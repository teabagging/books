I was flipping through the September issue of Marie Claire magazine, and to my amazement I find that Paris is coming out with her own fragrance called \\"Just Me\\"::snorts:: No thanks Paris, I think I'll pass (gas)Look, I get that Paris is rich and all, and I don't hate her for that, not at all. But what I do hate is that she just doesn't seem to just simply GO AWAY. She's like one of those kids from high school that craves attention no matter what, and when no one seems to care about this kid anymore or has lost interest, they do something else so as to FORCE people to pay attention. Yup. That's Paris. What has she done to actually have a fragrance named after her? Honest to god I don't know. Let me guess what the fragrance's marketing tag will be....hmmm....\\"you too can feel sexy, powerful, and pampered just like Paris\\". Uhmmmm, Kimora Lee Simmons has said the same thing about her new Baby Phat Women's fragrance (don't EVEN get me started on her). I think I will just stick with my Hanae Mori fragrance.So what's the point of this latest ranting. You want Paris Hilton to disappear into the abyss? Ignore her. DON'T BUY THIS FRAGRANCE!!! Heck, when you're in Macy's, run, don't walk, past the perfume lady calling you to test out this sham-de-toilette.June 3, 2005: Well, if you haven't figured out why many people just can't stand this \\"celebutante\\" (what is this? Goes to show, most critics don't even think of Hilton as a bonafide celebrity), just look at what made the headlines here in NYC's Daily News newspaper. What made the cover headlines? Get this, 1/2 of the front cover was devoted to the debate of whether or not NYC should build an Olympic-sized stadium for 2012 Olympics. You see, that I can understand, seeing as how billions of taxpayers' dollars will be used for this. The other 1/2 of the cover? That was devoted to Paris Hilton. Well, when you actually saw the inside of the paper, her \\"breaking news\\" was just a picture of her diamond engagement ring in the \\"Entertainment\\" section. Bizarre isn't it??? So now, her freakin' ring gets more front-page coverage than the wholesale slaughter of 20 million+ Sudanese people, the war on terrorism and countless other critical stories. Shoot, even the news of her engagement made headlines. Why God, Why???? What has happened to the once esteemed American press? If I want all the dirt on Paris, I will read US Weekly, or the tabloids. This isn't journalism anymore....thank god for the BBC and NWI. End rant. My review is below.I flipped through this book, which was displayed so prominently at Barnes and Nobles,in record time. The writing is very simplistic, the tone is overly shallow, and there seems to be more pictures than words. This is a quick, 5th grade level \\"reading\\" book. Don't buy it, just borrow it from the local library or a friend. Seriously, spend your hard-earned money somewhere else.As for Ms. Hilton, it's a sad day in America that we, as a society, have allowed her to dominate the news media. Even her dog, the love-starved Tinkerbell, gets more media coverage than the genocide in Sudan. What have we come to???? Spending money on this ghost-written book just feeds more money into this gruesome monster known as the Paris Hilton media machine. Don't love or hate her. Just ignore her. If a news program is doing yet another story on her, change the channel. Don't buy newspapers that feature her on 98% of the front page, while they only give a thumb nail to the war in Iraq. Don't stay at any Hilton hotels, the Waldorf Astoria (her family owns that as well) and any other hotel that her family owns. Don't watch \\"The Simple Life\\"! And for the love of humanity, don't fall into the trap that her sister Nicky is any different and she's the \\"shrinking violet\\" b/c, baby, she's just as shallow as her sister, except she's a brunette.As for the book, what can I say that hasn't already been said by the majority of reviwers? Paris comes off, or should I say her ghost-writer, as extremely materialistic, shallow and vain (What a shock!)As a heiress to a multi-billion dollar empire, I can expect this is due to her upbringing but alas, you can't necessarily blame the parents for everything, can you? I can blame American society for allowing her to be elevated to the status of an \\"icon\\". Maybe Paris Hilton reflects, on a bigger scale, what our society has become. But like I said, just ignore her and she will eventually go away. It will work but enough people need to do this. The media will finally get the message."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"this book sucked as expeceted, i just needed it to help me with a prject Im working on"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I picked up this book, mainly because I seen it picked at, and made fun of, over and over again on VH1. I regret that day. I have not seen a book with so many pictures, and so few words since I was in primary school.

And Paris, as an author myself (therefore an expert in writing) try not to confuse \\"fiction\\" with \\"non-fiction.\\" Overall the book lacks substance and would be ideal for someone that can read at a fourth grade level.RCM II/BBauthor"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I knew better than to buy this book, but curiosity has gotten the best of people greater than myself, and when I was at a bookstore recently I had to thumb through it.It's much like what you would expect; a half-baked \\"inspirational\\" message that you should \\"always be your own heiress, be true to yourself, etc,\\" but mostly the book went on and on about her favorite beauty products, activities, and so on.If you're curious, head to a local bookstore and look through out. It won't take long to satiate your curiosity and convince you that your money can be better spent elsewhere."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I'm not a certified book critic, but I would never encourage anyone to waste $22.00 of their hard-earned money on this pile. Paris probably hired some underling ghost-writer to jot down her \\"ideas\\" and \\"thoughts\\" and paste them together in a hardcover. She was trying to get the readers to see her as someone that she's obviously not (respectful, humble, intelligent, real), and contradicts each statement with her \\"tips\\" and \\"how-to's\\" (behave like an utter snob, act ridiculously arrogant and you'll gain the admiration you've so longed for from society). She also uses an entire chapter to name-drop her celebrity friends' list.She's glamorous, stylish and has the cash to get her by, but otherwise, there is nothing to the book but and endless abyss of shallow thinking."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"It's not even remotely interesting. It took me about 10 min. to read half of it in the book store. I didn't even want to bother reading the rest of it, much less buy it.The other reviewer was right, It's written on a second grade level."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Don't buy this book.If you do, you are just feeding into her wallet and her ego. Save your money for something usefull, like toilet paper."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"This book was a complete disappointment. I was expecting \\"confessions\\" and there was not a single mention of the sex-tape scandal. This book was written on a 2nd grade level and took about 30 minutes to read. In the book, Paris constantly talks about \\"being yourself\\", \\"don't listen to anyone's advice\\" but the entire book is a step by step on how to be Paris Hilton. She tells you what you should do and exactly how you should do it, only because she does it that way. The most insulting line of the book is when she says \\"Only have billionaire friends\\" How shallow can a person be!? I guess if you were 9 years old and had millions of dollars at your disposal and wanted to be a Paris Hilton clone, then you might find this book useful. If not, don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Once upon a time, Paris was a cute brown-eyed girl with dark blonde hair. Then, she got minor rhinoplasty, bleached her hair to the point of falling out, tanned her skin until it looked plastic, purchased blue contacts, and hit the big time. Yawn.Touting this book as \\"tounge-in-cheek\\" is supposed to give Paris a Get Out of Jail Free Card; i.e. \\"You can't really criticize this book, because it's meant to be funny\\". But, it's not funny, and can really only be touted as part of the \\"I'm milking my 15 minutes\\" parade. If you want to know all the things an heiress would or wouldn't do, Paris will give you the skinny (I must have missed the chapter on how an heiress should make at least one amateur porn video!). But this is fluff reading at best and trashy self-promotion at worst. If sister Nicky had written this, perhaps we could take it more seriously. Quotes such as \\"People say they envy my lifestyle, but I'm convinced that anyone with a little imagination can live 'The Life.'\\" Yeah, that and a Daddy who internationally owns one of the most expensive and popular hotel chains. I suppose that helps you attain 'The Life'; and you don't even have to work hard for it!Between parading herself around as a \\"celebrity\\" (and a skanky one at that) and trying to convince America that she alone has coined the phrase \\"That's hot!\\" (as if no one else before her has said it), I just can't take this girl seriously. Bottom line: \\"Confessions\\" reads like one big Paris yearbook...except with less words. If you're really into this 'Girl of the Moment', then read this. But don't expect hilarity- it's Paris's way of saying, \\"Don't you wish you were me?\\" under the guise of humor. Ugh."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"It is amazing to me, the amount of passion that goes into people loving or hating Paris Hilton. I never knew a whole lot about her, as I am not much interested in celebrities, but I can say I find it much easier to be turned off by her than to be mesmerized by her.What is so great about her? Have we become such a materialistic society that we worship a girl who just happens to be born into a wealthy family? That nothing else matters except that she is rich? Just by birth?Sure, she is pretty, but I imagine with enough money spent on fake tans and blue contacts, hair extensions and overly sexy clothes, anybody can look good. And when you have all the money you could ever want to buy those things, and all the time in the world to groom yourself (because you do not have to work) well, any of us could be glamorous, right?So people who worship this girl do so because she is rich and glamorous. And that is about as shallow as Paris herself. This girl has had such an abnormal upbringing that she has no idea what real work is like, never thinks of others' feelings, and looks down at anyone less affluent than she (as seen by her behavior on the Simple Life shows). And this is someone whom we should all look up to?!?The real interesting thing about Paris though, to me, is psychological. I saw her on Letterman the other night, and she appeared to be much younger than her real age. She seems very immature, probably from gliding through life without many struggles, (struggling being the kind of thing that makes you grow as a person). We all wish we could have it as easy as Paris, but do we really? The things we struggle with cause us to learn and poor, spoiled Paris has never had that.Also, she is so self-absorbed and narcissistic that I just could not believe her! I was amazed at the things written in this book, but hearing her actually speak in that manner downright shocked me. How can anyone be that in love with themselves? This isn't self-confidence, either. I honestly believe she has Narcissistic Personality Disorder (I am not kidding) so rather than hate her, she should be pitied.I have seen photos of her, in her partying atmosphere, wearing scanty clothing with no underwear and then bending over to give the world a peek. Who in the world, other than a professional stripper maybe, would be driven to do that? Do you need attention that badly? Correct me if I am wrong, but that is abnormal behavior.All of you folks who have blind admiration for Paris should think hard about what a true 'hero' would be. Someone who is out to help the world be a better place, to fight corruption, crime, poverty, disease, injustice....I could go on and on. With her resources, I certainly know that I could do a LOT to help good causes and to change things for the better. But Paris does not give a second thought to anyone but herself, which, to me, is disgusting, whether she has resources or not. No matter how little you have in life, you are always able to help others. And she has been filmed calling people by racial epithets. Again, is this someone whom we should idolize? She is short on brains, definitely, but also on compassion for others.All of the people who passionately hate this girl should just ignore her, as she gets a bigger ego with any attention she gets, good or bad.It just scares me that someone so....useless....can be idolized so easily and so much. Do not hate her, sympathize for her instead, because she really is not a very nice person, and spend your time helping others, because she certainly won't."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"She's cute, no denying it. She's rich, hubba hubba. She's self-absorbed, yuck. She's a writer? Nope.In an effort to totally go against what the highest-rated reviewers on this site always do - write four and five-star reviews about everything they read and therefore, get glowing helpful votes - I went out and got a book that I knew deserved one star. Just so I could BASH IT!It didn't work out that way. It's not a lousy piece though, it's just no a good one. If you've ever seen her \\"tv series,\\" you know that Paris Hilton has a certain type of charm in her speech and personality. It's fun to laugh at her stupidity and cringe at her lack of respect for people less affluent than she. But she is charming and a great deal of how she writes is how she speaks. The book is as charming as she is and that's why people fall for everything she does.it's just what you'd expect from someone like her so don't get mad when you read it and find it to be fluff, bland, put-upon, air-headed and silly. you should have known that when you bought it. with that in mind, there is no way i can pan this book. it sucks. but i expected a heck of a lot worse. because i got more than what i expected, two stars."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"In case you - like me - believe in giving people the benefit of the doubt, and thus might be tempted to see if there actually is another, unseen Paris Hilton, as she purports to do in \\"Confessions of a Heiress,\\" let me save you some time.The only thing hidden behind Paris' glossy surface, is more surface.I was, however, pleased by the neat corrollation between the uselessness of the book (too large, pink and expensive to fit on most book buyers shelves or in their budgets; not big enough to be used as a doorstop or protective weapon) and the uselessness of Paris Hilton herself (basically also too large, pink and expensive - not to mention parasitical).In one of the many comic moments throughout, Paris notes that she thinks it is the worst sin in the world to be boring. Please note the headline of this article.Basically, never was a girl less like her namesake. And never was a single facial expression so devoutly used in press pictures."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I find it hilarious that people writing 5 star reviews here try to convince us that this 5th grade literature they just read isn't supposed to be taken seriously. As though Paris in her \\"genius\\" wit wrote it this way on purpose. To be fair, I am convinced she tried really hard. But let's be honest with ourselves, a billionaire heiress that only needs to focus on \\"being more important than her clothes\\" need not be educated. This book is funny, and I recommend giving it a quick read. However, I find it sad that this girl is so blindly followed. She is an heiress, not a goddess."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"As a professional career woman, wife, mother (and previously Paris Hilton fan), I was disappointed in this book in that it is written in a very 'child-like' fashion (or perhaps at age 30, I'm just too old for this kind of read?). Though I'm sure there are other 'early-twenties' out there, with good education and without the help of writers, that could do a much better job. Paris doesn't mention what kind of education she has and I think it shows through this book. I love fashion, I love entertainment, I love Hollywood, but I love intelligence and wit too."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I read this book solely out of the curiousity of \\"what would it be like to be filthy rich and totally beautiful with all the time in the world?\\" What I got was perhaps exactly what I could have read for $2.50 in the tabloids. What can I say? If you really want to read Paris Hilton's \\"memoir\\" spare yourself the $15.00 and flip threw the teen magazines at the grocery store - it'll be better for you and are actually written better!I gave this book three stars because, while it is incredibly obvious that Hilton did not write this book on her own, she does display some honest and optomistic view on her life. Besides the more \\"conceited\\" phases that Hilton constantly repeats over and over (\\"People respect me because I think I am worthy of it. I do this by constantly pretending I have a tiara on my head.\\"), for a more \\"autobiographical\\" view on her life from a true bimbo, read this. And with raving reviews from Carmen Electra (whom is actually somebody I like, no sarcasm intended), who wouldn't want to read this book? Paris is constantly contradicting herself over and over again. The first sentence says, \\"People seem to have the wrong idea about me...\\"Just take a look at the front cover.

Her celebrity is strictly circumstantial-a sex tape left in the worng place at the right time. I guess she benefited from that exposure, since she netted a deal for this piece of garbage.

Too bad I couldn't rate it with 0 stars. Wouldn't that make much more common sense for a book of such shallowness and superficiality? I believe so. I suppose you might say it taught me of all the things I don't want to do in my lifetime. For of all instances, be known for partying, misplacing inappropriate personal video tapes, and using my last name as a way to manufacture myself into the world of fame, when as in Paris's case, she never had to accomplish anything at all. There are people with real talent that strive to get recognized, yet the world has gone mentally petty to be fascinated with a person of such nature. Honestly, she is in no way generous, kind, or understanding of others and has no possible knowledge to define what the \\"reality\\" of life really is today.I do not hate her, yet, I think she could present herself in more positive ways than she has. Doing more postive things may get her recognized for actually accomplishig something worthwhile. She seems to act much more fake than real, and I think it's a bad impact on people. Though, u can't blame her for the way she was raised, it should be common sense to know what is right. This book was ok, yet, there are several thousands of aspiring writer out there that work years on things and never have them published. I suppose Paris represents the fact anything is possible, eh? So, I will not say I hate her. She just is someone that reminds me day after day I am fine the way I am because I know I will never develop a personality like hers.Paris is a very beautiful girl, that is unique in many ways. Yet, I think she needs to sit down and realize that. Perhaps think of how to present herself in an acceptable way. I'm sure her family would have wanted that for her. Wouldn't you want to try to be normal, despite the fact u were rich? I mean, honestly? Anyway, I think we all are in no means to judge her, because we do not know her personally and I think we all realize the fact she does have many flaws in the personality department! (...)I leave u with a quote Nicky Hilton said about the media and people that criticize Paris:\\"When people write these mean things about you, you think how sad it is that their job is to sit at the computer and write mean things about someone they don't even know. But the thing about Paris is that she really doesn't give a (...).\\""},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Paris Hilton is famous for being wealthy.

More likely she was interviewed about everything she liked and some of her thoughts and some unknown writer did it. However, unlike most people, I don't hate her. I mean, what do you expect? She was born a rich heiress, had good looks, and that pretty much got her through in life. We are all what we are raised to be, and there is no telling what any of you people who criticize her would have become if you grew up like her. I do, however, think that she is the worst possible role model a girl could have. There is more to life than fashion and materials. I am a guy, but if honestly asked, I would love to live a life like hers, and anyone who says they wouldn't are lying. She probably won't end up being much of a contribution to the world, but ask yourself; is that her fault or the people who raised her?Anyways, the book is DEFINITELY not recommended 0/100"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Paris is such a filty street rat, she thinks that she is so cute saying things in a nasal annoying voice and being so arrogant, she is a sl*t, and its true, she is a freak, she actually has ADD, but thats no excuse for her extremely distasteful existence.

Yay for Paris!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Confessions of an Heiress is a fantabulous read! It is hilarious and not to be taken seriously! Also, for those few hateful reviews entered in by people who NEVER READ THE BOOK, should be ignored completley! First of all, the book CAN be used by poor, middle, and upper class because the book gives you CONFIDENCE advice which has nothing to do with money. Paris is a positive ray of sunshine which we could all utilize for a little get-up-and-go in this cold dark world. Like Paris says, you should act as if you have a tiara on your head at all times of the day, its a confidence thang hun, live it up!This book is especially nice for a creamy bubblebath browse, or a quick airborne commute. Im sure all young and young at heart gals will enjoy this witty read!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Paris Hilton's book is really a tribute to herself, her youth, and her physical and charismatic beauty. A hardback book with hundreds of color photos, it's like a glossy and glamorous magazine!FRIENDLY WARNING: If you are an envious or judgemental type of person (c'mon, admit it if you secretly are!), then you will NOT enjoy this book!'Live and let live', I say!Read this book with an open mind and a great sense of humor, and you will LOOOVE it! :)I was enthralled by Paris' innocent and straight-from-the-heart statements, and amazed by her occasional naivete. After all, she is climbing towards her late twenties now, and you have to wonder, \\"Is she for real?\\" Can anybody have such a 'pure' view of the world?By the way, keep in mind that the \\"One Night in Paris\\" sex video was sold by her steady boyfriend of TWO years! This girl was a victim of betrayal.Ultimately, Paris genuinely is as happy-go-lucky and as innocent about the world as she seems. I agree with Carmen Electra's assessment in the inside front cover flap- that Paris is, in fact, \\"a real girl's girl\\".I have chatted to and partied with Paris in LA several times, and agree that Paris is very friendly and approachable. All in all, she's a very sweet person who simply loves to flaunt what she's got! :)"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Just like Paris Hilton's life, this book is an embarrasement and a sad reminder of America's obbsesion with $$ and celebrity. Someone who is born with such resources should take that and put it to good use, help the needy, get funding, feed the hungry. Look at Angelina Jolie...spends 1/3 of her income on charity. And newsflash to everyone \\"loving\\" the book. Not everyone wants her kind of life. What's worse, all you Paris fans don't even realize that this girl's sticking it to you...by making you buy this book."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"This book is really gr8. I bought it when I saw Paris reading it to someone in simple life 3.When I see a famous and gr8 person like Paris, I don't get jealous and spread romours about her, I just be happy 4 her unlike somepeople I know!I just dont understand!Anyway, this book really got into me, where ever I go I take it with me and get back to some points."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I lurve this book and because of it,i now see Paris Hilton in a different light and i think i do idolise her now.I used to think that Hilton is just some dumb blonde who has a powerful surname with plenty of money to throw about.Then came the infamous sex video.I thought that kinda put me off.I mean,thats real trash we're talking about.But the very first page of the book had this one liner which she wrote, \\"what you see in the newspapers is never true\\". and i thought,yeah.It's probably time to see her in a different light.Give the girl a chance.She may be out there partying,cuddling guys or publishing you-know-it videos or busy gyrating in her Stars Are Blind MTV,but really,after reading this self-autobigraphy which is full of and filled with tons of pictures of her,you get to see her as Paris the professional model,Paris the girl next door,Paris as the family girl,Paris as the wannabe actress,Paris who wants to meets her Prince.The pictures are nice and showcases her as a fashionista.She wears lovely outfits and had pretty cool haristyles,but not all pics are great.There's one of her without makeup and trust me,she looks real bad.Guess she's human after all.Another one shows her with her sister Nicky and she was actually displaying her Adam's apple.But other than these goofs,its really nice reading and ogling and seeing.You'll go 'wow,how i wished i'd clothes like her'.Because the clothes are just superb.Of course,she does dispensed certain tips and suggestions and advices on being a heriress.Some of which are utter bosh,cos you and i can't live off a lifestyle like hers,unless you try marrying Nicky or their brothers Barron and Conrad.Like this one that goes : 'I like wearing tiaras.It makesyou like a princess.', 'When you go travelling,pack three times more than you need.And when you arrived,buy everything new.\\" And then this one, 'Pink is my favourite colour.\\" I mean,how are we supposed to wear a dainty tiara on our heads all the time,pack trice more than we ever need on a holiday trip,and then buy everything NEW? or wear pink all the time? Pink's a nice colour,girly and happy and bright,but seriously Paris,Black is not depressed,its GOTHIC.Okay.Here's the book.I admit i still find her an airhead cos she acts dumb and ignorant and awful especially with her dog Tinkerbell.But she's indeed an animal lover.BUY THE BOOK AND READ IT,ESPECIALLY PARIS WANNABES!!!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I am a proud owner of this book and it's worth every $.Living in New York it's not uncommon to see the celebrities up close and express little excitement about it.

Gish \\"Dr. Gish\\" (Beverly Hills, California) - See all my reviewsTo allow oneself to even be in the spotlight is a frightening yet courageous thing to do. While many sit in the safety and comfort of their own home living their lives \\"small\\". You have chosen to get out there and live your life \\"big\\". Regardless of the family you come from. This opens you up to everything - the good, the bad and the terrible. All which you have already experienced. Your life has become public. I don't know if the day will come when you will be able to run into the local Starbucks to get a coffee, not have people stare at you and whisper - and be left alone. As long as we're going to be here and have a life - you may as well live it and large!It took guts for you and Nicole Ritchie to even do \\"The Simple Life\\" - and while some of America may have been laughing at you most of us were laughing with you. A tv show, a music career, a book and Guess campaign. Congratulations to you! At the age of 90 I am quite sure you will not look back with regret for not having \\"tried\\" something - nor for having lived a \\"small\\" life.All the nonsense about \\"what you look like\\" is just that - nonsense. We are all perfect children of God who just come in diferent colors, sizes, shapes and forms. For anyone to focus on just what someone looks like whether it be a compliment or an insult just lets us all know where \\"these people\\" have gotten stuck - I salute you for being a very brave woman. For getting back on the horse after your fall - literally - dare any of us forget how Mr. Christopehr Reeve had his accident in the first place? God Bless him! For continuing to follow your dreams no matter who says what and for those who are envious of you - bless them and just move on. You have your whole life ahead of you and I have a feeling you're going to do a lot more with it than you already have. This book is forthright and the best part of all was your complete honesty when asked how long it took you to write. I believe you said a month. Why? Because I'm quite sure the publishers had people to help you since it is your first book and they wanted to get it out as soon as possible - because that is what book publishers do.If it is true that we choose the family we are born into then you are a leader from way back. The really good news is that you have only just begun. Accept your role as a voice and a leader amongst the younger generation today! Hold your head high and smile as you politely step around anyone who is not a loving and positive influence in your life. Being a true leader you will find your passions - you have mountains upon mountains to move in your lifetime and I believe that you can do it. Think even biggger! And again congragulations on your first book. Well done! I am sorry I placed this review in the wrong place under the book that was written about you. It belongs right here."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"In the world there has to be someone you envy and why not have that person be perfect? Paris Hilton is very perfect in how we see her life. She's rich, beautiful, has a modeling career, jewelry line, etc. She is a partay girl that just enjoys life with everything at ehr fingertips. If she one day decided to become an astronaut, she'd have the power just with a snap of her fingers. She is perfect, at least in that sense. Some people think her qualities aren't perfect, but everyone judges everyone don't they? Paris wrote a book, or maybe she even just 'helped' write it, but either way she is doing more than just shopping and partying. Maybe writing a book was a dream of hers, and if it was, then she just made a dream come true. So all you Hilton-haters just realize that maybe because your life isn't perfect and you're just jealous of someone's whose is, just think of her as another human being and you won't have to be so judemental and cruel. Would yo ulike someone judging all your flaws and complaining?"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"i think paris hilton did a WONDERFUL job on this book. for all you idiots out there that are complaining about her and this and that and she doesnt need anymore money, get over it. at least shes doing SOMETHING,i dont see you people writing books! if you dont like her or her books then simply dont read them. its so annoying to read comment after comment of how \\"stupid\\" and airheaded she is. i think she is a great girl with good intentions. and yeah she has a sex tape, everyone does things they regret, its just more publicized because she is famous."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":".... i did!almost as much as i love paris!i cnat believe Amazon actually let all u kids type what u did about her!y must u b so jealous?Is it because you have such a rubbish life yrself?anyway! if u r a fan i PROMISE! u will LOVE this book!ciao Bit*hes!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"This book is cute! She was one of the lucky ones who was blessed to be born into parents with money. You all wish you were and that's why you hate her! Everyone who hates Paris wishes they could have the same life. She is just lucky! Just because she's in the limelight doesn't mean there aren't hundreds of other girls just like her-you just hear about her.

I hesitate to call it a book, or even an autobiography - instead it's better to look at it at as a portfolio. Filled to the brim with images of Paris and her famous friends and family, with short, funny chapters inbetween that deal with the main areas of her life i.e. fashion, beauty, boyfriends etc.I think Hilton's saving grace is that she does not take herself too seriously, and her writing shows this. She gently mocks herself and the whole notion of being an heiress, and in doing so makes the book accesible to us mere mortals. I was especially impressed with her jokey 'diet' advice, which basically tell you to eat whatever you want, when you want, and to indulge in cheesburgers and candies on a daily basis. It shows Hilton to be very young at heart and it's refreshing to hear of somebody who tries to enjoy each minute of life to the best they can.If you like Paris and the whole young-Hollywood scene that's happening at the moment, then you're sure to enjoy this book. Take it this way, if you can't stand to watch MTV or flick through a copy of People magazine then steer clear - this book isn't for you.A cheeky look at a glamourous world, that doesn't reveal anything too specific but is still a great read."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Confessions of an Heiress is a thought provoking bible for those seeking to emulate the style of a fashionable socialite. In this book, the lovely Paris reveals some secrets, which may or may not be completely true.This sensible guide is entertaining, and filled with useful tips from a true capitalist - like how to party late \\"in style\\" by drinking Vitamin Water or energy drinks (rather than alcohol). :-)"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"If people hate Paris Hilton then of course they shouldn't have bought this book because it's all about her! But if you are a Paris fan then you will enjoy it. I wouldn't recommend paying full price for it (not worth $22!) but I got it for a fraction of the price and I'm happy I did. The book is obviously tongue-in-cheek so if you're looking for something indepth or a how-to, keep it moving. I think the main point of this book is having confidence and enjoying being a girl, whats wrong with that?"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I didn't care to much about the writing, but I really enjoyed the beautiful pictures. I always loved looking at the clothes that she wears"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"You gotta love Paris Hilton's ability to laugh at herself and to have fun with her own lifestly. Who couldn't laugh at the idea of \\"finding your own inner heiress\\"? Anyone who takes this book too seriously won't like it, but if you just look at it with a sense of humor and with how good-humored Hilton is, you have to have a good time with it. Okay, it's a little ridiculous that someone thinks it's a good use of time and money to have birthday parties in L.A., NY, London and Tokyo all on the same day, but, you know, you have to think she knows it's slightly wrong, too. Plus, she's still young. Hopefully she'll mature and find more productive things to do with her life and money when she's older. Meantime, just check this book out of the library (no need to own it) and have a little fun with it."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"This book is amazing! It truely gives you an insight to the real Paris Hilton!!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I'm a big Paris Hilton fan and I really liked this book. It's fun and easy to read. One warning though, if you're not a Paris Hilton fan, you probably won't like it. It's not some sort of expose or anything, but rather just a look at her life. If you're entertained by Paris, then this is a good book for you."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I really thought the pictures were telling of the lifestyle she leads. I enjoyed her candid reviews of different places, products, and clothes which gave me a peek behind the pose as she termed it. Very honest, open and forthright--what can I say--I'm in love with Paris Hilton! I suggest this book to females who want to go into fashion. Very good and coupled with her CD, very good representation of this very talented young lady. Thanks for letting me share!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Funny, full of cool pics, and I really liked the doggie diary idea! I totally think Tink's Diary should be Paris' next project =)"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Like Paris writes: Don't take anything in this book seriously.I laughed throughout this book.

In the divided world that we live in now, where it seems that most people are more concerned in maintaining their \\"images\\" rather than seeking out the truth in matters and trying to have actual conversations with different folks, I'm for anyone who is true to their nature, even if I don't agree with all that they are saying. (Where were these women who call themselves \\"feminists\\" when an innocent women was being degraded to nothing more than a piece of property owned by her husband - I'm talking about Terri Schiavo here, but I digress... )I cannot have fault with someone who is still very young and has until now, only known one side of life. I'm sure when she gets older, her opinions will change.... as mine did.So, why not explore the world that we live in? Why not try new things? Why not be your very own diva? Why not be all that you can be? Why not celebrate life? Yes, indeed, why not? Even if it means taking a risk in facing rough times, as Paris says, you only truly grow during tough times, and we all face tough times at some point along the way."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I thought this book would trully turn me off from Paris Hilton, but I found it was cute and fun.

Honestly, for example it stated that heiresses always eat fast food. That can't be possible, because Paris Hilton herself will not be what she is today if it were true. Another comment, is that the author doesn't have to brag about how perfect her life is. She tells about how shes a model, and everything. We get the idea!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I initially picked up this book just for kicks to see what kind of insightful advice Paris could give to me about how to live my life. I was disappointed to read that it was all just a guide on how to be an heiress which is basically pointless unless you're born into money. Who has the money to be able to afford multiple cell phones (let alone the hottest and latest model)? Paris has proven my theory on how shallow she is by mentioning that an heiress' boyfriend should always be hot afterall \\"have you ever seen me without a good looking boyfriend\\"?I feel sorry for girls who idolize this girl and follow this book to the T. Those are definitely people I need to avoid."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"When I heard Paris Hilton was writing a book, I thought \\"A book?

She's beautiful, she's rich, and she has a right to. Good for her. Paris has an obvious zest for life, and knows how to live it up. Let her.This isn't a book book, in that you're not going to find out any deep, meaningful information aside from \\"Don't drink Diet Coke that's for fat people\\".

It was fun to read and find out about her life, who she is, and who she wants to be. She tells me about behind the scenes of my favorite show, Simple Life, how she really did the stunts, how she felt about it, and whether she liked it or not. It is truly an awesome book!

She's pretty and rich, thanks to an inheritance gained from the Hilton Hotels chain. She's gaining all her opportunities because of the Hilton name. Has she ever worked at Hilton? Has she ever attended a board meeting? No, this is more about how she is busy making adult films, parading around in nightclubs and calling herself a celebrity. She needs to get onto \\"The Apprentice\\" and see how her Hilton empire was built. I would have more respect for her if she knew something about her family business, but no, this is all about her partying.

The Italian Duo-Tone leather (imitation) looks and feels great. It's slightly smaller in width in comparison to other compact Bibles (namely by Thomas Nelson...I have two). Not a big deal since the print is the same, if not clearer than the Nelson editions.I appreciate the center-column reference system. It has a good volume of explanatory word references to assist with your reading. The reference also uses the actual verse number (ie. 1:25 in bold print) instead of just using a simple letter like other Bibles.It does offer study helps: About the Bible, Prayers of the Bible (from the OT thru Paul's letters), Prophecies Fulfilled in Christ, Parables of Jesus, Miracles of Jesus, Teachings of Jesus, Ministry of Jesus, and a Concordance.The only downfall for this Bible is the Concordance. I have compared the entries for this one with my Nelson editions, and this by far is the weakest. I am very disappointed with this feature.Also, this Bible does not have Book Introductions. I have seen descriptions elsewhere online stating this. The Book Introduction feature is for the larger Duo-Tone Leather edition by Zondervan. I'm not sure if this is considered 7.2 type font. It may be around 6 points.Inspite of the weak concordance, it's still a keeper."},{"Title":"Structural Dynamics","review":"The material is well structured and the book is written in a clear and concise manner that's why I give five stars to the author.

Suitable to a reader at perhaps the second or third undergraduate year, and who has had some calculus and linear algebra. A substantial portion of the text involves solving linear systems of equations, to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors. And for this, the maths background is essential.What distinguishes the book from many older texts is the intensive use of computers to solve equations. This permits the tackling of harder problems, that are amenable only to numerical solutions.Also, if you already use some other numerical package, like Maple or Mathematica, then you can ignore the binaries on the enclosed CD, and just recode."},{"Title":"Structural Dynamics","review":"This is an excellent book for beginners but doesn't have too much detail on the math part I believe.

I use this reference all the time with my shells.However, I was led to believe that this Book was an update of the Melton and Pawls Guide to the Civil War Artillery Projectiles (1996 Kennesaw Mountain Press 1st Edition 1996 ISBN #0963586114). I was wrong, it is the exact same book except for a new publisher. So if you already have the 1996 book then you already have this one.

The first photographic section features cutaway half-sections of 16 common projectile types. This is followed by two projectiles reconstructed from recovered fragments and two illustrations of canister. Each image contains a paragraph description.The next section is images of many types of fuze with descriptions of the major types. Following this is the major portion of the guide which consists of 2 to 3 glossy high resolution photographs of rounds per page, each with a paragraph description and a short list of particulars: diameter, gun, length, weight, construction type, sabot, and fuze. There are 142 projectiles illustrated in this section, and it is followed by seven non-combat/post war types.The only real negative is that this whets one's appetite for even more detail. Heavy ordnance is not included. Descriptive text, drawings and tables of internals for all the major shell, case, and canister would really fill out such a work.

You gather at the funeral of the town's great lady and conspire. You watch as the family of the deceased wait to divide the spoils and you pray that Dr. Jim Jaspers doesn't open his mouth about you. This novella and collection of short stories center on a tight knit community that revolves around the local theatre and university. Almost all may have something to hide. The death of a leading townsperson and the turmoil that ensues is perfect backdrop for the unwinding of Dr. Jasperson's mind. There is enough deceit and truth finding to go around. This is southern storytelling at its best"},{"Title":"The Cabal And Other Stories","review":"As a long-time devoted Ellen Gilchrist fan, I rushed out to purchase The Cabal as soon as it hit the shelves, and was not disappointed. The title novella introduces a new set of characters based in Jackson, Mississippi, all coping with the typical Gilchristian themes of love, sex, death, and, most importantly, life here on earth. The short stories that follow are equally entertaining, particularly the latest installment from Miss Crystal's maid Traceleen. This title is a must-have, both for those familiar to Gilchrist's work and for newcomers to her fiction."},{"Title":"The Cabal And Other Stories","review":"I had goose-bumps just reaching out to pluck the latest Gilchrist collection from the shelves! I relished each page, drinking in these new additions to the Southern family. THE CABAL was Ellen at her finest and the stories that followed pure delight. Even if this is your first Gilchrist experience you feel like a part of the family. You know these people. What a treat to find the latest installment in Crystal and Traceleen's lives at the very end. I could not have been more delighted with this latest colection and have sent it to every friend I know!"},{"Title":"The Cabal And Other Stories","review":"Ellen Gilchrist is back again with another book of familiar and delightful stories. Some regulars make another appearance here as well as some great new characters. Gilchrist weaves her enchanting spell again, drawing the reader into the lives of her characters.

If you are a fan of Ellen Gilchrist you will not be disappointed with this new entry into her world!"},{"Title":"The Cabal And Other Stories","review":"As a fan of Ms. Gilchrist's for a long time, I was delighted by her latest book.

Great work and would highly recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"The Cabal And Other Stories","review":"As one who has lived in the south for over 35 years, I found The Cabal to be very disappointing. The book promised to be about southern life. Instead I found a book that was full of spoiled, excluding people who I would avoid at all costs. In the title story, the self-absorption of the fully two-dimensional characters was really disappointing. They were only interested in reputation, sex, and money. There is so much more in life, and in my opinion it is a novelist's responsibilty to explore these other areas. The other stories, with the possible exception of The Big Cleanup, were no better. I was left feeling rather soiled by shallowness after reading this book. For a much more accurate and developed picture of southern life, I recommend Lee Smith. Leave this fluff behind."},{"Title":"The Cabal And Other Stories","review":"I am a big fan of Ellen Gilchrist, and by now have read almost every single one of her novels and short stories.

If this is what southern women (and God forbid, men) read for entertainment, they need to break out of their hoop skirts, put down those mint juleps and run at breakneck speed toward the north. How did she garner such amazing reviews is beyond me. Is this what passes for great writing these days?How Ellen Gilchrist can take a fairly interesting plot line and ruin it with boring drivel and meaningless conversations by two-dimensional and clich&eacute; characters is nothing short of amazing. Why wasn't this a novel instead of somewhat-connected short stories?What is the point of this collection in the end? To show how much she hates men and adores names like CeCe and DeDe? Her hatred of men (unless, of course, they are over-the-top handsome and spineless or gay) is barely concealed. Apparently she's been burned good by Hollywood producers as well... what was all that stuff about the tiny penis in \\"The Sanquine Blood of Men\\" ? Enough, already! You've emasculated the poor devil in one paragraph, you can stop now, no need to go on and on.Don't waste your money on this one. Get something by Annie Proulx if you want great story lines with odd names. At least her men seem real and her women aren't self-absorbed, whiney sex-fiends. And while we're on the subject of sex, there are much classier terms for it. The F-word is not very genteel, Ellen."},{"Title":"The Cabal And Other Stories","review":"I liked this book (which I listened to on audiotape) a lot but agree with the reviewer who complained about the ending. Overall, the writing is wonderful, the characterizations sharp, the intermingling of many stories effective.

It is a shame that it isn't better known, but unfortunately Arnow-Simpson is thought of as a regional writer. This is a very deep book, but it also has some very funny parts. Her description of pre-consumerism country life is very detailed and insightful. She saw how the world was changing, and captured a piece of it that is now long gone.

Arnow captures Appalachian culture, idiom, landscape and character at a moment when the world was on the cusp of becoming much smaller. Her women are extraordinary, and their lives are the lives of real women. Her animals are stunningly well-written -- the hounds are some of the best-developed non-anthropomorphic animal characters in literature, and their place in the community is charmingly portrayed.I do not understand why this book is not more widely known, and why it was and is not universally read in both American literature and women's studies programs."},{"Title":"Hunter's Horn","review":"Another book I found at a used book sale, so that it had no dust cover and was an author I had never heard of before. But the book was old and that is why I bought it. What a discovery! I loved every word, every page of this book. I have read many unusual books but this one rates number 1 on my list. It had its humorous parts but also its deep psychological parts in the way human beings react and think.

She was a very good writer and it is lovely to find this less well known work of hers."},{"Title":"Hunter's Horn","review":"**Spoilers**This book is a complete novel from a time that we don't see anymore in fiction. The Great American Novels are dead, and I was glad I purchased this book. I liked the history of Kentucky in a transitional time period. At first I didn't give the book a chance, as it was so different. The language of the characters didn't appeal to me, but I picked the book up again, and read through it in two days. Since, I have read it three more times and will probably pick it up again. It is a great study of human nature in a unique and believable setting.With great american novels, you have a sense of wilderness, and living off the land. The land beating down a man when he tries to conquer it, then finally rising above his/her own tragedies to learn from it. This book had all of that, but in a more complex way. If you look at the \\"hunting\\" as just that, then you miss a man's struggle with alcoholism, poverty, and belief in a higher power or God.The book really was about Milly though, struggling with a Man that didn't do as much as he could for their own survival. You see her dealing with the children and the women in her little community. She did what she could for her children and feared for their lives throughout the novel.It was ahead of it's time, the author writing about things that stayed behind closed doors. Things like Child birth - in a graphic, unforgiving way, so much so it was banned and pulled from the book in the first printing. I was glad they added that part back into the book as it was one of my favorite chapters.The book ends bitterly for some of the characters, but you accept it because it fit in the over all picture of the book.This is a great book, a book that everyone should try and read."},{"Title":"Hunter's Horn","review":"This book by Harriet Arnow, is a portrayal of living in the Appalachian mountains.

There are a couple pieces in a little lower voice, like Feed the Birds, and some higher, such as Think Of Me. There's a lot in there for people like me with a limited 2-3 octave range. The songs offer excellent practice not only in vocal strength, but also emotion and performance.Piano arrangements: Not hard, but a little beyond your basic piano player. Some pieces are very easy, like Once Upon a Dream (typical waltz temp/arrangement), others are a little harder, like the fast notes in Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend. I really enjoy playing Part of Your World, Favorite Things, Beauty and the Beast, and Memory.Price: Not bad. There are 33 songs, I think, with complete piano arrangements and lyrics.

However, I agree with a review below me; there are many songs in here that are overdone, and this is definitely a popular book. I always see people with this same book at auditions I go on, and (in my experience) everyone tends to do the same songs: Wouldn't it Be Loverly, I Could Have Danced All Night, On My Own, and Unexpected Song, to name a few. However, there are a few gems that people don't do as often: The Simple Joys of Maidenhood, It's a Most Unusual Day, God Help the Outcasts, etc. Even those, however, can be done over and over. This is great for the young, amateur performer, it offers good, age-appropriate songs that can really be helpful. The songs are mostly all in the mezzo range, very few go above an F on the staff or below middle C, and for the most part fall between a middle C and a D on the staff. An alternative to this book (if it doesn't sound like something you'd like) would be one of the Singer's Musical Theatre Anthologies, also in the Hal Leonard collection. They have three different (and are coming out with a fourth) volumes for each voice type, soprano, mezzo/alto, mezzo/alto belter, tenor, baritone/bass (I'm not positive those are all of them). There are more songs in them (I think there's forty-something in the first soprano volume) and have more obscure songs, much better for using on auditions."},{"Title":"The Teen's Musical Theatre Collection: Young Women's Edition: 33 Songs from Stage and Film [with a Companion CD of Accompaniements]","review":"I am a voice teacher and I have used this book (and the young men's edition) extensively.

Organized around Edward Kreitman's \\"Priority Teaching\\", and drawn from his many years of Suzuki teaching experience, it provides in-depth explanations of how to teach (and learn!) effectively and with superior results. Kreitman's basic idea of \\"priority teaching\\" is that there are certain things a student needs in every piece of music, at every level of playing. He urges people to learn to think in terms of these priorities, rather than focusing on where they are in the curriculum. He sets out to explain his five priorities, spending chapter on each one, detailing what it is and giving tips on how to teach it.The book is geared toward violinists, and as such the technical parts of the book (such as the discussion of teaching vibrato) are also highly applicable to violists (slightly less so to cellists), but will not apply to instruments such as the piano, flute, etc. Other 'how to' tips, such as teaching children to learn music \\"by ear\\", will work for every music student. Even with these tips, the book is not primarily a 'how to' manual, and it also provides a concise, simple, and accurate explanation of Suzuki philosophy, with fitting anecdotes scattered throughout.The writing style is clear and readable, the layout and pictures are elegant, and the explanations are precise and easy to understand. Kreitman writes with enthusiasm and 'balance', and the content is sound and thorough. The book has been widely praised by Suzuki teachers and organizations. I am a Suzuki teacher and have recommended this book to students and their parents; the overwhelming reaction has always been very positive, especially from parents who do not already have a musical background."},{"Title":"Teaching from the balance point: A guide for Suzuki parents, teachers, and students","review":"I recommend this book for all of my violin students' parents as they start their study. There aren't very many \\"textbooks\\" for the violin, and the ones available (Galamian, Auer, etc.) are geared toward much more advanced levels. This is one of the only ones written for the parents of beginners. Many parents have little or no background with the violin, or even music lessons in general, but this book will encourage you that all the information you need (besides having a good teacher) is available. Great pictures, anecdotes, and both technical and psychological information makes it easy for parents to help their young children practice."},{"Title":"The speeches: with an English translation. In Catilinam I-IV--Pro Murena--Pro Sulla--Pro Flacco (The Loeb classical library, 324 (English and Latin Edition)","review":"These are probably Cicero's best speeches in which his oratory is full of passion in its appeal to save The Republic from the impending doom brought by Catiline's sinister plot to consume Rome in flames and slaughter the wealthy. His style in the Catilinam is very inflammatory and accusatory as he urges his fellow senators to issue a decree approving of his actions as Consul against Catiline and to ratify his plea to execute Cataline's co-conspirators. His pacing and choice of words make the reader feel that doom is near unless swift action is taken. A simply marvelous piece of oratory. The final speeches 'Pro Flacco', 'Pro Murena', and 'Pro Sulla', are his defense presentations in the trials of Flacco, Murena, and Sulla (Sulla's son that is.) Although not as moving as his speeches on Catiline, these criminal defense speeches are useful in understanding the origins and effects of Catiline's bizzare attempts as well as Rome's judicial system in the context of political elections. It was common for defeated candidates to seek prosecution of their successful opponents to frustrate their ability to obtain that office: almost all of these trials involved claims of bribery and corruption. Political trials were extremely common in The Late Republic and these are fine examples of them: the rhetoric is heated and many of the accusations speculative; all of this is colored by the free use of invective. These trials are also important in that they show Cicero to be a rather practical politician who has no qualms in defending staunch optimates to the likes of Sulla or working with other defense advocates whom he doesn't like such as Marcus Licinius Crassus. What is perhaps most touching is Cicero's pompous flair which makes him quite human: I saved The Republic! Me! Me! Me! Cicero's self-congratulatory remarks in his speeches and letters were often considered pompous even by Roman standards of oratory and behavior. Perhaps no one else was more dismissive of Cicero's arrogant airs than Brutus, the tyrannicide, who tought of them as too Greek for his taste.The Loeb library is unique in that its classical texts are printed in both the original Latin text and English side-by-side. The translations are quite good and were done by competent scholars of classics whose choice of language is accurate, clear, and modern. These hard bound volumes are small but their covers are durable: the paper is of good quality. These are some of Cicero's greatest public orations that will capture the reader into all of the intrigues and turmoils of The Late Roman Republic. The powerful words and events reflected in these works move the reader and make him/her wonder about all of the nuances of a free republic that ceased to exist over 2000 years ago. A good companion to this text would be Loeb's edition of Sallust's monograph on Catiline which both complements and deviates from some of the information presented in Cicero's speeches. I strongly recommend Loeb's editions as they are both in English and Latin side-by-side. Don't be dissuaded by the out-of-print notice on this site as there are other editions presently available by Loeb that just haven't been posted on Amazon yet."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"Set in Colonial America during the French and Indian War, historical novelist Kenneth Roberts' Northwest Passage is an epic work about the larger-than-life Major Rogers and the artist Langdon Towne who joins Rogers' Rangers.

However, the novel did not sit well with me: it's really two books in one. The first part deals with Robert Rogers' St. Francis raid- our fictional protagonist joins Roger's Rangers on the eve of their raid on St. Francis. This tale is briskly told, conveying the dangers and hardships of the mission, weaving historical figures into the narrative and accurately (as far as I can tell) portraying the details of the mission. In this first half (350 pages) of the novel, author Roberts deftly explores tensions between the British regulars and their Provincial counterparts; as well as portraying the ambivalent attitudes of both toward Native Americans. All in all, the first half of the novel is a brisk, rousing historical adventure. The book started to lose me in the second half, however. The life of our fictional protagonist, Langdon Towne, continues to revolve around that of his former Captain, Robert Rogers, as Rogers' life descends into a Dickensian drama. Rogers attempts to parlay his military prowess into fame, fortune, and a personal empire in Britain's newly acquired Western territories. Rogers is no match, however, for the politics and skullduggery of imperial management, as he deals with- and runs afoul of- people like Charles Townshend, Edmund Burke, Sir William Johnson, and Jeffrey Amherst. Constantly scorning authority, the alcoholic, womanizing Rogers winds up in debtor's prison in London before returning to America to raise another Ranger contingent to fight the upstart American rebels. This second part of the tale could have been told much more efficiently; it was hampered by a contrived, melodramatic romance and repetitive ruminations on the relationships between Indians and whites in the Western territories. I almost gave up on the second half of the book. If readers find themselves losing interest after the first 350 pages, I'd advise letting it go- enjoy the tale of the St. Francis raid, but you won't miss much by dropping the book after that."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"True, the language is archaic (published 1937) and the vocabulary at times daunting (we've dumbed down quite a bit since 1937).

The book is clean, the cover is new, not a mark on the book. Great."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"This tale, cast as a memoir by a fictional acquaintance of the historical Robert Rogers who gained fame in colonial America for creating and leading \\"Rogers' Rangers,\\" is lengthy but compellingly told, especially in its first part. As others have noted, the first section, which recounts how young Langdon Towne, an aspiring artist from New England, finds himself on the run from local authorities and thrust into the arms of the Rangers is fast paced, vivid and exciting narration. Towne and a companion soon end up enlisted in the Rangers on the eve of their departure for the Indian town of St. Francis where French-supported Indians who have been terrorizing the New England colonists are based. Under the spying eyes of French and Indian scouts in the latter years of the French and Indian War, Rogers' Rangers depart the British stronghold of Crown Point and, led by the indomitable Rogers, succeed in making the lengthy and difficult passage in secret to St. Francis where, in a surprise attack, they slaughter the Indians dwelling there. The return home to safety turns out to be the real challenge though as Major Rogers must herd and cozzen his failing and soon starving troops back to New England via a different path in order to avoid retaliation by the French and Indians of Canada.The long trek back nearly kills them all though many finally get through thanks only to the unyielding will and capacity for outthinking his opponents that Major Rogers reveals, thus gaining the hero worship of young Langdon Towne and others in their company. Toward the end of the journey back, nearly starved and dead, it is Rogers who manages the final leg to bring back help for what remain of his men and, in so doing, he earns the undying gratitude of the colonials and the British Army itself. But Rogers is a man who needs action and who dreams big and he has begun to think of something that only the boldest have dreamt of, finding the Northwest Passage through North America to the shores of Japan and China. Young Langdon returns to his hometown of Kittery, a coastal settlement northeast of Massachussetts, to take up his old life which he finds no easy task, under the circumstances. Still, despite the respect he has now earned from his neighbors, he eventually decides to pursue his artistic inclinations and, disappointed in love, finally takes ship for England. The second part of the tale is rich in the London of the period as young Towne works to earn his living as a painter so that he can one day return to America to paint Indians. But Rogers shows up in London, too, and before long they have resumed their former close relationship with Towne hero worshipping the great man. Rogers is working to get support from the English aristocratic class and, especially, from the king himself, for the expedition to discover the Northwest Passage and promises to take Langdon Towne with him when he goes.Meanwhile, Towne is enlisted in a task laid on him by Rogers' personal secretary, one Natty Potter, to find the lost daughter of the secretary's disparate youth. In a complex series of events, Rogers seems to get what he is after, all the while drinking heavily and carousing with the London upper crust, while Langdon, through Rogers' good offices, achieves some respectability as an artist himself. Returning to the Americas, his relationship with Rogers restored, Langdon Towne affiliates himself with the larger than life adventurer once more and soon finds himself in Michilimakinac, at the juncture of the Great Lakes where Rogers means to establish himself and branch out from there to discover the elusive Northwest Passage. But things don't go as smoothly as the relatively simple operation that destroyed St. Francis had and Rogers soon finds himself embroiled in a political battle with the influential Sir William Johnson, His Majesty's Indian Agent (and friend of the Iroquois Confederation), who aims to retain a monopoly on the Indian trade at all costs. Rogers' plans get in the way of Johnson's objectives and the two are set on a collision course.There is as rich a detailing of wilderness life in this part of the book as in the first half though we never see the Indians themselves in any great depth. But the narrative threads are less taut as the tale shifts from one of adventure against deadly adversity to the complex interactions of numerous personalities against the backdrop of the Johnson-Rogers feud over Indian control. In the end the forceful and energetic Rogers is undone by the subtler and more cunning Johnson (aided and abetted by the shortsightedness of Rogers' own supporters in London who tie his hands rather than fund his plans, to which they have supposedly signed on) and all of the major's dreams come crashing down upon him. A lately discovered betrayal by the major of his young protege's personal interests turns Langdon Towne against Rogers too, as he soon sets out to rescue his damsel-in-distress, spirited away from him to Montreal.The rest of the novel brings Towne at last back to London and his lady love -- and, surprisingly, Rogers, too, though the latter is no longer in the condition or state in which he had once been wont to appear. Eliciting Towne's sympathetic assistance in a Debtor's Prison in London, Rogers wins back at least a modicum of his old friend's loyalty, albeit without the same level of respect, and the two part again, Towne to become the artist he had dreamed of being and Rogers to move onto other ventures and unachievable dreams. With the onset of the Revolutionary War, Rogers returns yet again, though now on the wrong side as far as the colonists are concerned for he is still serving the British. But the man, whatever his skills on the battlefield in guerrilla war has become but a shadow of his former self and so the story fades with the fading of Major Robert Rogers himself.Kenneth Roberts has penned a worthy novel which strikes true to the historical record and populates his pages with vividly drawn characters, not least of whom is the larger than life Robert Rogers. That the historical Rogers ended up on the wrong side in the Revolutionary War goes a long way toward explaining why his name and fame largely faded from America's historical record.Stuart W.

Surely if other K Roberts books are in print this one should be! This was one of my favorite novels in high school - I have read it several times since and enjoyed it as much each time!"},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"Kenneth Roberts was one of America's finest writers of historical fiction- mainly because he actually really knew the history into which he placed his fictional characters.\\"Northwest Passage\\" is arguably his most popular work, and its Book I was made into a pretty good 1940 movie with Robert Young as the fictional Langdon Towne and Spencer Tracy as the legendary Robert Rogers. (I must admit that everytime I read Rogers' dialogue in \\"Northwest Passage\\" I hear the voice of Spencer Tracy.) Anyway \\"Northwest Passage,\\" the novel, is actually made up of two very different books.Book I is one of the finest pieces of historical fiction that I have ever read. It's the story of Rogers' Rangers attack on the Abenaki Indian village of St. Francis during the French and Indian War. The story revolves around a fictional character, Langdon Towne, an upper middle class lad who wants to become a great artist by painting \\"true life\\" subjects such as Indians. Fleeing a dispute with local crooked politicians, Towne joins Major Rogers and his Rangers on the eve of their departure for St. Francis. What happens next is a thrilling story. Roberts' descriptions of the northern New England terrain, the agony of fatigue and starvation, and the gruesome depiction of the barbaric nature of war are stunning to read. Also amazing is the depiction of Major Rogers as seen through the worshipful eyes of Towne. The reader will finish Book I with a heroic image of Rogers as an indefatigable, courageous, clever tactician and born leader.Book II, though, is a disappointment. Of course, it is very understandable that Book II is a let down, since Book I can hardly be topped as a historical adventure. Roberts' spends most of Book II tearing down the heroic image of Rogers that he built-up in Book I. Alcohol, debt, political enemies, a bad marriage, and his own vices reduce Rogers to a rather pathetic character. Book II also suffers from a lack of focus- we follow Towne as he develops into a famous painter from New England, to England, to the Upper Great Lakes, to Canada, back to England, and then to New England. Unlike Book I, which dealt with just a few short months of time, Book II is all over the place. However, the biggest problem with Book II is that nothing really happens in it- just Rogers' long decline and Towne's search for fulfillment.Finally, Kenneth Roberts' books usually contain some extremely well developed and strong female characters, but \\"Northwest Passage\\" is lacking in this department. The interesting character of Jennie Coit disappears quickly. And Anne Potter, who had the possibility to be extremely interesting, is just too thinly drawn.\\"Northwest Passage's\\" Book I is a terrific piece of historical fiction. I cannot speak more highly of it. However, Book II drags, and is really only interesting in that illustrates what happens to the characters introduced in Book I. Book II is actually just a very long and detailed epilogue to Book I."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"Kenneth Roberts' &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; is one of the great novels of the 1930's.

Most of the book is an accurate description of what occured during that time period, and one gets an incredible feel for the hardships and calamities that befall these men. The book is written in the first person as the narrator is one of the Major's trusted associates; the story involves both men and their lives together in the wilderness and much later when their paths cross once again near the end of the 18th Century. Rogers himself commanded the first real &quot;commando&quot; unit and he is the father of all subsequent outfits like the Green Berets, the Navy Seals etc. Kenneth Roberts was one of the great historical fiction writers of his day and anyone who is interested in this time period would be wise to read this book. It is truly a classic."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"Kenneth Roberts was one of America's best-known nonfiction magazine writers back during the heyday of the Saturday Evening Post. One of his best-known articles was a profile of Hitler following the Beer Hall Putsch, which became a book in its own right at a time when no one in America knew who Hitler was.Beginning in the mid-1930s, Roberts wrote a series of brilliant but erratic historical novels about America in the late 1700s, set in his beloved Maine or in neighboring Boston and Portsmouth, NH. \\"Northwest Passage\\" (which was serialized by the Post) was his masterpiece and the most popular book in America for two years during the 1930s, although it's barely remembered today (or, if remembered, known only as the source for a mediocre Spencer Tracy movie of the same name).The book is the story of a real person, Major Robert Rogers, a miltary leader from pre-Revolutionary America whose unit, Rogers' Rangers, was America's first to fight \\"Indian-style\\" (in other words, to fight battles the way we fight them today). Rogers' great success in warfare led to him becoming one of the colonies' first published authors, a star in London, and later the royal governor of Michilimackinac (the fort at the tip of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan ... and the land westward), but his unwillingness to join with pluderers who wanted to loot the British and colonial treasuries in the name of the Crown led to his arrest and unwarranted disgrace ... and to his ultimate decision to side with the British during the American Revolution, like Roberts' other main hero, Benedict Arnold (\\"Arundel\\" and \\"Rabble in Arms\\").This novel is made up of two very different but intricately-plotted books. Book 1, which ranges in place from Harvard College to the British Army during the French and Indian Wars and the New England art world, tells the story of a young man, Langdon Towne, who becomes Rogers' personal secretary during Rogers' Rangers' expedition to destroy the town of St. Francis, home of the native group most hostile to the New England settlers. Book 2, which begins in London, crosses back to upstate Michigan and the Dakota lands, and then returns to London, tells the story of Towne's advancement as an artist and his involvement with Rogers' plan to discover the Northwest Passage.The reason that this book rates 4 stars instead of 5 has to do with a writing issue that must be mentioned. Roberts' friend Booth Tarkington served as \\"editor\\" of the first three-quarters of the book, and the Roberts-Tarkington prose is stellar. However, under severe time pressure to finish the second half of the book (due to its smash-hit status), Roberts wrote the last quarter without Tarkington's help, and the change in writing quality is jarring -- especially as it comes right during the most historically-important and dramatically-important section of the book, Rogers' betrayal by his Northwest Passage expedition commanders and by his British and American enemies. Roberts had offered Tarkington co-writing credit, which Tarkington refused, but this justaposition of styles shows just how critical Tarkington's help was. The plot continues smoothly, though, even if the writing doesn't.One more point: in researching and writing this book, Roberts uncovered (after two years of searching, and just before publication of Book 2) the actual court-marshal transcripts of the two court-marshals with which Rogers was involved, which were believed to have been destroyed by Rogers' enemies -- and both supported Roberts' sympathetic treatment of Rogers. Thus, not only was this book incredibly popular, but it was significant for historical research as well. What more can you ask from one book?"},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"I first discovered Northwest Passage at a library while I was still in high school, and ever since then I have been a confirmed Kenneth Roberts fan. His ability to bring the frontier and its characters alive is uncanny and unmatched by any other author I've ever read. His research into the foods, weapons, country and historical events he writes about is unparalleled, and each character in all of of his novels seems so real it sometimes becomes diffcult to determine if they were real or not. Mingling real-life historical figures such as George Washington, Benedict Arnold and others, with fictional characters such as Steven Nason, Cap Huff, and other truly unforgettable creations, lends them a credibility that results in history coming alive. One's understanding of historical events and people that have become blase' over the years is competely turned upside down and inside out as you gain new insight and understanding of what happened, why it happened and what it meant through Roberts' masterful writing backed up by exhaustive research into his subjects and events. The characters not only are drawn larger than life in all their strengths and weaknesses, but as they move through several of Roberts' novels and are observed and encountered differently when viewed from different perspectives, we begin to realize that history is not static but is dynamic and alive. Example: RABBLE IN ARMS and OLIVER WISWELL are both books about the American Revolution, but written from diametrically opposite viewpoints ! RABBLE IN ARMS follows the struggle of the colonists to free themselves from England's grip as envisioned from the rebellious colonists' perspective, while OLIVER WISWELL is about the very same events written from the perspective of a Loyalist; many of the very same characters populate both novels, but the view one gets of them is so different from one to the other of the books that it hardly seems as if at first they are about the same thing. Additionally, OLIVER WISWELL is an outstanding exploration of the Loyalist cause and why they believed we would all be better off to remain loyal subjects of England.I've read all of Roberts' books, and have a first edition of OLIVER WISWELL purchased for $3.00 from a used bookstore with an original newspaper review that had been tucked inside the book by the original purchaser. The review is of the novel itself, and after reading that review from more than 60 years ago, it is very apparent over the years the very high and well-deserved reputation of Roberts has not diminished.My recommendation is: read them. Read them all !! You will never find finer writing or an author with a keener appreciation of his subject matter and the period about which he writes than Kenneth Roberts. All of Roberts' books should be reprinted, again and again, as they were when they were first published (check the frontispieces to see how many times his novels have been re-printed over the years --- it's astounding!). Every person who reads Roberts becomes a devotee and a reader for life, and every one to whom you loan a copy of any of his novels will then be someone with whom you can share the pure pleasure of having read a Kenneth Roberts novel, and there are many of us out there. Welcome to the astounding, incredible world that will soon be at your fingertips!"},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"Northwest Passage:Kenneth Roberts was the premier historical fiction author of his day. What starts out as a simple French and Indian War tale of a daring raid on the St. Francis Indian village by Major Robert Rogers, eventually spans North America, Europe and the Mediterranean. Roberts' descriptions of wilderness warfare and survival bespeak his excruciatingly thorough research and knowledge of eighteenth century America, to the point where you might wonder if he was actually there. His battle scenes are unsparingly violent and brutal, even by today's standards, but the whole novel is infused with a quaint romanticism, that is usually avoided in modern literature. In Robert's works, warfare is bloody, and politics unsavory, but noble spirits and strong hearts prevail. Anyone who likes historical fiction, art history, or adventure travel, would do well to start with Northwest Passage."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"Kenneth Roberts is my favorite novelist so this review may be somewhat biased, but Northwest Passage truly is a book people should read. It is gripping, a book I had a difficult time setting down. Roberts had a style that was unique in that the reader can many times feel the sensations he is describing. When the soldiers were hungy and were failing at hunting, Roberts could create a sensation of hunger and frustration. When he described the streets of London, the reader feels like he/she is actually there.This book is wonderful. It's full of lively, intelligent characters and solid story plots. It is as good a represtation of colonial America as was ever done in the form of a novel. Hopefully it will remain a timeless classic forever."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"As a history buff, Revolutionary War reenactor and New Englander, I was interested in reading about this author who I'd never heard of from my area. Although this story is historical fiction, the events mentioned (and many of the characters) are real. The amount of detail the author was able to put in this book is staggering. Once you start reading this story you will be dragged into the daily struggles of the many characters. In addition, you'll better understand the trials of the native Americans and how they suffered and were taken advantage of. There was a 1940 movie by the same name starring Spencer Tracy which follows the book pretty closely. Unfortunately the movie only takes in the first half of the book. Since reading this book, I have read 4 other historical novels by Kenneth Roberts and enjoyed each one. He is a prolific writer and has taken great pains to portray the events and their details in an easy reading style. Sit down with this book on a snowy evening in front of your fire and be transported back to the 18th century. You won't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"I was fourteen years old when a family friend gifted me on my birthday with Rabble in Arms in Hungarian translation. It took no little trouble and risk to locate other works by Roberts in Communist controlled Hungary. Northwest Passage was the second book by Roberts I read and this as well as all other works in Roberts 'Chronicles of Arundel' series sold me on the US. Northwest Passage is the story of revenge within the framework of the French and Indian War, a fantastic account of courage, endurance and heroism. It is also the story of one man, Major Robert Rogers; one man's life at its zenith, as he relentlessly inspires his men to superhuman performance; also at its nadir, as he descendes into debauchery, debt, and succumbs to disease. The narrator, Langdon Towne, aspiring artist, only matters insofar as he is the one,(in first person, as many of Roberts' protagonists do,) who tells the story. His viewpoint is that of a participant, not an outside observer, and this makes the story come alive even more than it otherwise would have.It is one of Roberts' masterful works. It lost nothing in translation although I consider myself fortunate to have many of Roberts' works in their first editions.It is my uderstanding that Roberts' works had been translated into over 52 languages. If any of those translation are as well done as the Hungarian version Roberts should be a universally celebrated and rewarded author.Northwest Passage is true classic. Even though the movie with Spencer Tracy now seems obsolete this deserves a remake that should closely follow the book. I wouldn't recommend changing anything just go by the book. I sure would go and see it. As it is I have the book and have enjoyed reading and rereading it over the many years."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"I've spent a lot of time on the history surrounding the actual events of Rogers Rangers raid on the Abenaki village of Odanak in 1758. But here is a book that throws back the curtain and hurls us out the window into the midst of 18th Century America and Britain.This is simply one of the finest historical novels out there; closely rivalling LeGrand Cannon's Look To the Mountain. Good historical escapist fun and drama."},{"Title":"Northwest Passage","review":"Somehow I only recently got around to reading Northwest Passage, even though it is better known and deals with an earlier period in American history than than the Roberts novels on which I started, such as Arundel and Oliver Wiswell. I'm glad I waited.Other reviewers have commented on the differences between the first and second halves of the novel. Not only are they stylistic, but the scope of the story widens dramatically in part 2. Here's where reading NWP out of order helped, though, because the other novels created a context that made the dramatic shifts more understandable than they might have been otherwise.Without giving any spoilers, all of Roberts' usual themes are here, including betrayal, corruption, and a fairly cynical attitude towards women.All in all, great, thrilling stuff, of a type that isn't really done any longer.

The French Revolution is well under hand; hundreds of aristocrats are being put to death through the guillotine. All in Paris is in terror of the guillotine and many of the aristocrats try to flee but are always caught until a band of brave and noble Englishmen risk their lives to protect the innocent. This group of men are led by a mysterious man known only as 'the Scarlet Pimpernel'. No one knows who he is and the French Revolutionists want to know badly so that they can capture and kill him. One of the leaders, Chauvelin, comes up with a plan to use a former citoyenne of France, Marguerite St. Just, as a spy. Now that she is married to one of the most fashionable and richest Englishmen, Sir Percy of Blackeney, she is the pivot of social London who hears and sees everything. She might find out who the Scarlet Pimpernel is. Though she refuses and says she wants to have nothing to do with the Revolution, Chauvelin blackmails her with a signed letter proving that her brother, Armand St. Just, is in league with the Scarlet Pimpernel. If she does not cooperate with him, Chauvelin will produce the letter to the head of the French council and Armand will be put to death. Marguerite, seeing no choice, agrees reluctantly. She has had many problems of her own. When she married Percy, everyone was gossiping why ever would she marry such a fop and an idiot when she could have chosen to marry anyone. But Marguerite is in love with Percy, because she feels that he is wearing a mask, and that being a fop is just a faade. A terrible thing happens on their wedding day because Percy finds out that Marguerite was involved in the execution of the whole St. Cyr family when she tells the Committee that Marquis de St. Cyr is a spy for the Scarlet Pimpernel. Though she pleads that she is innocent, which is true, Percy does not believe her and is cold towards her. So thus Marguerite has no one to turn to when Chauvelin blackmails her. At the Prince of Wales&#65533;s ball, she finds out that the Scarlet Pimpernel will be waiting for two of his accomplices in the library at the ball. Will Marguerite betray the Scarlet Pimpernel, or will she hand over the life of her dear brother, Armand?I love this book because it has plenty of adventure, action, mystery, suspense, and romance. One of my favorite parts of the book is where Sir Percy recites his poem, &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel.&quot;&quot;They seek him here, they seek him there,Those Frenchies seek him everywhere,Is he in heaven or is he in hell,That demmed illusive Pimernel.&quot;Baroness Orczy made me feel for the characters. When Marguerite was scorned by the Comtesse de Tournay, I felt so bad for her and when Chauvelin is about to go into the library to find the Scarlet Pimpernel, I was in such suspense as to whether he would find him or not. This is a book which can be enjoyed by everyone. One of those classics that must, MUST, be read!If you enjoyed the book, I strongly recommend the 1982 version of &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;. With great actors Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymore, this is one of my favorite films to watch even after watching it so many times. There's also a 1934 version with Leslie Howard though I'm sorry to say I haven't seen it yet. Do want to see it though!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I first saw several movie versions of \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\\" and always wanted to see the Play. With the purchase of a Kindle and text-to-speech I could not afford to pass up the book.I was amazed to see that the book started out like the movies with the telling of the blood lust of the French revolution and how one man for the sport of it saved many from the guillotine thwarting the authorities and tricking the sergeant at the city gate into letting him through.Then I was afraid the story was going to bog down as we took a long time to drudge through a scene in an inn. I did not realize that this was to introduce the major players in the soon to be mystery.The essence of the story was best said in the book:\\"Only between these two hearts there lay a strong, impassable barrier, built up on pride on both sides, which neither of them cared to be the first to demolish.\\"The story really picks up after Marguerite realizes what she has done by giving away the pimpernels identity and disides to make amends.Usually I cannot stand flowery writing or long descriptions of feelings. But for some reason this book was so well written that what would seem like extraneous information actually enhanced the tale. I also noticed it is told mostly from Lady Blakeney's point of view.Once again this is a case of the book being better than the movie. I was surprise to find the Pimpernel poem came from the book:They seek him here they seek him thereThem Frenchies seek him everywhere.Is he in Heaven?Is he in Hell?That damned elusive pimpernel."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"About the Book:It is 1792 and the French Revolution is at its height. Hundreds of French aristocrats face the guillotine. However, many are saved by an elusive man known as the scarlet pimpernel. Using wit and disguise, the scarlet pimpernel and his band smuggle French aristos to English shores. Because of this elusive man, Chauvelin, a French republican, travels over to England to gather information. There he runs into Marguerite, a woman who was known for being a French actress and now is the top of England's fashion society. Chauvelin ends up threatening Marguerite with a fearsome either-or. She must gather information for him on the scarlet pimpernel or he will send her brother to the guillotine.Review:Upon hearing Douglas Sills sing int the 1997 Broadway musical, I was instantly in love and knew that I would have to read the book one day. Although I still adore the book, the musical still holds my heart. For one thing, we get to follow our hero more. Now, I completely understand why Orczy didn't follow him so much. It was meant to keep the mystery of the scarlet pimpernel a prolonged secret. Now, I knew who it was going to be from page one, but I have to agree with other reviewers that it was demmed obvious who it was early on.Another complaint I noticed a lot of reviewers made was that the book was very repetitive. Again, I would have to agree. Although it didn't bother me personally, I could see many people having trouble getting through it. Now, I can hear a good portion of you arguing that this was written in the 19th century so it is bound to be more wordy. Yes and I expected this and even a decent amount of repetition. However, I felt that half of this book could have been cut away.The only other issue I had with this book was the characters. The first example I would like to look at is Chauvelin. Now, I first came to know the character through the musical and the 1985 film. In both of these, he seems to show feelings for Marguerite. This did not occur in the book. Perhaps it is shown in one of the many sequels written by Baroness Orczy, but it is not shown in the initial novel. Now, this particular trait did not really bug me. I am fine with or without this love interest. What did bug me about Chauvelin's character was the the fact that he was little more than the villain in the story. He was much more endearing in the musical version where he is more well rounded and you can feel where he is coming from. Again, perhaps we see more of his character in the sequels, but in The Scarlet Pimpernel, he is hardly more than a bloodthirsty fiend.The other character I found myself disliking in the novel was actually Marguerite. I liked her well enough in the other medias I mentioned, and I also liked her early on in the book. However, for being the \\"cleverest woman in all of Europe,\\" she seems quite thick. Also, by the halfway point of the book, I was utterly sick of her for it seemed that she did little more than whine.Now, I can hear you asking, \\"It seems there was a lot you disliked so why the high rating?\\" Well, I usually find there is plenty of good to go with the bad, and even though The Scarlet Pimpernel had its faults, I still found myself enjoying it immensely. Granted, I am a tad bias. Anyone who knows me knows I have a fondness for 18th century fops, but even without that fondness, I found the story compelling and original (especially for its time). I also found a great liking in the fact that the scarlet pimpernel used wit and disguises rather than force and violence. Now, I am not one of those people who are strictly anti-violence, but I have always found my heroes more intriguing when they try to use their mind first.The other factor I was intrigued by was the mixture of both adventure and romance. I would not recommend this classic for a reader looking for mostly adventure however. Yes, the pimpernel's escapades are riveting and influenced heroes such as Zorro, but I'd say that 65-70% of the book related more to the romantic portion of the story. I, myself, was intrigued by it, but it may not be to everyone's liking and thus thought it would be worthy to note. Granted, my favourite parts of the book involved the pimpernel and the adventures that surrounded him, especially near the end when Chauvelin is hot on his trail. I don't want to give away the ending for it was most excellent (even if I did manage to figure the twist out). Even with that factor in play, I was reveled in joy and suspense to see how he would save himself, Marguerite, and the others.So all together, I found The Scarlet Pimpernel to be an excellent read. I may have disliked how some of the characters were portrayed; it could have been less repetitious, and it may be too slow of pace for some, but its story, wit, and adventure made it a wonderful classic that was well loved by this reader."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This is a fun, rousing classic, filled with adventures, misconceptions, narrow escapes, and touches of romance, Victorian style (all chaste and clean). The Scarlet Pimpernel, and his gang of men run daring missions, rescuing French aristocrats from the clutches of the guillotine, during the height of the French Revolution, and managing to stay just one step ahead of being captured. I agree with and understand the many comparisons to Dumas and Sabatini. They all contain fast paced adventurous tales with suspense, intrigue and daring dos with dashing heroes, damsels in distress and damsels causing distress, and clearly defined villains that take joy in seeing the good guys squirm. Orczy's novel is not as tightly drawn, nor is it as vast in scope. It is a breezier read, with a smaller, more intimate cast of characters for the reader to focus on, making it great for young readers or as an introduction to this time period or genre, while it still holds much for the seasoned reader.What I didn't expect was how much more substantial Lady Blackeney's role was and the depth and complexity of her character. You are not sure where her loyalties lie, her home country of France, or her new adopted country of England, for or against her husband. We learn that prior to her marriage to Percy, she made a very selfish and foolish decision that had devastating consequences and lingering affects on the present.Written at the turn of the twentieth century, 'Pimpernel' is of its time, melodramatic, romantic with some touches of flowery prose, and lighter on the historical aspects than historical fiction novels of today. Originally, Baroness Orczy could not get her manuscript published; it was only after turning this into a very successful play, that it found its way to a publisher. This made me wonder if the book benefited from it having to be presented on the stage. Were the pacing and visual qualities present before it became a play or enhanced due to the play? Was the reader privy to the Scarlet Pimpernel's identity in the original manuscripts or after? The answers don't really matter, the results are what count and what have made this classic a fun ride of a read for generations. This read is an entertaining 3-1/2 stars!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"The Scarlet Pimpernel is a classic novel, though it is hard to categorize. It is part romance, part adventure, part spy thriller, and part superhero fiction. All of these elements went into the pot and the resulting stew is extremely entertaining.The book follows the adventures of Sir Percy Blakeney as he seeks to help French aristocrats escape the guillotine during the French Revolution. Since official English policy forbids this, Blakeney adopts a masked identity as the Scarlet Pimpernel to remain anonymous. The French, of course, detest this interference in their affairs and set out to trap and kill the Pimpernel at all costs. As part of his effort to deflect suspicion from himself, he plays the fool in every day life and he does it well. His own wife considers him a useless fop... and that's where the story really gets interesting.I won't give away more of the plot, but she ends up following him into danger in an attempt to save him. This allows the most suspenseful section of the book to be told from Mrs. Blakeney's perspective. Her terror for her husband's fate is pure and adds to the tension considerably. If we saw it through the Pimpernel's eyes, it would doubtless be far more composed and nowhere near as suspenseful.In closing, The Scarlet Pimpernel is well worth buying. It's laugh out loud funny, suspenseful, romantic, and generally quite a page-turner."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This is a re-read for me, and one that I have to admit doesn't hold up nearly so well as an adult. Part of this is not the fault of the book as much as it is the fault of its many imitators. The foppish irresponsible aristocrat who is actually the super-competent avenger of justice has, in the meantime, been done-- done to death-- done again-- done some more. It lacks the kick that it had when I first read it so very long ago.None of which makes it a bad book, not at all. It is still fun to read. Lots of romantic not-quite betrayal, love and derring-do. I don't think it's really a great book, that's all.Orczy is worth a read simply for the influence that her work has had on other later authors. Don't expect too much, and you should be pleasantly surprised.(Has anyone out there read any of the follow-up books to Pimpernel?

What an incredible love story it is...and it's not one of those books that you read once, and then put back on the shelf, never to be taken down again, either. It is one which you can read again and again, and each time you do, it is as new as when you FIRST read it. It is one of those few novels that retain innocent romantic dialog, and yet it is intriguingly poetic and beautiful beyond words.

Only after Baroness Orczy turned her novel into a successful stage play, was it eventually printed in 1905.Sir Percy Blakeney is a high living, 18th century action man. He leads the whole of England to think him a brainless fop, whilst in reality he's the mastermind behind the daring rescue of many a French aristocrat (aristo in those days having taken on a new meaning of anyone, regardless of birth, who objects to the revolutionary government)... the first hero with a secret identity.And what of the central character, Marguerite, who dreams about the mysterious hero whilst being contemptuous of her husband? A woman with brains and beauty, who pushed every 18th century boundary as far as a woman could (although you really have to read the rest of the series to get the full picture)... move over Lois Lane!Then there's Chauvelin, the sable clad villain (another first?). Orczy develops him so well over the series that you'll be willing him to win... just once!The Scarlet Pimpernel is the predecessor of Zorro (and in turn Batman), James Bond (and in turn Indiana Jones) and a whole host of other modern fictional heroes. Certainly, if you read this book and then watch the Schwarzenegger movie \\"True Lies\\", you'll never see it as a 007 spoof again. It's pure Scarlet Pimpernel updated!And which characters inspired Orczy to create Sir Percy? My guess would be Dickens' Sidney Carton and Conan-Doyle's Sherlock Holmes... but I could be wrong."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"The Scarlet Pimpernel is set during the French Reign of Terror, when aristocrats and royalists were being beheaded in the name of &quot;liberty, freedom, and brotherhood&quot;. The author creates The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, a band of Englishmen committed to helping aristocrats escape to England, and keep their heads. The head of this band of Englishmen is, of course, called by the code name The Scarlet Pimpernel. His identity is secret to all, even those he helps escape.This sets the scene for a &quot;Three Musketeers&quot; style swashbuckling adventure story. It is fun and exciting, full of suspense that lasts until the very end. There is a nice love story woven quite naturally into the fabric of the plot, that manages to add to the plot without being syrupy. The story also includes some thoughtful moments that excute simply without bogging down the story in the least. Overall, a very enjoyable novel. It treads lightly on the moral/ethical issues surrounding the French Revolution, and deals mostly with an adventuresome story. Those looking for a more 'serious' fictional work of the French Revolution may prefer A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"\\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\\" is a swashbuckling tale of the French Revolution's reign of terror, only without any swords swashing, and open contempt for the revolutionaries.A couragous Englishman and a band of his fellow aristocrats rescue French nobles from death at the hands of unwashed masses who shout \\"Librete, Egalite, Fraternite!\\" and murder and suppress anyone associated with the earlier regime. The Englishmen don't do this out of duty, or opposition to the brutal leaders in France, but for the sport of it, or so they claim to conceal nobler motives. The sinister Chauvelin, an agent of the French Republic is dedicated to rooting out the Scarlet Pimpernel, the leader of the band who makes fools of the Revolution.Short, very readable, with engaging characters who have personal lives, flaws, and issues as well as heroic traits and adventures, this book is pretty darned good. Unlike most stories of late Eighteenth Century Europe, swordplay and violence in general is conspicuous by its absence. The Scarlet Pimpernel uses trickery, cunning, and audacity to outsmart the French authorities who are bent on his destruction as they try to murder the remnants of the French Aristocracy. I liked it a lot, and largely because it wouldn't get good reviews in todays media.\\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\\" shows the virtues of monarchy, the vices of democracy, the nobility of taking personal risk to life and limb for strangers, the villiany of the will of the masses, the weakness of grim single-minded determination, and above all, the strength of laughter and a light heart. All of which constitute heresy to \\"real\\" book reviewers in academia and the media. Read it, and enjoy a perspective not normally heard, as well as an outstanding adventure story."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I adore this novel and the Baroness' writing style. I'll admit that I chose this version for its cover, but had always wanted to read the novel. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down.

It's definitely a great book for both sexes and many ages!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I had to read the scarlet pimpernel for my English class. I thought that it would be yet again another boring classic. It turned out to be something a lot more. The intrigue was interesting and the love was not the kind you would read in Shakespeare, but also not explicit at all. I am not going to ruin the book by telling you who the Scarlet Pimpernel is, but I would reccomend it to anyone, especially anyone interested in blackmail and spying or historical novels."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I first read the Scarlet Pimpernel years ago. The writing style is florid and archaic by modern standards, it takes a bit of patience to get used to, but the Baroness wrote a classic. Using the horrors of the French Revolution as a background, Sir Percy Blakeney is a worthy successor to such dashing heroes as Robin Hood, using his wits, courage and disguises to foil the plots of the evil French Revolutionaries and save the lives of the condemned nobility. Do not expect a balanced view of the actions of the French Revolution, this is a story of adventure, with a dashing hero, and a beautiful heroine.Lord and Lady Blakeney move in the inner circles of English society, friends of His Majesty, the Prince of Wales. But by night, Lord Percy, who seems no more than a fashionable fribble, becomes the dashing and resourceful Scarlet Pimpernel, who with his faithful friends, rescues condemned French nobility from the very jaws of death.Marguerite, Lady Blakeney, a former French actress who was once naive enough to be tricked into helping condemn a French aristocratic family, is blackmailed into helping the villian, Chauvelin, unmask the Scarlet Pimpernel, unaware that he is none other than her lazy, indifferent husband. She and Percy have become man and wife in name only since he discovered her part in condemning the aristocrats. He loves her, but he cannot forgive her for lying to him about her part in such a brutal and pitiless act. All that goes by the wayside when Sir Percy is forced to act to save both his wife, whom he truly loves despite his behavior, and her brother, not to mention his own life, from Chauvelin's trap.This is old-fashioned high adventure, and it does seem silly at times, but the relationship between Marguerite and Percy is touching and romantic. A great read for a lazy afternoon that takes you back to a simpler, easier time."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Okay first of all, if you are looking for a swashbuckling sword fighting adventure book you probably won't like this because The Scarlet Pimpernel (SP) does no fighting at all in this book. Later books, yes, but not this one. This is sorta like a Romantic Adventure Comedy. This is the only series of books that I can ever remember that has made me laugh out loud!And no, I'm not going to tell you who the SP is because its just one of those things you can't know before you read the book. The SP and his league are a band of englishmen who save french aristocrats from the guillotine and take them to england where they are safe. Well, the people who started the revoloution aren't happy about that! So they send Ambassador Chauvelin to england to find this SP. Chauvelin (pronounced Show vell lahn I think) Blackmails Marguerite Blakeney, the wife of the rich and foppish Sir Percy Blakeney, to find the SP. So she decides to find the SP for Chauvelin, and Marguerite gets in a whole heap of trouble. But not to worry because everything turns out fine. Really an entertaining book, and after you read this one I suggest you read some other books in the series. After you read the first one and understand everything that is going on is when the other books get sorta funny. The only other books I have read so far are The Elusive Pimpernel, and The Triumph of the Scarlet Pimpernel. Okay, so read the book to find out who the SCARLET PIMPERNEL is!Below is one of my favorite quotes that is in a couple of the books.....\\"They seek him here, they seek him there,Those Frenchies seek him everywhere!Is he in Heaven? Or is he in Hell?That demmed, elusive Pimpernel!\\"Oh and by the way, If you happen to find one of the movies out there about the scarlet pimpernel, PLEASE! don't watch it first!

Although her husband has connections in France that might save her brother, she doesn't know if it will be enough to save him.

Marguerite's attitude to her husband is revolting. She treats him like a piece of meat until she finds out her husband's secret. Then she has a sudden change of personality. Many other characters had personal flaws which I did not like and the fact that the Scarlet Pimpernel escaped without harm and the way he did it is truly deus ex machina. The identity of the Scarlet Pimpernil is obvious very early in the book as well.

For some reason, I chose the Scarlet Pimpernel, mainly because it was about 8 times shorter than Tom Jones or David Copperfield. I couldn't get into the book at all, and in fact, I couldn't even finish it. Maybe I'll try to read it again someday, but I doubt it. My advice? Read something else, like Tom Jones, where there are atleast Cliff Notes or a Movie about it. Maybe because everyone here has given this book 4 and 5 stars, it seems I have no clue what I'm talking about. I tried to give it a chance, but I simply could not follow the reading. If you are willing to give this dull and slow book a fair chance, by all means, go for it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I had to read this in 7th grade for English, and I could barley stay awake for it. It takes the character about 5 pages to do something as simple as pour themselves a glass of milk. We read this book in class and half of the class was asleep while reading it.

The book is written in that dry, stale, matter-of-fact style people were &quot;supposed&quot; to write in back in that day. Instead of describing excitement &amp; espionage, this book is more like an Ed Wood film: the writer talks about exciting things supposedly happening, but no excitement occurs. We're just supposed to assume there's adventure. Aside from the constant boredom, only an idiot wouldn't know who the Scarlet Pimpernel was by about page 20. Since it's so obvious, all the mystery is killed from the outset. From what I understand, the novel was never as popular as the play. I guess people didn't just stand around talking about exciting things happening in the play, but actually showed them taking place. If you're up one night &amp; can't get to sleep, read this book. It'll be lights-out for you in no time....."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"No doubt this was great reading 100 years ago. But to a modern reader, the book's age is apparent on every page. The central mystery of the book (the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel) is obvious well before it is revealed. The dialog is distractingly archaic and upper crust. The thoughts and concerns of the main character (Marguerite) are plain, without nuance or complexity, and by the end I was gritting my teeth every time she was described as &quot;the cleverest woman in Europe.&quot; The book's first sentence is great, and the first chapter is very good, but it's downhill from there. Baroness Orczy may have invented a genre of literature, but it is so familiar to us now that the original appears tired. It gets one star for illuminating historical aspects of the French Revolution."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"PLease consider how many books there are out there before you pick up THIS one. Though you may be a fan of suspense or romance, this has a plot that has managed to be predictable, dull, and pretentious all at once. The story is a basic spy story, and the little romance is obscured by slang which has no place in today's literature. The author tends to describe things in a way that could take paragraphs (if not pages) to explain. The only reason to go near this book is for a school project or in class assignment.

However, since this book WAS written before Gloria Steinem, I'm willing to overlook that. Besides Maugeritte, the characters are wonderful, especially Percy, and the novel is very suspenseful.

I want to compare it's entertainment value to that of &quot;Kidnapped&quot; by R.L. Stevenson. Both, &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; by Baroness Orczy and &quot;Kidnapped&quot; are of extreme value to the intermediate reader. Yet SP is a thrilling adventure involving the class struggle behind the French Revolution and, this might be appealing to individuals looking to piece together the jig saw puzzle that makes up Western Civilization. Although, SP doesn't bring out the general attraction as in &quot;Kidnapped&quot;. I felt my interests in the Comedy of Manners, espionange, and most recently, &quot;Les Miserable&quot; by Victor Hugo have been highlighted by this grand little story of an secret order with a ink drawing of a minuscule flower as a calling card. Sounds like Skull and Bones stuff to me. I was excited to read the page turner, SP and never the less, I wanted to save every episode that intwined the mystery of &quot;Who is the Scarlet Pimpernel's illustrious leader.The things that make young reader settle down to a good book are in this book. The last book I recomended to the young readers club at the down town library was &quot;Kidnapped&quot;, but I hadn't read the Scarlet Pimernel yet.

No, I wasn't forced. I disliked of my own free will. Perhaps because it's simply not my genre--there were times when one might call it &quot;thrilling&quot; and I had a soft spot for Chauvelin (villain et revolutionary!) From the very start, however, it was clear where Orkzy stood on the issues. Admitedly, the Revolution was out of control and had lost sight of it's motto: Liberty, Equality, Fraternity! But the first passages, in which Orkzy spits sarcasm at the very IDEA that the aristocracy had problems, are not remotely balanced. Politics ruined the read. Also, on a less subjective note, the Baroness is not a sophisticated writer. Her pros is far above, say, Michael Crighton's, but it lacks the sophistication of other &quot;classics&quot;. Once she fonds an adjective she likes, she sticks to it like a bulldog. When she forgets to call Chauvelin 'fox-like&quot; and &quot;shrewd&quot;, i begin to get insecure. Is he still shrewd?!!

It is part romance, part adventure, part spy thriller, and part superhero fiction. All of these elements went into the pot and the resulting stew is extremely entertaining.The book follows the adventures of Sir Percy Blakeney as he seeks to help French aristocrats escape the guillotine during the French Revolution. Since official English policy forbids this, Blakeney adopts a masked identity as the Scarlet Pimpernel to remain anonymous. The French, of course, detest this interference in their affairs and set out to trap and kill the Pimpernel at all costs. As part of his effort to deflect suspicion from himself, he plays the fool in every day life and he does it well. His own wife considers him a useless fop... and that's where the story really gets interesting.I won't give away more of the plot, but she ends up following him into danger in an attempt to save him. This allows the most suspenseful section of the book to be told from Mrs. Blakeney's perspective. Her terror for her husband's fate is pure and adds to the tension considerably. If we saw it through the Pimpernel's eyes, it would doubtless be far more composed and nowhere near as suspenseful.In closing, The Scarlet Pimpernel is well worth buying. It's laugh out loud funny, suspenseful, romantic, and generally quite a page-turner."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Intrigue, adventure...romance...what else does a great novel need to be just perfect?...

This character knows of disguise and intrigue...but struggles with a broken heart. Pride and misunderstandings will separate him from the woman he loves...I won't say more, so you can discover the rest of the story by yourself!Another good thing about this book is that since the story occurs in 1792 you also get the opportunity to experience some of the political and social issues present in France and England during this period.You will certainly enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"The Scarlet Pimpernel could easily have been another Robin Hood type book -- but Baroness Orczy made it so much more than that.

When Marguerite finds out that the Scarlet Pimpernel is her husband and realizes that she has been helping Chauvelin to kill him, she tries to warn him about Chauvelin's plot to capture and kill him before he walks into the fiendish trap.This original mystery is classic fun, adventurous, and full of romance. The constant danger and excitement is enough to continually keep you reading. The story is generally magnificent and not one that is easy to forget because of the variety of elements used in Baroness Emmuska's writing."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I read this book expecting it to be as boring as most books from that time period are. Boy was I wrong! This, hands down, is my favorite book of all time. The characters were human (in terms of their personalities anyway), meaning they have the same flaws as you or me. And it wasn't just action and suspense....there was romance too. The relationship between Percy and Marguerite is beautifully orchestrated...there's one particular part in the book that shows the longing the two of them have for eachother. I wont describe it, but it had me in tears. All in all, it was an exciting and fun book to read, even if some aspects are a little far fetched (that whole escaping alive EVERY time thing gets to be a bit much after a while)."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I saw the play in Stratford, Ontario a few years ago, and ever since I've been seeking this elusive book ... Well, I found it, and I love it! It's a classic, it got me intrigued, and now I'm hopefully going to read the other Pimpernel books one of these days. It has it's hilarious moments, it has moments where you want to read over and over again. It has spellbinding intrigue and moments where the plot and action is so tender you just want to bawl your eyes out. This book is said to be the perfect adventure. All the elements are there - surprise, twists, love, suspense and comedy above all. This is one of my all time favourite books. If you don't read it you are missing out on a wonderful and absolutely magnificent story."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I always think its such a shame that this book isn't better known and more widely read. It's probably one of the best romance/adventure stories I've ever read. The character of Sir Percy is so wonderful (his daring and audacity), and there are moments when you don't want to put the book down because you MUST know what will happen next. I've read the book over and over, and I still enjoy it just as much as I did the first time I read it. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Too many of my amazon friends have given up or strongly hinted at the ending to this classic tale. This reviewer will try to avoid that trap. Set in England at the time of the French Revolution, \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\\" features a brave Englishman who rescues French nobility from a certain date with the guillotine. Back home, the Brit is not taken seriously, usually described as \\"foppish\\". Across the Channel in France, he is the bravest guy around, carrying out daring rescues in a variety of disguises. Oh, those disguises! And that is all this reviewer will divulge! Those whose curiosity is whetted will just have to buy SP and read it. Though a bit florid, SP is fast reading, exciting and thoroughly enjoyable! A word on the movie version(s) seems required: The standard is the 1934 release with Leslie Howard as the SP, Merle Oberon as his wife, Lady Blakeley, and (in the \\"Prisoner of Zenda\\" tradition), Raymond Massey as the French agent, Chauvelin. There is a bad guy if ever there was one! The 1934 movie does NOT closely follow the book. Marguerite, Lady B, is vastly more prominent in print. That settled, enjoy SP in print or video. As is usually the case, the book wins but both are excellent entertainment in their own right. Isn't it poetic that Mr. Howard met his tragic real life demise as a British secret agent in WW2? Wouldn't Melanie have been proud of him?"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This book was wonderful. I'm 16 and I tell you, all teenagers out there read this book. Or, if you are a parent with a teenager studying the French Revolution tell them about this book. It makes history come to life and appreciate what you've learned in class. I couldn't put it down from start to finish."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I've read THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL more than once. As a Zorro fan, I've often wondered if THE MARK OF ZORRO author, Johnston McCulley, drew on her work as inspiration for his own. I think he must have. If I'm right, then THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL was the start of a whole genre--that of the masked hero. Because Zorro became the inspiration for Batman, the Lone Ranger, and other such heroes. The similarities between THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL and THE MARK OF ZORRO lead me to believe it must be true. First of all, Sir Percy Blakeney and Don Diego Vega are both wealthy aristocrats. Both pretend to be lifeless fops, while leading double lives as dashing, daring heroes. Both rescue innocent people from evil government: the Scarlet Pimpernel rescues aristocrats from the French Revolution's guillotine, and El Zorro rescues innocent people from a wicked governor. Both leave their marks: The Scarlet Pimpernel leaves behind a small red flower--a pimpernel--and Zorro leaves behind a carved Z. Both lead bands of men, the Scarlet Pimpernel from the first, and Zorro late in the novel. And both are relentlessly pursued by evil governments determined to stop them from saving their victims. The list of similarities are, too me, too many and too striking to be coincidence. Johnston may have drawn on real-life bandidos from California history for the man he created, but I believe he drew on THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL for the plot."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I've read this book many, many times, always enjoying it. I can safely say that this is my favorite book of all, and I read a LOT. This book has everything: a grand sweeping sense of history and the action behind the French Revolution, romance in the most pure sense of the word, a villain who carries all the evil of the Reign of Terror in his eyes and heart,a dashing adventurer who's really, REALLY smart as well as noble...you just have to experience it for yourself."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This review is specifically of the audiobook edition of this (ISBN: 1567404529) (I state this because reviews are sometimes posted on multiple editions).The Scarlet Pimpernel is a wonderful book, and has been one of my favorites since middle school.The problem here is the format of the audio book referenced by that ISBN. It is listed as a multi-track. Unfortunately, the information on the item does not make it clear what this is means. I did not understand until I actually purchased the item.Multitrack means that the tape is designed for a special audiobook reader that can be adjusted so that you only hear one track of the tape at a time. Unfortunately, if you don't have an audiobook reader (or at least a stereo that allows you to adjust the balance between speakers) and you try to play these tapes on a normal cassette player, what you get is different parts of the story coming out of each speaker. Needless to say this makes this audio edition useless for listening to in a car or on a common cassette player.Be warned. This edition is not for everyone. If you do not have the equipment to play it, seek an alternative edition."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I had to read this book for English class. Instead of it being the usual trash, I found it to be very entertaining and engrossing. Sir Percy Blakney, is percieved as a stupid nobleman by most of his peers. However, that is only a cover for his true identity, the Scarlet Pimpernel. He rescues French nobility who are about to be decapitated by Madame Guillotine. The peasants hate him and the nobles love him. Great love story too. Excellent book and won't take too long to read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Mystery, political intrigue, daring adventure and romance. All of this can be found in the Scarlet Pimpernel. A mysterious English hero and his band of cavaliers rescue French aristocrats from the clutches of the bloodthirsty revolutionists and their Madam Guillotine. Meanwhile a young French actress in England is forced to decide between saving her brother or the elusive Pimpernel, both whom she loves dearly. This is one of my favorite novels, but it is by no means difficult to read. Orczy can sometimes be repetitive, and sometimes she gives no proof to backup some the claims she makes. Example-Marguerite is the cleverest woman in all of Europe. This makes me think that this novel was written with a young audience in mind, but it does not make the novel any less exciting to read for anyone. The genius in the writing is not in these fine technical points, but in the extremely vivid and thrilling images pointed in your mind. Harry Potter fans will enjoy this."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Ok. I was assigned to read this book by my teacher. I usually hate books that teachers make you read so when I got this I thought ugh how boring can you get? And as in most good books the first few chapters were incredibly boring, or so I thought. Then I really started to get into the book and soon I couldn't put it down. This is now one of my top three favorite books ranking number 2 only to Harry Potter. I recommend this book to anyone who likes action and romance stories."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I loved the book version, but boy, the audio version was a dissapointment. The readings were a bit dull, and it was reallly REALLY long. This is one of my all time favorite stories, but even my partiality to this story wasn't ebough to sustain my interest in these extremely dragging tapes."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I'd read this book and its numerous sequels as a young teenager, and I remember loving them. The dash, the adventure, the romance, the period charm ... These books seem to me to be the proto-type of dashing historical fiction (as perfected by Dorothy Dunnett). Recently, having suffered the clumsiness of the Broadway musical of the same name, I decided to go back to the source to rediscover the magic. But alas, it was not to be! I was surprised by how much it now grates against my adult sensibilities. The characters are two-dimensional and stereotypical (and irritatingly slow on the up-take), the dialogue unnatural (far too much repetition for instance of affected exclamations), the plot corny and the writing lacking in finesse. And of course, it is incredibly political incorrect in the dewy-eyed and over-romanticised view it takes of the (oh so wronged) noble nobility (I write sarcastically, of course). Truly great juvenile fiction can be well appreciated by the adult mind (See Diana Wynne Jones); unfortunately this one just doesn't cut it for me.Nonetheless, this really is a classic of its genre, so I would still recommend this to any young person, or anyone who is prepared to switch off his critical faculties and just enjoy an indulgent story."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This was an excellent page turning fluff novel. Or so it seemed, having just read a 600 pagebook on Napoleon's invasion of Russia...The author unfolded the story well and demonstrated a knack forsuspense and metaphor. Though some of the events were contrived and the story washistorically inaccurate a couple of times, the writing flowed and was gripping at times.This was an entertaining read. For French Rev fans, this novel did not get into the details of the French Revolution.In fact, the historical setting could have been almost any with no change to the basic plot.Again, this was an entertaining read and would be a great book for the beach or a flight overseas."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I've just finished this book, and I've definately enjoyed it. It's a great mix of romance and excitement and moves along at a fast pace after the first few chapters. Of course, I did figure out who the Scarlet Pimpernel was by the fourth chapter, and forsaw some of the other plot developments (the minute the Jew appeared, for example, I realized who he was), but once I settled in to enjoy the ride it didn't detract from the fun of the story. The writing shows talent, but I found myself wishing over and over that the author had had a good editor to point out all the times she overuses certain phrases. That one little thing would have improved the book lots. I probably would have liked it a lot more when I was little (about seven to nine) and read books like it obsessively. The hero is apropriately appealing (the way he talks reminds me of Lord Peter, what?), the heroine sympathetic in her numerous ethical struggles, and the descriptions of some of the scenes conjure up extremely vivid mental images.Overall, &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; is fun and exciting, for the young and young at heart, as long as you sit back and don't let the repitions irritate you. I'd give it a try on a rainy day."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I hate, really hate giving a poor rating to a book that so many others have loved, but it must be done. Reading the reviews of the Scarlet Pimpernel, one expects Erol Flynn in print, with clever banter exchanged during swordfights, daring escapes, diabolical plotting by the villains. In the event, we get maybe one out of three.It's not that the novel is terribly written; there are some comlaints to be had there, but ultimately the book is too short for the complaints to matter. In fact, the novel starts out beautifully, with a French official bragging about how the Scarlet Pimpernel will never get past *him*, only to be duped himself. But after that first chapter it's Dullsville, with only an occasional spark of excitement. It's hard to get excited about a rich nobleman saving other rich noblemen, for one thing. For another, the gallant adventure promised is simply missing completely. If you want daring and dashing adventure, read The Three Musketeers - it's incredibly long, but you'll get much more satisfaction per page than you will here."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I am a fan of classic literature and find this story a littledull. The most annoying thing is the fact that Orczy repeats thingsover and over. It is so very irritating when you find the same thing out more than twenty times.I also feel that this book isn't geared toward an audience. The novice reader may like the repetitive nature so he or she can catch what is going on; but they will not endure the dragging plot. The advanced reader will become bored from hearing the same description over and over (i.e. the fact that \\"the net is closing around the \`aristos'\\" at the end) and barely finish the book because of its unappealing style. Furthermore, I think that the characters in the book rely on capricious events and call it &quot;wit.&quot; The fact that Marguerite is the smartest woman in all of Europe is never actually \\"shown\\" in the story. It is stated an innumerable amount of times; while she herself only makes a few clever comments in dialogue.As far as capricious events go, if you have read the book, think back at the chances of the happenings in the last chapters actually taking place ...In the end, I do not think The Scarlet Pimpernel is a good book. It has qualities that are ok but lack the development necessary to be great. I rate the book 3 stars because of its originality and the fact that some parts were ok. I feel that it is still so popular because of the &quot;superhero&quot; qualities that the Pimpernel has.If you want a real book, read the unabridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo. In my opinion it is the best novel ever written."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"We seek him here, we seek him there,Those Frenchies seek him everywhere.Is he in heaven? -Is he in hell?That demmed, elusive Pimpernel.The Scarlet Pimpernel takes place during the dark days of the French Revolution. When everyday a new aristocrat lost their heads beneath the platform of Madame la Guillotine. Until, however, when one Scarlet Pimpernel came to their rescue. The English Pimpernel and his many followers help save the lives of the French Aristos. With cunning and artful strategies, the Pimpernel is successful in tricking his many enemies, such as Bibot, which makes it easier for him to save many lives. The story also circles around Madame la Comtesse and her children, who were rescued by the Pimpernel, Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, Lady Blakeney, Sir Percy, Lord Antony, Jellyband, Sally, Mr. Hempseed, and many others who are all connected someway with the Scarlet Pimpernel.The book was exciting at certain parts, while boring during the others. Though, it's one of the best historical-fiction books I've read. My favorite part happened in the beginning when Bibot was fooled by the elusive Pimpernel. I liked this part because Bibot let the Scarlet Pimpernel escape right after he finished criticizing those, like him, who let the Englishman escape. It was funny to me especially since it was him who kept on babbling about how he would never let the &quot;hero&quot; get past him, and how those who let him escape should be sent to the guillotine. I also liked this part because it showed how smart and keen the Pimpernel's strategies were. For example, I had no idea, what so ever, that the woman with the plague-stricken son was part of his plan to save Madame la Comtesse and her children.The parts discussing the rescues made by the Scarlet Pimpernel were exciting and kept me hooked. Though, there were only a few. Other than those few passages, the book was full of dialogue. Even though there was some action during the many pages dialogue, like when Lady Blackeney and Madame la Comtesse reunited, I still struggled while reading the book. However, what made me continue reading the book was the fact that after almost every boring part in the book, the author always made up for it, either by having people argue, fight, or discuss the ways of the daring Scarlet Pimpernel."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I first saw several movie versions of \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\\" and always wanted to see the Play.

In The Scarlet Pimpernel, Baroness Orczy displays an incredible flair for the dramatic. Her book contains all the elements of a good play. For example, the plot's conflicts are clear from the first scene, and these conflicts heighten as the action moves along. The characters are very specifically drawn, and they develop as the conflicts heighten. The climax finds readers biting their nails, and the finale leaves them smiling in relief. As a senior interpretative speech major at Bob Jones University, I have chosen to perform The Scarlet Pimpernel as my Performance Recital. Baroness Orczy has made the task of performing this story a joy because of the dramatic elements she has skillfully woven into the fabric of her plot. This fabric forms a tapestry of romance, intrigue, and adventure--a tapestry that performers and readers alike cannot help but stand and admire."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"A very enjoyable book but very perdictable....I loved the history on the French culture and revolution....I do beleieve I will read the other books in the series just to see what happens next."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This is one of the best books I've read.

I picked it up but couldn't stomach the first few chapters. I put it down. When I was studying for my master's degree, I picked it back up and loved it once I got past that stuff in the beginning.Also, if you saw the movie first (any version), you won't find the movie ending in the book. The movie ending comes from a SP sequel.I catorgize this book as a romance. Yes, there is adventure, but the conflict is that the Scarlet Pimpernel married the love of his life only to lose trust in her on their wedding day when he discovers that she was responsible for a dasterdly deed that cost a French family their lives.

I am glad to say their are 18 SCarlett pimpernel books which you can enjoy over and over-if you now were &quot;to seek them everywhere&quot;"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"The book, \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\\" is set in the 1700s and is about a man who rescues people from being sent to the guillotine. This Englishman is known to the world by his alias, the Scarlet Pimpernel, since he signs his letters with a small red flower, a pimpernel. Whenever he rescues a person from being put to death, he sends a letter to the Committee of Public Safety to tell them that he has succeeded again. A reward of five thousand francs is on his head.My favorite part of the book is at the very end when the Scarlet Pimpernel, disguised a certain Benjamin Rosenbaum, utters a \`good, solid, absolutely British \\"Damn!\\"' It is funny because the author, Orczy, writes the book in such a way so that you know that Benjamin is the Scarlet Pimpernel but you still don't expect him to flat out have a British accent when he is in France.My least favorite part is at the very beginning when it takes about five chapters to understand what is happening and who the characters were. But, it makes it even more exciting when you finally realize what is happening.I would recommend this book to no one younger than twelve years of age because it has many interesting words that maybe even some adults might not understand. The book was written in 1905 so one should expect it to have some strange language. If the reader enjoys historical fiction, then the reader will love the Scarlet Pimpernel. It has lots of action/rescue scenes but it is ultimately about a woman's love for her husband."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Orczy has an overheated prose style, and her characters are made of cardboard, but she managed to strike gold in this book. It's hard to tell if it was an accident or not. The sequels aren't as good - but then, they wouldn't be, would they?The Scarlet Pimpernel is an archetype. He feels as much a fictional god as Robin Hood or Sherlock Holmes. The ending (by which I mean, the last third of the book) is nail-biting. Orczy doesn't over-bake, and certainly doesn't under-bake, the suspense: for once, her natural writing style is perfect, given the structure of the plot. This is a book you'll find yourself reading in one hit; and almost before you realise what has happened to you, you'll find that you've read one or two of the sequels as well. That is probably a mistake, but what the hell."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This story introduces us to a circle of friends in England during the French Revolution who, for the sport of it, travel to France in disguise to rescue French aristocrats from the certain death of the guillotine, right under the noses of their captors. The identity of their leader, the Scarlet Pimpernel, is a guarded secret but one that interests more and more people as more and more French aristocrats are discovered in safety in England. Constant danger, wit, romance, and adventure befall the reader at every turn.I've noticed in other reviews that people complain about the book starting out slow or gruesome or whatever. I don't remember noticing this myself, but I think any book worth reading can take a little patience in parts. Just let yourself absorb the story and give the author a chance. Don't spoil the book by watching the movies first. It's more fun to see the mystery unfold in all its subtleties and intensity in the book first."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I picked up this book when I was fourteen and have read it numerous times since. Orczy's dramatic writing fully captures the drama and the tragedy of the French Revolution. This novel has something for everyone: political intrigue, adventure and romance. I particularly appreciate the development of her three main characters. They live lives that require superhuman intellect and courage. All of them find themselves searching for something: whether it be love, power or heroic fulfillment. Orczy has a true talent for writing. She envelopes her plot with dramatic dressing. One can see this by reading the novel's first sentence: &quot;The seething, surging, mumuring crowd of people, human only in name...&quot; If you enjoy this book, I recommend you read her other titles in the series. Most are not in print, but usually libraries have some or most of the hard to get titles. My other favorite novel in the series is The Triumph of the Scarlet Pimpernel. It carries the same premise as the first book but incorporates more edge-of-your seat excitement."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This book is just plain fun to read. No profound insight into humanity or burning indictment against someone or something - this is just great, fast paced fun. It reminded me of the Sherlock Holmes adventures or a modern suspense movie.The Scarlet Pimpernel is an Englishman who leads a group saving the lives of French Aristocrats who are being systematically hunted down and killed in a French revolution. His identity is secret and he is really putting egg on the face of the revolutionaries so they attempt to find him through the aid of the expatriot Marguerite St. Just, now Lady Blakeney and the head of society in England. The plot comes into full throttle when she puts them on the trail of the Pimpernel only to discover afterwards the identity of the Pimpernel herself. The race is on. Will they find and kill the Pimpernel before she can find and save him?"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"For those of you who have read the book you will understand what my title means. The wonderful laugh that is ready to send terror through the heart of the agent of the French Revolution, and chills of excitement and happiness through yours. And a song bearing despair and hope.This is a wonderful book! I started and finished it within a day. The first chapter is a little gruesome but not overly so, seeing that it is set in theFrench Revolution. If you keep reading though, you are caught within two chapters. The entire book is an emotional roller coaster. So if you don't like books that will keep you up till all hours of the night reading, this book is not for you. The Scarlet Pimpernel is one of the most wonderful men that ever didn't live. And so let us all break out and ask,\\"Is he in Heaven? Is he in Hell?\\"\\"That demmed elusive Pimpernel.\\"-E"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"The Scarlet Pimpernel is an amazing and well-written novel. It is brimming with action, suspense, romance and it is all crammed into a 200-page book. In the beginning, it may seem like a difficult read because the author is developing the characters and describing the setting, but once the plot begins in earnest, it is hard to put down.The story revolves around the elusive character, the Scarlet Pimpernel. Although his true identity is unknown, he is said to have rescued many French aristocrats from blade of the guillotine in France, to a safe haven in England. A French revolutionary official known as Chauvelin has been searching for the Scarlet Pimpernel for many years. He knows that the Scarlet Pimpernel is in the England, so he seeks the help of a prominent figure in England's society named Marguerite. Chauvelin claims to have the evidence to send her brother, Armand, to the guillotine, unless she finds the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel. Throughout the book, she finds clues and gives them to Chauvelin, until they finally discover the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel. He leaves for France to catch the Scarlet Pimpernel in the act of saving a family of aristocrats. Marguerite finds that her brother is safe, but the Scarlet Pimpernel turns out to be someone who she truly cares for. She makes the dangerous journey France to find the Scarlet Pimpernel before Chauvelin does.You'll have to read the end yourself; the story gets better with many twists and turns and lots of both action and romance. This is truly a book that both boys and girls would like."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Baroness Orczy's literary masterpiece is The Scarlet Pimpernel. The work follows the emotional journey of Lady Marguerite Blakeney--from tolerating her foppish husband, Sir Percy, to pitying his faults to finally falling in love with him all over again.When Marguerite realizes that she has unwittingly betrayed Percy, she journies to France so that she may warn him or at least share in his horrible fate.One of the themes in the book is &quot;abandonment.&quot; As a child, Sir Percy was abandoned by his mother through &quot;losing her wits&quot; and her eventual death. Percy's father abandoned him through neglect. Marguerite literally abandoned Percy in the beginning of their marriage by briefly returning to her brother's house after making a shocking confession. After being abandoned so many times, it seems logical that Percy would be the one to play the role of hero--risking all for those in need.Most of all, this work is well known for Sir Percy's bon mot: We seek him here, We seek him there/Those Frenchies seek him everywhere..."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Spoiler WarningsThis book is a delightful read. In contrast to the sorrow and heaviness of other books on the French Revolution (including Marie Antoinette The Journey by Antonia Fraser), this book is a very different take on the tragedy. Sir Percy vies with his wife Marguerite, a brilliant French actress, in terms of acting ability. He has mastered the role of a brainless dandy to such an extent that he is the last person anyone would suspect as having the wits and wherewithal to be the Scarlet Pimpernel. Aristocrats are spared the guillotine time after time thanks to this man's ingenuity.Shortly after Marguerite and Sir Percy marry, Marguerite tells Sir Percy of her involvement in the arrest of a certain marquis who had humiliated her brother. Marguerite does not tell her husband the whole story, including that she had no idea her words would be taken out of context and used against the marquis and that she had done everything within her influence to try to prevent the marquis's death at the guillotine. Sir Percy's attitude towards Marguerite changes: he is still the gallant he always was, but a certain coldness and reservation mark his manner. Marguerite had hoped that her husband would not need a full explanation, and that his worshipful devotion towards her would continue unabated. She is hurt by his changed opinion of her and retaliates with pointed sallies at Sir Percy's expense. She is considered one of the cleverest women in all of Europe, and she sharpens her wits by making fun of her husband, whom she wrongfully assumes is too unintelligent to take offense.It is not until Marguerite partially confides in her husband when her brother's life is threatened that Sir Percy learns the truth of Marguerite's (unintentional) involvement in the marquis's death. Sir Percy repents his false impressions of his wife and vows that he will do everything within his ability to save Marguerite's brother. As Marguerite makes her way up the staircase after this intense communication, Sir Percy actually kisses the stairs where Marguerite had just walked! His worshipful attitude towards her is renewed, and Marguerite for her own part recognizes how much she has loved her husband all along. But is it too late for the lovers? Marguerite was forced by circumstance to reveal information about the Scarlet Pimpernel to an unrelenting French commissioner (an obsessive, Javert-like character) before realizing that the same man is her own husband.The rest of the book is a clever game of cat and mouse, replete with a happily-ever-after ending (or rather, a happy-for-the-time-being ending, as there are more books in the Scarlet Pimpernel series).I had seen the movie with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour several years ago. Both the book and movie are equally wonderful, though the movie's storyline is a bit different. Anthony Andrews (whom I had a crush on as a young girl after seeing him in a TV miniseries) was beyond perfection in the title role, and of course, Jane Seymour was wonderful as Marguerite."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Before there was Batman, Superman, and Spiderman, there was the Scarlet Pimpernel, the greatest of all masked heroes, a man who uses his great intelligence and bravery to save French aristocrats from certain death at the guillotine. He, with the help of his band of brave English gentleman, risk their lives time and time again for this \\"sport.\\" He's famous throughout England, infamous throughout France - and yet no one knows his true identity.Enter Marguerite Blackenly, nicknamed \\"the cleverest woman in Europe\\" yet married to the inane fop, Sir Percy. In an effort to save her brother from the clutches of the new dangerous French government, she consents to help her old friend, and new enemy, to discover the identity of the elusive Scarlet Pimpernel. But with the knowledge she gains, she becomes more deeply involved than she bargained for.An adventure, a history, and a romance all rolled into one, The Scarlet Pimpernel is a book you'll never forget."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Judging by the other reviews, I'm afraid I'm going to be the odd man out. I didn't think The Scarlet Pimpernel was all that good. The book is a light and easy read. It's even pretty fun. But I found it repetitive, predictable, and laughably melodramatic-even for the period in which it was written.I acknowledge that Pimpernel inspired Johnston McCulley's Zorro (which I really liked) and the whole \\"hero with a dual identity\\" genre. But when the old Stan Lee Spiderman comics I read to my kids have better plots and character development than this novel, I have to wonder why so many other reviewers gush over it.If you enjoy adventure novels, and want to get back to their origins, then Scarlet Pimpernel is certainly worth a read. It clearly influenced the genre. But for overall quality, it doesn't hold a candle to Alexandre Dumas, who wrote gripping adventure novels 50 years earlier and much better.Note: The book's flagrant anti-Semitism may offend some readers. Normally, this sort of thing doesn't phase me (old books reflect the attitudes of their time, and attitudes change, thank goodness), but even I raised an eyebrow more than once. So if you are easily offended, be forewarned."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I first read this book because it was there in front of me,and I really had nothing else to do, it was sort of a let's read the back of the cereal box reaction to some gloom in having Winter vacation almost over. Eh hem, so I picked it up and loved the first chapter. I rushed on into the second, I started to get bored with it, and was somewhat disappointed. I was ready to put it down, until things started to pick up once more with the 3rd chapter, and from then on it was smooth going and wickedly easy to pay attention.First off...A PIMPERNEL IS A HUMBLE WAYSIDE ENGLISH FLOWER. SUCH AS A ROSE OR A DAISY OR A PANSY. In the book it's used as a communication symbol. Understand? Good.The plot? Well nowadays it isn't anything brand new, but for its time it was. This was the first &quot;masked hero&quot; kind of a story, which is pretty impressive considering we wouldn't have dear old Superman or Batman or Zorro or anybody if it weren't for that good old Scarlet Pimpernel. The Pimpernel rescues &quot;aristos&quot; and anyone else who needs the help, from the Reign of Terror in France. It's actually a very refreshing and fun book. I liked it a lot and think that its a true classic, which it is.The characters? Hehe, ok there's Percy Blakeney, that fool, that fop, that ridiculously annoying &quot;demmed idiot.&quot; There's his charming wife, Marguerite, who is considered the &quot;cleverest woman in all Europe&quot;. Her &quot;cleverness&quot; doesn't really show all too much, but after you look back at the end of the book you realize that your lasting impression is that she is definitely pretty darned clever. And heck, she is. There's Chauvelin. Ok he's the bad guy. He's nasty, and wicked, and despicable, and it's easy to hate him, yet I love him. Ok so now there's the Scarlet Pimpernel, who actually is --------, but no one but his best friends know that it's him. His friends are part of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, and help rescue the &quot;innocent&quot; ( or maybe not so innocent) from the claws of the guillotine.The Scarlet Pimpernel has some extremely interesting escapes and I think that is where Orczy's imagination sets in. It is like Sherlock Holmes without the feeling of &quot;I have to figure this out.&quot; and more of &quot;I shall see how it plays out and relax a bit.&quot; The book is sometimes funny, in an odd way, but look to it more for some good romantic scenes and some great excitement. Good vs. Evil. Masked Hero. Brave lady. Happy Ending. It's one of those, feel good, refreshing, suspenseful, two hanky books.Heck it's only 3 bucks! Why don't ya just buy it? You shan't regret it."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I really enjoyed this book, and I am defiantly going to read the rest of them! This is the first of many Pimpernel stories, and it is very good. It has lovable character, wonderful twists, and a heartbreaking Love story. My mother and I both read it and Loved it!! I totally recommend it for anyone of any age I was 15 when I read it a year ago, and My mother is in her 40's, and We both loved it!!NOW THERE IS ONE THING I SHOULD WARN YOU ABOUT... The first few chapters are a little slow and you may be tempted to stop reading, but KEEP WITH IT!!!! It is so worth it!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I must agree with the South Carolina reviewer below, the good Baroness has a monarchy fixation. &quot;The CURS! How DARE they revolt against the good and wonderful French monarchy! Let them eat cake! ARRGGHHH!&quot;And her prose is a bitty bitty bit over the top. SIR PERCY IS GREAT AND CHAUVELIN IS EVIL AS WELL AS UGLY AS WELL AS STUPID! Did I mention Sir Percy is the best?Well, that said, this book has two things going for it:1- the compelling character of Sir Percy (NOT Percival like they say in all the movies, JUST Percy) He's marvelous, demmed marvelous. He is just so absolutely fun, you can forget about everything else.2- The ending. I won't give it away but it is SO cool!Here's an interesting theory that I must reveal to the world. Told from a different point of view, Citizen Chauvelin would be the good guy. Think about it. The ci-devant aristos who are responsible for starving the peasants, raping the women, enslaving the populace and growing fat off the land are escaping with the help of a shadowing foreign spy. It's up to Chauveln, brilliant investigator to catch him.Bottom line, if the Baroness had only allowed her characters to stand on their own merits, there would have been a great duel of wills but she is not satisfied at this, she has to force Sir Percy to win when it would have been more interesting if he had struggled for it.Worth the read if you like that sort of thing"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I loved this book when I was a teenager. Back then I still believed in honor, love, and marriage. I still believed that I'd make a mark upon the world. Though Baroness Orczy's THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL still stands the time of almost 40 years since I last read the book; I have changed. I no longer believe in love nor will I leave my mark upon the world -save my son and two young grandchildren. I am almost too old to have adventures, now that I am in the autumn of my life. I leave the 5 star rating to the young, and keep the 4 star rating for the hope my youthful memories give me. Yet, that pleases me. I abhor regret.Originally published for the stage in 1930, the Baroness takes the reader back to the French Revolution when Marie Antoinette presumably said, \\"Let them eat.\\" Madame Guillotine is feeding ravishingly on entire French families, and one man is determined to stop the bloodshed. His calling card is known to his followers and those men, women, and children now living in England: the five petal red flower. The Scarlet Pimpernel is a good choice. The mysterious man, known by that name, secrets these innocent French subjects from imminent bloodshed to the blossom of a new life in England. But the ruthless French Agent Chauvelin relentlessly pursues the enigmatic Pimpernel.Enter the beautiful, but feckless, Lady Blakeney. Marguerite has already helped Chauvelin dispose of the marquis and his aristocratic family, much to the disdain of Lord Blakeney. Even colder towards his wife, he and her brother are more determined to complete their work in France. Realizing, the danger she has put the two men in, Marguerite follows them to France. Her actions after all have had unintended consequences and she must find Percy and her brother before two men become Madame Guillotine's next meal. The cat and mouse chase is on and Marguerite loves again the man she has sharpened her wit upon. There is so much more to Lord Blakeney than meets the eye."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I normally write long reviews, but I think I already said everything I need to say. This is a great story, and it will stick with you. I still smile when I think about it. I'm smiling right now, actually.The problem with the book is that it takes very long to get into. My mother gave up, and she can normally make it past these things. I was determined to read it, and once the plot actually started, I didn't want to put it down. The book's not that long, which makes it easier to manage than some classics.I DO recommend the book. I couldn't give it 5 stars, but it is honestly exciting. Who is the Scarlet Pimpernel? I would be cruel if I told you."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"The 1999 Audio Book produced by Brilliance Corporation and read by Michael Page truly does justice to Baroness Orczy's classic adventure / romance.Note: this version does require use of a stereo cassette player with full balance control (or a special adaptor for a personal stereo player with headphones) The total length is approximately 8 hours, however, due to the recording method, only 3 cassette tapes are used.Michael Page does a masterful job of reading and bringing the characters to life. The voice of each character is unique and identifiable. His accents and pronunciations are authentic enough to add to the story rather than to detract. His narrative voice is very pleasant and listenable.The details of this nearly 100 year old story are well covered in other reviews, and the story is thoroughly enjoyable to read. However, for those who prefer or require audio books, this is a highly recommended version of this enduring classic."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"It is most unfortunate that I must disagree with the vast majority of the reviewers of this book, as I had high hopes for it after hearing it compared to the work of Dumas. I was rather disappointed with The Scarlet Pimpernel, however, as I found it to be of rather mediocre quality. It was rather unpolished compared to Dumas, which is surprising considering the haste with which Dumas penned his numerous volumes. The Scarlet Pimpernel is simply not nearly as fun and exciting as either Dumas, Stevenson, Shellabarger, or Sabatini (the other swashbuckling authors). What I found most unappealing about it was Orczy's apparent underestimation of the reader. The first three quarters of the book is obviously supossed to leave the reader guessing as to the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel, but it was rather easy to guess who it was early on in the book, and by the half-way point it was so blatantly obvious that no one could conceivably be surprised by the much-hyped discovery of the hero towards the end of the book. Add to this the over-the-top melodrama and frequently cheesy dialogue and you have the makings of an average adventure novel.Some may think that I have been harsh with this book. That may be so, but if it is it is because I am so shocked that others dare favorably compare this to the masterpieces of Dumas, or to the great Zorro writings of McCulley. Orczy is not a terrible writer, but it is rather outrageous to compare her to the great swashbuckler authors. She is almost entirely missing the raw spirit of adventure present in others, and this spirit is at the very heart of the adventures of those like Dumas. For me there was no point in this book where I was entheusiastically turning the pages, eager to find out what would happen to the main character, following with glee each turn of events. This is not at all because the main character is female. It is because the main character is not the hero, and is not even adventuresome. To be quite frank, she is rather boring until toward the very end of the book, and even then she does not endear herself to the reader in the manner of a D'Artagnan or an Edmond Dantes. There are no supporting characters worthy of comparison to Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. Even the villains are rather boring (not to mention wooden), leaving us with little to really care about in this book. I think author's intended \\"hook\\" was supossed to be the mystery about who the Scarlet Pimpernel is, but this was entirely lost by the half-way point, so I found the last half of the book rather unremarkable.The most redeeming merit of this book is not its enjoyability, but its historical significance. The dual persona of the hero was the inspiration for further variations on the theme, beginning with McCulley's Zorro in the early 20th century and subsequent rise of superheros. It is hard to imagine that such a motif is so recent, but we really do have Orczy to thank for that, and I am truly grateful, for The Mark of Zorro is one of my favorite books. Beyond that, however, my advice is to stick to Dumas, Stevenson, Shellabarger, and Sabatini. They are all far better than this.Overall grade: C+"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I have loved this book since i was 12 when i first read it - it gives you a close look at the French revolution - sure it is a bit sappy in parts but all in all a very good read !!!!!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Having read this book roughly 4 times now,I can fully back the review of 5 stars. It is by far the best tale of Revolutionary France that I've ever read. Sir Percy's foppish tendencies keep the reader entertained while Chauvelin chases after him,adding much suspense. Percy's love, Marguerite, is who every girl would like to be. She is famed, beautiful,and wife to the swashbuckley and elusive Scarlet Pimpernel. Of course,one cannot forget the abundance of run-ins with Madame la Guillotine! I highly recommend reading this book, no matter what your usual preference of literature may be.

I've pretty well read them all--from the classics by Scott, Dumas, Forster, Stevenson, and Sabatini to the more obscure (but great) works by Costain and Shellaburger to more contemporary novels like those by Perez-Reverte. Two of them, though, have always stood above the rest. One is Hope'sThe Prisoner of Zenda (Penguin Red Classics). The other, of course, is Baroness Orczy's The Scarlet Pimpernel.This is the story of Sir Percy, an English aristocrat who's known in public life as a fool, who secretly works to save French aristocrats. The story is told by his wife Marguerite, from whom he has been somewhat estranged, and who is gradually learning the truth of who she's married and who is learning to fall in love with her husband.There are many things to love about the novel. There's the mystery, as you gradually discover who the Scarlet Pimpernel is and how he carries out his rescues. There's the adventure, as Marguerite finds herself caught up in a perilous, and surprisingly suspenseful, rescue herself. Most of all, there's the romance, of a kind that's approached in a different direction from most swashbucklers (after all, they're already married at the beginning of the story, just not in love). The narration, told from Marguerite's perspective, is quite affecting.I'll admit, as have many reviewers, that the novel can be slow to get going. But it takes off soon enough, and the rest of the story is well worth the beginning thirty pages or so. The Scarlet Pimpernel is, in the end, one of the great swashbucklers ever written."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This was such a great book that it has found itself on my re-reads for the October,the finest month.

For one I was hooked and I couldn&#65533;t stop enjoying the first few chapters. I had never read a book about anything that happened in France.The book is about the early years of the French Revolution where the common people where cutting the heads off all of the aristocrats. The aristocrats fled for their lives to neighboring countries. Most going to England. Then a man whose identity is unknown comes and takes these aristocrats to England using the most brilliant in ideas to outsmart the French army.However, the book then shifts to England.

Our teacher said that it wasnt really the same as the book so out of curiosity I bought the book and read it. I read it in 2 days it was amazing, i just couldn't put it down. The romance almost makes you want to cry. and the adventure is very fun. But i must say that my favoite part of it was the humor. At some parts i just could not stop laughing. Sir Percy is just the funnyest person i have ever encountered in my reading."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Of the books of it's kind The Scarlet Pimpernel is one of the best in my opinion. When the thrillers and pschological novels of our time drag you down, pick up this classic. For good, old-fashioned adveture and romance- the foundation of any enduring tale- this is the one to read."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This is a wonderful book, and I definitely intend to read it over and over again (I must've read this 50 times already!) My romance with this book started at the age of nine, and after all these years, I STILL LOVE IT! This is one of my all time favorites, and a definite recommended read! The balance of humor, adventure, and romance make this book unforgettable and the blend of characters are better than jane austen even! I guarantee you that you won't forget this tale once you read it. As for myself, i'm in love with Sir Percy, the hero of this book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"I read the Scarlet Pimpernel last year during summer vacation and have read it at least fifty times since! It is a nice sweet romance with a load of adventure and suspense! The Jane Seymour version of the movie is the closest to the book. I hope everyone will read and enjoy this book as much as I did!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This book is a great adventure story, but I found it very dry and overly-Romantic.The characters are less than two-dimensional. Marguerite is stunningly beautiful, talented, and rich. She's also named the cleverest woman in Europe. She thinks her husband a foolish imbecile whom she ridicules in front of others. On finding out his identity, all of a sudden she's madly in love. I couldn't help but dislike her. You'll get really tired by the hundredth time Orczy refers to Marguerite's 'womanly instinct', her 'woman's heart', or her 'woman's wits'! It's so stereotypical. Chauvelin is a silly, evil little scary-looking man. Sir Percy is most tolerable of these, I suppose.Although you can guess 'who wins', the plot itself is unpredictible. The climax was quite a surprise, I think, entirely unexpected. But it all comes to what you knew it would from page 1. It's just fun to read, nothing more. The events will keep you hooked and interested. The best thing about the book is the historical and political background, the mixed political views, providing much tension and intrigue in the story.The language is unimpressive. I know it's just an adventure-romance, but I've read other books of that genre with much more literary merit and character depth. If you like sophisticated classics don't read this book. If you're just looking for something fun and suspenseful, I highly recommend reading it. It's enjoyable, and I suppose we must give Orczy some credit for writing the first masked-hero adventure."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Well I'm in the middle of reading this book for a second time. Oh my gosh... if you haven't read this yet then there is not much that i can say because i'll end up telling you the whole story and then ruining the ending for you. Let's just say it's totally intense toward the end. But in the beginning and end I keep waiting for tiems when you can witness Percy and his foppish ways. It's so cute!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"To those who complain that the book is not historically accurate, note that Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind is also not historically accurate. Neither book is intended to be an accurate rending of history. They are both intended to be romance stories, adventure stories. If you are looking for historical accuracy, look elsewhere. But if you are looking for an exciting, romantic, breathtaking novel, then look no further than the Scarlet Pimpernel."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Don't be surprised if this appears on a required reading list somewhere in your education. This book is recommended by educators on lists that students love to hate, but it is surprisingly wonderful. I enjoyed the suspense in the scenes and the variety of characters. The reader knows exactly what's going on, but is eager to find out how the characters react. I highly recommend this bok for anyone looking for adventure or suspense in a book."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This review is directed primarily to ladies.This is a great book, girls! It starts out real gory, but hang in there (no pun intended), it will turn into an incredible romance.About 20 years ago, a college friend urged me to read the Scarlet Pimpernel. I read the first few pages and was so horrified by the bloodshed that I did not read further. That was a big mistake.After I graduated, I spotted the unabridged book in a CHILDREN's section of a library. What!? I checked it out and after I read past the first chapter or two, the story was so wonderful that I've been recommending it ever since.The first few gory pages set the scene. After you get through that the story develops into an amazing romance with lots of adventure.Warning: if you expect this book to end like the movie with Jane Seymour in it, it doesn't. The movie ending is actually the ending of one of the Scarlet Pimpernel sequels.This book has an OK ending, but if you want to read the dramatic ending that the movie has, you will also have to read one of the sequels, too--only I don't remember exactly which one it was.From what I remember the Baroness's husband helped her write the story and you can see his hand in it, I think, which really makes a great story. There are elements in it that are really action-packed and then there are the tender scenes. All nicely done, not too syrupy.This is a great book. Go for it. Read it, then the sequels. Also, I liked both versions of the movie. The old black and white with Leslie Howard and then the more modern version with Jane Seymore."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Torn between love for her brother and her husband, Lake Blakeney is tortured by doubt and guilt during the autumn of 1792--a turbulent year for France and her English sympathizers. Members of the hated French nobility (sacres aristos!) are ruthlessly hunted down, incarcerated, then executed to the jeers of the abused masses--grisly fodder for Madame Guillotine. Regardless of the justice or injustice of their fate, readers are treated to a gripping tale of vicious schemes, clever counterplots, and international intrigue. A band of 19 English aristocrats pledge life and loyalty to their audacious and ingenious leader, known cryptically by his signature flower: the Scarlet Pimpernel. This band of disguised heroes undertakes to rescue the doomed French nobility from the insatiable jaws of the Reign of Terror.Hounded by foxlike Chauvelin, the merciless agent for the bloodthirsty Republic, the Scarlet Pimpernel is walking into a fiendish trap--unwittingly set in motion by his own, unsuspecting wife, who does not realize his true personoa behind his foppish mask. The distraught woman, a former actress at the Comedie Francaise, is forced to make intolerable choices by her implacable foe who stalks her happiness, tirelessly pursuing theshadowy trail of the daring Pimpernel. How much emotional torture can a woman endure in such a short time? Once she tumbles onto the truth about her sham marriage, she realizes that the heart she scorned is truly a prize worth earning--even dying for! Romance, lust for political power, and duels of wit mark this fast-paced novel of intrigue set in the French Revolution on both shores of the Channel. This is a spy swashbuckler without the usual swordplay; instead, readers enjoy a lightning exchange of rapier wits, while two hearts struggle to deny their true passion."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"Baroness Orzcy has written an amazing book of bravery, faith, and secrecy of the elusive Scarlet Pimpernel.

I loved it sooo much! I would recommend this book to anyone!!"},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"This is probably the first spy thriller stories ever. The story is good enough, but it devolves (?) into a romance in the later chapters.The time is that of the French revolution during the Reign of Terror. An Englishman has been helping aristocrats escape/ He is beiong sought by the French authorities not only because he is helping those who the authorities consider traitors or enemies of France, but also because he taunts them with little notes left to be found after the deed is done and each with athe picture of a scarlet pimpernel, a flower from England. The story is of one more escapade that the Scarlet Pimpernel dares, only this time his wife is mixed up in it.As an American, I am not partial to aristocrats, but I am also not partial to killing people for little of no reason, so this story gets me to thinking of what the situation entailed and how to resolve it without killing and without sucking up to aristocrats. In the heat of the moment, the French people had no concern but for revenge or animosity for the aristocrats. This was well borne out by Margaret Blakely, the heroine, whose brother was beaten by lackeys of an aristocrat. Yet she later regretted the action because she abhorred the killing that ensued.I listened to this from a recording my Librevox. The recording was really well done. There were very good, if not professional, actors speaking the parts of the characters, laughing and chortling, etc., as called upon in the story. This separation of narrator and characters got a bit strange because when the quotes are broken into two parts by a 'she said' or some such, the narrator interrupted the dialog with those words. Usually the reader, doing all the parts, makes it a seamless translation between spoken and written. It is weird to listen to this, becoming more of a radio play crossed with a book reading."},{"Title":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","review":"The book itself is one of the very best classics out there, but there have been enough reviews and analysis written about the story, the writer, the sequels, and the characters.

I read the original years ago but only recently discovered that Orczy had written numerous sequels, and I'm enjoying every one!

HOWEVER, NO ONE COULD MISTAKE IT FOR A MASTERPIECE. WRITTEN BY AN EXILED HUNGARIAN ROYAL, Baroness Emma Orczy, THE STORY IS AN HISTORICAL ADVENTURE STORY TAKING PLACE DURING THE REIGN OF TERROR A FEW YEARS AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. IT IS A SLIGHT TALE, AND A LOT OF FUN TO READ. THE CHARACTERS ARE ONE DIMENSIONAL AND EXAGGERATED: THE VILLAINS ARE ESPECIALLY EVIL, AND THE HEROES ARE ESPECIALLY HEROIC. THERE IS CONTINUOUS ACTION, WHICH MAKES THIS BOOK FUN, ENTERTAINING AND A NICE DIVERSION FROM SERIOUS LITERATURE."},{"Title":"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas","review":"It's curious that so many reviewers identify so uncritically with those who walk away. I think that is the base-note of the story - having enough wit to see wrong but not enough imagination/courage to change it.A friend of mine teaches this story in college. There is a goose-bump moment when one student comprehends why the story is named what it is and what it is actually naming. The ones who walk away are defined not by their refusal to be cruel but by their refusal to do anything about it."},{"Title":"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas","review":"This short story place the reader in front of a fantastic city of happiness. However, this is not a fairy tale, and if only you go deeper (no great effort, I ensure you, as this is the goal of the writer) you will start wondering about the sense of happiness and sorrow, good and evil, life and death. There is no simple explaination of these themes, nor a simple corrispondence between fictional and real conceps. If you need an explanation, this is not the place to look. But if you want a suggestion, read this story, because it's worth it."},{"Title":"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas","review":"This is a story that haunts you long after you've read it and after you think you've forgotten it.

It is really unlike anything I ever read. It's been nearly two decades since I've read this and I remember it clearly. It is profound and accurately describes a horrific flaw in human nature. It is also a story that I don't think people can truly grasp until adulthood.After reading this story, my teacher had the class discuss what they would have done if they had been part of this society. Everyone in class stated that they would have left as they would have felt too guilty knowing that their happiness was a result of one person's suffering. Nobody seemed to realize that walking away did nothing to ease the suffering of the child.Not one person mentioned that they would take the effort to change things. It's really not all that different in real life. Our world has so much suffering so a select few can live comfortable lives. We all turn our backs to it since we can't see it. We hear stories about blood diamonds, slavery, child labor, etc. What's even worse is that there are people who refuse to step forward when the suffering is right in front of them. People refuse to help our homeless, fail to report child abuse, blame victims, etc."},{"Title":"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas","review":"There is no need to spend huge amounts of money to read the book, unless having a bound copy is important to you.

I believe we are, to some extent the people in Omelas. Every time we drive by the homeless, every time we walk by the sick, every time we oooh and ahhh about something we see on television. But we still walk away. I think many people think that the people who walk away are the honorable ones in the story. I whole heartedly disagree.

In the end, however, those who choose to leave do so because, I imagine, the happiness of others is eliminated from the equation.

I am sure it's worth 5 stars, though.But, I strongly recommend the inspiration for it, as acknowledged by LeGuin herself: the chapter Rebellion (or Mutiny) depending on the translation, in Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov. This precedes the chapter \\"The Grand Inquisitor.\\" I have both of them on my website in PDF format: http: [...]As LeGuin tells it somewhere, her title was taken from a road sign seen in a rear view mirror as she left Salem, Oregon.

What a weird story. It's hard to follow at some points but it's short enough for you to be able to read it a couple times in order to get it.

Her children must have felt so comforted to have this book to guide them in their lives as well. And I would imagine what a treasure this would have been to hand to a new bride as she started her life with her husband. Lydia M.

Are your children full of shenanigans? Well, this is the book for you!Okay, modern American women may not be able to relate (because we aren't just housewives anymore and because of technology), but Mrs. Childs does have matter-of-fact advice that many of us need to pay attention to. For example, she speaks positively of education being the foundation for all children, and she also speaks of assigning children chores (what are those?) to complete with their brothers and sisters (because other children can or may be bad influences if they have nothing to occupy their time). I enjoyed how she spoke of living under our means, which is something that we rarely do in a world full of credit cards and 0% financing for blah, blah number of months. She believes that sickness should be the only \\"extra\\" spent out of the strict budget.With this being said, I would have enjoyed reading this better if the information was better organized (I read about preserving eggs and her trip to the mechanic all in one paragraph).

It is, without doubt, THE best book of its kind.The American Frugal Housewife is fascinating on a variety of levels, not the least in that Child wrote the book with the emphasis on &quot;AMERICAN.&quot; Other such books existed at the time, but they were written in England and for English women. Child was one of the Transcendentalists who were huge advocates of personal self-discipline and restraint, but believed to their core the importance of fighting for what they knew to be right. It wasn't just a religious fervor -although Child's Christianity, like that of Catherine and Harriet Beecher Stowe, was extremely important - but a belief that the still relatively new United States had a unique destiny that set it apart from the rest of the world, specifically the old, decrepit world that was Europe.Child was no blindfolded nationalist, however. She saw the flaws and contradictions that bound the new Republic. Child, like many other Transcendentalists, was a fervent abolitionist and a proponent of women's equality, and worked all her life toward achieving those ends. Even with its problems, Child was an ardent American. She saw Americans as a unique race of people with a unique and powerful destiny. Americans, she believed, were new and unique, and that the American destiny was far different from the degenerate, rotting hulk of Old World Europe.So what does all this have to do with the American Frugal Housewife? Well, Child wrote the book specifically to address AMERICAN houswives and what she knew to be their unique problems and issues. It's much more than just a recipe book; it embodies Child's philosophy that the only way toward virtue was self-restraint and sobriety, and that the way to tutor the new nation in these values was by teaching the nation's housewives - the hand that rocks the cradle, Child believed, did indeed rule the world.The new nation was becoming prosperous, and Child saw that then, like now, people had a difficult time learning how to restrain themselves financially. One part in particular has to do with how mothers should raise their daughters. Child believed they should teach their offspring the virtues of frugality, that it was better to put savings &quot;out at interest&quot; and earn wealth from it, then to indulge in the latest fad - one in this case being something called a Brussels carpet. As new brides went out to set up their household, Child lectures at how they drive their husbands to bankruptcy by embracing fads and trying to keep up with the Joneses.Other, cheaper types of carpet &quot;will answer just as well,&quot; Child wrote. She also recommends using cheap illustrations, nicely framed, as wall art, rather than going overboard to buy the latest European style.Some of the best sections are on frugality. Child was the &quot;Hints from Heloise&quot; queen of her day, and she's got a solution for everything that could possibly beset the early 19th century housewife. The interesting thing, as others have noted, is how so many of her tips still work so well.I don't know that I'm ever going to need her instructions on how to brew my own soap in a backyard kettle or how to keep my homemade pickles in a barrel from turning soft, but I did get a burn mark out of an antique chest by using rottenstone and oil, just as she prescribed.What's rottenstone, you ask? Well, you can buy it at a hardware store, but if you want the recipe, buy the book! It's a fantastic window on early American life, but the sound advice inside, about not getting into debt and how to &quot;do up&quot; your brass so it doesn't tarnish, is still amazingly useful.I guarantee you'll become a Child fan, just like me! :)"},{"Title":"The American frugal housewife: Dedicated to those who are not ashamed of economy","review":"I bought this book at a Revolutionar War event this past weekend and I've read it 3 times already (Purchased Sunday, and it's now Tuesday morning).

It is not well for the purses and patience of parents; and it has astill worse effect on the morals and habits of the children. Begin early is the greatmaxim for everything in education.

Everything from porridges to cows brains, herbed wines to pies.STEWED PRUNES.Stew them very gently in a small quantity of water till stones slip out. Physiciansconsider them safe nourishment in fevers.BEANS AND PEAS.Baked beans are a very simple dish, yet few cook them well. They should be put in coldwater, and hung over the fire, the night before they are baked. In the morning, theyshould be put in a colander, and rinsed two or three times; then again placed in akettle, with the pork you intend to bake, covered with water, and kept scalding hot, inhour or more. A pound of pork is quite enough for a quart of beans, and that is a largedinner for a common family. The rind of the pork should be slashed. Pieces of pork alter-nately fat and lean, are the most suitable ; the cheeks are the best. A little peppersprinkled among the beans, when they are placed in the bean-pot, will render them lessunhealthy. They should be just covered with water, when put into the oven ; and the porkshould be sunk a little below the surface of the beans. Bake three or four hours.THE SKINNY:::To be perfectly honest, there is some sound advice here. Some of it inspired by Ben Franklin, and some of it coming from friends and articles read by the author.I found this an absolutely fascinating book that gives some wonderful insight into the daily life of early American families. We get to see what the concerns of housewives were, and how life was lived amongst a class of people -- the less well-off -- that is frequently overlooked by historical studies.Ms. Child was born in 1802. She was raised by a strict Calvinist father and later she married a lawyer who proved to be an improvident dreamer who at times was imprisoned for his debts. As a consequence she knows frugality quite well.The American Frugal Housewife is extremely well written, and was extremely well received at the time it was first put up for sale. In fact, it was republished 27 times between 1835 and 1841.I HIGHLY recommend this work to students of history and those who are interested in early American life.As for the \\"Kindle\\" format, I must say that this particular version comes with 'highlights', some of which are definitions. These are easy to access or ignore. (Which is why I can't tell you what they all are.) Being a FREE book it's hard to complain, but I should note that there are images from the original book that don't appear in the Kindle copy. They pertain to the parts of animals -- rumps, chops, etc.-- and aren't particularly valuable. But if you are curious you can find them at GoogleBooks and Archive-dot-org, both of whom have their own free copies.ASIN: B002RKTKXOPam T~pageinhistory"},{"Title":"The American frugal housewife: Dedicated to those who are not ashamed of economy","review":"Both the prose and the basic philosophy espoused by this book are refreshing on todays palate. No over-wrought writing or get ahead mentality here. The book gives a wonderful view of household life in the 1800's, covering ground from pudding recipes to the best and cheapenst method for cleaning your candle stick holders and treating common ailments. Liberally spiced with the philosophy of a frugal housewife who's example many of us would do well to follow."},{"Title":"The American frugal housewife: Dedicated to those who are not ashamed of economy","review":"Great book, hard to put down.

I think some people might think this book has a few good ways to go green old fashioned if you're interested or off the grid or survival stuff or whatever (Just steer clear of the medical section. Fear Factor anyone?) but I think it is mostly useful as a historical reference. A great insight to logic back then. Still it was still fun to let your imagination run wild dreaming of doing some of these things. Also if you are going to do some reading about history why not go directly to the source on that particular subject? The chapter on raiseing girls was very modern in some suprising ways, I expected a sit down and be quite chapter but thats not what I got. For the price I think it was worth it."},{"Title":"The American frugal housewife: Dedicated to those who are not ashamed of economy","review":"I really love this book. It probably would be a stretch for the typical mid-class to high class family, but for those who love to be frugal it's wonderful!

It teaches you to appreciate a simple life."},{"Title":"The American frugal housewife: Dedicated to those who are not ashamed of economy","review":"Here is a book that was worth reprinting. Much of the joy lies in the relating of family events that occurred at its time in history. For example, children learned about growing up by participating in some adult activities (working at knitting scarves and making placemats that would benefit the whole family.) The greater lesson was, of course, learning their own importance in society. Furthermore, in a world where the future has become more uncertain than usual, this book reminds us that our ancestors did not have the conveniences of prepared foods like mayonnaise and jello but that with a minimum of research we can duplicate the same goodness. I smiled from cover to cover."},{"Title":"The American frugal housewife: Dedicated to those who are not ashamed of economy","review":"I purchased this through Kindle, and found myself unable to put the book down. It gives a great look into the tasks and challenges of the early American homemaker, but the best part of the book is her wisdom interspersed throughout the book. Her philosophy on life, on economical methods, on raising children all ring true with what has gone wrong with our current environment. Brilliant book.

People in villages or living in the country at that time would still have stored their foods for winter in the same way as this book advises.

It has quickly become a staple reading selection amongst my friends and family.

What this means is that the emphasis is placed on observations. There is not much of extravagance, often arising from the glamorized life style of ballplayers. Rather, it is the unglamorized side of stories that interests us in this book. This is an academic writing (though very readable), and as such it might look like a little dry read, except on a few occasions like when Gmelch, with his old teammates, reminisces his own days as a ballplayer back in the 60's, and writing about such highly emotional events as the release of a minor leaguer.The stories are told mostly from interviews of various people involved in the game, such as players, managers, scouts, people in management, wives of players, and even groupies. Being a former ballplayer himself, Gmelch does not miss those questions that would naturally arise from any curious baseball fans. Also it enables him to have comparative views on how things have changed from the days when he actually played, e.g., the increased role of money and the improved, yet somewhat less camaraderie-oriented (for the lack of better words) conditions surrounding minor leaguers.Despite being an observer, Gmelch obviously can relate deeply to players, having gone through similar emotional up's and down's himself. After learning how much the players need to go through before only few among them eventually climb up to the topmost echelon of the baseball world, I came to find myself accepting of players being lavishly paid (still don't want another strike, though), especially considering that in many other outrageously paid occupations like cooperate CEO's and entertainers, breed, luck, and/or connection may play much greater roles than sheer skills, for which others are paying. That is the extent to which you would come to feel like rooting both for those who flourish in the glory of the major league and for those whose dream ends up being shattered after tremendous hard work and stiff competitions.The purpose of this work, of course, is not to sensationalize or sentimentalize, so it is understandable that the tone of the narrative throughout the book is reserved to an extent, despite that many stories can be emotionally involved. For me, that takes something away from this highly interesting work. This is probably an unfair criticism from a student, being tired of reading too much academic work in an ivory tower. No wonder that two of the chapters I like most deal with players with unfulfilled dreams, including that of young Gmelch.I highly recommend this book to those who wish to view ballplayers as human beings, just like us."},{"Title":"INSIDE PITCH","review":"The Inside Pitch by George Gmelch is one of the best baseball books I have ever read.

I found Gmelch's book to be rather disappointing. While it could've been more involving and presented the sport in the gawdy light it deserves, I found that Gmelch trivialized Baseball. He was repetitive in his ideas and analysis; furthermore, his analysis was not at all insightful by any stretch of the imagination. It simply seemed that he stated the obvious, skimming over the wondrous moments he must have experienced during his journeys. In the end, Gmelch does not really say anything worthy of publication. Any Baseball fan already knows much of what is in this book, and did not have to travel the country interviewing dozens of amateur and professional ballplayers of varying ranks to discover this information. If you want to read a book that will REALLY incite you to see Baseball in an entirely different light, and make you appreciate just how magical this game can be, read A.

Bellevue points out that almost all seeing is self-taught, and as with any other motor skill, can be trained and developed to an optimal peak of performance. Improvement can actually be great enough to make contact lenses and vision defect corrective eyeglasses unnecessary. Through suggested skill building techniques, often dramatic improvements can be made for such conditions as nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, decreasing vision associated with advancing age, and more. Improve Your Eyesight basically updates the classic &quot;Bates Method&quot; with applications drawn from the latest and most up to date optical research. Four complete vision therapy programs are provided, plus guidelines to customizing a program for the individual reader's needs.

You just rotate your eyeball and neck. That's it.The video is also useless for the exercise (3). It just displays a small dot moving on the TV screen and you track it with your eyes. Nothing more. Moreover, since it is a video on TV screen, the displays are very flickering so the exercise (3) will only give you eye strain."},{"Title":"Improve Your Eyesight : Vision Therapy Eye Exercises--Updates Bates Method (1 Hour & 30 Minute Video and Eye Chart Included)","review":"For what it's worth, I'm an optometrist and the optics in the eye can't be altered by muscles (unless we're talking about accommodation). If my camera is out of focus it's the optics. That's why glasses and contact lenses are used...to correct the optics. I'd be leery of anyone who rates this book at five stars. They probably have a vested interest or they are into mind games because the laws of light are not altered by muscles.Now, if a person who removes their correction (glasses/contacts) they may be able to squint and see better. That is done by limiting off axis rays and only allowing a narrow band of light to enter through the pupil. Again, muscles in the eye didn't affect the optics, only the beam of light was limited. Please....educate yourself on science if you want to know the truth."},{"Title":"El Gaucho","review":"I think Pratt and Manara are the Italian dream-team of comics. The detailed but light drawing style of Manara fits perfectly Pratt's great historic pieces. I wish Pratt was alive to complete a trilogy that started with Indian Summer and continued with el Gaucho."},{"Title":"El Gaucho","review":"If you expect a book about sex and people, this ain't it. This is pretty much just a story about soldiers in the wooden ships and muskets age, with some women thrown in for bonadage slave sentiment, with a few sex scenes - those mostly sordid. The art is okay. See his other titles for truely sexy books - Gullevera is a quick, neat, sexy, fairly clean romp for adults who like naked women but also enjoy women who aren't always naked."},{"Title":"El Gaucho","review":"Milo Manara is one of the greatest italian artist. He is a famous illustrator and his fine touch can transform simple pieces of paper into sweet and fantastic dreams. But with Hugo Pratt you can see the real Manara, his love for history and adventures, for poetry and prose, for every kind of art. Don't miss this masterpiece!"},{"Title":"El Gaucho","review":"You could just pick the up the book, browse and enjoy the art of Manara.After you settle down, the story is engaging and it makes you feel for the characters: Tom Browne, an english drummer boy; Molly Malone, an irish prostitute; Matthew the hunchback and Aureliana, an argentinian girl.All these while Argentina dreams of freedom from Spain and the British empire profits from it.Manara does superb art, teasing the eye while Pratt keeps the story going.A must have for Manara lovers!"},{"Title":"El Gaucho","review":"I have always enjoyed the marvelous line of Manara; it's so simple yet exquisite. And admittedly this is my first experience with anything by Pratt. The story has a lot of potential given the setting and the characters, and moves along rather well, but everything sure seems to end abruptly. So, I enjoyed it, but it shouldn't be rated 5 stars."},{"Title":"Pick of the Bunch : New Zealand Wildflowers","review":"I thought from the title that this book was on native wildflowers of New Zealand. I was partially right. It has a lot of information on plants introduced from all over the world and only a few pages on the alpine section of this wonderful part of the world. I found no useful information in it at all and returned it after a thorough but quick look. Don't waste your time or money.I also ordered &quot;Gardener's Encyclopedia of New Zealand Native Plants&quot; by Yvonne Cave and Valda Paddison. It was all on native plants and had wonderful photographs and information. Get that book instead. I loved it.

Plato is often obscure, Xenophon can be boring. But Homer, though he writes in an artificial dialect, is always clear, always engaging, and has the advantage of being the fountain of Greek literature. Schoder's textbook, like Clyde Pharr's, is an attempt to bring the best of Greek literature to the beginning student. Volume One is devoted to the basics of Greek grammar and begins with Book 9 of the Odyssey. Volume Two rounds out the grammar and continues with selections from the Iliad. A student who has worked through both volumes will be ready to read the Greek lyric poets and begin reading prose with Herodotus. Classicists, in their conservative desire to begin with &quot;good Attic,&quot; are usually wary of such an approach, but are probably secretly envious of students who can begin at the beginning, and with the best. The transition to reading Attic is not difficult, and Schoder provides some guidelines on how to make the switch. The student who gives up his or her studies after working through this method will go away feeling satisfied, and can dabble in Homer with ease. The only caveat is that this book has frequent misprints, so it would be advisable for the independent student to check the paradigms and exercises with a good lexicon (Cunliffe's is best for general purposes)and the paradigms in Clyde Pharr's textbook as well, which has fewer misprints (but is otherwise not as user-friendly). The format is clear and attractive. The text is generously supplied with photos of Greek monuments and artworks. An inspirational quote stands at the beginning of each lesson, usually from a historical figure (e.g. Thomas Jefferson, Oliver Wendell Holmes) about the joys and benefits of learning Greek. An excellent and adventurous way to approach Greek for the high school or college student."},{"Title":"Homeric Greek II: 002 (Reading Course in Homeric Greek)","review":"update: The publisher has made the first eighty pages (which go up to the middle of Chapter 24) of this book available as a free sample to download, on their website \\"pullins dot com.\\" So you can order the book now and start studying today with the free sample while you wait for your hard copy to arrive."},{"Title":"Homeric Greek II: 002 (Reading Course in Homeric Greek)","review":"As others have mentioned, you need book 1 first. It took me about a year to track it down, but I did find eventually.The strong point of this book is that there are a lot of exercises. Your vocabulary really gets a good work-out.On the down-side, the book was written assuming that students would have a teacher, so important things like the difference between the aorist and the imperfect are handled in only one paragraph.The other issue I have is that a lot of the exercises are drawn from the New Testament, which is Koine Greek, and translated into the Homeric dialect. This is a bit like a Latin course giving quotes from Dante translated into classical Latin--sure, it can be done, but it makes more sense to use the original language. (Other exercises are drawn from Plato, Aristotle, et al, also not Homeric, but not as distant as Koine)"},{"Title":"Homeric Greek II: 002 (Reading Course in Homeric Greek)","review":"This is the second book, but it there doesn't seem to mention of that.

I finished \\"Thai For Beginners\\" and \\"Thai For Intermediate Learners\\" and I still had trouble with this course.The book has vocabulary and stories / essays which uses the vocabulary. The Cd's, though, only have the stories / essays on them. That makes it difficult to insure you are pronouncing the words correctly. If you make it to this book, you should know how to read Thai. That will help you with decipher what tone the vocabulary should be and how to sound out the words. But, being a non-native speaker, I'm sure I'm still not saying the words like a native Thai speaker would.This book makes a large jump from \\"Thai for Intermediate Learners.\\" I think Mrs. Benjawan Poomsan Becker should write another book to bridge the gap.This is a good course for anyone who wants to learn more about Thailand, Thai people and their customs... And for those who would like to improve their Thai reading skills."},{"Title":"Thai for Advanced Readers","review":"*Thai for Advanced Readers* is a fairly good reader for lower-level intermediate students. It's got to be kept in mind that, for less frequently studied languages, \\"advanced\\" is used to describe non-native speakers whose abilities would still be considered fairly primitive in the major Western languages. This book could be a good stepping stone, but to what? There's still a vast amount of knowledge necessary before a person who had worked thru Becker's books could read a newspaper or short stories, but there don't seem to be any real materials for instruction in those skills. I don't know of any book, yet, that merits this volume's title."},{"Title":"Thai for Advanced Readers","review":"Thai for Advanced Readers is a huge jump in difficulty from the Intermediate book in this series. This book consists of several one to three page passages in Thai, followed by vocabulary relevant to the passage, and finally the translation in English.This book offers a lot to learn to anyone willing to put in the time. Personally speaking, about halfway through this book I noticed a jump in my reading speed and in my ability to \\"sight-read\\" words that I had never seen before.The book has a few drawbacks however. First, as I mentioned before, there is a huge jump in difficulty. If you read the beginner and intermediate books and are expecting the next step in the progression, forget it. This book should probably fall in a series of books oriented towards reading skills.The second issue I have with this book is overall effectiveness of it as a study resource. As much as I enjoyed the challenge of this book, I can't say the vocabulary stuck with me at all, nor did it do anything to improve my day to day Thai skills. Perhaps this is more fault of the student than the book but I thought it was fair to share my experience."},{"Title":"Thai for Advanced Readers","review":"I completed third-year Thai in graduate school, but still could not read a Thai newspaper article without looking up every other word. This book was a huge help; it really improved the ease of my reading. The audio CD (which I definitely recommend buying at the same time) is also a huge help with listening comprehension. The readings in this book are still a lot easier than most Thai newspaper articles, but they definitely helped me take a giant step forward in my Thai reading comprehension. If Ms. Becker would create another, more advanced reader that follows on from this one, I would be really thrilled."},{"Title":"Thai for Advanced Readers","review":"Worked through most of this book some time ago, and it is a great book.

The protagonists in this novel are well-developed and come across as real and admirable people with real feelings and flaws. Sizemore gives these real people real problems to deal with, so the book has a depth that is rare in the romance genre. It's also pretty hot(!) and has a great deal of humor. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"A catalog of the Coleoptera of America North of Mexico: Family Scarabaeidae, Subfamilies: Rutelinae and Dynastinae (Agriculture handbook)","review":"I gave this volume to a friend who had no experience of reading poetry (since school, that is), and had asked me what sort of poems he could start with. I pointed out a couple of poems that I thought were highlights, and wished him good luck. When I met up with him a week later, he burst into excited praise for the book. He'd started on the poems I had suggested, and rapidly proceeded to read the whole collection, several times over.I quite agree with his response - in my early 20s this was one of the books that got me excited in contemporary poets and poetry. While Walcott is not foremost an experimentalist - and he might at odd moments almost be thought a sentimentalist - his sheer joy of craft and wordsmithing is a beautiful, beautiful thing to behold. This book is one of those things that can remind you why life is worth living. It's that good."},{"Title":"A catalog of the Coleoptera of America North of Mexico: Family Scarabaeidae, Subfamilies: Rutelinae and Dynastinae (Agriculture handbook)","review":"That's the rueful observation of a poet from Saint Lucia born into a family of mixed race (Derek Walcott's two grandfathers were white; his two grandmothers were black). The economically disadvantaged from the Mediterranean can at least claim a literary heritage, but not those from the Caribbean. Walcott, who recently celebrated his 83rd birthday, has spent his career exploring the legacy of slavery and colonialism and the problems an intelligent and highly literate person of minority racial lineage (such as himself) faces in today's cosmopolitan world.THE ARKANSAS TESTAMENT is one of the two most noted books of Walcott's poetry, and it surely was instrumental in the Nobel Committee's decision to award him the Prize for Literature in 1992. It is divided into two nearly equal parts. The poems of the first part, entitled \\"Here\\", are set in Walcott's native Caribbean (many in Saint Lucia). For Walcott, it is a bittersweet homeland, to which he returns as an outsider:\\" * * * This is not the grape-purple Aegean.There is no wine here, no cheese, the almonds are green,the sea grapes bitter, the language is that of slaves.\\"The second part of the book is entitled \\"Elsewhere\\", and the various settings of its poems are, of course, outside the Caribbean, including Auschwitz, Germania of Roman times, Wales, Boston, California, and Arkansas. In many of these poems, too, our poisonous history of slavery looms large. In the last poem, which concerns an overnight stay in Fayetteville, Arkansas and whose title is also the title of the entire volume, there are these lines,\\"The original sin is our seed,and that acorn fans into an oak;the umbrella of Africa's shade,despite this democracy's mandates,still sprouts from a Southern streetthat holds grey black men in a stoop,their flintlock red eyes. * * *\\"\\"The Arkansas Testament\\", at fourteen pages, is the longest of the thirty-nine poems in the volume. Three of the poems are less than fourteen lines. Most of the poems are structured to some degree, and many of them feature rhyme, much of which is both subtle and creative. Several of the poems are formal quatrains. The craftsmanship is impressive. But the meaning of many of the poems is elusive. Some are clearly quite personal; others are freighted with literary or cultural references beyond my ken. Almost always I get the mood, but only occasionally do I get the meaning. Still, my reading of THE ARKANSAS TESTAMENT was sufficiently rewarding that I intend to return to it some day and maybe even explore other works by Walcott."},{"Title":"Braids and Bows: A Book of Instruction","review":"This book is the only reason I know how to braid.

It is great for learning how to do just about any kind of braid. It starts with easier stuff, like the garden-variety braid and pony-tail flips, so it works for someone with zero hair experience. It finishes up with fishtail braids, French braids and French ropes. The instructions are very clear, and the best part is that they show you just how to hold your hands. I never got the hang of French braids, but now I've mastered them.The only reason I give this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is slightly outdated in style. The publication date is 1992 and you will spot pictures of girls in floral dresses with white yokes and oversized button-down shirts with turtlenecks. But the hair techniques are still great and easily adaptable to other hairstyles. And most of the hairstyles are timeless, especially for young girls. (I don't know that I would wear a French braid myself.)The bow instructions are also neat. The book shows how to gather ribbon and wire it to barrettes in different styles such as rosettes and the \\"worm.\\" It also has ideas for more unusual barrettes.

It did not believe it was true but it was entertaining. I purchased this book because from the title \\"Hidalgo\\" I expected it to be about the movie. Instead I found a book that contained various writings of Frank Hopkins annotated by a group of people who were intent on trashing him. There was very little in the book about Hidalgo. Now Frank Hopkins led people to believe that his exploits were fact so I have no problem with anyone setting the record straight. However the manner in which this was done in this book was mean spirited, tasteless, rude, insensitive and showed a definite lack of character on the part of the authors. Both Frank Hopkins & his wife are dead and can't respond. So if you want a book about Hidalgo DON\\"T buy this one. If you want a book that trashes Frank Hopkins writings put together by some really mean spirited folks who seem to have an ax to grind this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Hidalgo and Other Stories","review":"I was unable to enjoy even a few pages of this book due to the constant interuptions of the \\"experts\\". I believe that these stories may be very interesting if only Mr. Hopkins were allowed to be read through. If the experts want to make their points they should publish their own book instead of ruining the flow of this one. Stories of the old west are just that. There are plenty of facts to be checked and many records that still exist. However, I find it hard to believe that every pony ride was documented in the paper or otherwise photographed, written about or published. What is so upsetting is that these experts seem to give absolutely no regard to the spoken word history. They even try to build up Buffalo Bill as a true hero when much of his legend comes from stories told to other people. I don't believe Mr. Hopkins was any kind of hero or everything he purports. Also, recollection is just that. We all have certain images from childhood that stand out more than others and memories tend to be emotionally driven. Let's not crucify the man because he glorified his own memories. I would have just liked to read his \\"stories\\" as written, not as interpreted by a bunch of academic experts.

I just wish that the people that made the movie would have done a little more reasurch before they said that it actually happened."},{"Title":"Hidalgo and Other Stories","review":"I bought this book because I am interested in the Old West, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.Frank Hopkins' writings read like a dime-store novel, and are entertaining in a highly implausible way. The footnotes are really interesting, and demonstrate without a shadow of a doubt that what Hopkins didn't make up, he took from books and other publications of his day.I am surprised to see some of the other reviews, which seem to be muddying the waters by telling everyone what fantastic horses Mustangs are! Maybe they are - they certainly have a great reputation for hardiness - but that has nothing to do with whether or not Hopkins wrote the truth.I take great exception to the Walt Disney company telling us their movie is \\"based on a true story\\" when it is so clearly based on one man's ridiculous fantasies.

Besides the controversy and other thoughts, I thought this book was actually pretty good. I'm not too much of a heavy book reader, but I did thoroughly enjoy reading of Frank Hopkins' journeys and adventures. Having found possible evidence of fraudulent writing through the O'Reilly's and Long Riders' Guild Research, it was quite hard for me to rate the deserved 4* of the book itself.

I was disappointed with this book.I knew the movie took some liberties as most movies do to make the story more interesting and or flow better. I expected the stories to be different and probably not to the level as Hollywood. Overall they were not. However, they are not bad. They read as if you were listening to an old man tell stories about his life.I must admit some kind of felt like tall tales as Hopkins met many famous people: Generals Custer, Terry, and Owens. He had a pistol from Wild Bill Hickock, he was friends with Annie Oakly and Buffalo Bill. An he knew several Native American personalities such as Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse. He also mentioned meeting Teddy and Queen Victoria. Some might argue it's seems like too much. However, keep in mind this is not a biography as it's a compilation of Magazine articles.There are several \\"information points\\" through out the book. Some are useful and some are simply attacks on Hopkins. I found they didn't offer much and they distracted me from the flow of the stories.Overall, I was not happy reading this book. I was expecting to read about Hopkins and his life and found this book to be designed as an attack on him. What is interesting is there is a concentrated effort to declare him a [...] as there are information points throughout the stories. Make a mental note while you read them and notice that the sections about horses and horsemanship either have one comment or none.What ever Frank T Hopkins was in life be it a [...] or a hero, it does not take away from his efforts to preserve the Mustang.Finally, I can't suggest this book. I am wondering about the completeness of the stories."},{"Title":"Hidalgo and Other Stories","review":"This is a fascinating book. When I saw the preview for the Disney film about Hopkins, it seemed like a thrilling adventure, especially as I am a dedicated horsewoman. I wanted to learn more about Frank Hopkins and that is how I found this book.Hopkins' own words read like a dime-store novel, and the footnotes from the historians make it very clear how he fabricated just about everything he wrote. The editors have included short biographies of the famous people Hopkins pretended to know, which are very useful for someone like me who doesn't know all that much about late nineteenth and early twentieth century American history.I am horrified to learn that the Walt Disney company is promoting this as a \\"true story\\" - the idea of racing for 3,000 miles in those conditions should make any true horseman's blood boil. And how could anyone fall for Hopkins' claim never to have lost an endurance race? Life's not like that! Even the greatest horse in the world loses a shoe sometimes, and the most brilliant rider can have a bad day and get lost.Walt Disney company should just say the film is fiction. By pretending the film is \\"based on a true story\\" they are misleading millions of people - and putting parents in the position of inadvertently lying to their children."},{"Title":"Hidalgo and Other Stories","review":"I have to say Hopkins is a captivating storyteller---I love it when someone is good at winding details together to keep the reader interested(hence my 5 stars), but I found as I read that it seemed a bit much for me to believe that in that day and time some one man could actually know so many historic figures so intimately---a Forrest Gump phenomenon if you will. From the small amount of research I've done on my own, there's definitely \\"2 sides to every story\\". There seems to be a \\"paper trail\\" out there, but nothing that Hopkins' own wife could produce or verify much of. Strange that there seems to be no pictures of Hopkins even sitting on a horse. And why no verifiable information from the Wild Bill Museum when Hopkins claims to have spent so many years with the show. There is that in all of us that aspires to \\"beat the odds\\" and loves the story when someone can---but we are very disappointed when we are told a story as true only to find out we've been \\"strung along\\". Give me the stories of some real long riders well substantiated!

Although they may not be literally true, because it is nearly impossible for one human being to accomplish all that he claimed to have done, the book is still entertaining. Also, the footnotes by the many historians and researchers, especially the O'Reillys' with the Long Riders' Guild, were extremely informative, and I commend them for working so hard on researching this hoax because a lot of people were not on their side especially the ones involved with Hollywood. But the difference from the historians and Hollywood is fairly simple: the researchers told the TRUTH. I do believe that the Disney Movie should have been advertised as based upon a story, not a true one, although I did enjoy the movie. If someone were to write a book, and it is claimed to be true, then you probably should tell the truth. All in all I do highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Hidalgo and Other Stories","review":"I have just recently finished reading Hidalgo and Other Stories and found it to be quite interesting. I believe that the book is well represented when it says that it is based on the writings of Frank Hopkins rather than the true story or life story of Frank Hopkins. I found the many editor notes and inserts to be amazingly helpful. I am not very familiar with horses, and occasionally I wouldn't know the difference from the truth or not when Hopkins made reference to something or someone which wasn't true or which was plagiarized had it not been pointed out. I think that it is great that the Long Riders' Guild spent so much time and energy into this book. It is remarkable to think about all the people they contacted and worked with for this book, it benefits the reader so much. The story is a good story, but that's all it is, a story."},{"Title":"Hidalgo and Other Stories","review":"My university freshman Writing and Research class this term saw the movie and studied this book as they both came out. What I thought would be a \\"normal\\" movie vs book comparison assignment gave us instead an explosive entry into larger research and writing issues. Along the way we've analyzed when literal truth is required, when half-truths are ok, when the truth can be positively dangerous, and when fiction carries truth better than non-fiction. The Long Riders' Guild's outraged determination in chasing down the errors, plagiarism, and sad wishful thinking of Frank Hopkins gives this book a sizzle our class found admirable.Not one class member is an equestrian, but the argument that the Long Riders are trying to trash mustangs doesn't bear up: we, at least, now know mustang lore and view those horses positively. We have to acknowledge too that Frank Hopkins did have one kind of journalistic skill: an eye for the stories and prejudices that would appeal to his (and our) era--he knew which ones to lift, claim as, and mix with his own! Frank and Disney recognized that pre-digested ideas go down easier than solid food.Notions of what constitutes plagiarism have changed from ancient times to ours. Writing when he did, Hopkins and his publishers should have known contemporary journalistic and research ethics better. From the Hopkins material traced in this book my students have seen how scholarship bristles with drama, conflict, and long slogs, rather like an endurance race. It's a dense book with a lot of detail. I'd recommend reading it in smallish segments.(...)"},{"Title":"Hidalgo and Other Stories","review":"First, we have to clarify that the O'Reillys are not winning anything by publishing this book. In fact, they are spending their money to bring out something that people fear to say, the truth.I have to admit that before reading the book I saw the movie and thought that the O'Reillys were the bad guys. Later I learned that they themselves are Endurance Riders and in the Long Riders' Guild they have members in 31 countries that are Endurance Riders as well. They have all the rights to defend what they love, horses. They are not attacking the mustang breed nor any other horse, just Frank Hopkins' dreams. Yeah, he was a dreamer like most of us. I am a runner and many times I have imagined myself winning the Olympic medal in the marathon, but I am not going to publish a book that says that I actually did that. In other words, I would make sure that someone else, not my wife (I don't have one) or relative, would be there to document it.I am not trying to trash the book. No, no. It's an amazing book, the stories, the ideas that conveys, and I guess some real facts about the Old West. Frank Hopkins also knows some about horses since he did work for the Ringling Brothers Circus taking care of horses but not to the point where he can self-appraise of knowing everything. You can tell this in chapter 4 \\"Gentling\\" where the LRG have no notes on it. The chapter is somewhat boring so I will not bother re-reading it. One of the things that I really didn't like was that some stories were repetitive.My conclusion is that the O'Reillys are only defending their love. Don't get me wrong, again, the book is great for motivation and all that good stuff but how would you feel if someone uses your passion to gain fame. For example, as a runner, I train hard everyday of the year and if someone comes up to me and says that he has run a faster 10k when he was my age, 18, I want not only to know how he did it but also how and where. Was he an Olympiad or is he just trying to praise himself. Then some I can tell just when they start talking running terms such as PRs, ATs, Tempos, and other stuff.Good Job O'Reillys from the Mexican Runner"},{"Title":"Hidalgo and Other Stories","review":"Walt Disney has not lied to you -- Michael Eisner has done that. The wreckage of Disney's company that is now run by this greedy meglomaniac has given us the movie &quot;Hidalgo,&quot; set to open in early March 2004.Disney (New Hollywood Revised Version) says the movie is &quot;based on the true story&quot; of a guy named Frank Hopkins. This book, which is a collection of all the available writings of Frank Hopkins, makes clear that NOTHING Hopkins said that he did can be verified through academic research. The documents are here, and the conclusion is unavoidable: Hopkins never rode 3000 miles across Arabia. Shame on you, Disney Company!The editors who put this together are not the authors of this book -- Hopkins speaks for himself, and believe me, his lies are pathetically obvious. If you read the book, you'll see that there is no way for the story of Frank Hopkins to be &quot;true,&quot; unless we re-define what the word means. The editors have even more documentation at their web site, which I checked out.Eisner and the other suits are set to rake in buckets of dollars from this film, and there's nothing we can do about it, except point out that THE WHOLE THING IS A LIE. Why won't they admit it? Why not just say it's fiction?I'll tell you why -- because they paid the screenwriter quite a lot of money to DO RESEARCH and write the script. Oh sure, he did some research - the kind that mediocre undergraduates do: &quot;Oh, it says here that Frank Hopkins rode across Arabia. It must be true, because it's in print!&quot;Please. Actually, I've seen better research from even mediocre undergraduates.Go ahead and rake in the dough, Disney boys. But I'll never respect you again. And I'm NOT taking my child to your silly movie."},{"Title":"Hidalgo and Other Stories","review":"From the start, any person who uses thinking ability must look at BOTH sides of a controversy, and if they want honesty, then they must look without prejudice or partiality. At first I was extremely disappointed to read that Frank T. Hopkins was a charlatan, but I wanted to have a basis for putting trust in the words of the Long Riders' Guild and others. Once I began to do my own research, the issue completely opened up for me and my questions vanished.I started with finding simple facts, and when I saw for myself a wide variety of photos of Frank Hopkins on many different horses, I began to wonder at the credibility of the \\"experts.\\" It turns out that they are the ones with all the 'proclamations' that are completely unfounded. Not only do they quote many vocations and accomplishments that Frank Hopkins never claimed in the first place, they completely blind themselves to the FACT that he was an outspoken activist for the mustang all his life, many of his speeches are written down as historical documents; also do they overlook the unique knowledge he had of indian horses, something which he could not possibly have possessed if he really was an \\"equestrian charlatan.\\" I find it a little ironic that in some of the other closed-minded reviews, many actually admit that they know nothing about horses. Don't you want to find out a little bit more for yourself before you state your opinion as if it was already fact?The most unforgivable thing that the Long Riders' Guild have done though, and perhaps the most important part of history of all that they have ignored, are the first-hand accounts of the Native Americans, their oral traditions, their TRUTH. And when I found out this, the underlying reason for the Guild's writings came to me. I thought, why would the Long Riders' Guild and others want to slander this man's reputation, to try to cover over his extraordinary accomplishments? It all comes down to the same-old, age-old issues of politics and prejudice.There are those prejudiced men and women who will never want to acknowledge this man's accomplishments because he was part Native American and thus a true horseman from his roots. He spoke out for the mustang when these same men and women would have been content to let the breed become extinct out of greed. He was at one with horses and could accomplish incredible feats BECAUSE he had Native American blood in him, but there will always be those who are racist who either want to ignore this heritage or claim it has nothing to do with any accomplishments. Finally, those who are politically prejudiced will never want to admit the guilt of the U.S. in the massacre of the Native Americans. Perhaps they don't like that the movie Hidalgo exposes the hypocrisy involved, when after U.S. soldiers brutally massacred innocent men, women and children, they called it a \\"battle\\" in which they had been victorious.Obviously I could never know the true motives from the hearts of all these people involved in this controversy; these are simply the conclusions I have reached, and it is true that it fills me with disgust to see the prejudice and racism that consumes people and causes them to deceive others. All I want to try and say to those who are reading this is not to blindly follow others along and put your trust in their every word, but to build a store of knowledge for yourself, so that you may always have a basis for finding truth, real justice and a faith of your own."},{"Title":"Hidalgo and Other Stories","review":"I have an &quot;Original&quot; copy of Frank T Hopkins' Autobiography. The book &quot;Edited&quot; by the O'Reillys is nothing but a &quot;Forgery&quot; to suit their own purpose, which is to &quot;slander&quot; a deceased Old West Heroe. I am an Endurance Rider, who breeds Spanish Mustangs. I have competed with my Mustangs on the endurance circuit for over 22 years. The truth is: Spanish Mustangs are, truly the greatest, &quot;Ultra-Marathon&quot; endurance horses! Although only 1% recorded, to compete in today's endurance circuit, they claimed Top National Awards! I was 2nd in the Nation, in 1990, with my Spanish Mustang, Montana, at the Multi-Day Ride Championship. (250 miles in 5 consecutive days, running against fresh Arabs each day!)Since the year 2000, a Spanish Mustang Stallion, by the name of Geronimo's Warrior, set an unprecedented record in the history of the AERC. (American Endurance Riders Conference). Geronimo received the following Awards for 4 consecutive years: National Mileage Champion, National Endurance Stallion, (Jim Jones Award), Mid-west heavyweight Champion, and Pioneer Award in Heavyweight division of the Multi-day ride championship! So in Lieu of all of the above, Mr. Hopkins is not the one who is lying! It is the O'Reillys. Frank Hopkins championed the legendary Endurance of the Spanish mustangs and his claim stands TRUE even today! Anybody who sinks so low, as to &quot;Edit&quot; a book to serve their own purpose, is to be condemned! I have found everything Mr. Hopkins advocated regarding the endurance of the Spanish Mustang to be TRUE, and verified by my personal experience during my 22 years of endurance riding.

Hopkins may have been charlatan, like so many others of his time and ours, who attempts to mold their personal history to their own advantage. However the question arises who are the debunkers? Why do they care? The legend of Hidalgo is inspirational. Hopkins' thoughts on conservation and horse care and training were ahead of their time. So what if he repeated what he heard. It's what he chose to repeat that is worth noting. It's the thought that an old man could create a false biography that still endures fifty years after his death that makes it great. Was he real man or legend? In another fifty years will it matter? I much prefer the west of legend over the west of fact. Enjoy the legend, savor it, don't fall prey, to whiny self styled western historians who obviously have a bone to pick. Enjoy Hopkins writings and skip the rest. What great western legend could survive a thorough investigation of their lives done 100 years after the fact?"},{"Title":"Hidalgo and Other Stories","review":"I do wish the movie had explained this was a tall tale. I didn't realize it really was mostly fiction, but I did figure that most of the historically famous people and even the outcome of the race was put in for effect. Thought that was the Disney touch we've come to expect over the years. Knowing the extent of the fiction involved would have really hurt my strong feelings after seeing the movie Hidalgo. I am truly disappointed a Mustang didn't win such a fantastic race.Don't be fooled by the book, horse-lovers, I think the movie very accurately presented a picture of how extremely harsh and devastating such a trip would be to a horse and its health. Having cleaned just a few hooves, I really thought that halfway through the trip, Hidalgo--in real life, would have been lame for quite a while and unable to finish the race. I think most people who have been around horses even a little bit would understand that.The movie tells a love for a wonderful horse and presents the kind of trusting relationship we would all like to have. It demonstrates the power of persistence, not giving up, even when it seems like you're finished.I think that's the real message worth taking home from this movie. I hope that's what one could take away from the book.And I love mustangs more than ever. I truly love &quot;Hidalgo&quot; and if I were fortunate enough to be able to own a horse, I would choose a mustang."},{"Title":"Hidalgo and Other Stories","review":"This is a very good book. Hopkins stories are entertaining in a purple prosy, old fashioned way and the historical comments by the various historians and experts are very informative.It is too bad that Disney has chosen to market their movie (which I liked, by the way) as a true story, rather than just a movie based on a story. And story it is, there doesn't seem to be a shred of truth in anything he says. Hopkins would have had to be about 300 years old and 3 different people to have met everyone he met and done all he claimed to have done.His stories would be pretty amusing, if they weren't so filled with things that didn't happen and slanders against genuine American hero's and blatant untruths about historical events. Kind of reminds one of the book and movie LITTLE BIG MAN, which never claimed to be anything but entertainment.The editors are to be commended on their research and their committment to the truth.It is too bad the negative reviews tend to focus on some obscure argument about horse breeds rather than on the book and it's author and his supposed exploits.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hidalgo and Other Stories","review":"So what if Frank Hopkins was streching it a bit.

One year, the nu. 1 &amp; nu 2 JJ winners were both Spanish Mustangs. I am Spanish Mustang Breeder. This year alone I raised 5 Gilbert Jones / Brislawn foundation bloodline crosses; all are pure Spanish Mustangs. I do not understand why the arabian folks are so unhappy that a mustang can bet the arab, but the fact is Spanish Mustangs can and have placed in front of Arabs.

Now, at nearly 70 years old, I am on a 20,000 mile non-stop ride to all 48 state capitals of the USA.I have read this book in the evenings, after I have finished riding for the day. And what I have read has left me deeply disgusted. In fact, the writings of Frank Hopkins should alarm anyone who loves horses.No horseman would brag about riding a horse to death like Hopkins did. And nobody who knows anything about horses would say that all horses are born blind. He may have been a successful liar but Hopkins certainly wasn't a horseman.I believe that American history is important. Hopkins said he was Buffalo Bill's best friend, that he taught Billy the Kid how to survive in the wild, and that he was a half-Lakota who witnessed the Massacre at Wounded Knee. These are lies, as the experts in this book have proved. Our country's history should be honestly written and Hopkins' writings do not portray the truth in any way.Finally, I was born in Texas, so it's fair to say I know a bit about cowboys and horses. It upsets me to learn that folks in Hollywood are now defending Hopkins by saying that all cowboys told tall tales. Some of the most honest people I have ever known are cowboys.

I'm starting a new diet that's along the lines of Esselstyn, Ornish and McDougall (emphasis on plant-based diet and excising meat, eggs, dairy, oils and other forms of fat). So, I'll say that if you think that \\"low-fat\\" means vegetarian, not-so. There's a pretty wide variety of meat-based dishes in this book. That said, I wasn't expecting this to be vegetarian (it does seem to have a \\"vegetarian\\" section, however, though it must be lacto-ovo-vegetarian as it generally still includes dairy; not sure on eggs).Long story short, I'll probably end up adapting some of the recipes to a vegetarian pantry. Just wanted the range of dishes this offered. Looks good so far. Can't wait to start trying recipes. Many of which won't even need adaptation.It seems pretty straightforward in arrangement. It has an intro with some diet advice and several appendices on various health-related topics. The recipes are divided into sections, seem legible on the page (though I haven't tried it in the kitchen while cooking yet). The recipes also seem to have basic nutritional information breakdowns.I assume this book should be a good addition to the typical chef's repertoire of cookbooks and recipes. For those looking toward vegetarian / vegan cooking, or toward non-fat diets, quite a few of the recipes are a bit too \\"standard\\" and may require some tweaking or adaptation to remove oils, dairy, etc. But since that's not what the cookbook is about, I won't fault the authors on it. The average user should find it a useful book for preparing more healthy meals.Those wishing to know more about health or heart disease may want to do some additional reading, such asThe China Study, and books byDr. Esselstyn,Dr. OrnishandThe Mcdougall Quick and Easy Cookbook: Over 300 Delicious Low-Fat Recipes You Can Prepare in Fifteen Minutes or Less."},{"Title":"Richard Boone: A Knight without Armor in a Savage Land","review":"I thank the author of this book for sharing his insights into a complex man and a versatile talented actor, Richard Boone.

Too bad this format fell short of portraying the full scope of the man, Richard Boone. The information is in the book, but falls short of satisfying the reader.

He was a classic character, both on and off the screen.Not a whole lot has been known about the many facets of this hard-boiled, caring gentleman, Richard Boone. So many of today's stars are relatively one dimensional and generally perform the same way. A Richard Boone performance, regardless of the character, usually contained at least several dimensions and, as Mr. Rothel points out so well, Hollywood, out of ignorance, jealousy and greed, never allowed him to utilize even a fraction of his talent. Thank goodness for his fans, Richard Boone was able to portray and perform under such demanding and, at times, disappointing circumstances.Richard Boone was truthful. That automatically puts him in a 'Savage Land'. Mr. Rothel's efforts at discovering the real truth, coupled with his extraordinary writing abilities, make this, in my opinion, one of the best 'total packages' I've ever read concerning a celebrity. I find this book to be totally captivating.The many interviews and the lots of 'little extras' add up to a factual excursion into the land of make believe.

One of the best programs of the day, and seldom seen on TV since, was the western \\"Have Gun Will Travel\\" with Richard Boone who played the main character, Paladin.The show started on September 14, 1957 on CBS and ran for six years. This half-hour show aired Saturday nights at 9:30 PM just before another popular western, \\"Gunsmoke\\". The character, Paladin had a great impact on me. To say the least, I loved his style and sense of right and wrong. Thus, Have Gun was my favorite western and Richard Boone my favorite cowboy. The series was filmed at the Paramount Studios in Hollywood and on location in the rough and tumble areas of Bend, Oregon.What made the program, was not just the great writing, and wonderful productions, but rather the acting Of Richard Boone was unlike anything I had ever seen before.In his new book by David Rothel, \\"Richard Boone; a man without Armor in a Savage land,\\" Rothel, brings us closer to one the most talented and most complex men Ever to grace the TV screen. The book will guide you threw Boone's early years, and explains his desire In becoming an actor.This book is not just a chronicle of Have Gun will Travel, but also a wonderful review on Boone's other Programs, Medic, The Richard Boone Theatre, and Heck Ramsey. And thou Rothel does and outstanding job dealing with the Boone's 4 TV programs, it is his writing regarding the years that produced that great western, Have Gun will Travel that makes this book come alive.Boone was born June 18, 1917 in Los Angeles, and was actually a seventh generation nephew of frontiersman Daniel Boone. He garnered critical acclaim for his acting on stage and on screen, both large and small.Rothel gives great detail on life in front and in back of the camera. Especially in Have Gun Rothel shows little glimpses of just who Paladin was. He lived a dual life as a wealthy man of the world residing in a posh San Francisco Hotel and as a black clothed gunfighter - for hire. We were also introduced to Paladin's business card, which would find it's way into every episode.Paladin came from a well to do family back east. He served as a Union Cavalry officer during the Civil War, then at some point thereafter left for Frisco to assume his double life of civilized sophisticate and rough and tumble gunfighter. At the prestigious Hotel Carlton, he lived a life of leisure and luxury. He liked the Arts, fine food, cigars, and acquired knowledge on scores of subjects, from law, to poetry, and history. He dressed in the most expensive clothes of the day, spoke several languages, played the piano, composed his own symphony and played chess with all the tenacity of a military tactician.But things were different once Paladin changed into his work attire. Dressed completely in black, with a silver chess-knight on his holster, Paladin simply had no peer. He stood alone at the top of the gun slinging world and he knew it. He used a black, single action Colt .44 with an extra long, rifled barrel; the gun was hand-crafted to his specifications, and had a one-ounce trigger pull. He also wisely carried a concealed derringer, which he'd often use for good effect some time after being told to \\"drop your gun.\\"He was physically strong, and great with his fists (Richard Boone did all of his stunts despite being in his mid 40's), but it was with his gun that Paladin truly excelled.Paladin would hire out his services to those who were in need. On many occasions, Paladin would do charity work, donating or waving his fee for a good cause. Paladin was a great champion for Justice, highly principled and ethical, ALWAYS concerned with what's right. He was truly one of televisions greatest heroes.\\"Have Gun will Travel\\" is a great legacy of a by gone era, the old west, and the Golden Age of Television. And Richard Boone played an extremely important role during that Golden Age. David Rothel's 277 page book is a Must read. A treasure that will stand the test of time. It's beautifully illustrated with over 100 photos. Most of which the public has never seen. The book also comes with a musical CD of the Theme song, and other recordings. One which also includes the voice of Richard Boone himself. I give the book 5 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Richard Boone: A Knight without Armor in a Savage Land","review":"When I was born in 1953, my first memory of television consisted of Westerns Television shows as well as movies. I loved them at the time but after time, I grew blaise.Just since last year, I have been faithfully watching &quot;HGWT&quot; each Saturday morning (like a child) and became fascinated and.... admittedly a little enamored of Richard Boone.This month I have just read &quot;Richard Boone: A Knight Without Armor in a Savage Land&quot; by David Rothel. What a fascinating and complex man Richard Boone was, and I was delighted to have it affirmed how much I suspected that the character of &quot;Paladin&quot; was the real Richard Boone.The book is filled with interesting photographs, interviews along with summaries of all the &quot;HGWT&quot; episodes. I was astonished to learn that Richard Boone was also starring in three others tv series. I had never heard of &quot;Medic&quot;, and wish his anthology series could be televised. I always respect the work of repertory theate. And what a group of performers he had selected! Typically, TV execs aired this anthology series opposite &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;...unfair competition.It was heartwarming to read of his wife's memories of her 30+ years with Boone. She has alot of guts and staying power!This is the perfect book for any devoted fan of TV westerns!I am thankful to the author for this labor of love."},{"Title":"Richard Boone: A Knight without Armor in a Savage Land","review":"Here's the latest in a series of showbusiness biographies by David Rothel. This time around the subject is Richard Boone, a dynamic and powerful actor best known for his role as Paladin in the late 1950s CBS TV Western, HAVE GUN, WILL TRAVEL. Rothel has covered just about every aspect of Boone's long career; apart from a few bloopers in the broadcast log of HAVE GUN, the book is completely reliable as a reference.The portrait of Boone offered is affectionate, but covers the &quot;warts and all.&quot; Boone was addicted to alcohol throughout much of his professional career, and this and other self-destructive habits eventually seemed to consume him. His most interesting TV work, the short-lived RICHARD BOONE SHOW, went largely unseen by audiences. In films, Boone usually played quirky heavies... in fact there has probably been no more terrifyingly pathological villian on the screen before or since than Boone in NIGHT OF THE FOLLOWING DAY and THE TALL T.Recommended... a fine appreciation of a unique and versatile actor."},{"Title":"Richard Boone: A Knight without Armor in a Savage Land","review":"Skilled with a gun, or with his fists, knowledge of subjects asvarious as the Menonites to playing the Japanese game of Go, anexpert of fine wines, well tailored colthing, and of course a ladies man about town. James Bond? No Paladin! Paladin was JamesBond before James Bond hit the big time. Here was a series way ahead of it's time. Tell me which western produced in that covered such subjects of the mental illness and the conflict ofbeing a part of two cultures? Richard Boone brought life to theroll as Paladin. It is sad that the series lasted &quot;only six years&quot; but maybe it is for the best because those six seasonswas some of the television the world has seen."},{"Title":"Richard Boone: A Knight without Armor in a Savage Land","review":"To my mind, there were four classic TV Adult Westerns made in the late 1950s: GUNSMOKE, WAGON TRAIN, RAWHIDE and HAVE GUN WILL TRAVEL. Significantly three of the four were ensemble shows, offering up a cast of interesting characters to keep the viewers' interest. The appeal of HAVE GUN WILL TRAVEL however rested on a single, fascinating character - Renaissance man/gunfighter Paladin - so vividly brought to life by actor Richard Boone. In his own way, Boone was just as fascinating a character as Paladin and his life and times are well told in this nicely done biography by David Rothel.RICHARD BOONE is a comprehensive look at a complex, highly principled and talented actor/director/writer/painter. Rothel ably covers Boone's early life, WWII service in the Navy, early TV efforts, his breakthrough MEDIC series, HGWT, the nobly intentioned RICHARD BOONE SHOW, his movie work, HEC RAMSEY, etc. Interviews with many, many of Boone's family, friends and fellow actors along with rare photographs bring the man to life.As with many complex men and women, Boone had his rough edges and weaknesses. Yet the cinematic legacy he left certainly speaks highly for him. Richard Boone fans will enjoy this book; it's an entertaining, informative and insightful tribute to the man who gave us Frank Usher, Leer, Hec Ramsey, John Fain and, of course, Paladin. For all that and more: Thank You, Mr. Boone! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Richard Boone: A Knight without Armor in a Savage Land","review":"This is an excellant work on the life of a complex and interesting individual who clearly grabbed Life and lived it his own way. Wonderful interviews and photographs provide true insight into the character of a man who WAS quite a &quot;character&quot;. There are innumerable anecdotes and facts covering the length of Boone\`s life and career that will fascinate the reader. I was left with a sad,sort of wistful feeling after reading of Richard Boone\`s life....and death. This was a man I would have liked to have met,and would have found a common-ground with in many ways...but at least through this work I had the opportunity to realise that. There are flaws in this book,actually in some remarkably simple areas which could easily have been corrected with a modicum of research,(example: The episode listing for Boone\`s signature series &quot;Have Gun--Will Travel&quot; is surprisingly flawed,claiming there were &quot;156 episodes&quot;(page 194)when there were in fact, 225 episodes of &quot;Have Gun--&quot;....but, as flaws go,this is fairly minor. After all, the focus here is not the minutia,but the man himself."},{"Title":"Richard Boone: A Knight without Armor in a Savage Land","review":"Tip of the hat to Rothel for putting together such a fine book. if you have ever admired the film career of Richard Boone, this is the book. A biography, lots of photos, interviews reprinted, and a somewhat listing of his film credits. HOWEVER, if you are looking for a book that covers the Have Gun, Will Travel TV show, this is NOT the book. Amazon offers The Have Gun Will Travel Companion by Rayburn and Grams and it's far more retailed. Heck, the first season's episodes list the dates the episodes were filmed. Rothel's doesn't. The Rayburn book is 500 pages thick and covers nothing but the Have Gun program, Rothels is half the number of pages and only spends a part of this book covering the Have Gun program. But, Rothel's book has better photographs. If you want a book about Have Gun, buy Rayburn's. If you want a book about Richard Boone, buy this one."},{"Title":"Richard Boone: A Knight without Armor in a Savage Land","review":"I was surprised to receive a large, very well researched book about Boone. Its pictures were also beautiful. It's build with interviews with those who have known Boone. I had doubts about this method, but it worked fine. I think Boone had the charisma to be a great star, but maybe his looks did not allow it. Anyway, if you are interested in Boone, you find all essential facts about him in this book. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Richard Boone: A Knight without Armor in a Savage Land","review":"I was just a kid when Have Gun, Will Travel was on TV. I didn't realize how good it was, however, until I recently saw the 1st 3 seasons on DVD. This led to an interest in Richard Boone, the man.I found the book fascinating. I like the interview format, as I think that gives a more realistic picture of a real, complex human being. Each person knew him in a different context, and often during a different stage of his life.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Richard Boone: A Knight without Armor in a Savage Land","review":"My husband and I went to a hear Mr Peter Boone, Richard Boone's son, speak at a recent event and was very impressed by his son. When we inquired about any books on his father he told us about this one and told us we could probably find it on Amazon. We did, we purchased it and have enjoyed reading the book. A must have book on Richard Boone."},{"Title":"Richard Boone: A Knight without Armor in a Savage Land","review":"I was very young when Have Gun Will Travel aired and didn't appreciate the intelligence of the show. I have rediscovered it in my early 50s and am quite impressed. Reading this book made me realize that Richard Boone was a driving force in keeping this from being just another western.But don't think this book is only about HGWT. Nay, nay. It's about everything Richard Boone has done (within reason of course) and covers a wide ground with amazing clarity and makes it interesting to boot! The many interviews with people who knew and/or worked with Boone make it seem like you are sitting down with them and chatting about an old friend. Before long the friend walks in and joins the conversation. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Forest (Signed)","review":"the gavriel/gregor failure to reconciliate shows a devastating loss of identity for the protagonist. at this point he believes he is a genuinenowhere man. but...there is a \\"dot\\" left in his soul brought out by hissurroundings, the yeshiva boy, & zman shachris - the MORNING prayer time,a time of resurrection of the spirit. so he dons the phylacteries & saysthe kaddish reborn in the memory of Leib the Lion..."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Forest (Signed)","review":"Alongside 'A beggar in Jerusalem', in my opinion, this is the author's finest book. It is a rare journey into a vital yet hauntingly esoteric perspective on existence. I truly agree with the other reviews suggesting that this work should not be viewed as belonging solely to the Holocaust genre. The interplay of plot and undertone alongside the sane and the insane allow the mind to soar - and falter."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Forest (Signed)","review":"I just want to say that this book was amazing and I would recommend it to anyone who has a heart in this topic as well as people who just want to read. Also I just want to say that I am truly disappointed as to what Sophia from Salem, Oregon said about it. I though that I met all the ignorant people in this world, but Sophia from Salem is by far the worst of all of them. What you said Sophia is disgusting and I am sure that your priest did not encourage you to say that."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Forest (Signed)","review":"Since Elie Wiesel's original trilogy he's been the quintessential Holocaust writer. This is a mixed blessing, since Wiesel is not just a Holocaust survivor but also one of the greatest philosophers of the 20th century, on par with Emmanuel Levinas. He has seen humanity at its worst and his love for G-d and the human race still runs through his writing.This is a strange book about a nameless survivor running from place to place. He's haunted by a stranger who knows more than he's letting on. He takes a role as a deaf mute learning all the secrets that he never wanted to hear and he's both an observer and a victim of Europe. When the book ends the first thing you want to do is read it again. Much of it is confusing, but a lot of it is profound - and it just gets better on repeat readings."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Forest (Signed)","review":"I don't simply mean &quot;really good&quot; or &quot;rather impressive&quot;. I mean this book is quite earth-shaking.This book does belong to that literary category known as Holocaust Lit. But it's also simply a book about a single boy-youth-man trying to cope with the absurdity and meaninglessness of existence - Gregor as the individual alienated from everything, desperately trying NOT to be alienated. The four seasons of the novel are the four attempts by Gregor/Gavriel to find some possible relationship with his God, with his universe. Don't let the similarities between each season fool you - Gavriel's solution in Spring is not Gregor's solution in Winter. Also, do not believe that the Gavriel of Spring is different from the Gavriel of Winter, or the Lieb of Autumn (though of course, they are all different and, yet, all the same).This novel is definitely Wiesel's finest (this from someone who worships the man). Absolutely incredible - a new look/experience/way of life."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Forest (Signed)","review":"In response to Sophia's review - and for the benefit of those who might be misled by it - Wiesel's \\"Gates of the Forest\\" is powerful not because it is a story of the Holocaust, but because it is a story of Everyman. It is, at its core, a story of grappling with existence, yet without trying to label it as \\"the Absurd\\" (Camus), \\"Nausea\\" (Sartre), or \\"Dread\\" (Heidegger). Sophia, this is so much more than \\"just another Holocaust story,\\" and I can't help but wonder if your zealous attempt to pigeonhole this incredible opus into that singular genre reflects a deeper fear you have of the themes of this book. After all, if this is \\"just another Holocaust story,\\" you could explain away any bearing it might have on you as a person. But if it is more than that - and it IS MORE THAN THAT - then the book demands a reaction from you. To all the Sophias out there, this book is a life-changing read, but only if you are willing to live like someone who is alive. Your review saddens me, Sophia, but I am hopeful for you and others like you that one day you will wake up and decide to live deliberately. To those willing to think, this book is worth reading once a year, every year, for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Forest (Signed)","review":"This is incredible writing. So good, in fact, that I wonder why he has not won a second Nobel Prize for Literature to go with his Peace Prize. I too agree that although this is by nature Holocaust Lit, it belongs with the classics of all world literature by merit of its eloquence and lifetime themes. Such themes are borne out especially in the name/identity crises of Gavriel and Gregor and the mother as sexual person characterized by Ileana. I recommend this book to every lover of great literature, unequivocally."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Forest (Signed)","review":"The Gates of the Forest is a deeply profound philosophical work, yet it reads with eloquence and emotion of a beautiful poem. This book paints images for everything abstract, and renders intangible everything ordinary. Through the mind and spirit of a young survivor, Elie Wiesel reexamines our relationship to God and to one another. He finds meaning where there would seem to be only chaos, and compassion, where there is only insanity. Read this book a million times, and it will still open your eyes in some way."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Forest (Signed)","review":"This book is really deep and wonderful.

It is hard to explain the emotions one goes through when reading it, but it is truly amazing. There is no need to be interested in the holocaust to enjoy it thoroughly."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Forest (Signed)","review":"As with his other fiction, Elie Wiesel has crafted a story that encompasses the Jewish history of suffering, with the Holocaust central to the tale. What separates \\"The Gates of the Forest\\" from otherworks is its very nature, which consists of a story told through other stories. The main character, known as Gregor and not by his real name, exists and survives merely through the stories that others tellhim and the ones that he re-enacts as he tries to find himself.Gregor goes into hiding that he might not be captured and sent to the work camps. He is holed up in a cave when he encounters another Jew, one who escaped from the transport, known as Gavriel. Through stories,Gavriel helps Gregor to understand what is actually happening in the outside world, and sacrifices his own life so that Gregor might live. Gregor then searches out an old family friend, who hides his identitityfrom the town by crafting a tale that he is her mute nephew. Gregor serves as a confessor for the townspeople, until he is called upon to enact the role of Judas in the local passion play and the tables areturned. He then takes refuge with a band of partisans hiding in the woods, at last able to seek justice for his captured friend. Each tale unfolds like a season of Gregor's life, told in flashback, with manyquestions raised before answers are found. In the final chapter, the reader meets Gregor as an old man, still searching for the meaning of his life, still searching for his real name, at last able to recognizethe path he needs to follow.\\"The Gates of the Forest\\" will be familiar territory to anyone who has read Elie Wiesel's fiction. He has concerned his literature with the sufferings of the Jewish people, of survivors who are haunted by theirpast, by what they did or failed to do. His own experience in the concentration camps and surviving the Holocaust has been a wellspring of creativity for his fictional accounts. The tale of Gregor and thosehe encounters is that of every Jew, is that of anyone who has been lost and found their way."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Forest (Signed)","review":"right from the beginning an enigmatic and surprising laughter is heard. that laughter,gabriel's laughter is a message for humanity .gabriel's laughter is his own arm against the germans , it is his way to fight, it is the survivor's choice"},{"Title":"The Gates of the Forest (Signed)","review":"this is a story about a hearing child who pretended he was deaf. our real deaf son was interested in this story. easy to find on Amazon and price was right."},{"Title":"Red Fox and His Canoe","review":"The time has come for Red Fox to have his own canoe.

This was one of my favorite books as a child, and I am very lucky to have found it to share with my own children."},{"Title":"Red Fox and His Canoe","review":"This is a story about an Indian boy who wants a bigger and better canoe, yet learns at the end that small and functional is most often good enough. Red Fox asks his father to help him build a bigger canoe, and they do. Red Fox then goes out on the water and catches a lot of fish. This attracts a large bear that climbs in the canoe and eats all the fish. More bears then climb in, followed by a raccoon and some otters. They all manage until a moose also wants to get in the canoe. This is too much and it breaks apart. Red Fox then takes some of the pieces and patches together a small personal canoe similar to what he had before.The meaning of this story is clear and it is a valuable lesson for children. If what you have is good enough then asking for something better may cause problems that you can't handle. I enjoyed the story and recommend it for children three to six."},{"Title":"Red Fox and His Canoe","review":"Our class learned how to make canoes by reading this book.

Though it is written by a master theologian, it is not difficult to read. The major concepts are presented very clearly without the clutter of technical jargon and arguments.On the other hand, if you are looking for or need a verse by verse exegetical commentary with all of the underlying arguments, this is not the book for you. While the book is layed out in the style of a commentary, it was not the author's intention to show all of the reasons behind each remark. Again, if you need a commentary to help you determine for yourself the meaning of certain controversial verses, this is not the book for you - you need something more detailed.However, even though it does not give the greatest exegetical detail, the introductory material is very good, and the reader will benefit greatly from this. The book emphasizes the practical application for the believer and has numerous commentary inserts scattered throughout like a devotional would have, although the inserts tend to be more practical than inspiring."},{"Title":"Clinker Plywood Boatbuilding Manual","review":"This book is excellent for what it is: tips & tricks on building lapstrake plywood boats.

I recommend that anyone building their first boat buy Hill's book, then Hill's video (...) and then this book.

Not only does it go through the complete process of building a clinker ply boat, but it also takes the time to address different methods for accomplishing various steps. For example, he goes over several ways of spiling the planks and makes recommendations in a reasonably unbiased manner (none of the \\"this is the way I do it so don't bother trying anything else\\"). I'd highly recommend reading this book if you are building or are interested in building a clinker ply boat, whether or not it is one of the author's designs. I'm currently building a design by another designer and this book is still throughly useful.This book also covers basically any type of clinker ply boat including prams, flat bottomed dories, round bilged dinghies, and even has the occasional reference to larger (20' +) boats."},{"Title":"Clinker Plywood Boatbuilding Manual","review":"This book is a great cross reference to the Hill and Rossel books.

I have about 20 books on boatbuilding and I seldom consult this one except to compare to what others have to say on a particular subject.I find Thomas Hills' method more interesting and I find his instructions to be clearer (but not without leaving some questions).Note to those who have trouble with the bindings: On any book I expect to use while doing something else, e.g. building a boat, I immediately take it to Kinkos where they cut off the spine and put one of those plastic combs on the book. Make sure the person understands what they are doing. Once they cut the binding holes on the side opposite the original binding. No wonder it was confusing!I find it ironic that some of the highest quality writing is packaged in the poorest quality books."},{"Title":"Clinker Plywood Boatbuilding Manual","review":"By the time I finished reading the book I had a very clear picture of how to build a wooden boat.

The author provides a comprehensive guide to grilling vegetables, and offers some inspiring menu-grouped recipes for marinated, grilled, sauced, and otherwise SMOKIN' vegetables. I love to see pictures of recipes, and this book does not disappoint in the illustrations.I'm already a fan of the butter baste on page 53, having used it on corn and Vidalia onions.So little attention is given to veggies on the grill, and so much flavor is brought out when they are grilled.

Tariq Ali's most recent segment of his Islamic Quartet is the best so far. The novel reads like an epic poem, but with all the drama and intrigue you would expect from a Latin American soap opera. The rich tapestry of one wealthy Ottoman family's story unravels through the clandestine reports made to a pagan statue near the summer residence of an exiled forbearer. The interconnecting details are told through a headstrong daughter who has returned home after a long absence. Ali's gifts are especially evident as he slowly unpeels the layers of this family's compelling and often-cursed history. Meanwhile, Ali wraps in the politics surrounding the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the so-called \\"Sick Man of Europe,\\" on the eve of the Great War. The sometimes tedious subplot about the proto-revolutionary movement in the Empire is the novel's only weak point. As a student of Ottoman history, I found it interesting, but it takes away from the true brilliance of the novel. For fans of Ali's other two works on the often violent but always spellbinding confrontation between Christianity and Islam, this book will be a godsend. It is quite similar to Ali's first book in the series, Shadows of the Pomegranate Tree, in that it focuses on the life and times of patrician family. But this work deepens the focus on family and creates a vast array of memorable and believable characters where Pomegranate had only a few broadly drawn archetypes."},{"Title":"Stone Woman","review":"I went to the author's reading at Cody's bookshop in Berkelysome weeks ago.

This is, first of all, a wonderful piece of literature, suffused with lyrical prose that befits its time and place and evokes the poetry and sensuality of the Middle East in the pre-modern world. And it is a vital piece of history, occasionally pedagogical (some might say to a fault, but I won't), an insider's view of the last days of the Ottoman empire in Turkey as the world prepares for the painful and violent birth of the twentieth century, a sensitive and cynical rendering of the corrupt,but feeble, state of affairs of the government of the Sultanate.The narrative flows in a series of vignettes as the main characters, members of a proud aristocratic family, gather one fateful summer at the family estate outside Istanbul, and reveal their secrets to the&quot;Stone Woman,&quot; a natural rock formation that has always been the keeper of family secrets. Ali's Turkey is full of surprises -- Sufi mystics who quote Balzac, nobles whose true lineage derives from Albanian shit-sweepers, gay uncle Memed and his intellectual Prussian lover of 50 years,desperate intrigues and dubious patrimonies. Through these the author teaches us of the follies of contemporary life in the Islamic world --the deadly hypocrisies of religious fanaticism, the ugliness and tragedy of ethnic and sectarian hatreds, the redeeming value of life-giving passion. And always, the eternal lessons of history. This is a marvelous book, as rich and complex and enchanting as an ancient Turkish carpet."},{"Title":"Stone Woman","review":"A friend recommended this book, and i am so pleased that she did. What a novel i am absolutely swayed by it. Stone Woman my first of Tariq Ali, but certainly not the last. I read with initial resistance, but was lured to it from the first page. Mystically he draws the attention with the words which encapsulates the reader as a silent observer witnessing the developments in the palace of Pasha. One is drawn away from present times and transcends to the era of Ottomon empire's decadence.I found the characters in this narration to have immense depth, which is delieved in part by confessions. Confessions are made to a small rock resembling a pagan goddess. Secrets are divulged to the goddess which sheds a light on the mental and emotional state of the character. Another luring aspect of this novel are the discussions by the characters. Rational, religion, philosophy and the creation of the future republic to be carved from Ottomon Empire are debated.The narration has an expanse of seduction, rebellion, confessions, betrayal, rational, arguments, religion, treachery and conspiracy. It is to these reasons i find the text rich in prose."},{"Title":"Stone Woman","review":"Tariq Ali is a master of setting the character as a recognizable human with depth, worries, complexity, hopes and resourcefulness. And always with Ali there is at least one character of resolution and will power who is ttempting to change direction of their life, this time away from the path laid out by the Ottoman Empire and its traditions, culture, and political narrow-mindedness. The characters are so well drawn and realistic one from the very beginning is involved.This story is set at the very end of the 1800's when the Ottomans and the rest of the world is heading towards the first world war. The strength of the story this time is a woman who is reevaluating her life; the forces of the old ways are crashing on the shores of the new times: Old men hold onto old way honor and tradition, while their sons plot rebellion and revolution and the future; women and families and values are caught in the riptide. Some of this is revealed in confessions the characters make in private in the forest to a giant stone that has a face resembling a woman, The Stone Woman.Interesting people, interesting times with real and believable characters and situations in a fascinating time of a dying empire.

She is a young wife and mother, 30 years of age, attending a weekend house party at the home of her friend Omegus Jones. There Isobel Alvie, a young widow who is vying for the attention of an eligible bachelor, makes a cruel and cutting remark about Gwendolen, another young widow who would appear to be about to become engaged to him. The next morning Gwendolen is dead, an obvious suicide. Omegus proposes a medieval solution that could allow Isobel, who the guests find responsible for Gwendolen's death, to redeem herself. It will be a long and bitter journey in the cold of early winter to deliver Gwendolen's last letter to her mother, who lives in the north of Scotland. Vespasia, in friendship, offers to accompany Isobel. The journey is longer and much more difficult than anticipated, but the women persevere and meet another remarkable woman, Gwendolen's mother.The morals and mores of mid-nineteenth century England may seem strange and unusually strict to us, but Isobel and Vespasia must learn to live within those rules. As they travel, they share their thoughts and develop a true friendship. It is a journey of discovery for both of them, as they look deep inside themselves. I do agree with another reviewer that Vespasia dwells too much on her affair with Marco in Rome, but I assume that it is still a very recent occurrence, so that is understandable.What I do not understand, however, is Vespasia's willingness to leave her children, well cared for though they are, for long periods of time, first to go to Rome and again to travel to Scotland. Again, I suppose it is customary for the gentry and nobility of that era to do so. Nevertheless, it surprised and disappointed me.However, this is an excellent book which I highly recommend to all who love Aunt Vespasia and wish a glimpse of the young woman who became a great lady."},{"Title":"A Christmas Journey","review":"Anne Perry is a brilliant writer. She is my favorite author and can take you into Victorian England better than Charles Dickens, BUT even a superb writer can not always create a good work. Anne Perry proves that with this shallow, short novella. Her descriptions are magnificent, but there has to be a riviting story to make a piece worthwhile and this book does not have one.The title is misleading, it is not a Christmas story. It starts before Christmas and ends on Christmas Eve. It has virtually nothing to do with Christmas. To be accurate, it might better have been titled &quot;A Winter Journey&quot;.I had thought that this work might give insights into the wonderful Lady Vespasia from the Thomas Pitt novels. All it does is expose her as a shallow, almost adulterous lady of leisure who spends a great deal of time thinking of her lost love from a Roman escapade and has very little thought of her husband and children.She does not even spend Christmas Eve with her family but rushes off to Applecross to be with a man who has fascinated her throughout the book.The woman who causes the problems in the story is a most unlikable person. She has a quick, sharp, wicked tongue and uses it often. She snaps at everyone, even as they try to help her.The only person of true and nobel character is the stoic mother of the girl who committed suicide. She is the most interesting character in the book and only makes an appearance in the last quarter of the story. However even her character is under developed as there is no real reason given for her running from her previous life.There are needless extensions of the trip to find the mother of the suicide victum. Everytime it seems that she will be found, she has moved on to another more remote location. This gives Ms.Perry a chance to describe the Scotland she calls home, but needlessly prolongs a story that has quickly run out of steam.I wish I could recommend this book as Anne Perry and Christmas seemed a magnificent combination, but this is a very poor work from a usually great author."},{"Title":"A Christmas Journey","review":"This is a much shorter book than most of those from Anne Perry; it's a piece of light rewading for and about Christmas. The writer takes Aunt Vespasia, one the favourite characters from her Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series, and tells the story of one Christmas in her younger days. It isn't exactly a mystery story - a young woman commits suicide and her reasons for doing that seem obvious. But Anne Perry is master of digging beneath the obvious to find the truth beneath the truth.The result is a tale that flows from an elegant house party in a country mansion north to the frozen snowy wastes of Scotland (and Anne Perry lives in northern Scotland so we can assume she knows whereof she speaks). It's a pilgrimage of sorts, with Vespasia and her friend Isobel toiling through storms and snowdrifts to find the mother of the dead woman and, incidentally the truth behind the suicide.The only thing spoiling this good story is the overly moralistic tone that Anne Perry is increasingly becoming bogged down in. Of course you want characters with deep motivation - some pure, some mistaken, some evil - and the battle between good and evil always makes for good plot structure. But Anne Perry does tend to overdo it, leaving the reader wondering if she can stand being swamped beneath so many layers of virtue and morality."},{"Title":"A Christmas Journey","review":"Ms Perry is a very talented author and I have read, re-read, and listened to her Monk and Pitt books, but this book was rather disappointing. Unable to wait, I purchased this at full price on its first day of issue- I wish I had waited.As I read it, my excitement lessened and the words 'shallow' and &quot;Harlequin Romance' kept coming to mind. The contrived plot was hard to swallow: a woman is the victim of a stinging remark and commits suicide. No one appears to really care and no police are called. Eager to place blame, the houseparty group convenes a hearing and declares one of themselves guilty of contributing to her death and so must do penance. Huh???The moral (spelled out otherwise I don't think I would have caught on) is forgiveness and mercy, but it was made known rather abruptly in the last 2 pages (as it often is) and left me wondering if I'd missed something.The characters are Ms Perry's and she may do with them as she wishes, but I cannot say I was happy to learn more about Vespasia in this book. Vespasia, who is well aware of her great beauty and status in society, seems bored- bored with her husband, her life, her friends, and even her children since she leaves them for weeks at a time. Perhaps she accompanied Isobel to the wilds of Scotland out of sheer boredom. She doesn't seemed bored by the attentions of her host, though.Good characters have flaws and weaknesses and Vespasia is certainly one of Ms Perry's best, despite the weak story of this particular book.Borrow before you buy, buy at a discount only."},{"Title":"A Christmas Journey","review":"It's Christmas time and guests have gathered in the Berkshire countryside house of Applecross for a weekend of Christmas cheer.

The prime purpose of most of these books seems to be to cash in on the Christmas dollars people are willing to spend. I had high hopes for this book because I am a big fan of Anne Perry. It started with promise with one of the interesting secondary characters in the Thomas Pitt series, Vespasia Cumming-Gould. The story takes place when Vespasia is in her early thirties instead of the more advanced years of the Pitt series. I thought we would have some good character development and backstory for Vespasia, but instead the character portraits were superficial. The plot was not only rather ludicrous, but weak.

Life for these people was honor bound, but also extremely chauvinistic. As a result, I gave this book a 4 star rating, simply because two women would not necessarily be allowed to do what Lady Vespasia and Isobel set out to do alone had it not been fiction.However, I found this book charming, as well as one that could talk to our senses of morality, charity, love and friendship. Friendship is either a trust situation, or not, and this book addresses that nicely. Having everything conclude at Christmas helped tie in the friendship aspect of the Blessed Season, and for that, I was appreciative.A short book ... a novella really. Won't take long to read!

A despondent remorseful Isobel accompanied by her only loyal friend Vespasia journey to Scotland to offer sympathy to Gwendolyn's mother where they will learn the truth behind the suicide and the true meaning of friendship.A CHRISTMAS JOURNEY may be a mid nineteenth century tale, but the deep messages remain valuable in today's society. The story line is kept from being light fluff by a strong cast especially the two lead women that brings to life the era yet also relates the true meaning of friendship \\"never fades\\" regardless.

The group is stunned and outraged and demands some sort of revenge. At the urging of her good friend, Omegus Jones, Vespasia suggests to the somewhat less than recalcitrant harpy that perhaps she should atone for her foul deed with an unusual act of expiation. In front of the gathered group, she suggests that she should embark on the long and possibly dangerous journey to northern Scotland to inform the victim's mother of her daughter's sad demise. Not only that, but she should bring the grieving mother back to attend.In order to make certain this task of medieval origins is completed, Vespasia offers to accompany her friend on the journey. Vespasia, her friend, the victim and her mother are revealed to have secrets in their pasts that come to light as the journey progresses. Perhaps the suicide is something more than meets the eye.Perry spins a tale of intrigue lavishly adorned with Victoriana and moral conundrums. One almost wishes that expiation were a way of meting out deserved punishment in our times.--- Reviewed by Roz Shea"},{"Title":"A Christmas Journey","review":"I picked up this book tonight to read it and made it almost all the way through before I realized I had read it before. It made little or no impression on me at the time, because I certainly didn't remember having read it and I did not remember how it turned out.In this little book, Anne Perry focuses on Aunt Vespasia of the Thomas and Charlotte Pitt novels. The book occurs when Vespasia is a young woman and she is a guest at a week-end party when one of the attendees commits suicide after an insulting remark made by one of the other attendees.This book is not really so much of a mystery as a journey-- in undertaking a journey to tell the mother of the young suicide victim of her daughter's death, Vespasia also takes a journey into her own past. Its main interest is more in its picture of the times and the emptiness of women's lives-- how horrible it must have been to be a member of the upper class and have nothing to occupy your time but attend parties and snipe at each other. This book made me wonder if women of that time really had friends or if they spent their entire lives in the loneliness of a crowd.The book itself is a pleasant enough little diversion-- and I probably would have given it more stars if it had just left more of an impression. As it is, I have the feeling that in about a year, I could probably pick it up again and re-read it, having forgotten that I have already read it-- twice."},{"Title":"A Christmas Journey","review":"While &quot;A Christmas Journey&quot; proved to be a wonderfully affecting and poignant short story about forgiveness and the expiation of sins and a wonderful read for a short train journey home from work, honesty does compel me to admit that it is a bit of an expensive read -- $15.95 plus tax for an hour's enjoyment. If you can afford it well and good, otherwise borrow the book from the library. For while &quot;A Christmas Journey&quot; was a well written short story, it does lack the depth and intensity one has come to expect from a really good Anne Perry novel.It's the Christmas season, and Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould has been invited to spend it at a house party at Omegus Jones's estate (Applecross) in Berkshire. The atmosphere at Applecross is, at first, one of good cheer, hope and romance; until a jealous and cruel remark by one of the guests, Mrs. Isobel Alvie, courses another guest, Gwendoline Kilmuir, to commit suicide. Everyone is upset and angry, and all seem to hold Isobel responsible for Gwendoline's death. Hoping to avert a scandal, Omegus Jones comes up with the notion of having Isobel journey to Scotland in order to inform Gwendoline's mother of her death, deliver a letter that Gwendoline had written to her mother just before she killed herself, and also to explain the part that Isobel herself played in driving the unfortunate woman to her death -- in other words to undertake a journey of expiation for sins committed. And while Isobel is reluctant at first to do this, the dawning realization that she will be ostracized by everyone she knows in society, forces Isobel to agree to undertake the journey. Deeply affected by Gwendoline's death and Isobel's plight (and wanting to get the better of a few malicious members of the house party who would like nothing better than to socially shred Isobel's reputation) Lady Vespasia impulsively offers to accompany Isobel on her journey. But as the two women travel into the heart of Scotland in the middle of a harsh winter, Lady Vespasia cannot help but wonder about Gwendoline's death and her character. Why had such a meaningless and malicious remark caused such a tragedy? What's in the letter that they are carrying to Scotland? Will it explain why Gwendoline killed herself? And more importantly, will her friend Isobel be able to carry out her task and face a mother's wrath and anguish?I enjoyed reading &quot;A Christmas Journey.&quot; It had all the poignancy and pathos that one would expect from an Anne Perry novel. The short story unfolded smoothly and briskly -- even if it did harp on one particular motif over and over again (Lady Vespasia's Roman interlude) -- and even if the characters were not as well developed as they usually are. However Ms Perry did such an excellent job of providing us with such vivid thumbnail sketches of all involved that the lack of any deeply developed characters was not felt by this reader at all!If I had any quibbles about this book it was that Omegus Jones had such little difficulty with sweeping Gwendoline's death under a rug -- the Justice of the Peace did not make an appearance and there was no inquest. Gwendoline was quickly and quietly buried, while Isoble and Lady Vespasia left for Scotland without any hindrance from the law. So that while the whole idea of a journey of expiation was an interesting plot device, I think that I would have liked to see how Jones would have got the JP to go along with his plan. The other thing was that &quot;A Christmas Journey&quot; was not really very a suspenseful at all. However, because the book was not really a mystery so much as it was a study of people, manners and psychology, the lack of suspense wasn't that much of a factor at all. And indeed Ms Perry's sublime descriptions of the Scottish wilderness in the midst of winter more than made up for this lack. So that on the whole, I'd rate &quot;A Christmas Journey&quot; as a good 4 star read."},{"Title":"A Christmas Journey","review":"Short, terse, well told, with an appropriate ending.

Ms. Perry can take us into her Victorian world like no one else can, and it's an almost illicit pleasure! Surely it can't be right or legal to enjoy these books so much!

As its protagonist, she is a 30-something beauty nursing memories of time recently spent in Rome - time during which she lived a completely different existence from that of an older, wealthy man's wife, mother of small children, and an accepted and prominent member of England's upper social class. Vespacia understands all too clearly that this life is her real one, and she puts away her longing for that brief taste of something far more meaningful. In this mood she comes to a pre-Christmas house party at a friend's country estate, where she will spend the long weekend among others who are to varying degrees her friends and acquaintances. She is shocked when one friend, a still youthful widow who hopes to remarry, cruelly insults another young widow on the party's first night. The following morning her host informs first Vespacia, and then everyone else, that the insult's target has drowned herself in the estate's freezing lake. What can be done to salvage this ugly situation? Although Isobel Alvie did not murder Gwendolen Kilmuir, society - as a whole, not just the microcosm present now - intends to hold her responsible. She will never be able to remarry, which for a woman in this era is the only route to security and full social acceptance. She will be treated as if she did not exist, unless her host and her friend Vespacia can come up with a way the other guests can be forced to keep silent.Invoking the medieval tradition of the redemptive pilgrimage, their host suggests that Isobel travel to Inverness - in the far north of Scotland, as winter closes down - to confess what she has done to Gwendolen Kilmuir's mother, and to deliver the dead woman's farewell letter. When she realizes that Isobel is going to refuse the offer, not yet fully comprehending the consequences of being shunned if she does not do this, Vespacia offers to accompany her friend. The two women set off for Inverness, and then for even more remote places in Scotland, on a journey that proves even more difficult than anyone expected. In fact, at times it is downright dangerous. But it is the only way for Isobel to redeem herself - and as the journey unfolds, Vespacia finds herself intrigued by a mystery concerning Gwendolen's widowhood.Perry, I understand, has personal reasons for being intrigued by forgiveness and redemption as real concepts, not just as themes for works of fiction. This short Christmas novel uses those themes effectively and gracefully, and it is also a fine little mystery tale. I really enjoyed seeing \\"Aunt Vespacia\\" in her youth. What I can't say is how well this story might work for a reader not already familiar with the character.--Reviewed by Nina M.

The journey is much longer and complicated than they originally thought, leading them to some of the most remote parts of Great Britain. During the course of the voyage, the motives behind Gwendolen's suicide slowly begin to appear. I don't want to reveal more, but this is a great and smart mystery book."},{"Title":"A Christmas Journey","review":"Let me start by saying that I really appreciate Anne Perry and enjoy her books. This story, if it was a stand alone having nothing to do with Christmas, and all to do with Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould, would have been better received. The short book was enjoyable; as an average book by Ms. Perry is better than many authors' best work. However, if you are looking for a story about England at Christmas, I would suggest looking elsewhere. There were only a couple of times that the holiday was mentioned, and it had little to do with the story. That said, if you want to learn more about Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould (One of the truly great characters from the Thomas and Charlotte novels) this is a great way to do it."},{"Title":"A Christmas Journey","review":"A Christmas Journey is a very disappointing book with a very misleading title. This is my first experience with any of Anne Perry's books, and it was a big effort to even finish this book. After finishing the book, I can't believe that I wasted my time even reading it.The story is set \\"around\\" Christmas time and has nothing to do with a \\"Christmas\\" story at all. The characters are extremely shallow without any depth, the book jacket's hint of a murder and mystery do not materialize at all, and there were many questions left unanswered and I would constantly ask myself, \\"what.....\\"? Story lines did not connect and the plot did not easily flow.The entire story was unrealistic, bordering on horrible fantasy, as well as lacking in substance and depth. Not a book that I would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Our Land, Ourselves: Readings on People and Place","review":"This is an excellent collection of contemporary and classic essays dealing with people's sense of place, the vernacular landscape, perception of the environment and wilderness, and the meaning of community. The book began initially as an effort by the Trust for Public Land (TPL) to better comprehend the core social values imbedded in its land conservation mission and how to better apply these to strengthening communities (natural, social, and cultural) and to promote and foster a more healthy, sustainable natural world. After exploring these issues, TPL decided that there would be great value in including the greater community in its discussion of these issues and subsequently published this collection as a means to that end. Included our writing by Aldo Leopold, Wendell Berry, Wallace Stegner, Harry S. Truman, Gary Snyder, Annie Dillard, Linda Hogan, James Howard Kunstler, John Steinbeck, Mary Oliver, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Bill McKibben, to name only a few.As a professional conservationist, I was familiar with the themes and issues raised in this book, but had not read many of these essays beforehand. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest as to why we should preserve open space, wilderness, parks, and wetlands and anyone curious at to how individual lives and communities relate to the natural world; the message is so rarely delivered as eloquently and effectively"},{"Title":"The Baptist Faith and Message","review":"I was looking for this book to give to my Sunday School class for Christmas.

Finally, I buy the book and begin reading against advice from a friend. I think, \\"It's not so bad, the writing is decent and it moves fast.\\" After a couple of chapters, I determined that I would not subject myself to read this ridiculous and stupid story. Tiffany and Chantal are barely developed and Margaret continually got on my nerves. I do not expect plots to be exactly true to life but I kept going \\"Come on, be for real!\\" after Margaret kept getting into one mishap after another. Frustrated, I read the ending to see if this was all leading to something worthwhile, again, I must say that I was disappointed and thought that it was stupid. By page 120, I put the book down, actually I passed it on to a friend who would probably enjoy it a lot more than me. This is definitely one of those books that you get from a library or a friend.

Instead, they expect for you to take care of their apartments, water their plants and walk the dog. If you are Margaret Drew, you take on the responsibility and do a little snooping. What Margaret finds transforms her from plain Jane to the ultimate diva in Donna Hill's newest novel, Divas, Inc.From the time they were toddlers, Tiffany Lane and Chantel Hollis were on their way to becoming divas. Margaret Drew was lucky to be their friend, however she benefited very little from this alliance. Tiffany and Chantel wore designer clothes, Margaret shopped at K-marts. They lived in expensive condos in Manhattan and Margaret lived in a one-bedroom walkup apartment in Harlem. They rode around in Tiffany's Jaguar and Margaret caught the bus. So when Tiffany and Chantel decide to go to Europe and leave Margaret home to water the plants and walk the dog, she decides it's time for her to get a taste of the good life. Since they did not invite her to go along, Margaret felt justified in rambling through Tiffany and Chantel's closets. She began dressing in their designer clothes and shoes, wearing their make up and wigs, a new Margaret emerges and she is a diva. The question is can she handle all that comes with the title of diva?Donna Hill displays her versatility as a writer as she tackles the \\"Chick Lit\\" genre. Having read other novels dubbed as \\"Chick Lit\\" written by British authors, I feel Divas, Inc. equals if not surpasses the other novels I read in this genre. Filled with quirky secondary characters such as Margaret's grandma, Willie and the dog, Virginia, this novel is a funny and enjoyable read. Are you a Diva? Take the quiz in the back of the book and find out where you rank!JeanetteAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Divas, Inc.","review":"Tiffany, Chantel, and Margie have been the best friends from before the turn of time but when Chantel and Tiffany decide to go on a lesiure trip to Paris leaving Margie to house set Margie decides to take a look into their lives.The book brings you laughter and mysterious scenes where it leaves you wondering have you figured it out or is Ms. Hill up to her usual schame of giving you the one to hook keeping you wondering until the very end.The book is an excellent read keeps you hanging on for more!!"},{"Title":"Divas, Inc.","review":"I thought this book was alright and I liked Maggie's transformation however, there really wasn't much of a story there. I guess I was expecting it be a romance or something and it could have been. Though i'm not sure with who in the book Maggie could have gotten with. Calvin and James were friends' exes so that's not good form. Willie was a criminal. And I'm sorry but Wayne was a weirdo and stalker ways were freaking me out. I would have liked further detail in the secret life of Chantel and Tiffany (the hood rat side), She never followed up the club incident with Wayne either. I mean it was a pretty okay read. Nothing too spectacular."},{"Title":"Divas, Inc.","review":"Tiffany Lane and Chantel Hollis ARE divas! They wore some of the finest clothes and shopped at the most expensive stores.

Tiffany and Chantel ride around in a Jag, and once again, Margaret is left to take the bus.Margaret is flat out, down right TIRED. She wants to be a Diva! She gets the perfect opportunity when Tiffany and Chantel take a trip to Europe. She's left behind to water the plants and see after the condo, which she does until she opens the closet!!! She starts dressing up in Tiffany and Chantel's designer clothes, tries on their hair pieces, and gives herself a make over by drowning in their makeup. Margaret becomes a diva!! I love it!As Margaret goes from dull to glamorous, she finds out that all that glitters ain't gold! For me, this is where the story turns into a masterpiece. We as women want to be beautiful at any cost. We take it to the extreme by going broke, or worst, being something we are not! Margaret finds out in the end that beautiful just as she is!Donna Hill tackled something outside the norm for her, which I think she did a brilliant job in doing so.

While the flirtatious Tiffany and Chantal have been dude magnets able to get males to do their bidding since first grade, Maggie has always been reticent and in awe of the dynamic duo. Tiffany and Chantal remain successful, obtaining fabulous jobs and homes as everyone considers the two women as Divas.Maggie envies them but loves her pals. When Tiffany and Chantal go on an extended vacation, she agrees to watch their expensive New York apartments. Soon Maggie begins emulating her friends and though still overweight with glasses, hunks take notice of her for the first time. She learns that Tiffany and Chantal belong to the exclusive women only Divas, Inc., club for females who demand the best. However, as she begins obtaining multiple boyfriends and behaving like a Diva, Maggie worries that at midnight Cinderella will only have a mouse to show for her efforts.This is an amusing contemporary tale that gently winks at some of society's \\"Ivana\\" like assumptions. Maggie is a delightful protagonist as she gradually turns from bookworm to diva. Fans will notice that this tale lacks Donna Hill's normal deep drama but readers who enjoy an urban Cinderella like frolic will appreciate the humorous somewhat biting DIVAS, INC.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Divas, Inc.","review":"Have you ever felt like the third wheel? Margaret Drew has spent her entire life as just that. Tiffany Lane and Chantel Hollis have been Margaret's \\"friends\\" since they were in diapers. In elementary school, Tiffany and Chantel were the girls everyone wanted to be friends with and by high school the two were the girls of every boy's dreams. As women, men loved them and women loved to hate them but no one would question their status as true divas. Margaret has always been relegated to the shadows; she was more of a \\"plain Jane\\" that was outshined by her diva friends. As adults, Tiffany and Chantel have dream jobs, fancy cars, even fancier wardrobes and men that would make most women salivate. Margaret has an average job and secretly dreams to become a writer. She sports payless shoes, \\"sale rack\\" clothes and a serious inferiority complex. The three women get together for their regular lunch date, and the idea of a European vacation comes up. Margaret immediately begins to mentally scramble, trying to figure out how she could afford such a costly trip, that is until it becomes apparent that Tiffany and Chantel plan to go without her. To make matters worse, they expect Margaret to house and pet sit while they are away.Initially, Margaret is disappointed. But when she realizes that she will have access to all of Chantel and Tiffany's belongings she soon devises a plan to learn the secrets of becoming a diva. She figures that while her friends are traveling in Europe, she can reinvent herself and no longer be relegated to the shadows. After just a little snooping, Margaret learns of a secret society of divas; complete with handbooks and training videos. It becomes her mission to find and absorb the videos and handbooks because she is convinced that they hold the secrets she needs to complete her transformation. With this, the story begins, and between Margaret's antics and her wry sense of humor and sarcasm, Donna Hill has crafted a tale that is sure to keep you in stitches. Filled with action and more than a few surprises DIVA'S INC. is the perfect summer read. While this is a light read, the author uses Margaret's journey to remind us of the importance of self-love and self-respect. As Margaret secretly creates her new identity, she ultimately learns that some sacrifices are too big to make and along the way learns the true meaning of being a diva.Reviewed by Stacey Seayof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Divas, Inc.","review":"I really wasn't impressed with this book for the simple fact that there was not enough storyline around the other characters. My favorite person was the grandma was my favorite cause she was the most interesting of all of them. Maggie to me gave up too soon for on the job that she was offered and were based on her job skills. I think she should have kept the job and still wrote her book. I also wanted to know more about Wayne, cause he seemed like a stalker, but a nice one. Either way, I have enjoyed other books of Donna Hill. This one kept my interest, however I just didn't feel it all the way."},{"Title":"Divas, Inc.","review":"I tried reading this book twice and I could not finish it. It just couldn't hold my attention.

I read the book in one day (and I'm a mother of 3 including a 1 year old) due to it's easy flowing humor and cute lead-ins. Maggie did get on my nerve but it her 'grandmother' and the story that followed her as well as the other supporting characters, that actually held my attention not to mention my wanting to see how and when Maggie's newfound world would come crumbling down.

At first, I actually confused this book with Mary Monroe's \\"In Sheep's Clothing\\" because of the similar storylines. That doesn't mean these two books are copycat novels though. Diva's Inc is about a secret Diva Society that Margaret finds herself engrossed in (I predicted who the Grand Diva was. Donna gives a few clues). Like \\"In Sheep's Clothing\\", this is a story that someone who is tired of the routine of everyday life will find interesting. The main character sheds her \\"boring\\" persona and adopts a life that she finds more fulfilling and exciting, but is it really?Overall a good read for a lazy afternoon. And by the way, my favorite Character is Virginia, the dog."},{"Title":"Divas, Inc.","review":"I picked this book up in Target days before getting on a plane for vacation.

I loved the humor, the designer name dropping was not at all excessive. The plot, at times a little predictable was intriguing enough to keep my glued to the book until the end. Towards the end the book became rushed and lacking the original humor and zest of the rest of the book. I would definately recommend this book to anyone who's willing to listen! Definately a good read!"},{"Title":"Divas, Inc.","review":"Divas Inc. takes a comedic look at Margaret Drew. Margaret Drew is the third, unpopular, and rather plain wheel to Divas Tiffiany and Chantel. Tiffany and Chantel's motto in life is \\"Don't you want to be me?\\" Tiffany and Chantel are so stuck up that when they all attended Columbia University, anyone who attended on scholarship were poor. She has known them forever, but she wishes her life was more like their life. Money, great places to live, men, awesome clothing and popularity. Margaret thinks she will finally get her chance when Tiffany and Chantel decide to go on a 6 week jaunt to Europe leaving Maragret behind to watch their homes. That's when the real adventure begins. Margaret has learned early in her life to pretend to be what she wasn't, and she decides to expand on that by wearing Chantel's and Tiffany's outfits, driving Tiffany's Jag, and dating their men. She is still upset that she was not invited to go on the trip with them.Margaret has lunch with her friend and coworker Larry everyday. She embellished what Larry did for her company, and the scene when Chantel and Tiffany meet Larry is quite funny. When Maggie first goes to check on Tiffany's dog and home she meets Chiropracter Wayne Hathaway. Wayne's character was not expanded enough about me. All I got from reading the book is that he is nosey, but he was very kind to Margaret's Grandmother. Margaret finds out that Tiffany does not cook, she is the take out food Queen. Margaret starts her Diva training after opening a package that was delivered by an old high school friend, named Willie. In addition to Willie working for Federal Express, he is also a career thief.When Margaret would stick her nose in the air, Wayne would think Margaret is having a back spasm and adjust her. That was so hilarious to me. Margaret is placed in charge after her boss Mr. Fields has a heart attack. Margaret learns being in charge has it's pitfalls, and one of those pitfalls is her friendship with Larry. Margaret will stop at nothing to be a Diva, so she watches the videos, reads the books, registers to attend a major event to meet the Grand Diva and reads Chantel's diary.There is one line I really liked in the book. \\"Men. They're just like buses. For hours you don't see one and then they come in bunches. \\" Margaret starts eves dropping in the ladies room to overhear what people are saying about her. Margaret goes out with both James and Calvin and develops feelings for both men, and they develop feelings for her.The scene where Maggie meets cleaning lady Cybils is hilarious. Especially being the dog hid under the love seat and would not come out until Sybil left.Margarets Grandmother had so much wisdom, even though she acted a little off at times. I would not mind a book that focuses on Grandma and Margaret's mother, because you really did not get much information on her. I know the story was Margaret's, but it would have been nice to get some background on their characters as well. By the end of the book Margaret is in so much trouble she has no choice but to face the music.Margaret goes to the Diva soiree, but taking Willie as her date proved detrimental. He decided to rob every one of their jewels and wallets. Margaret does not get to meet the Grand Diva, but turns out she knew the Grand Diva all along.When Willie and Margaret try to return to Tiffany's house, they find Tiffany arriving home early. Margaret knows she is in trouble now, not only has she ruined Chanetel's dress, but Tiffany's house is a mess.Maggie thought she was invisible and insignificant, but turns out she had everything she needed to be a Diva inside her all along. I really liked when Margaret's Grandmother said the following: \\"You think you want what someone else has until you actually have it. Then you realize it's not all that you thought it was.\\"This book was a lot of fun to read, and Grandma had a lot of wisdom to share.The only question that did not get answered was how could Margaret's mother just up and quit her job?This book is so different from other books Donna Hill has written. The comedic spin took me by surprise, but was very welcome. I often found myself laughing out loud and having to wipe my eyes with tissue from all the crying I did while laughing. This is a book that is worth reading. Just be prepared to laugh and shake your head in amazement over Margaret's antics. The Diva test at the end of the book is fun to take."},{"Title":"Divas, Inc.","review":"I saw this book in Essence and recommended it for my book club. I did think that the book was funny and entertaining, but it really lacked substance, and I was disappointed that I was able to guess who the Grand Diva was halfway through the book. I thought that the plot had promise, and I appreciated the lessons in self reliance and self confidence that Margaret learned. But why perpetuate the myth that black women have to be \\"Diva's\\" with overpriced clothing and fancy cars in order to succeed? Why would Margaret have to do so much lying to learn these simple lessons? (She could have asked someone, or read a self-help book.) Considering her proximity to the Grand Diva, how is it even possible that Margaret grew up NOT learning these things, while her best friends had the \\"inside track\\" all along? And why were her \\"Diva\\" friends dressing up in disguise and slumming in the ghetto???? Donna Hill never explains what that was all about. Overall, there were so many little things that didn't make sense, and a few threads of the story that the author never tied together. I do not regret buying the book, because I want to support black authors. But, Donna Hill had a good story line. She could have delivered more."},{"Title":"Divas, Inc.","review":"Tiffany Lane, Chantel Hollis, and Margaret Drew are all best friends. Margaret was the plain jane 3rd wheel of the group.

A very good read."},{"Title":"Divas, Inc.","review":"This was probably one of the worse books I have ever read. It was all I could do to make it to the end of the book.

The heroine in this novel was quite pathetic."},{"Title":"Divas, Inc.","review":"I haven't had this much fun reading a book in a long while. In the beginning it started off sort of slow but once it got going I was in stitches.

Overall I enjoyed it and I read it in 2 days."},{"Title":"Daniel Defoe's Journal of the plague year (Longman's English classics)","review":"In this documentary novel, Defoe sketches poignantly the irrational behaviour of man under extreme circumstances, when death threatens behind every corner of the street.People turned to fortune-tellers, astrologers or conjurers who deluded them. They became the victims of \`doctors' selling \`infallible preventive pills'. They \`swarmed to a wicked generation of pretenders to magic and black art'.People were terrified by the force of their imagination and saw representations and appearances in clouds. Their impudence increased by using devilish blasphemous language.Others risked their lives by stealing and plundering without any regard to the danger of infection.Man behaved as a mad dog.The Government encouraged devotion, public prayers, fasting and humiliation to implore the mercy of God to avert the dreadful judgment. \`Many a penitent confession was made of crimes long concealed.'Innumerable religious sects and divisions fought for the souls of the condemned. It was \`altar against altar'. The discourses of the religious ministers were full of terror, prophesying evil tidings.Unfortunately, religion was not the solution: \`the best physic against the plague was to run away from it.' People who believed in predestination (\`tis the hand of God, there is no withstanding it') and stayed home, were infected too and died by thousands.For Swift \`there was no apparent extraordinary occasion for supernatural operation, it was really propagated by natural means.'The near view of death reconciled men of good principles one to another.But as the terror of infection abated, things all returned again to the course they were in before.More, after the plague, \`people, hardened by the danger they had been in, were more wicked and more stupid, more bold and hardened, in their vices and immoralities.'In this impressive panorama, worth a Breughel or a Hieronymus Bosch, the only weakness is the lack of some kind of plot.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Daniel Defoe's Journal of the plague year (Longman's English classics)","review":"Much more interesting than I could have imagined. Written by the author of Robinson Crusoe. If I have my dates correct, Daniel Defoe was about 5 years old when the Great Plague hit London. He wrote this journal when he was 62 years old, and wrote what he recalled of the plague. It obviously left a great impression on him. (He wrote this journal 3 years after he wrote Robinson Crusoe -- again if I have all my dates correct -- he wrote Robinson Crusoe at age 59 years age.) Robinson Crusoe and Journal of the Plague Year are both on Harold Bloom's Western Canon reading list."},{"Title":"The Dancing Queen","review":"I had this book as a small child. The illustrations are totally beautiful, and the story is lovely too....though, at the end, is somewhat confusing.It begins where Queen Ermalinda -- a totally beautiful blonde lady, is in the midst of preparing for the annual dance festival for her kingdom, (or is that queendom?) \\"...All the deserving children\\" in the land were given dancing lessons....and there is a lovely black and white illustration (amidst all the other, colour illustrations), wherein 8 or 9, (or maybe 10), little girl dancers are all shown in a row, in sillouette, but their tutu skirts are drawn without sillouette).\\"Fat Martha\\" is at the piano, as they practice. (The appelation of the name \\"Martha\\" with the word \\"fat\\" stayed with me for a long time....and, years later, it took a while for me to accustom myself, years later, to a svelte, thin Martha Stewart!)Then the Queen gets an inspiration. She wants OTHER kinds of dancing for her festival/recital. So she sets off for various countries, to gather different sorts of dancers.She goes to China, where she convinces the sisters, \\"Sing Hi\\" and \\"Sing Lo\\", (about 9 years old), to join her. She goes to Mexico, (or another Latin American country not specified), and convinces brother and sister, \\"Delores\\" and \\"Emmanuelo\\", (about 14 and 15 years old), to go with her. Then she goes to the Deep South, where she meets \\"Sambo\\" and \\"Ivory\\", two little black boys,(who seem about 8 years old, and appear to be twins), who wish, \\"they never again had to pick cotton\\" to join her. (It is true that all of these children may be stereotypes of their countries and dancing...but they are all presented in a sympathetic manner, and, to me at least, seemed real people, with real problems.) All of these children appear to be orphans. as no parents, (or guardians either), are ever mentioned.At the end, Queen Ermalinda takes these new dance acts back with her. They are a great success at the royal dance recital....but they then remain with her, in \\"her kingdom in the sky\\". S_P_O_I_L_E_R____A_L_E_R_T_____This is where the confusion started, (and continues to this day), in my mind. Up until the very last page, it seems that Queen Ermalinda ruled over a fictitious kingdom -- never named -- but quite certainly suposed to be a very real area, and on Earth. Then, on the last page, (in fact, in the last sentence), these new dancers, (and all others), are taken up byQueen Ermalinda into her \\"kingdom in the sky\\". Is this a reference to the Christian concept of the \\"Second Coming\\"? I don't think so....because they all went to a \\"kingdom in the sky\\", not returning to Earth. Is Queen Ermalinda, then, a benevolent angel of death? It sure didn't seem so, until that last page and last sentence. I am sure that the authoress, Ruby Finst, knew why she ended the book this way....but for me, (and I believe many, many of her other child -- and adult -- readers), it's a real surprise ending...with no explainations for it at all.The beautiful colour drawings in this book are all lithographs. The book is oddly-shaped, much wider than it istall. It is a true treasure, and I only wish I had not thrown out my own copy years ago, in a vain attempt to clean my room. (As a brunette, I also had colored over the Queen's beautiful blonde hair, and made it black). The book remains as a true work of art, both in words and pictures, and if you can buy a copy, (I've seen them from $69 on Amazon, to over $200 in other places), I'd avise you to do so, and add this undoubtedly beautiuful classic to your personal library. But the story -- at least the last page of it -- remains, to me at least, \\"a puzzlement\\"."},{"Title":"The Dancing Queen","review":"This was my favorite childhood book. The book features lovely full page color illustrations of children from different countries and ethnic backgrounds in native settings. The richness of the illustrations is rare for that period prior to modern CMYK color separation. The story is sweet and charming and any little girl would be so inspired by this book. A true gem!"},{"Title":"How to clean everything;: An encyclopedia of what to use and how to use it","review":"This is a terrific resource for those of us who find that things get stains, or are otherwise messed up.

Did you get tomato sauce on a shirt or on your pants? Page 294 gives some tips. First, sponge the stain as soon as possible with cold water. This may take care of the problem (although it never does for me). Second, if a stain remains, \\"work undiluted liquid detergent into the stain and rinse\\" (page 294). Normally, this takes care of the problem for me. . . .There are many other hints. Including what to do with stains on rugs or how to clean refrigerators or how to clean walls or cleaning out sinks. . . .This has been a good book for me; I have taken care of many problems by referring to this book. Does the advice always work? No. Does it usually work? Yes."},{"Title":"Flagellation & the Flagellants: A History of the Rod in All Countries from the Earliest Period to the Present Time","review":"This book is a classic on the subject of corporal punishment. It was published somewhere in the 19th century, and there have been several reprints in the 20th century. This edition is a facsimile reprint of the (original ?) 19th century edition. The editorial review gives a good description of the contents, and since it is a classic, there is really no point in making a review on the contents. If you are interested in the subject, this is one of the very few books you can buy. Since it was written in a period that corporal punishment was very normal, the contents did not suffer under Political Correct censorship. Although it is a well produced high quality book, the price of $... is a bit very steep. Unless you can buy it for considerably lower price (like I did) I would advice you to buy another edition of the same book. There is a much cheaper soft cover version from another publisher."},{"Title":"Flagellation & the Flagellants: A History of the Rod in All Countries from the Earliest Period to the Present Time","review":"William M. Cooper is a master of his subject. This book is a toprate work of history, albeit on a narrow aspect of history, corporal punishment. The book lives up to its ambition of giving an account of the history of corporal punishment i all parts of the world, from ancient times up to the 19th century, when the book was written."},{"Title":"Dark sleeper","review":"Though you find this book categorized under Science Fiction, you shouldn't expect any spaceships. 'Dark Sleeper' is a complex work of realistic fantasy, and only the first in a series of books that the reader will look forward to reading even before finishing this introductory novel. Yes, there are hints of possible parallel universes, and some ties to the world we are familiar with. But the tenor of this novel is such that it reads like the horror novel Dickens never wrote, the lost collaboration between HP Lovecraft and Arthur Conan Doyle. There are explicit references to both 'The Call of Cthulhu' and the Holmes and Watson stories, but the combination that Barlough strikes is very unique, and never seems derivative.Barlough uses a rich, Victorian-style prose to create a world much like our own, but one in which mammoths and 'sabre-cats' co exist with stagecoaches and gas-lit streets. To the inhabitants of this Victorianized Wild West that never was, these things are normal. It's the walking dead, the flying demons, the breached ship in the harbor that refuses to sink that send the characters into action.Like Dickens, Barlough spends a lot of time with his characters, filling in every detail so that the readers can better enjoy their predicaments and better believe in this unreal world he creates. The storytelling style that Barlough uses is a character as well, for we are occasionally reminded that someone is narrating the tale. The finished weave is complex and satisfying.Fans of Stephen King and Peter Straub's 'The Talisman' will enjoy this book, as well as those who liked Mark Frost's 'The List of Seven' and Tim Powers' 'The Anubis Gates'. It's a surprising blend of the weird and the gentle, for unlike many books in the Dark Fantasy/almost horror genre, it doesn't go overboard with violence, gore or general depravity, and it certainly doesn't suffer as a result. 'Dark Sleeper' is highly recommended; it's worth your time, your money, and when you're finished, you'll certainly want to visit Barlough's peculiar corner of the world again."},{"Title":"Dark sleeper","review":"This tale is written with a great degree of style, with obvious borrowings from Dickens, both in terms of the language and composition of the narrative, as well as the bevy of Pickwickian characters. Similarly set within an alternate world that could easily front for 19th century England, but for the presence of Pleistocene mammals and a post-apocalyptic destruction of Europe, the author goes to great lengths to echo and reinvent the Victorian masters prose within the context of contemporary fantasy fiction. In terms of the prose, he is largely successful, recapturing Dickens often mocking, at times sardonic humor in his portrayal of his characters, using authorial intrusion to emphasize observations of character and setting, as well as to establish authorial imprimatur. If the author had achieved as much in terms of the content of his story as he has in terms of style, this story would have proven more successful. Unfortunately, the plot at times seems more in the service of the authors stylish characterizations and compositional conventions, in the end too neatly wrapped up and declaratively presented to be convincing.Despite an earlier reviewers observations, I found this story more macabre than frightening, offering little in the way of true suspense. Though several short episodes of horror take place early in the story, they are presented in a manner more strange than horrifying, the bulk of the first two hundred pages devoted primarily to characterization and setting than any unfolding of plot. As events begin to progress in the latter half of the book, more often than not the foundation of what is happening is presented as exposition, doing much to enervate any real presence of suspense, as well as contributing to a sense of contrivance in the manner of which the author has chosen to handle and reveal his plot line. Everything falls in place at the storys conclusion too abruptly and conveniently to be convincing, and the summation taking place in the postscript, while a common 19th century literary convention, true to the authors stylistic choice of composition, only contributes further to the readers sense of mild disappointment after having been led on for almost five hundred pages.While I do feel this novel represents an example of style superseding substance, there is little question as to the authors success in terms of his prose. As this is a first novel, and the author shows great skill in his composition, characterization and description, as well as his ability to mirror literary mannerisms, little doubt exists in my mind that, should the author be able to develop and improve his story telling abilities, one could expect great things of Mr. Barlough in the future. He is an author who I will continue to watch."},{"Title":"Dark sleeper","review":"Jeffrey Barlough's 'Dark Sleeper' is a masterpiece. Barlough weaves his prose delicately and powerfully. This is a book that doesn't turn up often anymore. Barlough's words are reminiscent of the greatest authors from decades past; Melville, Dickens, Conan Doyle.The coastal town of Salthead is disturbed when the ghost of a deceased sailor begins to haunt its citizens. Who are these diffident newcomers to Salthead, Mr. Hunter and Mr. Hilltop? Will evil Josiah Tusk ruin the local mammoth-transport trade? I won't say more for fear of giving it all away.Words cannot express the depth and soul of 'Dark Sleeper'. The characters are lively and real. The setting is gorgeous. Even though the sun is shining outside, while I read this book I feel as though I'm wreathed in fog. Barlough's writing brings to mind that of Tim Powers (who, not coincidentally, has written a cover blurb). I wouldn't be surprised if in future generations, this book is pointed to as a classic of the genre. Regardless of others' opinions, 'Dark Sleeper' is a book that I will recommend to friends and foes alike. It's made my very, very short list of books that I must have on my bookshelf. I give it my very highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Dark sleeper","review":"It seems as though Mr. Barlough is more in love with he English language as spoken in the 1800s than he is devoted to the developement of his plot. There is page after page of meaningless dialogue among - admittedly interesting - characters, which does nothing to advance his plot.For a book with demons and aristocracy from the Etruscan culture, come back to lay claim to domination over humanity, still existent Mastadons and sabre-tooths, and reference to some cataclysm called &quot;the sundering&quot;, the plot promises much but just plods only to be loosely tied up at the end. The book jacket references a Professor Tiggs as the protagonist, we are to suspect.For awhile it seems as though Prof. Tiggs and his doctor friend will be off an a joyful and dangerous escapade such as Holmes and Watson. This never happens! Tiggs does nothing in this book, except listen to others tell him about horrifying events.I could have loved this book if it wasn't so slow. I liked the authentic Dickensian language, I thought the characters were interesting (to a degree), but this was just terribly unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Dark sleeper","review":"One of the impacts of twentieth century culture on the art of novel writing has been an increased emphasis on the importance of plot. In my more sarcastic moments I blame this on the rise of the cowboy movie. We have become adventure story addicts, and are perplexed when something doesn't happen in every paragraph. In earlier years, plots were sometimes less developed, but emphasis was primarily on characters, dialog and description, i.e., on the power and beauty of the language itself. Too often, best selling books consist of nothing more than stick figure characters mouthing predictable verbiage as they run from event to event on a two-dimensional stage. These can still be fun to read, and there is such a thing as a well-written adventure story, but I sometimes miss the carefully crafted prose of our greatest storytellers.Fortunately, there are always authors who buck the trend. Recently, China Mieville stands out, with \\"Perdido Street Station\\" and \\"King Rat.\\" Now another new face has appeared, Jeffrey Barlough, whose first work, \\"Dark Sleeper,\\" is a tour-de-force of finely styled writing. Mr. Barlough, through his service as an editor or older English writing, has a delightful facility with prose, which he has used to concoct a story that is both horror story and lugubrious farce. Imagine, if you will, that \\"The Pickwick Papers\\" had been co-written Charles Dickens and H. P. Lovecraft.\\"Dark Sleeper\\" is hardly lacking in plot. Set in an alternate earth where the cataclysmic strike of a comet triggered an ice age during the 18th Century. The world is a wasteland, surrounding a narrow band where civilization managed to hang on. The story takes place in the prosperous town of Salthead \`an ocean and a continent' away from where France used to be. It is now three hundred years or more since the cataclysm, but for all practical purposes it is still the 18th Century. Carriages are horse drawn, and candles light the night. Other than a single, silver pocket watch there is no evidence of mechanization. Guns do not exist. The wilderness has reverted, and forests now abound with giant mammoths and saber-toothed tigers.Unexpectedly, Salthead finds itself haunted by the supernatural. An undead sailor wanders the streets and a ghost ship arises from the ocean. An ill-tempered mastiff becomes a creature from hell. There are rumors that a wizard has moved into the city and demonic figures are seen on cliff tops. Professor Titus Tiggs and his companion Dr. Daniel Dampe are determined to investigate. They come, via a harrowing carriage ride through the mountains to the village of Pease Pottage and the Eaton Wafers estate. There they uncover the roots of a terrible secret that has unleashed a nightmare from ancient times. Salthead and its environs is threatens by an immortal cultist who is determines to reinstate the time of ancient Italy, filling the world with the spirits of dead Etruscans.All this makes for a dandy plot. But what makes the book special is the author a great deal of time elaborating on the characters, their foibles and faults, and the rich fantasy landscape in which the action takes place. Subplots are introduced and worked to satisfactory conclusions in a novel clearly intended to survive more than one reading. There is already a second volume in preparation for the series. \\"Dark Sleeper\\" may not be for everyone, but I believe that it will greatly reward those readers who enjoy such entertainments."},{"Title":"Dark sleeper","review":"The problem with your typical fantasy novel is that it's so. . . typical. The quest, the young man or lady with unusually strong powers, the evil bad guy (or girl - let's be fair).This book has a fine dose of evil, but the rest is a breath of fresh air. If I had to pick a modern-day author to compare Barlough to, it would have to be Tim Powers. The writing is most reminiscent of Charles Dickens', but unlike Charles' novels, I had no trouble getting through this one.Instead I found myself drawn into an eerie world filled with incredibly charming characters. Even the &quot;bad&quot; guys are charming! This is storytelling at its finest. Nothing is predictable. We are made to experience the amazing events of this world through the eyes of some quite interesting people.The only problem I had with this book is that I felt compelled to share some of the many very funny scenes in this book with my husband, to find that he'd have to understand the backgrounds of the characters to fully appreciate them. Ah well, guess he'll have to read it too!So if you are in the mood to savor a different, spooky, funny and richly written novel, you definitely need to read this book. It's the same feeling you get when you go to see a great movie in the middle of a mediocre movie season. &quot;Finally!&quot;"},{"Title":"Dark sleeper","review":"This is one of the more unique novels that I have encountered in the last year. It has element of alternate history and science/fiction fantasy, but is equally a mystery in the tradition of Arthur Conan Doyle. Moreover, the writing is undeniably similar to Dickens, and his contemporaries.If I had to pick, I would have to classify this book as a mystery, because the other elements are mostly window dressing for a story that could occur in a multitude of settings. That's not to say the other elements aren't impressive; they most certainly are. The novel takes place in what is apparently a remote corner of Europe after some sort of extraterrestrial impact devastated most of the planet. Furthermore, either Ice Age mammals never died out, or they are enjoying a renaissance as a result of the cataclysm. This unusual, creative scenario help create a real sense of desperation and isolation among the characters. Although there lives are relatively comfortable, they have been marginalized and pushed to the brink, so anything out of the ordinary is an even greater cause for concern.As for the story itself, it's hard to comment without giving away details. Suffice it to say that it touches upon the supernatural, but not in the ways one might expect. Regarding some of the complaints I've seen about the book being anticlimactic, I think it is necessary to consider Barlough's style when leveling criticism. He seems to be a writer for whom the journey is as important as the conclusion. I happen to like this style of storytelling, but if you need non-stop action, this may not be the book for you.All in all, I found \\"Dark Sleeper\\" to be an original, witty novel with a remarkably unique narrative style. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Dark sleeper","review":"Barlough is a breath of fresh air. Well written dark fanstasy and horror that is also original is a rarity but he succeeds on both accounts splendidly. The characters are marvolous and well constructed as is the background plot. His ability to mimic 19th century english is superb. It feels like you are reading a Dickens novel until Barlough hits you with the horrors that tie the story together. My only real complaint is that the book sometimes gets dragged down in the plethora of subplots but since all the charaters are interesting and thier stories compeling i didn't once object. Not quite as strong as his second outing, &quot;House in the High Wood&quot;, but still highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dark sleeper","review":"Dark Sleeper is an odd duck of a novel, a Weird Tales-style story told in the form of a Dickens pastiche. Though perhaps unlikely sounding, the idea is reasonably fresh, a quality sorely lacking in currently published fantasy.Bafflingly, though, Barlough has chosen to pastiche not Dicken's skill with description and character, but his most annoying depictions of behavioral and verbal &quot;comic&quot; grotesquerie -- rather than capturing the tone and feel of Dickensian storytelling, Barlough instead conjures the most horrendous bits of Nicholas Nickelby and The Pickwick Papers, eccentrics talking nonsense for pages to finish out Dickens' weekly word quota.After fifty pages or so this gets pretty tired, but at least there's some nominally creepy Lovecraftian spookiness going on. This holds one's attention to mid-book, at which point the entire mystery is explained in thudding exposition. This recreates the worst of Lovecraft: the rare bits when he stopped to explain what hell was going on. From that point on Dark Sleeper is just silly.Still, two stars for intent: this isn't another cynically motivated would-be bestseller. Barlough clearly loves the material he pastiches -- he just hasn't managed to pull a successful novel out of it."},{"Title":"Dark sleeper","review":"I felt distinctly cheated after reading this book. I liked the characters and I liked the main theme, but I think the problem was that I expected the two to interact in some way and they really didn't, at least not in any active way. The characters just observe what is going on rather than participating, so there is no center to the book, I ended up not really caring what happens as there was no real conflict amongst the main characters to drive the story. Basically it's two books, the plot occurs amongst minor characters with little impact on the reader, and the main characters though interesting just stand around doing little."},{"Title":"On Kissing: Travels in an Intimate Landscape","review":"I loved this book. Adrianne Blue has put more research into everyone's favorite past time that before may have been taken for granted. This looks at the last few thousand years of history, philosophy, and persuits of love all around the world, and put it all into one book. With each chapter, a new idea is persued. The book begins with a quick glance of kissing and intimacy, to modern and past psychology, to the roles between men and women, to poetry through out the ages, and the belief over time of what a kiss really means. My favorite part of the book comes from a chapter 'Body and Soul', and how the two work together to make a kiss have the power that it does. With references to the bible and poets through the ages, shows how many people believe when two people kiss, it is their souls mingling. Food for thought that is nothing but delicious.This is the perfect book for anyone with a love for history, philosophy, and have a persuit of romance in their lives. More research on any one single little thing done so throughly I have ever seen. After reading this book, it always brings just a little more spark to every kiss. Thanks Adrianne Blue!"},{"Title":"On Kissing: Travels in an Intimate Landscape","review":"This is a fascinating,really drole book that tells you everything you always wanted to know about the meaning of a kiss: the quotations from films and fiction alone are worth the price of the book. i really like her theory of how all kisses are related, it is sort of mindblowing. i'll give the paperback to my Valentine."},{"Title":"On Kissing: Travels in an Intimate Landscape","review":"One quote should help you decide if this book is for you. \\"In a flash of interior light, I suddenly saw the link - the kiss continuum - the loop of unbroken meaning which informs every kiss ...\\" (p. 14 in my edition). Is there any such thing? If you see the link, you can see something I cannot. Maybe it is something only seen by people who get flashes of interior light. Do you think there is also a loop of unbroken meaning which informs every bowel movement? A bowel continuum?I have more questions for the author. Did she mean \\"the unbroken loop of meaning\\"? Loops can get broken, but can meanings get broken, and is that what she meant? Are there loops of broken meaning? Does she have any idea what she means, or what she is saying?The New Statesman called it \\"Scholarly, ...\\". But then, she worked there, so they would say that."},{"Title":"Real World Microsoft Access Database Protection and Security","review":"This book is exactly what it proports to be. It covers all the Access versions being used in the development world - 97 to 2003. It does not spend half to 2/3 of the book on basic Access tables, querries, reports or vb code that developers already know, but from the first page to the last covers security and protection.It uses real world examples and code to demonstrate how developers who are proud of their work can protect and secure their Access database so it operates as designed and your intellectual property is not avialable for all to see and use.Well written from a developer who is obviously using these techniques in his own business every day, the code and screen dumps are easy to follow and can be migrated straight to your current work.If you are a Access developer selling your work or having others use your work, this book is a must have. It will save time and money in the future by not having to maintain database that have been deliberately or inadvertantly changed. It is an area usually left to last in the development cycle then dropped at the end as too difficult with no return on your investment. This book shows with planning and little effort how easy it is to secure Access databases.A must have for any Access developer or power user."},{"Title":"Real World Microsoft Access Database Protection and Security","review":"Garry Robinson's book is well written and clear. He covers the security issues thoroughly. As one reads the book, it becomes clear that Microsoft has not and apparantly has no plans to beef up security for Access. It is plagued with holes. But the book provides methods for plugging these holes. Purchasers of the book can download an accompanying database with forms that assist developers with implementing security. These forms have saved me countless hours in programming. These savings alone pay for the cost of the book many times over.I spent quite a bit of time researching Access security through the Microsoft website and this was a complete waste of time. There are holes in the security that MS doesn't even mention (what a surprise).This book is well worth the money for anyone who is serious about securing their proprietary efforts."},{"Title":"Real World Microsoft Access Database Protection and Security","review":"I recently purchased Garry's book. It provided me security solutions that I never read in any other Access book before.Every subject is described in great detail and the downloadable sample forms and functions make it easy to quickly create a secure database.When I got stuck on an issue, I emailed Garry and asked his team for some advice. I wasn't sure if anyone on his team would even respond. However, Garry himself answered the question within less than 1 hour and provided me the answer to the problem.Now -- in my opionion -- that absolutely awesome!!!"},{"Title":"Real World Microsoft Access Database Protection and Security","review":"This has got to be the best MS Access resource book that I have purchased. Like others, I have found MS Access security hard to understand but with Gary Robinson's help I am now getting a grasp on how I can keep sensitive data secure. The book is aimed at those who are new to security as well as those with experience. Also, the downloable database, with forms and code that you can easily use in your own applications, is a real time saver.I especially like how he has broken down the overview for each chapter with segments aimed at Developers, DBA's and the IT Managers. In these overviews he explains what in the chapter is important to the reader by their role. The book is arranged so you can easily locate the information you need and not have to go through the whole book to be able to accomplish your security goal. But I recommend that you do read the entire book as it has so much to offer! I am on my second read through."},{"Title":"Real World Microsoft Access Database Protection and Security","review":"Somehow I find myself responsible for security of an Access database and am learning as I go. Until I found this book, workgroups were a mystery and very easily messed up.The way this book is written is precisely what I needed, as a novice to much of this stuff. Being able to set up and maintain an Access database on one PC is a totally different animal from using SQL and a front-end on a network and making it all secure. First the author says what he's going to teach, then he outlines how he will present the information and why, and then he proceeds to the real meaty stuff. Because of this you understand which sections particularly apply to what you are doing. My copy already opens automatically to Chapter 8 where I have to admit I needed to start more than once. That is more a function of my lack of knowledge than of the way the chapter is written. The notes and tips are all gems. The instructions are clear and don't leave out any steps. There are details and screen shots all the way along that make it clear if you have made a mistake before you get too far past it. For example, page 262, step 7 my copy has a note added in pencil by me, first time through 'This didn't happen' - should have been a warning but I kept going. Had to go back later and correct things. It taught me to trust the instructions to the letter and not to proceed until what I am doing matches what is in the instructions.' I told you I was a novice! Too many computer manuals are written for the advanced expert - we're not all advanced experts! This book has been exactly what I needed.Maybe it's because Garry hails from down under. Maybe New Zealanders and Australians think differently - whatever it is, this ex-pat Kiwi is glad to have found this book."},{"Title":"Real World Microsoft Access Database Protection and Security","review":"I have known Garry for quiet some time, and was surprised that he had a book in him! I have read many of Garry's journal articles and subscribe to his newsletter and have always found his comments and tips useful - I never thought this would amount to a book. I thought a book on Access security? And then I read it! There is no other resource available that has collated and explained everything you need to know about access database security. SO many other books spend a paragraph or two on how to manage work groups and then they and the other books casually mention that if you really want security move on to SQLServer. Well while that is all well and good some business can not afford SQlServer, and for some corporations, Access provides all of their business needs except the security part. So from a developer's point of view the pit falls and work arounds to finally secure Access Databases are presented in a well thought out and presented book. Good Work Garry!"},{"Title":"Real World Microsoft Access Database Protection and Security","review":"A good book will find the reader. I would like to thank Mr. Robinson for a well written read. Besides all the other things I have in my life to do I was able to finish his work in about two weeks. I have read all the other reviews; there is nothing I can add. I can however tell you that if you are into Access database (and you know if you are) then this book is an imperative. I have had many books on Access database pass my way, nothing compares with Mr. Robinsons' book on security and protection.Mr. Robinsons' is the first technical book on Access I have ever read from cover to cover with a never ending want to turn the page to see what Mr. Robinson was going to teach me next. I'm going to begin a reread of his work and this time I'm going to use the examples with both Northwind and my own database to incorporate his methods; especially enjoying combining the OS and workgroup security to provide my data a secure base from my clients, friends and enemies.His book provided me ample margin to take copious notes along with my read, it will prove helpful in preparing for deployment. Mr. Robinson is a professional database administrator and this book is written as from such, you will think like he does at the end of this read and be the better for it. Mr. Robinson is a wonderful dbase admin, author, and now teacher. Again many thanks for his efforts and a heartfelt appreciation for my newly gained knowledge. Should Mr. Robinson ever have a worldwide tour on the subject, sign me up.All of the reviews are positive, I suggest a review of Mr. Robinsons' Table of Contents and more important, the wonderful Index. A review of these documents will give you better insight into the level of Access database security Mr. Robinson clearly and distinctly explains.

I think that it will save me 50 to 100 hours of work and it gives me the confidence that my application will have the best available security.It's loaded with code examples and the book contains links to the author's website that has sample files (by Access version). The book also contains cross reference to sites created by others.The author's sample files contain forms (by Access version) that you can easily import into your Access application to toggle different security and user interface options. The book also contains instructions on how to test the implementation of various security strategies (to make sure you've got it right).As the author points out, truly securing an Access application ranges from: controlling the user interface, to ensuring a consistent application, to thwarting hackers (or just curious eyes), to backing up the data within the application. Entire chapters are devoted to individual concepts (as opposed to the frustrating few paragraphs in other books or Access documentation).I highly recommend this book to anyone developing an Access application or anyone responsible for maintaining an Access database. Read it before any roll out or if you have an active Access application, read it immediately to plug any undiscovered holes.Walter M.Greenlawn, New York"},{"Title":"Real World Microsoft Access Database Protection and Security","review":"I had studied several textbooks on Access security, but the differences in workgroup files across versions and differences in available DAO and ADO tools remained very confusing. Garry Robinson's step by step explanation of available security is very easy to understand and implement.

It begins in August 1963 when Merton was living as a part-time solitary and traces the gradual expansion of the amount of time he was allowed to spend at the hermitage until he was allowed to take up full-time residence there in August 1965. This volume concludes at the end of 1965 allowing us to see Merton's reflections on his first few months as a hermit.Some parts of this journal will already be familiar to readers as it contains journal entries that were prepared for publication by Merton in the journal A Vow of Conversation, as well as his account of his visit to meet the Zen scholar Suzuki and an early version of Day of a Stranger. Having said that, over half of the material in this journal is previously unpublished and even those parts previously published can read quite differently in their unedited form. Vow leaves the reader with the impression that Merton had effortlessly made the transition to life as a full-time hermit whereas, in Dancing, this transition appears far from easy and a visit from his former novice Ernesto Cardenal brings to the surface the instability Merton experienced with the move.Dancing in the Waters of Life begins with a masterful introduction by Robert Daggy which highlights the central movements in this volume - Merton's move to the hermitage, his movement into his middle years with increasing health difficulties, and his continuing efforts to work out the paradoxes in his life. At times in this journal we see Merton at his most free and yet, almost in the next sentence he can be highly introspective and obsessed with certain aspects of his life. This tension runs throughout this volume and, as Daggy points out, accounts \\"for the highs and lows, the joy and the despair, the enthusiasm and the carping.\\" (xii-xiii.) Merton's own sense of this continuing movement in his life, of the dance, comes over clearly in a passage he wrote in January 1964: \\"The need for constant self-revision, growth, leaving behind, renunciation of yesterday, yet in continuity with all yesterdays...my ideas are always changing, always moving around one center, always seeing the center from somewhere else. I will always be accused of inconsistencies - and will no longer be there to hear the accusation.\\" (67.)Dancing allows us the most direct contact with Merton of any of the journals yet published. The difficulties of this period which Merton writes about, the tensions, his continuing ill health and his coming to terms with middle age and the absurd world of the sixties can make this volume sound like the ravings of a man obsessed with himself. Yet there is a fine balance here between the madman and the prophet, as was frequently the case with the prophets of the Hebrew Scriptures. When one considers Merton's other writings of this time - Emblems of a Season of Fury, Seeds of Destruction, The Way of Chuang Tzu, Gandhi on Non-Violence, along with such classics essays as \\"Rain and the Rhinoceros,\\" and his \\"Message to Poets\\" - it is the stature of the prophet which becomes evident and this journal gives us an intimate insight into the dynamics of the prophet.In this journal we can see the sources to which Merton was turning for his own spiritual and intellectual nourishment. Of particular interest to Merton in this period are Rilke, Barth, Bultmann, and Sartre. The Church Fathers, scripture and the religious writings of other traditions are all evident along with a growing awareness of his natural surroundings, brought about partly through a growing closeness to nature and its rhythms in his life at the hermitage: \\"Came up to the hermitage at 4 a.m. The moon poured down silence over the woods, and the frosty grass sparkled faintly. More than two hours of prayer in firelight...Sweet pungent smell of hickory smoke, and silence, silence.\\" (93.)Although not as intensely involved in the peace movement as he was earlier in the sixties Merton's awareness of the issues confronting it is clearly still evident as is his grasp of a wide range of national and international issues - race relations and civil rights, the space race, American politics, Viet Nam and the effects of the Vatican Council.In all the journals of Thomas Merton references can be found to the various anniversaries that were important to him. In this journal the dominant such date is his fiftieth birthday. Throughout this journal Merton makes references to a variety of health problems and his fiftieth birthday provides the occasion for an extended reflection on his life connecting his present self with various moments in his life from Oakham, through Cambridge and Columbia to Gethsemani concluding \\"Why go on? Deo gratias for all of them.\\" (199.) As he approaches middle age Merton is more able to see the unity of his life and discovers, in the midst of his vulnerability, a new sense of happiness which he had not experienced previously writing \\"Lay in bed realizing that what I was, was happy. Said the strange word \`happiness' and realized that it was there...And I was that.\\" (177.)This is a journal full of movement, from Merton's daily journeys between the hermitage and the monastery, through his frequent visits to Louisville, to his first ever return visit to New York since entering Gethsamani. There is also the movement of his restless spirit, of his continuing debates with the abbot, the church and the wider society. The rhythm of this movement gives it at times the feeling of a dance, one in which Merton dances very lightly, touching on spiritual masters down through the ages and calling his reader to undertake the same dance in their own life and to join in the general dance of creation."},{"Title":"Turning Toward the World: The Pivotal Years (The Journals of Thomas Merton, Volume 4: 1960-1963)","review":"Thomas Merton has become, since his absurd death,many thingsto many people. Only with Pope John Paul II, in my estimation, has such a varried and vocal sparring been going on for legacies and interpertations{I actually do not know who will have the more influential leagcy. My guess is merton.}In this, the 5th volume of these magnificent diaries, Merton has begun the transition to hermit,such as it was.Much of the published writings from this period have the smooth polish of an editors hand. Not so with these entries. Merton still writes,to borrow a phrase from Ross Mcdonald, like a slumming angel,and his nuggets of insight into his own foibles, that of his brethren{his abbot, of course, comes off no better here than the previois volumes}comes through almost painfully at times.. His reading list is so varied and prodigiois, that coupled with his correspondence, I cannot fathom how he found time to write,never mind pray,and meditate . Herein I think is the true genius,a word that has become so commonplace that it has lost its power.Mertons powers of concentration must have been extraordinary,his ability to focus on the thing at hand, without losing interest in momentary gifts{the fire-light reflecting through a glass jar of honey, the sound of deer scurrying about in new fallen snow.]The Thomas Merton I encountered here is an adult,believer,long discarding the triumphialism of the newly converted,grwing more at peace. Of course, we know how this part of the journey ends,so reading this again with that in mind makes it all the more pointed,and still retaining its power. HAving read all 7 volumes, I look foward to re-reading them for I believe them to be that good, and certainly worth the time, effort and cost."},{"Title":"Turning Toward the World: The Pivotal Years (The Journals of Thomas Merton, Volume 4: 1960-1963)","review":"This fifth volume of Merton's Journals hits a home run, an analogy Thomas Merton would probably relish. I've read volumes 1 through 5, and here Merton hits his stride. The diarist in Merton contributes nearly everything within his vast sight and makes it important and touching. The lengthier review on this page covers the base ground admirably. One of the really interesting aspects of these journals is the inadvertently given bibliography of Merton's own reading material, everything from Elias Canetti to Barth to D. T. Suzuki! These volumes give us a whole and uncompromising look at Merton's innermost sensibilities, apparent in his formal oeuvre, but turned over and examined like a winter leaf in these journals. I think the various editors of these volumes, a different editor for each, deserve high praise for the consistency of tone in their editing, one volume to the next; a job done wisely and well. It is as well a tribute to the consistency of Merton's path over the years. He was a true monk, an authentic thinker in the best tradition, and a heck of a writer. When Thomas Merton writes, he never loses that clear-sky-with-stars timbre of voice, spending his real humility like gold, and awakening all the sleeping people. The more I read these journals the more I miss him. Noble and unforgettable."},{"Title":"Turning Toward the World: The Pivotal Years (The Journals of Thomas Merton, Volume 4: 1960-1963)","review":"The journals of Thomas Merton give us a unique insight into the day-to-day life of a truly extraordinary person and they demonstrate how Merton progressed in his own thinking and spirituality. This volume is particularly insightful because it covers the time during which Merton's hermitage experience became a reality. The daily entries detail the construction of the little concrete building on the hill overlooking the Abbey of Gethsemani first as a conference center where Merton would meet with various visitors, including members of other religious denominations, then as a place where he was allowed to go occasionally for his own spiritual privacy, next as a spot where he could live as a semi-hermit who would spend a day-and-night or two away from the abbey, and finally as Merton's permanent home when he became a full-time hermit. This journal reveals Merton as less frustrated than he appears in the previous volume, in part it must be presumed because Dom James, his ! abbot, seems to have become more sensitive to his desire for greater solitude. It is during this period that Merton reaches his 50th birthday and he writes on several occasions of impending death, almost as though he were anticipating that he would live only a few more years. Reading the daily life of Thomas Merton in his own words, in entries that he did not necessarily intend for viewing by others, provides the very best portrait of this truly complex, this inspired and inspiring man who was and would continue to be the greatest spiritual voice of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Turning Toward the World: The Pivotal Years (The Journals of Thomas Merton, Volume 4: 1960-1963)","review":"This book illustrates vividly the calms and the storms of living out a life of commitment.There is enough content in the book to effectively encourage the persevering christian who seeks to deepen his or her relationship with Jesus Christ.Notations on the daily life in the monastary,and the relationship Merton had with his fellow monks and superiors,serves to illuminate the fact that here we have no &quot;plaster saint&quot;, but man in all his frailty! Merton calls us,through this book,to live out our indiviuality with respect to the tradition from which we come. There is suberb referencing to all literature mentioned throughout the text,and the introduction summarises well the events in Merton's life to which these journals belong.If you are a Christian ,then this book will surely give you the thirst to deepen your relationship with Jesus,through prayer."},{"Title":"Turning Toward the World: The Pivotal Years (The Journals of Thomas Merton, Volume 4: 1960-1963)","review":"The fourth volume of Merton's journals - Turning Toward the World: The Pivotal Years, edited by Victor A Kramer - covers the period from May 1960 when volume three ended up until the end of July 1963. In his introduction Kramer describes this volume as \\"the basic documentary record of [Merton's] movement from cloister toward world, from Novice Master to hermit, and from ironic critic of culture to compassionate singer of praise.\\" (xix)After the crises of stability in A Search for Solitude Turning Toward the World is a radically different journal. At the end of volume three Merton vows to \\"find solitude outside geography.\\" In volume four we find Merton no longer searching for solitude elsewhere but finding it where he is, \\"instead of making plans, anticipating and doing other futile things, I am really going to simplify my own life here\\" (27) and Merton ask for the mercy he feels heneeds to do this:\\"Have mercy on my darkness, my weakness, my confusion. Have mercy on my infidelity, my cowardice, my turning about in circles, my wandering, my evasions.I do not ask anything but such mercy, always, in everything, mercy.\\" (28)- a mercy which had frequently been a theme over the course of Merton's monastic life.The Mount Olivet Hermitage provided Merton with the opportunity for greater solitude eventhough the time he was allowed to spend there was only very limited. Over the course of this journal Merton is allowed to spend greater and greater amounts of time at the hermitage but it is not until the summer of 1965 that he is finally allowed to resign his position as novice master and become a full-time hermit and, even then, Merton is obliged to keep up certain committments in the community such as giving a weekly conference.The years covered in this journal are well descibed as pivotal years for Merton - much was coming to fruit for him as Kramer points out in his introduction. But underneath this there is a new found sense of stability, a stability which is rooted in Merton's time in solitude, especially at the hermitage and in the Gethsemani woods.Merton's expanding horizons are clearly evident in this volume. His thinking on the monks relationship to the world along with his thinking on issues such as war, nuclear weapons and racial issues is found throughout this volume and illustrates the manner in which his thought regarding these and other issues developed. Writing in November 1961 Merton says:\\"Yesterday afternoon at the hermitage, surely a decisive clarity came. That I must definitely commit myself to opposition to, and non-cooperation with, nuclear war.\\" (182)From this period Merton's most outspoken writings on issues of war and peace developed, including the \\"Cold War Letter\\".An interesting insight to Merton can be gained through looking at the index for this volume. The index is by no means completely comprehensive and, this is true for other volumes of the complete journals as well, cannot be relied upon in ways that scholars might wish. But the index still illustrates the range of Merton's interests and thought in the early sixties and it is hard to comprehend the extent of it. Merton reaches beyond purely the boundaries of east and west or north and south and reaches out to all times and places. At one point he refers to the fundamental thought of people of other ages and other countries citing \\"Latin America - Greek Patristic period - Mt. Athos - Confucian China - T'ang dynasty - Pre-Socratic Greece\\" and laments his inability \\"of ever beginning truly to know and understand, to communicate with these pasts and these distances\\" yet feeling a \\"sense of obligation to do so, to live them and combine them in myself, to absorb, to digest, to \`remember.'\\" (42) In passages such as this we can see the background to the work of Merton's final years and, in particular, his final epic poem The Geography of Lograire.Underneath Merton's developing universal vision in this volume there lies a new stability and simplicity which will mark Merton's final years. Early on in the journal he writes:\\"Sat in the cool woods, bare feet in the wet grass, and my quails whirling near me for my comfort, and wrote a poem about a flower.\\" (16)Over the course of this journal Merton frequently refers to nature and his surroundings with a simplicity not present in earlier journals. There is a sense of wholeness and unity and central to this is the extra time Merton is allowed to spend in solitude at the hermitage. There are many passages which I could quote to illustrate this but one will have to suffice. In a passage in which Merton combines his natural surroundings and the solitude of the hermitage to give a sense of having, at last, found a home he writes:\\"Lit candles in the dusk. Haec requies mea in saeculum saeculi - the sense of a journey ended, of wandering at an end. The first time in my life I ever really felt I had come home and that my waiting and looking were ended.\\"A burst of sun through the window. Wind in the pines. Fire in the grate. Silence over the whole valley.\\" (79/80)In passages such as this Merton's talent for prose poetry leads the reader into stillness.Simplicity, mercy, stability and compassion all feature strongly in this journal. It is the most readable of the journals published so far and lack somoe of the convoluted arguments of earlier volumes which made them much harder reading than this volume. Merton's writing has a new clarity and yet, he is frequently dealing with more profound issues than previously."},{"Title":"Turning Toward the World: The Pivotal Years (The Journals of Thomas Merton, Volume 4: 1960-1963)","review":"I have always like Thomas Merton and have been a big fan of his work. I feel it is awesome"},{"Title":"Polaris Writings","review":"While the book covers Universal Intelligence, telepathic communications, energy symbols, and a myriad of new age subjects, it fails to go into any of them in any depth, and lacks support for things the author says is \\"dangerous\\", or even to give asny reason why the author thinks so, such as Astral Projection, or astral travel. while it is mentioned as being \\"dangerous\\", the author gives no real reason why this is so (well, they do babble about going outside spiritual boundries, etc. in a few paragraphs that are simply babble, but make no sense in reality), listing it under \\"Practices of Illusion\\" and totally disregards the fact that astral travel has been done for certuries by a number of religions in Africa, Asia, India, Native Americans and others - all who reguard it as a normal part of life... none have had the effects the authors claim it to have.The authors state in a chapter called \\"Practices of Illusion\\" things that are 'unnatural to the Spirit.'The author goes on and on about \\"universal thinking\\", yet then talks of dividing the spirit world and our world... saying basically that in the cross-over from one world to another, the 'immortals' basically don't get it... also that there are self-induced false images and deception, and so on. in spiritual experiences... ghosts unable to release themselves & exorcism sending ghosts back to the darkness (NOT- they are, in reality sent to the light)Although this book tries to use scientific words to describe something that cannot be tested in such a way, and seems to miss many, many points, it does touch on a lot of areas... but those areas seem to be misunderstood. I doubt either author has sat through an exorcism, ever talked to anyone who does astral projection or dream work on a regular basis. Nor do I believe they have a clue about the Universal Mind (the authors state it is created at the time of one's physical birth??? I think not!)Anyhow, lots of buzz words, lots of big words, very verbose, very little real content.... a disappointment in metaphysical books."},{"Title":"Polaris Writings","review":"If you are interested in learning more about the Polaris Writings without buying the book, you can go to the website at: [...]"},{"Title":"Polaris Writings","review":"I thought this book spoke to me on another level! There are some interesting concepts in this book, especially when it talks about the universal mind in relation to space and time. This is one of those books where you should be open minded and be aware that such profound information needs to be read slowly as there are some advanced concepts for those just getting into esoteric reading.Concerning what the last reviewer said about the Universal Mind, I do not think he understood the concept. I believe the Universal Mind to be God, the source of creation. Carl Jung among other visionaries conceived of the universe being able to think, dream and create. The great Albert Einstein said,\\"A human being is a part of a whole, called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest... a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.\\" Einstein was saying a universal truth so profound, and we can access the same consciousness, if we open our hearts and minds and listen to the words of the wisest men such as Jesus Christ, Deepak Chopra, Kuthumi, Buddha, Carl Jung, Albert Einstein and other enlightened beings.I think what the author meant about astral projection being dangerous is that those who are inexperienced are vulnerable to harm by lower level spirits and the body is vulnerable to take over when the astral body is away from the physical body. Also if you desire to shift to a higher consciousness there are superior ways to do this, such as meditation, prayer, fasting, eating a natural raw diet, music, and so forth.All in all, I enjoyed the book and recommend it for anyone who wants a fascinating, and overall positive book on expanding our awareness."},{"Title":"Los mares de la luna / The Seas of the Moon (Narrativa) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Conociendo la produccion de Luis Sagasti, desde su Dinamica Parmenidea, pasando por El canon de Leipzig, ahora su nueva novela le erige en uno de los mas prometedores novelistas de la literatura castellana.

On the one hand, the vibrant descriptions of the unparalleled natural world of the book's namesake region are worthy of five stars, hands down. Were the majority of words between the covers devoted to the appreciation of the tactile world in which the author traversed, this book would rank with the best 'man in the wild' writings out there. But just when I'd start taking root in the author's passionately described woods and waters, an uninvited editorial diatribe would douse my tranquil embers.It's not that I disagreed with Mr. Gruchow's societal observations - I actually agreed with him almost entirely throughout - I simply would have preferred factual accounts of his travels through the Boundary Waters - which I erroneously assumed referred entirely to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (a quarter of the book is spent on an island in Lake Superior) - instead of rambling opinions claiming wilderness essentially ceases to exist in today's world. I can't disagree with Mr. Cruchow's dominant claim, but I'm less interested in his social commentary and more interested in his experiences in the allegedly nonexistent wilderness.The author cannot be faulted for writing the book he wanted to write, but potential readers should know up front that only a portion of the book will sweep one away to the boundary waters.

Nathaniel Burt has written and researched about American Aristocracy since the beginning of America. Philadelphia may still have the old families like the Biddles, Rittenhouses, Cadawalders, etc. but they are not as prominent as they once were in their day or time. Philadelphia was the center of America's answer to gentry. Despite being American, Philadelphia aristocrats were not only wealthy but well-bred and related to American history. It isn't enough to be related. You don't want to be considered middle class if you want to establish yourself as a member of the exclusive gentry. Burt's writing is addictive to read especially if you are interested in the history of our country. Philadelphians have an enormous place in American history. They may not have the same prominence as they once did. Old money is still referred too highly over new money. Philadelphia may rival against New York City which has become the financial capital of the world and Boston for it's history but nothing beats Philadelphia for it's role in developing the American gentry. Despite how you feel about gentry, upper class, money, and society, Philadelphia is still very much about who your parents are and how much money you are. Although there is a great sadness is that the gentry are no longer as visible as they once were in downtown Philadelphia. They still have their country clubs and Episcopal churches but they are no longer exclusive. They have married outside their class, religion, and race over generations. The life of an American aristocrat might as well be on the endangered species list. Although Philadelphia was the central location of the country's gentry for a time, it still remains a place of history and reminds us of the ills of society such as the poverty, prejudices against racism and different cultures. No longer is Philadelphia is a gentry based culture. Rittenhouse Square has become a place that looks more like Greenwich Village with it's artist and alternative lifestyles. There are still some wealthy residents and maybe a few members of the gentry. In the last century, the gentry has moved to the Main Line suburbs and still practicing their way of life. It is there that they still remain and prosper hopefully but they encounter the same troubles as everybody else. This book is quite profound one of the best books on Philadelphia and the American gentry."},{"Title":"Business Psychology And Organisational Behaviour: A Student's Handbook","review":"I'm not a student of business psychology.

New readers will find a world opening around them that is as ancient as Aristotelian metaphysics and as new as quantum mechanics: a world that not only raises the mind to God, but that actually reveals Him-a world that is theophanic.Modern science bills itself as the great demythologizer, and it claims to show us the world the way it really is. The Wisdom of Ancient Cosmology demythologizes modern science.What is this myth that Smith exorcises? It is the reduction of the natural (\\"corporeal\\") world to the mere physical, which is only an abstraction. It is only to this abstraction that the instruments of modern science have access: objects emptied of their essence. The universe, Smith shows us, is neither a mere aggregate of particles, nor a mere aggregate of galaxies; the world is an icon to be read.This book is no rejection of the findings of modern science-Smith is himself a physicist and mathematician. Rather, it is a dialogue between \\"the wisdom of ancient cosmology\\" and modern physics, from quantum mechanics to astrophysics. And it is the ancient that sheds light upon the new.The book consists of twelve chapters (the summaries in parentheses are mine):I. Sophia Perennis and Modern Science: (Smith explains the split between the ancient and modern cosmological world-view)II. From Schroedinger's Cat to Thomistic Ontology: (how the distinction between the corporeal and the physical, and the Aristotelian categories of potency and act, shed light on quantum mechanics-an astounding thesis)III. Eddington and the Primacy of the CorporealIV. Bell's Theorem and the Perennial OntologyV. Celestial Corporeality: (the resurrected body)VI. The Extrapolated Universe: (a discussion of the \\"discrepancy between contemporary physical cosmology and the Patristic teaching concerning the creation and early history of the world\\")VII. The Pitfall of Astrophysical Cosmology: (a theological objection to Big-Bang cosmology on the basis of an understanding of ontological hierarchy)VIII. The Status of GeocentrismIX. Esoterism and Cosmology: From Ptolemy to Dante and CusanusX. Intelligent Design and Vertical Causality: (Smith addresses Darwinism and Intelligent Design theory)XI. Interpreting Anthropic Coincidence: (the new essay)XII. Science and the Restoration of CultureIncluded as an appendix is Seyyed Hossein Nasr's reply to the first chapter"},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Ancient Cosmology: Contemporary Science in Light of Tradition","review":"Wolfgang Smith is a \\"Traditionalist\\" writer inspired by Gu&eacute;non, Hossein Nasr and similar thinkers. He is also a Catholic, and seems to be mostly known for his attempts to square quantum physics with Thomist philosophy. While that project may have a certain intrinsic interest, many others ideas of Smith are fringy, to put it mildly.In \\"The Wisdom of Ancient Cosmology\\", Smith comes out as a geocentrist, claims that the universe is much smaller than suggested by modern science, and that the Big Bang theory is literally inspired by the Devil himself. (I always assumed it was Screwtape!)Even more disturbingly, Smith claims that the stars are made of a special, imperishable stellar substance - as suggested by the ancient philosophers and astronomers. He means this quite literally, no allegory intended. Apparently, the stars emit the divine light, too.And then there's the Moon...The Moon, too, is made out of a celestial-spiritual substance. But how come we don't see it that way? Surely, the Moon is made of solid rock! Smith concedes that it *looks* that way, but that's because we have blinkered material vision. What we're seeing is really an illusion. It's all in our minds. Even the moon rocks in our museums are illusory, at least to the extent that they seem to be solid, perishable matter. They are not. Hallelujah.Why not just deny the moon landing &aacute; la His Holiness A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada? Or is that too untraditional?Obscurantist drivel of this sort is mildly entertaining, to be sure, but only for so long...For more insight into this matter, see my review of \\"Root of All Evil? - The Original Program\\". :P"},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Ancient Cosmology: Contemporary Science in Light of Tradition","review":"This is a strange book written by a very intelligent individual. Dr. Smith, with an unwavering devotion to Platonic-Christian cosmology, does a very interesting job at reinterpreting modern science and modern philosophy in light of it. He makes much of parallels between the two, and always sides with the former when the two diverge significantly.Dr. Smith is no slouch. He's obviously done a lot of work in math, physics, and philosophy. This book is unique in that Smith has a real command of the physics he talks about. But read just a few pages into this book, and you will probably be thinking: Dr. Smith, your \\"much learning hath made thee mad\\" - to the extend that we find him even arguing for the validity of a geo-centric model of cosmology!First of all, he argues for a Christian/Gnostic/Platonic/Aristotelian understanding of the cosmos, but also sees it fit, from time to time, to invoke Hindu and even Buddhist philosophies to buttress his case, neglecting the fact that they (the latter especially) would dismiss his philosophy outright. Buddhists categorically deny the validity of essentialist thinking and any metaphysics of a \\"great chain of being\\", which Smith's philosophy is rooted in. Smith argues for a mystical apprehension of \\"essences\\". To me, this is as unenlightening in an approach to the question of reality as it always has been. I agree that the mystery of existence is mysterious indeed, but making up answers with dubious concepts (like the apprehension of essences, emanations, etc), which implode upon scrutiny, is not the answer.The problem here is that the Greek tradition is so large - and the questions of science so multitudinous - that it is much too easy to merge the two and make a (seemingly) convincing synthesis. The problem is that you can do this with ANY philosophical system with similar (if not contradictory) results (Buddhistic for example). Ultimately Smith's explanations of physics in light of Greek philosophy represent an arbitrariness in that he has chosen to view the world as the philosophical tradition most palatable to himself describes it.I was drawn to read a book like this for various reasons. For one, I acknowledge many limitations to a purely quantitative account of the nature of reality. Right in the beginning of the book, I found some thing which resonates with where my own thoughts have been taking me. Smith discusses the legacy of Descartes, writing, \\"he supposes...that a res extensa is bereft of all sensible qualities, which obviously implies that it is imperceptible. The red apple which we do perceive must consequently be relegated to res cogitans; it has become a private phantasm, a mental as distinguished from a real entity. This postulate, moreover, demands another: one is now forced--on pain of radical subjectivism--to assume that the red apple, which is unreal, is causally related to the real appeal, which however is not perceptible.\\"OK, so far I was following Smith here. But then, through a short series of arbitrary assertions, he goes on to say (bracketed words mine),\\"What we need above all to realize is that the cognitive union [of perception and the object of perception] cannot in truth be consummated within the confines of the universe, which is and remains external to the human subject. There are light waves and sound waves, and there is brain function, to be sure; and these external or objective processes do no doubt play a necessary role. But they do not--they cannot!--constitute the perceptual act; to affirm that they do would be...to reduce 'knowing' to 'being.' The act itself, therefore, transcends perforce the bounds of space, and must by the same taken be conceived as instantaneous or atemporal as well. The perceptual act, thus, is literally 'not of this world.'\\"Smith's philosophy can only be as good as his foundations, and if this sort of thing constitutes his foundations, then Smith's philosophy is, in the end, bad. What presumption! There is nothing in his explanation which indicates why perception must be beyond space and time and the universe. He simply asserts this as if it were not only obvious, but meaningful. It is neither. It is absurd.Furthermore, why can't \\"knowing\\" be reduced to \\"being\\", as if we actually have a definition of what either of these words ultimately mean? For someone who denounces Descartes' \\"bifurcation\\", Smith sure does play into that duality, so much so that he must leave behind space and time to recover the act of perception!A final note, being a radical and holding a minority view, Smith takes the polemical tone of one at points, as if his views were such an obvious alternative to all of present thought. For a more readable (and in many ways, more responsible) presentation of the same basic ideas, I would recommend HUSTON Smith's \\"Beyond the Post-Modern Mind\\".3/5 stars because of the author's credentials and because the material is indeed interesting."},{"Title":"Chase The Dawn","review":"This romance is sure to entice every reader!

I would reccomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Wild Baron (Baron Series)","review":"The Wild Baron is quite simply one of the most delightful booksI've read. I applaud the panache and aplomb with which CatherineCoulter has created this diverting Regency-era tale of romance andsuspense. While the spine of the book calls it simply a novel, it is part romance, part mystery, part pure farce. It is pure delight, especially for those ex-or-about-to-be-ex Catherine Coulter fans. This book will change your mind. It changed mine.At the start of this clever tale, Rohan Carrington, Baron Mountvale, sets out to uncover a mystery. How is it possible that his cold fish of a younger brother supposedly &quot;ruined&quot; one Susannah, whom he wed and left penniless before he died? After all, it is Rohan who is the family rake, upholding the reputation of both his studly father and magnificently debauched mother, known throughout England for their charm and philandering ways.But Rohan is not at all what he seems. Trust me. He is a delightful, wonderful hero who gets caught up in a mystery and falls in love along the way with Susannah, who wasn't at all lucky with his dead brother George. Susannah, her younger brother, and her little daughter Marianne , are gathered up by Rohan and moved to his country estate, where he plans to look after them and falls in love along the way.As does Susannah, her younger brother, and her little daughter Marianne, because Rohan is, as I said, a pretty wonderful fellow. Unfortunately, someone wants something that Susannah has, only she doesn't know what it could be. As the mystery unravels, we meet Rohan's beautiful and youthful mother, a close friend of Rohan's who could well be the hero of a sequel, along with some of George's unsavory friends, who, along with another brother to Rohan, are up to absolutely no good, no good at all.What with cat races, a limerick-singing horse trainer, a miniature map and tiny key, dead Bishops, reliquaries, etc., Catherine Coulter takes the reader on a fast-moving ride throughout the English and Scottish countryside. There's a mystery to be solved and Rohan must prove to Susannah that what men and women can do for each other is lovely, not disgusting.Say what you will, but Catherine Coulter can write a great love scene when she wants to. Surprisingly, this book seemed a bit tame , but my sense is that this book is being marketed more toward the mainstream, so perhaps that's why.The Wild Baron is utterly captivating. It is a quick, funny, suspenseful read filled with lovable lead characters, enjoyable secondary characters, and a cast of villains that will lead you on a merry chase. The end result of the mystery is outlandish, but this is fantasy and I had no trouble accepting the outcome Ms. Coulter presented.If you have given up on this author or had contemplated doing so, I suggest giving this author another try and reading this book. If you want to read another Coulter book that presents a wonderful, good-guy hero, I'd suggest Night Fire.The reason this book won't be joining my all-time keeper list? Not quite enough sizzle shown between Rohan and Susannah. Though referred to quite a bit and shown in little ways, there weren't enough actual love-making scenes for this book to earn 5-hearts from me. While love scenes don't usually make or break a book for me, it's something I've come to expect from this author. When she does it right, she does it better than practically anyone else. When she does it wrong, it is about as stimulating as a trip to the OB-GYN, as my old friend Leslie McClain wrote in her review of Rosehaven for The Romance Reader.In the case of The Wild Baron, the love scenes were great, but there weren't enough. Still, this is a terrific book that should satisfy readers who appreciate good humor, great characters, and fine suspense.TTFN, Laurie Likes BooksPublisher, All About Romance END"},{"Title":"The Wild Baron (Baron Series)","review":"Since I wasn't reading the book I can't make a judgment on the book.I was listening to the audio book and I can say this..Never in my life have I been subjected to a more dry and lifeless naraiton.

Kind of cheesy, but very well written and nicely described. Coulter's usual work, with wonderful lovable characters and an exciting action storyline. The mystery thing just kind of made me grin a little, I mean, come on, a romance novel heroine finds a long-sought-after historical artefact? :) I mean, it's the first book in a series (and has crossover characters from the Bride series as well - Sinjun and Colin Kinross), how is she going to top this?Either way, the book was very enjoyable and I would highly recommend it to fans of Coulter's who may have missed it!"},{"Title":"The Wild Baron (Baron Series)","review":"I really loved the book.

I found Rohan's mother disgusting and no, it's not because she owns her sexuality but because she felt she had the absolute right to push it on her children to the point that all three were not what they appeared to be. In fact, 90% of the problems in the books were probably the fault of Rohan's parents. If I could give a rating for the secondary characters of the book, I would. Luckily, I can't.The plot was decent if some what far fetched and I wasn't all that bothered by it. As a fan of science fiction, I enjoyed it. The real reason to read this book though is the romance between Rohan and Susannah. It was wonderful and these two characters aren't the normal hero/heroine pair up which makes them even more enchanting. Rohan, despite his reputation, turns out to be a really good,sweet guy and Susannah is delightful."},{"Title":"The Wild Baron (Baron Series)","review":"This is one of my favorite Catherine Coulter novels. The hero is an original. The product of 2 feckless rakish parents, Rohan dutifully fakes the rake reputation expected of him by society and his doting Mama, while secretly living a modest life caring for his plants and grounds. He's really an endearing hero, no jerk moments at all. The heroine is no virgin, she claims to be the widow of Rohan's allegedly sober and straight-laced brother. There's yet another brother and it turns out none of the 3 are what they seem. There's a diverting mystery to stir things up. Things get a bit fantastical for my taste towards the end but it's an enjoyable romp overall."},{"Title":"The Wild Baron (Baron Series)","review":"I thougth that this book was very good.

While a few definitions miss the mark here and there, this collection is, on the whole, full of wit, insight, and vintage macabre humor. Some of the best -- &quot;FRIENDLESS: having no favors to bestow, destitute of fortune, addicted to utterance of truth and common sense&quot;; &quot;BIRTH: the first and direst of all disasters&quot;; &quot;FAITH: belief without evidence in what is told by one who speaks without knowledge, of things without parallel.&quot; Unlike other authors more concerned with propriety and cultivating good taste, Bierce understands the corrupt comedy of human existence and would prefer to laugh as the world burns. It is easy to see why H.L. Mencken loved him so."},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (Forum books)","review":"A classic that should be read by everyone. Many will hate it but it's a part of every American's heritage -- and probably more relevant in some ways today than when it was written a hundred years ago.

So for many years Bierce was the only major American writer who'd actually experienced the blood and guts of actual combat. He ended up a bitter man -- but the questions he raises are good ones.

There's really not much need for a pricier copy. In fact, the Dover edition's format is superior in its use of boldface for the word entries and a smaller typeface to present Bierce's illustrative stories, poems and quotations. Like the author, it is also a triumph of economy, taking only 139 pages to present the exact core content that the UGA edition requires over 100 more to set forth (with its use of larger fonts and broader line spacing).Buy the maximum three copies of the Dover for the price of one of the other editions and give the other two away.

Not all of the definitions are funny, but the majority of them really take no prisoners and it is very good at pointing out the little things we all still see in this modern day and age -- those little things we think to ourselves but dare not say outloud.The only problem with it is that, true to its time, there are some racist and mysogynistic overtones to some of the definitions [the only reason it didn't get a full five].

I don't think it's worth the money but I do suggest borrowing it from a friend or checking it out from the public library."},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (Forum books)","review":"I first acquired this book about five years ago, after reading Bierce's fictional works. I could not put it down. You don't read this book sequentially, but rather it is a book to leaf through, stopping where you find a word that interests you. With the format of a dictionary, Bierce sets up the look and feel of the official word, which is what we expect from a dictionary. Then, reading the definitions, you at first think, &quot;Bierce is being a wise guy.&quot; But after a few more definitions, you realize that Bierce is actually delivering a concise treatise on Western Culture by giving you a shot-by-shot commentary, using as his basis the essential element of any society -- its language. Birece may not have realized it when he wrote the book, but The Devil's Dictionary aligns with some 21st-century literary experimentations with concise presentation, irony, and non-linear exploration. Even reading it non-linearly, however, you soon find you've read every entry in the book. Then, of course, you'll want to start again...My favorites are the definitions pertaining to religion."},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (Forum books)","review":"Beginning in 1881 and continuing to 1906, Ambrose Bierce created a series of sardonic word definitions of his own. Many of these were collected and published as The Cynic's Word Book, which he later protested was \\"a name which the author had not the power to reject or happiness to approve.\\" So in 1911, he pulled together a collection that was more to his own liking and called it The Devil's Dictionary. The entries are a tad uneven in quality, but most are amusing and some are great. Each reader will have his own favorites, some of mine are as follows : ACQUAINTANCE, n. A person whom we know well enough to borrow from, but not well enough to lend to. A degree of friendship called slight when its object is poor or obscure, and intimate when he is rich or famous. ALLIANCE, n. In international politics, the union of two thieves who have their hands so deeply inserted in each other's pockets that they cannot separately plunder a third. BIGOT, n. One who is obstinately and zealously attached to an opinion that you do not entertain. BORE, n. A person who talks when you wish him to listen. CONSULT, v.i. To seek another's disapproval of a course already decided on. CYNIC, n. A blackguard whose faulty vision sees things as they are, not as they ought to be. Hence the custom among the Scythians of plucking out a cynic's eyes to improve his vision. DICTIONARY, n. A malevolent literary device for cramping the growth of a language and making it hard and inelastic. This dictionary, however, is a most useful work. DISCRIMINATE, v.i. To note the particulars in which one person or thing is, if possible, more objectionable than another. EDUCATION, n. That which discloses to the wise and disguises from the foolish their lack of understanding. FUTURE, n. That period of time in which our affairs prosper, our friends are true and our happiness is assured. HISTORY, n. An account mostly false, of events mostly unimportant, which are brought about by rulers mostly knaves, and soldiers mostly fools.... A member of a large and powerful tribe whose influence in human affairs has always been dominant and controlling... He has the last word in everything; his decision is unappealable. He sets the fashions and opinion of taste, dictates the limitations of speech and circumscribes conduct with a dead-line. POLITICS, n. A strife of interests masquerading as a contest of principles. The conduct of public affairs for private advantage. And, my choice for the very best among them : CONSERVATIVE, n. A statesman who is enamored of existing evils, as distinguished from the Liberal, who wishes to replace them with others. By all means, read it and pick out your own; you're sure to find a few that tickle your fancy. GRADE : A"},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (Forum books)","review":"'The Devil's Dictionary' is an interesting, very intellectually cynical collection of proposed definitions to words collected by Ambrose Gwinett Bierce, a journalist, writer, Civil War veteran, and general misanthrope, who disappeared without a trace in Mexico about 1914. In the words of H.L. Mencken, Bierce has produced 'some of the most gorgeous witticism of the English language.' Bierce delights in irreverence and poking fun at all aspects of life.Bierce's own definition of dictionary gives some insight into his general thought patterns:'Dictionary, n. A malevolent literary device for cramping the growth of a language and making it hard and inelastic. This dictionary, however, is a most useful work.'This would lead us to conclude (most correctly) that Bierce is a world-class cynic. What is a cynic?'Cynic, n. A blackguard whose faulty vision sees things as they are, not as they ought to be. Hence the custom among the Scythians of plucking out a cynic's eyes to improve his vision.'Originally published under the title 'The Cynic's Word Book', most of the definitions in this book originally appeared as part newspaper columns. There have been many imitators, but this is the first and finest collection. Arranged as a dictionary, it provides an interesting writer's tool for finding a unique perspective on words and phrases. There are more than 1000 entries. A few examples include:'Outdo, v.t., To make an enemy.''Universalist, n. One who foregoes the advantage of a Hell for persons of another faith.'Fair warning -- those who do not like cynicism and scathing wit will find this book irritating, and sometimes offensive. Bierce is a product of his generation; political correctness wasn't in vogue then, and, even if it had been, Bierce would have been one of the sharpest critics.As a Christian priest, I take great delight in the insights from Bierce's criticism of religion in general, and Christianity in particular.'Christian, n. One who believes that the New Testament is a divinely inspired book admirably suited to the needs of his neighbor. One who follows the teachings of Christ in so far as they are not inconsistent with a life of sin.'Why does this ring so true? Of course, there is the old adage that if you scratch a cynic, you'll find an idealist. Bierce would undoubtedly have described himself as a realist, but buried beneath many layers of cynicism, one can sense the idealism.Why did Bierce go to Mexico? Perhaps his underlying idealism led him to a country that was awash in revolutionary ideas; perhaps those ideas are what cost him his life. Perhaps he went underground? It is possible we will never know.The publisher of this volume, one of but many reprints of the text over time, says: 'The caustic aphorisms collected in \\"The Devil's Dictionary\\" helped earn Ambrose Bierce the epithets Bitter Bierce, the Devil's Lexicographer, and the Wickedest Man in San Francisco. The words he shaped into verbal pitchforks a century ago--with or without the devil's help--can still draw blood today.'This book is very useful for generating ideas for writing and reflection. It is a good counterpoint to 'guides to positive thinking' kinds of material, and can serve as a tempering agent on such collections."},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (Forum books)","review":"I'd skip this and purchase the UNABRIDGED version. Some of the definitions left out in this version are among Bierce's best. Also, the complete work is not so long: no reason to abridge something that in full length is only 100 or so pages long."},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (Forum books)","review":"Bierce's misanthropy and glorious cynicism remain a breath of fresh air, never having lost their ring of truth for the better part of a century. His aversion for hypocrisy, formal education (He was of humble origins and self-educated), and religious self-righteousness are appropriately barbed. His disillusionment with concepts such as patriotism (&quot;The first refuge of a scoundrel&quot;), are particularly interesting, considering his rural midwestern upbringing and heroic service in the Civil War. The most consistent and I think interesting theme throughout this volume is his disdain for the institution of marriage. Long before marriage was seen by many as a burden and divorce became unstigmatized and commonplace, Bierce's definition seems prophetic for his time: &quot;An institution consisting of a master, a mistress, and two slaves, making in all two.&quot;"},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (Forum books)","review":"This edition doesn't obliterate all the merits of a literary classic, but it comes remarkably close.Do yourself and Ambrose Bierce a favor: purhcase a copy of The Devil's Dictionary put out by a reputable publisher instead. Whoever released this version didn't see fit to identify themselves, possibly for fear of crmininal proscecution. Defiling a literary masterpiece may not be a crime in the United States, but this release makes a good case for it becoming one.Overlooking the fact no biographical or editorial information was deemed necessary for inclusion, the thugs involved in this crime weren't even responsible enough to check the accuracy of the text. In one instance, the use of the word \\"is\\" for \\"if\\" is obvious enough for the reader to reconstruct Mr. Bierce's original intention, but in other cases, his words are so carelessly mangled, his meaning is beyond comphrehension.As written by Ambrose Bierce, The Devil's Dicionary is a uniquely wonderful reading experience. If I could rate this version with a negative number, I would gladly do so. As it is, one star will have to do. Avoid this at all costs."},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (Forum books)","review":"Ambrose Bierce was a man of many distinctions - writer, journalist, humorist, and Civil War veteran. We all remember reading his classic story &quot;An Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge&quot; in eighth grade English class. Bierce is best known for his ghoulish horror tales, which were on a par with Edgar Allan Poe, but his greatest work was The Devil's Dictionary. A scathing parody of Webster's dictionary, Bierce's volume was a showcase for his brilliant, caustic wit. This is Bierce at his best, mixing comedy with social commentary, unleashing his anarchistic convictions to the hilt! Bierce blasts away at God and country and all that is respected and proper. He defines patriot as &quot;the dupe of statesmen and the tool of conquerors&quot;, a Conservative as &quot;a statesman who is enamored of existing evils&quot; and a clergyman as &quot;a man who undertakes the management of our spiritual affairs as a method of bettering his temporal ones&quot; and so on. Nothing is sacred and no one is safe in this classic work of 19th century American literature which continues to attract just as much controversy and outrage today as it did when it was first published. A must read for all students of literature, dissenters, and fans of caustic humor!"},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (Forum books)","review":"The book is wonderful if you are a cynic or would like to know how they think.

His use of English as both an artistic medium and a weapon is almost unrivaled, though British greats John Cleese and Douglas Adams often evoke some of his elegance and economy of wording. His writing style often may seem dated to modern readers, and sometimes the references completely pass us by, but the majority of the book is both timeless and of the choicest quality.&quot;Magpie - a bird whose thievish disposition suggested to someone that it might be taught to talk.&quot;"},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (Forum books)","review":"This was first published in 1911.

If you go to \\"the beginning\\" it takes you to a preface. If you go to the \\"cover\\", on the second page after it is an alphabetic index labeled as \\"contents\\" but you can't go to it directly. So its a bit confusing. If you do find the \\"contents\\" you can select a letter of the alphabet and then browse that section. You can search for a word but if its a common word then every time its mentioned in the text you get a hit.

It's surprising the Latin knowledge of Bierce, although I feel that sometimes he does not use it properly. The same for his ancient Greek Mythology skills.Unless you have a mature mind, you need to be cautious when reading Bierce. Sometimes he is shocking--but hilarious!"},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (Forum books)","review":"Ambrose Bierce was unique in being the only major writer to have served in combat during the American Civil War. In fact, he was actually invalided out of the Army after being shot in the head, and only after that did he become a writer. Perhaps his experiences in the war generally, and that catastrophic wound in particular, did something to his mind, because his writing remains unparalleled in the annals of dark, sardonic wit.Not least among the products of Bierce's twisted view of the world is his famous (or perhaps one should say infamous) \\"Devil's Dictionary\\". Like most of Bierce's work, the diabolical entries in his dictionary originally appeared in a series of newspaper articles, and only later were collated into a single volume.Bierce was primarily a journalist and short story writer, who did not write novels, and perhaps that explains the principal reason why he is not as well remembered today as are many of his lesser literary contemporaries. The fact that his \\"Devil's Dictionary\\" defines the novel as \\"A short story padded\\" speaks volumes of the author's disdain towards that particular literary form.Nevertheless, no person who considers himself truly literate and educated can afford not to be acquainted with the work of the incomparable Bierce, and most particularly with his unique \\"Devil's Dictionary\\"."},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (Forum books)","review":"I've got several editions of this, most recently on my Kindle.

Excellent quoting material and fun for a leaf through now and again, this book is a bargain for all its interior wealth."},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (Forum books)","review":"Any reader,particularly of history by Ambrose Bierce,will greatly enjoy this book. Little wonder, Bierce (1842-1914),an American journalist,satirist -\\"it was said that a bad review from Bierce could break a writer's career;and writer of short stories who earned the nickname \\"Bitter Bierce\\" for his sardonic views and his vehemence as a critic\\".While the thoughts and definitions in this dictionary were written many years ago;they remain sharp,revelent and cuttingly satiric today.What I find so surprising is that these ideas have not become dated.While few,if any ,dictionaries lend themselves to reading or simply just spending time leafing through;this is certainly an exception.Just to give an idea of what awaits in this tome;try these for size;mausoleum- The final and funniest folly of the rich.martyr- One who moves along the line of least reluctance to adesired death.blackguard-A man whose qualities,prepared for display like a box ofberries in a market-the fine ones on top-have been openedon the wrong side.An inverted gentleman.amnesty-The state's magnanimity to those offenders whom it would betoo expensive to punish.grapeshot-An argumentwhich the future is preparing in answer tothe demands of American Socialism.And last but not least;nonsense- The objections that are urged against this excellentdictionary."},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (Forum books)","review":"A veteran of the 1861-65 U.S. Civil War who mysteriously disappeared during the 1910-20 Mexican Civil War, the caustically irreverent Bierce was the H. L. Mencken of the 19th century (or Mencken was the Bierce of the 20th century). His timeless and ego-deflating observations of Homo Sapiens reminds us that today's 21st century politics and pop culture were well-known to this 1842-born iconoclast. For instance, he defined a conservative as, \\"A statesman who is enamored of existing evils, as distinguished from the Liberal, who wishes to replace them with others\\" (1993 p.18). He defined a homeopathist as \\"The humorist of the medical profession\\" (p.51). He defined a clairvoyant as \\"A person, commonly a woman, who has the power of seeing that which is invisible to her patron-- namely, that he is a blockhead (p.16).

He was awarded the nicknames 'Bitter Bierce', 'the Devil's Lexographer', and 'the Wickedest Man in San Francisco'. It is a compilation of Bierce's favourite definitions from his magazine, the Sting. They remain cuttingly true today, although they were written at the end of the nineteenth century. For example:Monday, noun. In Christian countries, the day after the baseball game.Monkey, noun. An aboreal animal which makes itself at home in genealogical trees.The Devil's Dictionary is great not only as bathroom reading, but in helping one muddle through today's society. I only wish Bierce had written more.More, adjective. The comparative degree of too much."},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (Forum books)","review":"The Devil's Dictionary is the first book by Ambrose Bierce I've read and I think it's one of the most brilliant in American literature. It is timeless in a rare, hilarious way, yet chances are you have never heard of it unless you are an AmLit scholar working on satire or found it by chance like I did while prowling the web for free ebooks.Bierce took no prisoners; the book is both politically incorrect and timeless. This is not a contradiction in terms. It is as relevant now as it was a hundred years ago, and will remain relevant and funny for centuries to come, because human character doesn't change on such small time scales. By the standards Bierce sets to intelligent humor and satire, Mark Twain is a bumbling schoolboy and whoever spawned South Park is an aspiring amoeba.In a different country, The Devil's Dictionary would be taught in school and university, and the author would have streets and landmarks named after him. (I know, because I'm from such a country, and we have a Bierce equivalent who lived in the same period and is now considered a classic.) The reason why \\"The Devil's Dictionary\\" is virtually unknown, ignored in the classroom, and excluded from the list of American classics is that the US is such a God-fearing country. There are two obstacles to this book being afforded its rightful place among the best in American lit: the devil in the title and the atheism of the author. (One can only guess what Bierce would have written after putting together the Biblical story of Jesus throwing the businessmen out of the temple and the decision to inscribe \\"In God We Trust\\" on American money, for example. Ambrose, we need you so badly!)"},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (Forum books)","review":"The Devil has nothing on Bierce, (except maybe a pretty good blackmail file with color photographs).

An obsolete kind of literary composition in which the vices and follies of the authors enemies were expounded with imperfect tenderness.\\" However, this book isn't obsolete, but becomes more evidently true as time goes on. An excellent list of definitions that insult everyone in general and everyone in particular. This book is a necessary tool to carry in your pocket and correct people's definitions at cocktail parties. You could tell people the definition of a Saint, 'n. A dead sinner revised and edited'.

The mother does not have an active role in the story line, but she is shown in the illustrations to react to the little girls antics as she goes about her daily activities of caring for the house and children.

When you find it, treasure it!"},{"Title":"Silverlock (Ace Books, No. A-8)","review":"I suspect that this is one of those polarizing books: those that love it REALLY love it; others will be, at best, blandly indifferent or outright bored. I hew more closely to the second camp.The book has notable adherents and in recent years has been hailed as a bit of a neglected gem, but I found it only moderately diverting. It was written in 1949 and so it's a bit dated (and its attitudes toward women are not the most advanced, but then again, the protagonist is by his own admission a cad and a bounder), but that's really not much of a problem.The novel is your typical Pilgrim's Progress type of thing, and is divided into three parts, which turn out to be Chance, Choice, and Oracle, or as I see it, Heaven, Purgatory, and Hell, based on the decreasing level of quality (and the not-concidental Dantean shenanigans toward the end). It starts out strong, but the charms grow old fast, and the overarching quest in the middle section simply is not very gripping. In the final third, the book becomes unbearably didactic and wearisome, and then, rather suddenly, the words \\"The End\\" scroll across the screen.On a side note, I found myself often contrasting this book to Stephen Donaldson's \\"Chronicles of Thomas Covenant\\". Both feature (anti-)heroes thrust into a strange land and both deal, to some degree, with large philosphical concerns. (In fact, Donaldson acknowledges having read this, and having plucked the titles of a couple of his novels from one of the songs within, but purports to find the book sub-par.) The major contrast, of course, is that Covenant believes nothing of what he sees, but Shandon easily rolls with all that he finds, no matter how fantastical, to an extent unbelievable of someone from mid-20th century America.Filkers and others who enjoy making songs out of poems will like \\"Silverlock\\", as will those who excelled in high school English classes and who can pick out some of the myriad allusions. I suspect most others will find this to be much less than advertised.I would, at any rate, recommend picking up an annotated version to get details on some of the more cryptic appearances of characters from myth, fable, and literature."},{"Title":"Silverlock (Ace Books, No. A-8)","review":"If you're wondering how a book with such stellar (and basically deserved) reviews could POSSIBLY go out of print, it is simply this: While John Myers Myers is great at imagining a world poulated with a literate person's favorite characters, he is not a particularly stellar writer.

At 516 pages I was anticipating an all-stops-pulled-out fantasy epic. Instead I was served up a convoluted and not very interesting tale full of literary references many of which were unfamiliar to me. Sometimes I felt like the author was making up \\"classics literature trivia quizzes\\" in lieu of a stronger narrative. If the author had included footnotes, a glossary or an appendix I might have found the book of more interest. I have subsequently noticed that the NESFA has published an annontated edition - I regret I did not a have that edition when I read the book, althought it is OOP and not inexpensive.If you like to decode literary puzzles by all means read this book. If you are a Literature major or enjoy deciphering arcane references to myths, legends and classics this is the book you have been pineing for. Otherwise I would recommend you pass this one up. The last paperback edition of this title was published in 1996 by Ace.Just an observation: since I posted this review - and rated it one star - I have received no \\"helpful\\" responses. I notice that the 4 and five star rated reviews show mostly \\"helpful\\" responses.

It was a very easy read and it flowed right along. I would have preferred more action but what was there sufficed."},{"Title":"Silverlock (Ace Books, No. A-8)","review":"This book is half Pilgrim's Progress, half Divine Comedy, half outright allegory and complete fun. A. Clarence Shandon, the Silverlock of the title, is not a very nice person as the story opens. Shipwrecked, he is saved by Widsith Amerigin Demodocus Taliesin Golias, who is more than a bard, he is a Maker. And from the moment he meets Golias, Silverlock falls into stories, one after another. He lands on the great island of the Commonwealth, which at one level is the Commonwealth of letters, literature, stories. And on another is simply a grand romp through the great stories of our culture.For Silverlock, who is as ignorant of literature as a fish, it's initially simply something that happens to him. He is, in Golias's kind phrase, &quot;Not well informed.&quot; Nor are we. Whether it's hanging out with Robin Hood, wandering into the scenes of Shakespeare's &quot;Midsummer's Night Dream, or quaffing mead with Beowulf, or even his own quests; it's initially all the same. But gradually the stories he lives and the stories he hears, and Golias's own example, transform him into a better person.I could tell you that &quot;Silverlock&quot; is an allegory, that Myers is telling you that literature has the power to transform, and make a person better, and that life without literature is not worth living. But that's like saying &quot;Hamlet&quot; is a story about a depressed prince. Saying this book is an allegory is implying its cod liver oil. It's not. This book is masterful as pure, sweet entertainment; the encounter with Izaak Walton and a dozen others is amusing even if you have never heard of any of them.Sure, what makes the book even more fun is trying to recognize the characters and situations Silverlock encounters. Some are easy: Captain Ahab and the Great White Whale; Circe from &quot;Odysseus;&quot; drifting down a river on Huck Finn's raft. Others are much harder. But that's a game to play afterwards. There's no time when you are wrapped up in the story itself.Myers' point is that literature is transforming. And this book will transform you. You will have great fun reading it - it's a ripping good story - but there's a real danger that Silverlock's encounter with Bercilak will send you to read &quot;Gawain and the Green Night,&quot; or that the visit to the Deiphobe will send you off to the enchantments of Greek myth, or that the hysterically funny encounter with the Dean of Knights Errant will make you finally read &quot;Don Quixote.&quot; The dangers are real in the Commonwealth, and not the least of them is the danger of being transformed by the experience of reading this book.Understand that when Silverlock's guide, Golias, tells a story, or invents a poem in the course of this book, he is Making, he is creating new and wonderful characters that Silverlock or anyone else just might encounter as they wander through the Commonwealth. I promise you that John Myers Myers is himself a Maker. &quot;Silverlock&quot; is Making at its best."},{"Title":"Silverlock (Ace Books, No. A-8)","review":"Upon reading 'Silverlock' for the first time, expect to experience the sense of awe and wonder that explorers feel when first discovering strange and wonderful new lands. 'Silverlock is a hidden classic, on par with Tolkien in quality, yet utterly unique. For readers who enjoy fantasy but have become weary of the genre's cliches and vast quantity of derivitive material, 'Silverlock' is Eldorado.'Silverlock' is a masterpiece that works on several levels. It is a first rate adventure yarn, following the misadventures of the title character from his ship wreck in unknown waters through many close scrapes, battles, drinking bouts, and wenchings in the enchanted realm of the Commonwealth of Letters. It is also a clever allegory, following the development of Silverlock as he changes from a cold cynic with no knowledge or respect for the world of literature, to an enthusiastic aspirant maker of tales. And finally, it is an incredible literary game. Every person, place, and thing in Silverlock, outside of the protagonist is lifted from the vast range of literature and myth, from Gilgamesh to Mark Twain, and the challenge to identify these tantalizing references proves irresistable to most readers.These literary references and the way Silverlock interacts with them create the book's unique magic. A typical series of scenes finds Silverlock emerging from the forest where the night before he has been the guest of Robin Hood and his merry band; stopping at a tavern and lunching with the Mad Hatter and his party, and pushing on for an evening feast at Heorot Hall, where the revelers are celebrating the death of Grendel by recounting the tale of the Alamo in Norse verse. All this and more in but one chapter.'Silverlock' is a book you will come back to many times. You may also find yourself enthusiastically pushing it on friends, as once you fall under its spell you will want to share the magic. So be smart and buy two copies - if you loan yours out, it might not come back. I give 'Silverlock' my very highest of recommendations.Theo Logos"},{"Title":"Silverlock (Ace Books, No. A-8)","review":"Okay, this book has 30-odd reviews, all of the with five stars, and some with titles like &quot;the best book ever written&quot;. What's up with that? Well... if you are one of the people unlucky enough not to know A. Clarence Shandon, aka Silverlock, then scroll back up and add this book to your cart now. I can tell you all about this book (as anyone's review will do), but it'll just come off as hyperbole. I mean: reference hunting? What's fun about that? Pilgrim's Progress? Wasn't that one of those tedious books you read in high school (and hated)?Okay, it sounds boring or tedious or somehow suspect, but this book will make your cheek muscles hurt from the silly grin you'll wear while reading it. The plot exists in part to hang all of these delightful songs (yes, songs), characters, rimshots, and, well, yes, references off of. But it never slows down or gets tedious at all. You'll find yourself merrily zipping along right through it.It is hard to find because it comes and goes from print--this book's the size of a Michener novel--and most people get this white-knuckled grip on their second or third copy (the first ones always having been loaned out and NEVER returned).

It chronicles the journey--inner and outer--of an American cynic as he travels through the world of literature. Some of the fun is tracking down the literary characters, from Beowulf to Don Quixote to Becky Sharp. Part of me regrets not having been born in the 1950s to relish Silverlock fully; the Internet makes finding the sources of the characters effortless. Hopefully, readers take the next step and read the original sources to expand their understanding and appreciation of literature. In my opinion, the novel posits that literature is an evolving, cumulative organism. Modern (American) literature is built on the foundation of the stories that came before. The novel shows that someone can find meaning in the stories he or she encounters, and sharing those experiences--and possibly using them to invent new stories--is one of the joys of life. Anyone with respect for literature and the history of speculative reading should give Silverlock a try."},{"Title":"Silverlock (Ace Books, No. A-8)","review":"Myers wrote an incredibly entertaining tales of a hero's journey through adventure and life; it's one of my all-time favorites.

The freighter is shipwrecked after several days of running before a storm and the main character, Silverlock, finds himself cast adrift without a life boat.

The references to classic literature throughout this book are what really makes it fun to read. The setting of the book probably inspired the creators of \\"the Neverending Story.\\" The only thing keeping me from giving this book five stars is the fact that it does get rather boring in the middle due to the seeming pointlessness of the quest they go on.

If you know what's going on, as you must having read the summary and reviews here, it's a tantalizing and amazing piece of work. I first read it pre-Internet, and could recognize from memory just a few of the characters and scenes. The second time I read it, I was in the local library - for an entire weekend - looking things up, and even then I didn't find all of them. You can find much better references online now - but I really recommend reading it the first time straight through, without trying to figure them out.Let me say that again. The first time, just read it. Ignore the temptation to stop and look up the references. If you recognize one, hooray! Enjoy seeing the story or character again from this new angle.

I didn't get all of the literary references then, and in the pre-Web days, it wasn't within my resources to look them up. It was a great pleasure, though, to be in the company of a smarter writer than me, one who knew so much and could assemble a story so cleverly. I still think about this book often, and still consider it an influence, in that it makes me want to incorporate the literature of the past into new contexts. (I did that in Level Three's Dream with Alice in Wonderland. Thanks for the inspiration, John Myers Myers.)You don't need to know all the references to enjoy the book. The writing is just stunning, the characters and situations gripping. There is an engaging plot, plus fascinating personalities for Silverlock to interact with, plus poetic beauty. You will have favorite moments you want to read again and again. I like C. Lorel and the ship of fools.A price of 6.99 for the Kindle edition is not too much. This book is just mind-bogglingly good. If you are a reader of mine -- there are a few of you guys -- get it. Just do. It's magnificent.I'm sorry to say, though, that I cannot recommend the so-called sequel, The Moon's Fire-Eating Daughter.

Although I initially disliked both the writing style (slangish 1940s) and the protagonist (it's hard to call a man who bites the hand that saves him a 'hero'), the story progresses through so many interesting twists and clever surprises that it becomes almost like a game. In fact, part of the enduring appeal of Silverlock rests on its vast collection of allusions, which can be spotted or picked apart at leisure on a second or third reading. Not only does this book introduce you to a magical world of adventure, but it's like a hypertext guidebook to the infinite worlds of other books, such as Orlando Furioso, Mody Dick, the Volsungs or Gawain and the Green Knight. This is what John Myers Myers calls The Commonwealth (of Letters).But that's not all. Far from being a shallow exercise in literary name-dropping, Silverlock brings back wonder into your life and may rekindle your love of reading and storytelling. The songs, filks and dirty limericks in the book (don't worry, all very tame) just add to the fun.

I constantly found myself devouring it in 100 page gulps. Unlike nearly all other fantasy novels that are serious, this fantasy novel is intentionally humourous. The main character, Silverlock, finds himself stranded on a strange continent called The Commonwealth. As he journeys with his friend Golias, he meets up with MANY familiar literary characters. The literary characters and references are scattered through the book, but John Myers Myers doesn't stick with any of them very long. That way they don't go stale or get too much attention. There are TONS of humorous situations and poems in this book that will make you perk right up. Tolkien may have been a good poet, but JMM was just as good and sometimes far better.

This is a writer who has read the Starr report. She has also read Judge John Sirica's autobiography, as apparently no one at the New York Times had done before they condemned some conclusions she drew from that book and other sources. This, in short, is a writer with a genuinely independent point of view who does her homework. Her subjects are varied: Watergate, the National Guard, the OIC office's treatment of Monica Lewinsky, Robert Bork's judicial &quot;philosophy&quot;, daytime television, a late collection of Pauline Kael's movie reviews for the New Yorker, and others. I do not see that she can be faulted for self-righteousness when she backs up any accusation she has to make with almost an embarrassment of evidence. The book is also a pleasure for those who relish English prose that is finely wrought, not overwrought. She is astringent, delicate, devastatingly accurate, deliciously funny, and fair. The New York Times would do well to put her in charge of its OpEd page, and its Corrections department as well."},{"Title":"Canaries in the Mineshaft: Essays on Politics and Media","review":"Renata Adler can be a scathing social critic. She can also be more than a little self-righteous. Both tendencies are on display in Canaries in the Mineshaft, her new book on politics and the media.Primarily what they call in journalism a &quot;clip job&quot; of old articles, Adler shows a real joy in going for the jugular in some of these pieces. Her articles on the Starr Report and Monica Lewinsky's autobiography are truly biting. You'll be hard pressed to see Ken Starr the same way again after Adler's indictment.Included as well is Adler's 1980 hatchet job on Pauline Kael, House Critic (originally entitled The Perils of Pauline when it ran in The New York Review of Books). You don't have to admire Kael (as I do, with reservations) to think that Adler is making a mountain out of a molehill here. The final article A Court of No Appeal, is Adler at her most insufferably self-righteous. Even though she might have a case, her argument is always simplistically Manichaean -- everyone else is wrong and I'm right. Always.So this book is a mixed bag. I can't wholeheartedly recommend it (if you're a Conservative Republican you're liable to drop dead of apoplexy by page 159), but Adler's insights and deliciously vicious style make up for her not-unoccasional smugness."},{"Title":"Canaries in the Mineshaft: Essays on Politics and Media","review":"Since Renada Adler's first book, Toward a Radical Midde, she has exhibited the instincts of an Orwell and a wit and valor entirely her own.

Second, Justice Butler only concurred in the result. Third, Justice Black wrote that he did not agree with that part of Stone's opinion that contained footnote 4. Fourth, neither Justice Cardozo nor Justice Reed participated in the decision. This means that the famous footnote 4 was agreed-to by only four of the nine justices-hardly a \\"unanimous\\" expression by the Court, as Adler says.As Adler points out earlier in the book, in connection with an error made by another author, errors cause a reader's faith in the author to \\"unravel.\\" Here, the error was not caught in 1987, when the article first appeared, or, recently, when Canaries was cobbled together.Frankly, I stopped reading when I got to page 127 because I could no longer trust anything in the book to be accurate.

The Big Laugh is one of his Hollywood novels. In his entire body of work (and it is prodigious), I would put this in the bottom 25%. It begins with a nobody forging a career in hollywood by blackmailing the first person to give him an acting job. A weak premise not usually found in O'Hara's plots. It ends with a twist -- hence the Big Laugh. This is the type of novel that is only enjoyed by someone who is a diehard fan of the author. The plotting is weak; it's missing the dialogue and little details that are a hallmark of O'Hara's outstanding work."},{"Title":"The Big Laugh (Bantam Books #Q5781)","review":"This book started off really well. The first part with Hubert Ward conniving the people around him to make ends meet and his growing stardom in the theatre were all electrifying--O'Hara at his very best--but it all goes downhill after that. First of all, O'Hara writes in exposition in the beginning and in the epilogue that Ward was a heel, but I never got that impression throughout the narrative, and Ward even came off as rather honest, blunt, and down-to-earth. Second of all, his marriage to Nina Stephens was absolutely unbelievable; and I think O'Hara may have been reading a little too much Hemingway; some of the dialog between Ward and Nina were starkly reminiscent of several early Hemingway novels. And there were even two suicides, AGAIN recalling Gatsby. Overall, &quot;The Big Laugh&quot; is substandard O'Hara, but a pleasurable quick read utterly without pretension and profundity. As usual, O'Hara wrote brilliantly and never wrought a boring line of prose, and he was a speed reader's dream come true."},{"Title":"The Big Laugh (Bantam Books #Q5781)","review":"The Big Laugh was originally pubished about 1962 and was a bestseller at that time. In the first few pages, the author says that it is about a man who was trying to be someone he was not. He was a rascal to begin with, tried to redeem himself and succeeded to some extent for awhile but then failed in the end.Hubert Ward was kicked out by his family, cheated a friend out of rent money, killed a woman in a hit and run incident, and when he got desperate enough, he blackmailed a producer for a bit part in a play. From there he went to Hollywood where he became a huge star, participating in the glamor life, though he drank very little, did not gamble, and generally restrained himself from fooling around with married women, who often tried to seduce him. He fell madly in love with and married a young society woman who eventually got tired of him and began seeing a writer on the side. So he decided to have an affair of his own and made a bad choice -- he selected the girl friend of the producer he had first blackmailed in the beginning of his career. The producer found out about it and killed his girlfriend and himself.I failed to see how the stated premise was played out. I found the dialogue to be weak and improbable, but the pages of unparagraphed narrative were strangely entertaining. I suspect that the bit that made this book a bestseller was the overt sex, both homo- and hetero-, which was not common in the mainstream in the early 60's. I suspect people found it titilating at the time; it's tame by today's standards. However, there is something more and I'm not sure what it is, unless it's the true story of the author's own personal life, at least part of it. While it is certainly not a \\"page-turner,\\" it is interesting in some way, even though I personally have no interest in the lives of the Hollywood rich and famous."},{"Title":"Learning to Paint","review":"The following information is taken or paraphrased from the cover.

This is not a textbook on Lie algebras in the usual sense, but a practical guide whose intention is to provide a solid comprehension of the main facts on (finite dimensional) Lie algebras used in physics. This justifies the choice of the objects analyzed, the compact real form su(N) of the Lie algebras sl(N,C), which constitute an essential tool in the study of the interacting boson model and nuclear rotational states. The topics covered by this book are quite modest (there are no general proofs and no development of classical problems like the classification of simple Lie algebras), and focuses on a detailed comment on the properties of simple algebras using mainly three Lie algebras, su(2),su(3) and su(4), before ennouncing the general case in the last chapter. However, this should not be understated, specially because the book explains carefully the usual notations (which change in the literature from author to author) and tries to clarify the reasons that justify the study of the formal theory.The book is divided into six chapters, which we comment separately. The first chapter is a quick and effective overview on the basic properties of simple Lie algebras, namely the adjoint representation, the Killing form, representations and their reducibility. For the inner product the Dirac bracket notation is used. The concept of multiplets, which plays an essential role, is introduced at the end of this chapter. Chapter 2 begins with a short discussion of hermitian matrices, and introduces the Lie algebra su(N) in the usual way. The complexification of this algebra is shortly commented, as well as the generation of the algebra by means of operators. The structure constants over the standard basis are obtained, and as application the Killing form for su(N) is computed. It should be said that the notations used in this chapter have in mind the Gell-Mann matrices, which will be introduced later. Chapter 3 studies the fundamental facts concerning the rank one algebra su(2), and which will be central to later developments. The topics commented are generators of su(2), that is, the Pauli matrices, the quantum mechanical operators J of angular momentum, the su(2) multiplets and the irreducible (complex) representations. Further the tensor products (called \\"direct products\\") of these representations and their decomposition into irreducible components is commented. Many very detailed computations are presented, which illustrate clearly the procedure and its significance. Moreover the graphical method for the tensor product decomposition is developed,The fourth chapter, devoted to the Lie algebra su(3), which cosntitutes in some sense the core of this book, actually develops the main aspects necessary to the description of global symmetry schemes for hadrons (without deeping into the actual classification, for this would require a basic knowledge of quantum field theory). The Lie algebra su(3) is introduced according Gell-Mann's notation. The step operators and states of su(3) are introduced, and the individual states and multiplicities are carefully constructed using graphical motivation (which actually corresponds to the standard application of the su(2)-triples). In order to formalize the construction, the Young tableaux are used (these constituting an essential tool for the analysis of the su(N) algebras). Special attention is devoted to the fundamental su(3)-multiplet (the quark representation 3) and its dual. This leads naturally to the introduction of the hypercharge Y (however no reference to the Gell-Mann-Nishijima formula is made). The (quadratic) Casimir operator of su(3) and its eigenvalues are analyzed, with explicit examples that point out the main properties of this invariant. The next section focuses on the tensor products of su(3)-multiplets, and develops also the graphical method to deduce the decomposition. A table presents some of these tensor products (for highest weights lower or equal to (2,1)). Again, this motivation is used to present the Young tableaux. Chapter 5 presents more or less the same topics for the rank three algebra su(4), and discusses the charm C (as a natural consequence of the quantum numbers discussed for su(3)). The multiplets and tensor products are reviewed (the diagrams are of exceptional quality and clarity), and the chapter finishes commenting on the standard Weyl basis (that is, the basis obtained from the root system of the corresponding algebra; this is the presentation that will be found in almost any book on Lie algebras). These facts are presented without proof, but serve to illustrate fundamental facts like the Cartan integers or the presentation by generators and relations that the interested reader will find in any standard text. Chapter six gives a recopilation of the basic facts of the su(N) algebras for arbitrary values of N (hermitian generators and multiplets, quadratic Casimir operator, etc). The bibliography presents some texts to profound the study. A little remark: the reference to Cornwell's book refers specifically to volume II, which deals with the theory of finite dimensional Lie algebras.On balance I think this book is an excellent first contact with Lie algebras for those using them in physics, because of the lucid style and the clarity in the exposition. The very detailed calculations and step by step introduction of the material allow the readers not familiar with Lie algebras to become confident with the main facts they will find in any standard textbook, and which often discourages because of notational problems or implicit assumption of knowledge concerning the fundamental properties. Although the notation is mainly that used in physics literature, the examples and motivations introduced in this text will help the reader in the transition to other books using alternative notations. This work is a welcome reference for both beginners in Lie algebras for physics, as well as for instructors."},{"Title":"The Lie Algebras Su(N), an Introduction","review":"This book is fantastic and written very clearly.

It is the first book to make me laugh out loud in years. It is warm, funny (make that HILARIOUS), and fascinating. I just couldn't put it down. Unfortunately, none of the rest of the volumes live up to the quality of the first. The second book is less amusing and less interesting, and the others aren't worth your time at all. But *this* one! Oh yeah! Buy it and read it.

Before you grab that big rope to tighten a few loose ends, just order the whole serie of &quot;The Tales of the City&quot; 1) it is just like a soap opera (but a hippie, gay, funny, exhuberant one): the chapters (and the books) always end right when it is getting interesting: you won't be able to just drop those novels in the middle of the story. Well done Maupin-Sheherazade! 2) you'll realize that the world is full of people who care (but where can I find Maupin's address in Frisco to move in with him?) 3) if you still feel blue afterwards, then I guess there is nothing anybody can do, pal! Want a last joint? 4) if you don't find it funny, &quot;go fly a kite!&quot; I hope you'll enjoy these novels as much as I do."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"The UK was lucky enough to get the tv version of Tales of the City due to the forward thinking of channel 4 - as a result large portions of the UK were turned on to Mr Maupin and his wonderful fictious friends. I read the whole set of novels after seeing the tv series in less than five days - turned off the telephone, unplugged the telly and withdrew from normal, dull everyday life and sunk into the world of Mouse and Mona. The warm and familiar style of writting just whisks you to SF and Barbary Lane in an instant. I've now read the whole set at least 10 times and intend to spend considerable time in 1998 reading then again and again and again and again! Mr Maupin has found a simple formula in the Tales of the City - one I hope he repeats in the future."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"This is the best book you will ever read. The charaters are great. When they are happy, you will be happy. When they are sad you will be sad. I couldn't put this book down."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"This book could not be easier to read, which I mean in the best possible way. The short chapters and snappy dialogue keep the pages turning as characters grab hold of the reader through the seemingly effortless prose of the author. Maupin has a clear voice and writes about a time and place, San Francisco in the early '70s, that are clearly an important part of his own history and identity. Highly recommended reading for those looking to escape to a different time and place."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Just brilliant and laugh-out-loud funny. And SO right on if you know SF. Maupin was an insider and knew all the characters. Will this become &#34;literature&#34; someday? He's like the Dickens of 70's San Francisco. Read the whole series."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"It is still a good story. Takes me back to the fun times of my life. Had a great time visiting Mouse, Mona and Ms. Madrigal. Smoke 'em if you got em."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I purchased this because I spent my twenties in SF and am currently raising my own family here. The storyline is pretty lame and the name-dropping gets incredibly irritating. While it is interesting to hear the names of locations that are and were staples of SF in the 1970s, the clothing brand dropping is cringe-worthly. When I finished this book I literally let out a sigh of relief and wished I had those hours of my life back."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Tales of the City weaves together the stories of young eccentrics and elites in 1970s San Francisco. The characters are what make this book shine, ranging from Mary Ann Singleton, a wanderlust Ohio transplant looking for love, to Edgar Halcony, a rich businessman who is reacquainted with his soft side. You will come to care about these characters and the drama of their inner circle.Most of the characters are motivated by their different versions of love. Some are motivated by something else entirely. Those unknown motivations will turn into the big mysteries towards the end.I really appreciate Armistead Maupin's succinct style of writing which is unusual for a fiction book. The dialogue is exactly what it needs to be with the occasional comedic digression or a enlightening sociological insight.Tales of the City would be of most interest to any San Francisco resident, resident wannabe, or just anyone that wants to be transported to another place and time."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I became hooked on these books ever since I first watched the movieon my local pbs station. I bought the book read it, then within a month time completed the series. Now I have them all not only in paperback, the 3dvds, now I've downloaded them all to take with me everywhere I go."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I lived in San Francisco for a short time. For some strange reason, San Francisco seems like home the minute you step off the plane, and remains your home after you leave. This book captures this atmosphere perfectly. Re-reading this book (now on Kindle) is like leafing through an old diary to remember friends that have long since moved on, and events that exist in the haze of memory. Each of the characters seems like someone that you've invited into your living room and life. Every reader is, at times, the wide-eyed Mary Ann, the searching Michael, or the mysterious Anna Madrigal. And that is the pure charm of the book."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I got the Kindle edition because you never know when you might need a dose of Mouse and MaryAnn on the road.A great story, great characters, well plotted, and a romance between older people (gasp!). Groundbreaking in showing that people in their 60s can fall in love too."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"First of the serie, probably my favorite book of my favorite series... Get to know everyone and follow them true the years.You.ll be addicted!"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"What a fun read, perfect for traveling or just when you want to sit down for A good book. Love the historical aspects of reading about my favorite city, San Francisco!"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"A wonderful apartment house at 28 Barbary Lane in San Francisco is the setting for this tale of its quirky and engaging residents. Mary Ann Singleton, a wide-eyed Midwestern girl, falls in love with the city while on vacation and never goes back home. Her often comic, often tragic, adventures and the people she connects with provide a somewhat charming tale, but in the end resolves nothing, only sets the stage for coming sequels.I was somewhat disappointed after hearing of this for so long and seeing all the glowing reviews. While it may have been ground-breaking when first published in the 1970's, it is pretty standard fare today and doesn't give the contemporary reader the fresh and innovative look at the gay lifestyle that it gave 35 years ago. That being said, the book is not without its humor and charm, its variety of interesting characters and very human stories. The problem for me was that it only seemed to scratch the surface and not delve very deeply or completely into any one person's life. Also, one of the most tantalizing bits of the story was left dangling and apparently begs the reader to embrace the whole series to find the answer.Because this was originally a newspaper serial, the chapters are short and quick and the action pops rapidly from one character to another. Maupin is a gifted writer who can balance many characters and storylines, but in the end, this one was like cotton candy---enticing, but ultimately unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I'm sure this would have made a much larger impact on the reader back when it was written. I think part of its appeal was that it was fresh at the time.That being said, I wouldn't necessarily dissuade anyone from reading this. It was an entertaining read and gave a glimpse into (what is now) history. The problems are that I didn't feel connected to any of the characters and there was no resolution on a certain issue (I can't give it away here). Obviously, there is a need to read the sequel to solve the mystery. The other thing that bothered me was that everyone knew or was connected to everyone else. It was just one coincidence after another, which got really annoying. Maybe the gay community was that small and interconnected, I don't know, but this was true for gays and straights alike."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"A book that captures what it was like in San Francisco in the late 1970s. Young, naive Mary Ann Singleton has just moved there from Cleveland. She quickly gets caught up in the swinging, carefree life and interacts with a cast of very interesting characters: Michael Tolliver, a gay romantic man; Mona a cynical woman who's unsure of wat she wants; Brian Hawkins a straight ladies man; Edgar Halcyon, a rich man; his unsatisified daughter DeDe; her cheating husband Beauchamp and Mrs. Madrigal who is connected in some way to them all. The chapters are VERY short (I believe the longest is 3 pages) and the book moves at breakneck speed. The dialogue is witty and the large cast of characters endlessly amusing. I only gave pause to the large amount of casual drug (ab)use in the book but that WAS a sign of the times. Never a dull moment with this one. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Midwesterner Mary Ann Singleton falls in love with San Francisco while on vacation and makes an abrupt decision to relocate. She takes an apartment at 28 Barbary Lane, owned by the mysterious but kindly Anna Madrigal. This provides our entry into a world of lovingly-drawn characters from both the gay-friendly, bohemian, pre-AIDS world of 1970s SF and the stuffy, gossiping, status-conscious world of high society. One of the major delights of this novel is the way author Armistead Maupin draws these characters into each other's orbits in unexpected ways, providing quite a bit of overlap between two seemingly incompatible worlds. Maupin is a very gifted writer of telling vignettes and humorous dialogue. He stumbles toward the end when he reveals a truly depraved character without dealing adequately with the issues he raises. But, otherwise, this book is full of people I want to know and know more about. Thankfully, there are five more books in the series!"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"This is one of those books you don't want to stop reading because each chapter leaves you hanging for the next. The lives of each character draw you in closer and the tie-in is fabulous. Highly recommend for a quick, light read!!!"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Armistead Maupin does a brilliant job in intertwining the lives of nearly a dozen people in his internationally-acclaimed \\"Tales of the City.\\" The book is quite a quick read, interesting, and also provides a great commentary on life during the 70s. Maupin, who is himself a homosexual, also does a good job of using the story to paint a picture of the gay community. Similarly, he does a fabulous job of describing San Francisco and the interesting culture that exists there. This book is recommended for all, especially those that are looking for an amusing book to read on a nice afternoon."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Reading the 'Tales of the City'-Series was such a wonderful experience I could easily repeat it as much as I could. Maupin's style is so great and terrific, it's strange I hadn't heard of him that much, before I read it.The characters are surely some of the best ones ever created in literary history. The developement of the storyline is so surprising and unexpectable it's breath-taking. The twists and turns are so effective, because you seem to know the characters so well, and never had thought... well, you have to explore the secrets by yourself. I have never seen such a developement of characters. The same persons are totally different in the last book than in the first one. It's great.I won't rate every book differently, although they are very different. But they are so great alltogether and so well-connected it's hard to tell them apart.This is wonderful stuff!"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"As I do not plan to get to San Francisco in the near future, my opinion of the book is purely in regard to it as a yarn.Much as I enjoyed it, it struck me as soap-operatic at times. For example, the level of interconnectedness is hard to believe. I thought only Melrose Place could have a situation where the doctor whom A goes to just happens to have been the lover of A's father's secretary's neighbour and just happens to later sleep with A's husband.But perhaps the city is actually like that.More specific comments: Norman's secret is worse than soaps. But D'Orothea's secret is really really good -- imaginative, plausible, lateral thinking and a great comment on life in the fast lane."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"&quot;Tales of the City&quot; will take you back in time to the carefree 1970s. The characters in these books become friends to the reader, and don't be surprised if you find yourself rooting for them and worrying about them. When I finished this book I felt sad to say goodbye to these people...BUT there are five more books in the series! Some of the funniest lines in literature are in these books. Do yourself a favor...READ THESE BOOKS. I guarantee you'll hold these characters in your heart forever."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I read the &quot;Tales of the City&quot; series many years ago, and recently re-read the entire series. What a wonderful time I had visiting this family that I called my own when I was 21. Read the books and you will not want it to end... Note to all, when you see a reference to a former teen idol &quot;_____ _____&quot; know that this is &quot;Rock Hudson&quot;. This weekend, the Seattle Men's Chorus will be premiering a concert based on this series. The author, Armistead Maupin will be joining the guys of the chorus as they present passages from the books, along with music and some acted scenes. The concert is titled &quot;Tunes from Tales (Music for Mouse)&quot; and the focus is primarily of Michael Tolliver and his relationship with his new home San Francisco, his mother and the friends he now considers his family."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"As a published writer (LONELY JUCTIONS), I know how difficult it can be to fully realize in writing the complete characterization of people without making them seem from another planet. That Maupin is more than capable of making ALL of his characters well-rounded people is a tribute to the man's talent. Then, he takes it a step further and places it in a time and city where everything was happening. The man's talent is amazing. And, at the end of the sixth book, I was sad to not know more about my new-found friends, but felt a rare satisfaction...like that of having a good cigar, a perfect bottle of wine, or a very satisfying meal. You MUST enjoy this 6-part saga for yourself. While the mini-series are excellent, they are not the novels and you owe it to yourself to try one. But then, if you try one, you'll be hooked. I know that for a fact!"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I have just finished the first of the &quot;Tales of the City&quot; series and am proceeding to the next one. For a long time, I have stopped reading non-fiction as most of the novels these days are -- trite and predictable. I am not saying that this novel is a thriller but rather it is most entertaining. The message is conveyed well in simple language to the readers. If one has a vivid imagination and can feel the characters, then putting down the book is not an easy task. But if one needs to, then Maupin's short chapters are most convenient and no bookmark is required. I would say that the first book in this series is a good piece of modern day literature. And I do recommend that anyone who enjoys reading Maupin to also read English authoress, Jane Green's &quot;Jemima Jones&quot;"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"My mother gave me this book when I moved to San Francisco to attend college. I immediately fell in love with the book and all it's characters. I suddenly found my self running all over the City searching for the rest of the books, two of which I read while sitting in a coffee house one night. It was four years ago that I first discovered this delightful series and have even re-read them all since. I am eagerly anticipating SHOWTIMES airing of More Tales. I reccomend Armistead Maupin's books to everyone, especially anyone who has ever or will ever live in San Francisco."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"The humour in this is so quick! It's that Will and Grace humour about 15 years before its time. I found myself feeling sad when a book was ending, but couldn't wait to get onto the next one in the series. Also a winner of you're a fan of San Francisco (as I am) - very real descriptions of Frisco, really captures the essence of the place. Not just touristy description, but real detail of the lifestyle there. I have one more book to go to finish the series and I keep putting it off because I just don't want it to end."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Back in flashy, sexually-hedonistic 1970's California, when Armistead Maupin was serially writing the stories that would later become the book Tales of the City, San Francisco residents read these chapter-size installments in the local press, and to them it was like following the lives of people out there somewhere in their city, in their world, in their time. Today, thirty years later, reading Tales of the City, is more about making a trip backwards to another era: an anything-goes era extremely different in attitudes and mores from the reactionary conservatism of our own. The open promiscuity, the drug use, the amorality and experimentation that temporarily re-set life's rules might surprise many born after the \`70's, who grew up in more staid years than those which Maupin uses for his canvas. This book is filled with larger-than-life characters whose exploits fascinate perhaps even more now than they did in that other age. This book is funny, touching, slightly repellent in a few places and endearing in even more. Its stories of the unique migrations to San Francisco of the spiritually-seeking and the sexually-unbound reveal some of what made that world-famous city so unique. I think this evocative book will become a classic and be read long into the future for use as a roadmap back to a time and place destined to become as (in)famous as Paris in Fitzgerald's 1920's."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Yay! I've been waiting for this to come to Kindle for so long: it's one of my favorite books. It's like an old friend that I haven't seen for a long time, but am always glad to see. Way to go Amazon! Can't wait for the rest of the volumes to go Kindle!"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I would give the \\"Tales\\" series 10 stars if I could. I love the stories. I couldn't wait for them to come out in a Kindle edition. But why after several years of e-books are there still so many errors and typos in the Kindle editions???"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"If you are going to San Francisco be sure to wear some flowers in your hair, someone sang. If you are not going - but you want to, just for starters pick a copy of Armistead Maupin's \\"Tales of the City\\" a novel that was first serialized in the mid-70's in a local newspaper and some time later was published in a single volume. But he didn't stop, and last year he reached the seventh installment.\\"Tales of the City\\" is a quick read - what doesn't mean is a disposable one. The characters are unforgettable and after a couple of pages it feels like we have known them for ages. It all begins when Mary Ann Singleton a Cleveland twenty-something spends vacation in San Fran and decides she does not want to go back home.As she starts her new life, we are introduced to a group of people who are somehow related - although they are not aware of the ties all the time. The most important scenario is a building in 28 Barbary Lane, where Mary Ann moves to. The owner is Mrs Madrigal who receives her favorite tenants with a special gift.By this time, \\"Tales of the City\\" has become classic. It is funny and it also has cultural and sociological importance. The new P.S. edition brings some interesting information on the writer and his work. But the most touching part is a short text he wrote recollecting the time when the series started to become popular. The stories, has been said, are a love letter to San Francisco. His text is a love letter to the art of creating a world using imagination and observation of his life and times."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"A friend of mine moved to San Francisco in the late 1980s to accept a new job. He didn't know much about the City and he had never lived here. He asked a mutual friend of ours to recommend a good guide book or history. Our friend recommended &quot;Tales of the City&quot; with the remark, &quot;This is all you ever need to know!&quot; I agree, the &quot;Tales&quot; series give you a look at a place and time that is at once specific and universal. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I really enjoyed the characters and razor-sharp dialogue in this novel. The many references to the 70s brought me back to that fun and carefree time in my life. The plot and story line reflected the ziegest of the times be it mixed marriage, gay rights, black pride, gay pride and the like. But what Maupin did so skillfully where other authors have failed is he never let the characters rest while he espoused some social and/or political view. He let the characters be the vehicle. As a reader I cared deeply for them and the author left me wanting to continue in the series to renew my relationships with them. That, to me, is the acid test of fine writing."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"These are, quite simply, the most entertaining books ever written. Like so many other reviewers here, I read the whole series in a week then promptly read the only other book I could find written by Mr Maupin, &quot;Maybe The Moon&quot; (just as wonderful and wacky). How anyone could not take these books and their wonderful characters to their hearts is beyond comprehension. The two downsides have been - 1) reading anything else has been extremely difficult as any other piece of fiction has an aweful lot to live up to and 2) that Mr Maupin does not write more as he is surely one of the best writers of the modern era.If you have yet to read these books, do yourself a favour - turn off your computer and race to your nearest bookstore. Don't plan anything for the next week as you'll want to forget your own life as you immerse yourself in the lives of your new best friends."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Perhaps it's a bit of Californian bias that I select this particular book; I am a California native and it's this that makes Tales of the City all the more familiar to me. The story began as a weekly serial for the San Francisco Chronicle back in the early seventies, before I was even born. Still, generational differences don't keep one from getting sucked into the world of Anna Madrigal, Michal &quot;Mouse&quot; Tolliver and all those who reside at 28 Barbary Lane.It's hard to know where to begin when describing this series. Maupin's writing is descriptive, yet it doesn't trespass the way other authors might, as they try too hard to convey their &quot;vision&quot; to the reader. Maupin prefers to sit back and let the reader draw - or jump to - their own conclusions. He enjoys cliffhangers, melodrama and even blatant shock tactics to keep the reader's attention, and it's these things that remind you that this world was born in the pages of a newspaper. Despite the simplicity to Maupin's work, he still manages to create the most intricate, involved world of people living, working and loving in San Francisco.The characters, of course, are what make the book: Mary Ann Singleton, the Ohio transplant searching for meaning to her life, Brian Hawkins, the aging gigolo, Michael Mouse, the hopeless romantic looking for Mister Right, Mona Ramsey, the hippy in denial, and of course, Mrs. Madrigal, the landlady of Barbary Lane and &quot;Mother Of Us All&quot;. With these few characters, Maupin creates an entire world that, when you close the book, stays with you. It never goes away.The interlocking storylines, plot twists, turns and five-car pileups inspire a special kind of tolerance in the reader, for you never know when your favorite character and the villain will cross paths with one another and a complete role-reversal will occur. This is a must-read for anyone interested in the human condition.The only downside is that you actively miss these people when you stop reading. Then you only have to pick up the books and read them again. I do it all the time."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Does every gay man start their gay reading with this book? Possibly the answer is yes, and I think that's a wonderful thing. It's funny but real, risky but ultimately safe (like a mother's approving hug), and it captures a moment in time that is the foundation of contemporary gay society. For any gay man who realizes and respects how significant the 70s were for gay life, owning this book is just as important as owning CAN'T STOP THE MUSIC by the Village People or cherishing those Tom of Finland drawings."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Original written as a newspaper serial, Armistead Maupin's TALE OF THE CITY may not be great literature--but it sure is fun.Mary Ann Singleton is an up-tight midwesterner when she vacations in San Francisco and on the spur of the moment decides to make it her home. Once installed in a Russian Hill apartment and employed by a powerful advertising agency, she finds herself embroiled in one soap opera situation after another: drugs, sex, and intrigue abound in her newly adopted city, and the lives of the people that she meets overlap in some very unexpected ways.Although Mary Ann's adventures--which range from coping with suicidal help-line volunteers to dealing with extremely unpleasant pornographers--form the backbone of this novel, TALES OF THE CITY casts a broad net. Reigning over Mary Ann's apartment house is the engmatic owner, Anna Madgridal, who seems to have formed a suspiciously deep affection for another tenant, advertising artist Mona, who is greatly attached to her gay room mate Mouse, who is friendly with lady-killer Brian who is warm for Mary Ann's form. On the business front, her boss Edgar is coping with socialite wife Frannie and their excessively pampered daughter Didi--not to mention Didi's no good husband Beauchamp. And needless to say, Frannie, Didi, and Beauchamp all have a few issues of their own. What with one thing or another, they all run rampant through enough mood rings, gay beaches, opera societies, macrame, free sex, and Quaaludes to choke a mule.If there is a problem with TALES OF THE CITY, it is that it is a very topical, very localized sort of novel; if you didn't actually live in San Francisco during the 1970s (and I didn't), you may occasionally feel you're missing something when it comes to Maupin's more topical charactures and bits of satire. But don't let that stand in your way: Maupin writes in a witty manner, and the characters and various threads of the story are so entertaining that you'll likely finish the book in one enormous gulp. Extremely entertaining and tremendous fun.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"\\"Tales of the City\\" is the first of six novels in one of the most enjoyable series I have read in a long time. Beginning in the mid-70's (anybody remember mood rings and pet rocks?) with its false promise of free love and rampant promiscuity, the series' progression brings along with it the inevitable slide into the materialism and the specter of AIDS which characterized the lost innocence of the 80's. We watch the main characters progress (or decline) as the series unfolds, and while the changes and deterioration can be painful to watch, they are also eminently believable. We shake our heads at Mary Ann's metamorphosis from a corn-fed innocent from Cleveland looking for success and Mr. Right into a career-driven egomaniac who will sacrifice anything and everything that stands in her way, and we cheer Michael on from one adventure to the next in his frantic search for his own Mr. Right, knowing that his final happiness will have a time limit caused by his past bed-hopping which will result in a slow death sentence; we just want him and his lover to make the most of the time left to them. Watching the antics of the younger set is Anna Madrigal, the benevolent landlady of 28 Barbary Lane, a self-made individual in every sense of the word, everybody's favorite \\"aunt\\" figure, accepting, non-judgemental, knowing how to keep her distance, but always there when you need her. We wish Armistead Maupin had written a seventh book to bring us yet another installment in his characters' lives, but maybe it's best that he left off where he did, and let us use our imaginations from that point on. It's a great series and great fun by a very talented writer."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City begins one of the most entertaining, touching and involving series of books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. The dialogue crackles, the action is paced brilliantly, and the characters pop off the pages and stay with you long after the final chapter ends.The cable network Bravo has recently re-broadcast the film version of &quot;Tales&quot; as part of their Gay Pride month series. While PBS and Showtime have done an admirable job translating these tales into well-produced mini-series, nothing can compare to reading these amazing books and becoming involved in a time and a place that are gone forever.I have given this book to friends and family on countless occasions. It never fails to delight and entrall. And everyone I have given the book to has gone on to read the complete series.I miss my friends on Barbary Lane, and I am EXTREMELY eager to read the next book by Mr. Maupin. Please, Armistead! Hurry!"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Tales of the City is a love letter to San Francisco. It celebrates the rawness and the wildness of this beautiful city. The characters embody what San Francisco (during that time, at least) is all about.Unlike a lot of reviews that I've read, I have not seen the PBS miniseries (although I should get on to it because of Thomas Gibson). What I've seen was the musical staged by the American Conservatory Theatre in 2011. I liked it a lot and it was so much fun to watch. Since then, I wanted to get my hands on the book and read it.Tales of the City is a story about the life and times of the residents of 28 Barbary Lane. Mary Ann Singleton visits San Francisco in 1976 and falls in love with the place and the culture. She then decides to stay for good. She meets the landlady Mrs. Anna Madrigal, who readily takes Mary Ann under her wing; the other residents, Mona Ramsey and Michael \\"Mouse\\" Tolliver; and other colorful characters. All of them have their own baggage and journey.The book is a very easy read. It has (very) short chapters and each chapter is a peek into a character's life. Think, episodes. And as you read on, you will realize that all of them are somehow connected. The different ways they are connected are hilarious. It makes it so much fun to follow each storyline to find out how two seemingly unrelated characters are connected to each other. The various plot and character twists are hilarious. I can see how people, not just the LGBT crowd, can relate to these characters. It is real, candid, and heartfelt. While it is not a \\"great\\" piece of literature, it is definitely a good read.But just like what I said about the musical, \\"The characters are relate-able enough but it can be a little bit confusing for non-San Francisco, non-Bay Area people. I'm not and I admit, I didn't get some jokes.\\" Nevertheless, this book made me care about these characters enough for me to look for the other books and find out their journeys through life.Rating: 5/5.Recommendation: If you like LGBT lit, this one is a must-have, a must-read."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I have heard so many wonderful things about the Tales of the City book series that I finally decided to give it a whirl. What a brilliant and hilarious book! The book introduces the reader to San Francisco during the Seventies (the time in which this book was written) and the mythic apartment building at 28 Barbary Lane. Each character in the book has his or her spark of wit and neurosis. I especially enjoyed Mrs. Madrigal, Mary Ann Singleton and Michael. I marvel at the brilliant and exceptionally witty characters. It didn't take me long to realize -- especially with the author's Afterword -- that the book is a satire of the gay scene in San Francisco. The characters have a great deal of humanity in this book, for it is obvious that the author had a message to send to his readers. Is Armistead Maupin -- as some people have said -- this era's -- or rather, the Seventies era -- Charles Dickens? With his incredible writing and undeniable wit, I'd say yes!"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Age has done nothing to diminish the pleasure this book brings. The characters are believable, the writing fluid, and the dialogue inspired. Thank you, Armistead Maupin! Long may you write."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I don't know about you, but if you're reading this note then chances are that you're a bookaholic.I read Tales of the City many years ago and have kept my copy ever since, occasionally picking it up to search out and remind myself of one vignette or another.Over the years I have bought and read more books than I care to imagine. And annually I have a clear out and take piles down to the nearest charity shop. Only the best survive the annual cull.This is one of them and if you haven't read it then there's no time like the present to put things right. A beautifully paced and charming set of stories within a story."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Okay, okay, I guess I'm cheating because I never actually read the book. But just this past New Years I saw the previews for the miniseries that was going to be on Bravo (it was a rerun I guess). The previews looked pretty good so I started taping the six episodes at like one in the morning. I was extremely tired but once I saw the beginning I was enraptured for the next thirty minutes before I tore myself away! The next two days all I did was watch Tales of the City and be involved with this hilarious and wacky bunch of creepy and good people! There were so many twists and turns and dirty secrets...It was amazing. I'm sure the book is good. The other reviews make it sound amazing as well as the other volumes. But even if you don't read the book somehow you have to find a copy of the miniseries because even if the book is better the miniseries is SOOOOOO GOOOD! I CANNOT STOP TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT IT! IT'S THE BEST THING I HAVE SEEN ALL YEAR! And I'm not gay or anything either. No offense to anyone."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Who am I to review this man's writings? Still, it's fun to be asked to share my ignorance. Many books, by todays' authors, are touted as being hysterically funny, etc. Unfortunately, for me, I find that although I am said to have an excellent sense of humor, these fall rather flat well before the end of the stories.Maupin allows us to enter the world of the Gay and Straight communities, without forcing either on us as being the \\"correct\\" one. I enjoyed how brief he made each chapter, yet (at any given point) tied them together and continued the stories of the several lives, to whom he has introduced us.There were some \\"whimsical\\" moments, and fewer \\"outright humorous\\" scenes, however, I had no trouble finishing the book, and look forward to reading his next two installments.As they used to say on one of the 1950's Teen Dance Shows, on TV, \\"It's a catchy tune, but a little hard to dance to. I'll rate it as a 7. I will rate this book with 3 stars. If I had laughed, 'til I had tears in my eyes, I'd have given it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Frothy, intelligent, satirical, lyrical, the original gaylit/chick lit, diabolicial, and tragicially hillariously comedic .... Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City capture the unique spectral of San Francisco's culture. One house, many tenants, and the life of the Bay Area's liberal mind-set have captivated and entertained audiences since 1976. It wouldn't be about San Francisco without Mrs.Madrigal, the infamous landlady of Barbery Lane."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I almost didn't want to review this because it is SO, SO fabulous that I literally cannot think of the words to describe it!So I just want to share that this book (as well as More and Further Tales) is one of the best reading experiences of my life and the stories will linger with me literally forever. As insane as it sounds it feels like the characters of this book are my good, good friends and that I could call them up or go to San Francisco and find them and their fabulous world waiting (and I've had other readers tell me the same thing so don't call the mental hospital for me yet)! Armistead Maupin is a literary god as far as I'm concerned! One of the best authors of all time! I could not recommend a book or a series more."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I've heard so many people say the Tales of the City series was so incredible, and I've read all the reviews on this page, but I couldn't even get through the first book (and I've lived in the Bay area all my 22 years). To me, it lacked richness and colorful descriptions, and very little &quot;happened&quot; except for the most mundane of situations. San Francisco just didn't &quot;come through&quot; the pages for me."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Tales of the City and its follow-up sequel More Tales of the City accompany the reader on a whirlwind tour of 70s gay San Francisco, pre-AIDS post-Vietnam. Maupin has spoken eloquently about gay writers' need to write not just about gay characters, and here he gives us a mix of straight and gay, mostly young but also a pair of older characters who near the end of the book fall into an unlikely romance, which is terminated when the man, Edgar Halcyon, dies.Anna Madrigal is a fifty-something been-around freewheeling lady who runs an apartment house, where she likes to tape joints to the doors of new tenants as a welcome gesture. The various denizens of 28 Barbary Lane make up the cast of Tales of the City. There is Mary Ann Singleton, prim innocent from Cleveland who has arrived in San Francisco for a visit and decided to stay. She finds a job at Halcyon Communications, an advertising agency presided over by patriarch Edgar Halcyon, and whose employees also include Barbary Lane inhabitant Mona Ramsey, coke-sniffing, lovelorn copywriter. Mona is fired when she unloads on a Halcyon client, Adorable Pantyhose. She offers to share her pad with Michael \\"Mouse\\" Tolliver, a likewise unemployed gay guy who has to give up his place at Barbary Lane. Michael is in a relationship with gynecologist Jon--until Jon happens to drop in at a bar where Michael has entered a dance contest in the hope of winning the $100 prize to help with expenses. Michael wins the dance contest, but Jon is disgusted and walks out on him.Then there is Brian, who works as a waiter but is actually an attorney who worked on social justice causes until he burned out. Brian spends his time cruising singles bars. At one point he picks up a waitress at a diner and when she takes him to her place in a trailer park, he realizes he has already been there before and slept with her \\"roommate\\"--who turns out to be her daughter.By now you are probably starting to get the idea.Another tenant, Norman Neil Williams, lives in a sort of penthouse on the roof, where he keeps aloof from the rest of the Barbary Lane family. Norman is supposedly a vitamin salesman. Mary Ann falls into an unlikely relationship with him (unlikely because Norman is such a nudge) until near the end of the book, his true identity is discovered.This is approximately where the book ends. The exposure and death of Norman makes up its denouement. Left unresolved is the question of Mrs. Madrigal's mysterious past. Mary Ann remains lovelorn. There is material here for another book.And what do you know? Another book appears: More Tales of the City, in which Mary Ann goes off on a vacation to Mexico with Mouse (Edgar Halcyon has left her $5,000 in his will). There she finds romance with Burke Andrew, who used to live in San Francisco where he worked as an AP reporter, but has amnesia about that part of his life.Meanwhile, Mona too sets off on a trip. Deciding that she needs a change of scene, she heads out for Montana. After ingesting some angel dust and getting seriously stoned, she meets up with Mother Mucca, a crusty old babe who runs a whorehouse in Montana. The two hook up and Mona joins her at the Blue Moon Lodge, where she helps out in an unofficial capacity (she doesn't turn tricks). We later learn that Mother Mucca is the mother of Anna Madrigal and Mona's grandmother. Anna, you see, has had a sex change operation (revealed in a dossier kept by Norman and destroyed by Mary Ann in Tales of the City). There is an eventual reunion of the three generations of women.Back in San Francisco, Mary Ann sets out to unravel the mystery of Burke's amnesia. Meanwhile, Michael has reconnected with Jon in Mexico and the relationship is on again. After their return to SF, Michael is stricken with a rare disease that paralyzes him. There seems little hope, but he has a miraculous recovery and will start a new job at Halcyon. It looks like happily ever after for this pair.After following a twisted trail of cleverly crafted clues, Burke and Mary Ann reconstruct the forgotten events that caused his memory blackout. The story is a sensational one, and Burke is suddenly in demand by the media. He accepts a promising job in New York and asks Mary Ann to accompany him, but she is by now bonded with her SF family and will remain there.Anyone for Further Tales of the City?Maupin's books are fun to read and hard to put down. Nothing too weighty here, but for readers in search of hip, entertaining fare they come recommended."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Evertime I open up the Tales series, memories flood into my mind.Perhaps everyone falls a little in love with their childhood city, but very few have a chronicler as Armistead Maupin.(pun intended)Dorthy went to the Emerald City and no she didn't go back to Kansas, she stayed."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"The author sneaks short peeks of 2-45 minutes into the lives of the characters. Most of these peeks are 3-4 pages each making it a fast read. Maybe this helps keep the reader from getting bored, Frankly, for me it was frustrating as just as you get acquainted and reacquainted with the interesting characters the chapter ends and the next chapter takes us to other characters, much like TV soap-operas except the author is not so cruel as to always leave us at the most dramatic moment.Most of the story takes place through conversation and it is very close to realistic, except there's a lot more wit in the book then in most real conversations.The author also glosses over the sex which is ironic given that the stories take place in very liberal, sexually open San Francisco.Finally the vast majority of characters are masochistically unhappy; they ought to be taken out back and slapped around to get them to realize how happy they should be."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"After reading this, I found it hard to remember exactly what had happened in it. Some of the characters are interesting, especially Mrs. Madrigal and Michael Tolliver. But I have not felt the need to read the others, and will probably never need to re-read this one. An amusing diversion, nothing more."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"After hearing so much about this book from so many people for such a long time, I walked out of the bookstore very excited and ready to immerse myself in the imaginary world of 28 Barbary Lane. I read a few chapters, surprised at the lack of eloquence, the shallow characters and the non-existence of a plotline. Surely, I thought, San Francisco's defining novel has to extend beyond the bedside adventures of a group of roughly drawn charicatures. Okay, I thought, I'd better stick with it; after all, with so much buzz, this has got to be a great piece of literature. But alas, the more I read, the more trite it got, until I was left with the sense of chewing a less than flavorful gum for much too long. What a disappointment! This might have been very daring in the 1970s with its open-minded take on gays, but today -- when thankfully society has become much more accepting -- it feels very, very dated. If anything, it serves as a telling &quot;period piece&quot; for the 1970s, reflecting much of the era's self-centeredness and superficiality, seasoned with some of the preachiness of the 1960s. However, since the author is clearly part of that culture instead of a critical observer, the lessons learned for the readers are limited."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"This is a fantastic book. It is campy, creative, suspensful, and a true joy to read. I first read it in 1994, and have revisited this book several times since then for its humor and spirit. The characters are so lively, and the drama laden turns in the lives of these neighbors will catch you by surprise! A great book for reading on the beach or by the pool-lighthearted and a true reflection of the spirit of San Francisco. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"The characters were well presented, the plots were extreamly true to life and very beleivable, campy etc..

Love them all :)"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Truly, I don't believe that I have met *anyone* who hasn't completely fallen head over heels over the &quot;Tales of the City&quot; series.

Highly, HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I love this book. It's the best thing I've ever read. When the mini sereies was on PBS originally I passed it up because I missed the first episode and I couldn't get into it, so I bought the book and I loved it. You know the old cliches, it made me laugh, it made me cry, blah, blah, blah. Well, it actually did. It is easily my favourite book of all time. I'd much rather re-read it than read the stuff that is compulsary for school. It is the best. I think everybody should read it!!!"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I began reading this book and I was instantly sucked in until it was completed. Reading this book, you began to feel like you are a part of the Barbary Lane crew, and seeing it come to a close is devistating. Until you discover that there are **five more books**! I was so enamoured with this book that I told all of my friends about it, lent my book(s) to them, and made an all night session out of videos of the PBS series.

In the last year I've found a couple of books that caught me in their snare as well. Tim Farrington's California Book of the Dead and the other is Alex Garland's The Beach. Both have a set of characters that really involve you in the story. I just wish there could be more Tales of the City!"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I first read this series in high school and have since picked it up at least once a year for a good re-read. In college, when faced with an unexpectedly boring batch of freshmen, I found myself wishing these characters were real. Now, as a young woman on her own for the first time, I totally identify with Mary Anne Singleton's quest for independance and a new life in &quot;Tales of the City.&quot; I now also understand how friends can become adjunct family. I can't wait to re-read these books again and again, hoping to understand even more as I get older. The only down-side is that life seems oddly dull by comparison to Maupin's twisted, witty, and very special world."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"The very day I finished reading this book, I bought the rest of the series. Within a week, I had read volumes two through five. The characters in the book are like friends to me now. The only reason I haven't read volume six (although I have it) is that there's no more after that. I can't bear the thought of not having another intallment from the Tales of the City series. I've recommended the series to anyone that would listen, and they all loved it. It's the addictive type of book that you had better not pick up unless you have a lot of time, because, I promise, you won't want to put it down"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"This drama series is beyond incredible, it touched me in so many ways that it has a special place in my heart. The first 3 of the Armistead Maupin \\"tales\\" is totally original, unapologetic, and full of heart. The acting is superb, plot quirkie and surprising, and it makes you want to live in 1970s San Francisco. One of the reasons why I moved to San Francisco was because of the drama series based on the book, and the reality is not too far from the book or movie either!!!"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Last summer, I picked up Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City and began to read. One week and 2,000 pages later, I finished and found myself incredibly depressed the series had finally been drawn to a close. What a wonderful world they had at 28 Barbary Lane. Granted, it didn't last for very long and some of the characters (Mary Ann!) became horrible people, but it was still enjoyable all the way through to the last page of the sixth book. Highly recommended for anyone who desires a quick (unless you become addicted to the series like me), extremely entertaining read."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I first discovered the \\"Tales of the City\\" series over the summer. I purchased the ombious of the first three books.I have been looking for a long time for a series of books that fit into the mold that Armistead Maupin has used for his book series. He uses the books to tell tales of people who have all sorts of different sexual identities and how they live (and play) in a world where they are accpeted everywhere.Back in the 70's this had to be a groundbreaking book, and I am glad that I was given to the chance to meet Mary Ann, Mouse, Mona, Brian, Madame Madrigal, Jon, DeDe, and D'or so many years after there adventures where first told."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Maupin's Tales of the City manages to bring to relief some far out characters and manages to make them wholly believable because the world he creates for them is so detailed. I wasn't alive in the 70s, so I don't really know what it was like, but the world of 28 Barbary Lane is so vivid, this is what I imagine 1970s San Francisco to have been like.As the characters of Tales of the City navigate San Francisco society they seem to find themselves like fish out of water, but they never give up trying to find their places, find love and happiness. None of the characters is perfect. They all have their own flaws and quirks. They are characters to continue to follow through the rest of the series.The first book of the series deals with issues like gay and lesbian issues, abortion, spirituality, drugs, suicide, alcoholism and trying to make it in the big city. Maupin handles them with tact and without being heavy handed or moralizing. The characters just do the best that they can.The biggest drawback is that many of the pop culture references are a bit dated and obscure for younger audiences. Tales of the City is one of the most pop-culture filled novels that I have read. Many of the references were a bit lost on me personally, but it didn't get in the way of the whole vivid world that Maupin creates.Bottom line: Tales of the City is an engrossing world of pop-culture nostalgia and vivid groovy characters. It's well worth reading.Read more of my reviews at trevsliteraryreview.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I enjoyed \\"Tales...\\" but the short chapters chopped it up too much for me. I read it in about a week, and I think that for full effect it might best be read in two days so it's like a mosaic and pulls together more as a whole.I really enjoyed the San Francisco locales and the early seventies time period. I actually spent some time in SF about that time and quite a bit since, and this book really captured the feel and magic of the city. The characters were quirky and, although a bit over the top, scarily close to real life.I read another review saying other books in the series are paced better, so I might give them a try."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Reading this book is a bit like a history lesson. Set in San Francisco in the late-1970s, this book was remarkable for presenting homosexuality as part of mainstream popular culture. In 2011 this is hardly shocking, but thirty-five years ago it was. This is important to recognize before going into the book.With the stage set, I felt like this book read like a sitcom. The characters engage in crazy antics. They get involved in humorous love triangles. The series began in the newspaper, and I can see how that shapes the book. The book is comprised of short chapters and small vignettes. It is humorous and easy reading, a bit of mind candy.By the end I was left with some unanswered questions. What was the issue with the landlady? As this is the first book in a series, I'm going to assume that Maupin is setting up for the next book. I'll be reading it to find out."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I adore this series, and we all know that the original is always the best, but I see this book as the pilot episode of a television series. Plagued with pacing problems, as well as fairly one dimensional characters with few honest surprises, this is not the strongest offering of the series. That said, it's a good start, and it did make me want to read more, I just wish it felt like a more solidly constructed book. That said, \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" has a terrible pilot, too, and that's my favorite show."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"In simple, direct language, Armistead Maupin invites the reader into the lives of the residents of Barbary Lane -- a place where in San Francisco in the 1970s, a new resident is welcomed to \\"the family\\" by a joint taped to her door.Maupin brings their stories to life with ample description, plenty of of-the-era dialogue, and more product placement than I have ever encountered. The chapter titled \\"Coming clean in the Marina\\" includes People magazine, Downy, Cheer, Charlie, Care-free Sugarless gum, Paris Match, Armstrong linoleum, and United. Actual advertising is also referenced: \\"You are fresh, you know that?\\" \\"April fresh, I hope.\\" If you were a child of the '70s, then these iconic images make each scene even more real. You can practically smell the Charlie and picture Shelley Hack in a TV commercial in the next room. \\"Kinda free, kinda WOW\\" indeed.The characters are fun, too, and I'm sure I will wend my way through every installment of their lives. It's just the kind of fluffy summer reading that chicks dig."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"This is RE-read for me now after first reading the series 30 years ago!

A great beach or bedtime book as the chapters are only 1-1/2 pages long."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I do understand why such a large fan base developed in San Francisco, when these stories first came out by chapters in the newspaper.

Both the novel and the lecture were extremely entertaining and a fascinating window back to life in the 70's. The novel began as a newspaper series and had such a following that a series of novels resulted. The characters are engaging and represent many facets of society. I love the way their lives intertwine. I'm looking forward to later novels to see how the characters lives evolved."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"The buy/mail process worked well.

They draw you in and, as rarely any book has done in many years, kept me reading \\"just one more chapter.\\" The charachters in Maupin's books are like people we know and want to know more about. The characters genuinely garner our interest and I found I really cared about what happened next. Try just one and see. It's well worth the time spent."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"A friend of mine insisted that I read this novel, even though I had just watched the mini-series and was satisfied with that, so I committed myself to reading it, surprised to find the humor on the page, even though the mini-series was quite loyal to the book. There is more info one can gleen from the book that is lacking in the movie, but the performances of the movie really enhance some of the humorous lines that's not apparent from just reading it. I'd recommend reading the book first, then watching the mini-series.Its hard not to be taken in by this novel. Its very easy to read in bit sized chunks. The book tends to be dialogue heavy and skimpy on the descriptions, but you still get a lot of value out of reading. The characters and their diverse personalities come alive, the wit is apparent, and you can't help but feel like these are real people you wish you could meet. There are so many good lines in this book that are worth quoting, anyone who dreams of becoming a screenwriter or any writer period should read this novel as an intro course to believable dialogue.Mona is probably my favorite character, because she's the most eccentric. She moans the lack of males in her life, except for her gay best friend, making her the quintessential \\"fag hag\\". The scenes with her and Michael \\"Mouse\\" Tolliver, and her and D'Orothea (the foxy black model with a secret) are some of the funniest in the entire novel. Overall, I like how all the characters are connected somehow, whether intimitely or casually, and how it all plays out against the backdrop of a great American city. My only complaint is that there should have been more descriptive writing, because it comes across as a screenplay written in novel form. I do plan to read the rest of the series...especially before I watch the other mini-series adaptations. For good laughs and some of the best, wittiest lines I've ever read, add this novel to your reading list. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"This is a very cleverly told tale(s) of a dozen or so main characters, all of them as large as life, set in swinging San Francisco in the nineteen seventies. Anything goes and of course anything does. Much like the play &#65533;La Ronde&#65533; what goes around comes around. The lives of each and every one of the characters are inevitably linked as the novel progresses. Persons so diverse, with no apparent linking thread, turn out to be either intimately acquainted or only apart by one degree of separation. Some of the coincidences are amazing, but then real-life can often be just like that. Life is good, life is fun, there are swinging singles, miscreant couples, gay affairs, straight affairs, platonic ones and even the lady of the manor having a quick fling or two with the grocery boy.The setting is of parties, flash parties, up market parties and parties which are judged by the fame or &#65533;name&#65533; of the special guests. It is keeping up with the Joneses, outdoing your friends, work colleagues and neighbours in the most extravagant fashion where easy-come easy-go or here today gone tomorrow is the driving force. Yet for some of the characters it is as little as pursuing a simple dream, enjoying a &#65533;happy&#65533; cigarette or searching for a soul mate. Contrasting with the flash parties are scenes in laundro-mats, steam baths, dance halls (jockey pants competitions), supermarket aisles and inner-city low cost apartments. Halcyon, Manigault, Booter, Beauchamp, DeDe, Oona, Binky, Mona, D&#65533;Orothea and Madrigal are just a few of the characters whose lives and relationships are as unusual as their names.Most of the book is written as conversation between any two of the players so it is a quick read as the pages flash past. An appendix with an instant guide to all the characters in the book would have been useful as there are so many to remember. However, a few times when trying to recall who someone is or what they did earlier in the book, a link appears with a new person and the past anecdotes fall into place.For those of us who were around at the time &#65533; even if not in San Francisco or the USA &#65533; this book vividly illustrates and recalls the life style of the era when the music, the drugs, the fashions and the lifestyle were so unique, so superficial, so exciting and yet, at the same time so real. For those who weren&#65533;t, this is not just a social history of the age but a clever, romantic book, well put together and a darn good read."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Armistead Maupin's TALES OF THE CITY, which first ran as a series of newspaper columns in 1976-77, is a great, twisted, plot-filled soap opera, which commented as much upon its times and location as Charles Dickens' TALE OF TWO CITIES did long before it. The fact that, in addition to having characters with interwoven stories and histories, Maupin's characters also cope with drug use, bisexuality, transgendered characters, child porn stars and underwear-only dance contests just speaks to the time in which the story is set, God bless it. If the '70s were really like this (and if I didn't know what the consequences of all this were), then sign me up for a disco trip back in time.Reading this book, the first and best of the six, made me (briefly) want to move to San Francisco. It also served, to me, as a cautionary tale, for the lives of the characters in this book are far too wacky and occasionally downright scary. But, while all of the plot is going on, Mary Ann, DeDe, Beauchamp, Michael, Brian, Mona, Jon and Mrs. Madrigal do seem to be having more fun than I usually do. And they're funnier than I am.The chapters are brief and compelling, and they read quickly - like the best gossip. And the cliffhangers at the novel's end are straight out of Hitchcock.The original miniseries taken from this book is incredibly faithful, but TALES OF THE CITY is the most fun in written form - where it feels like the sort of newspaper you don't want to put down.(NOTE: I recommended this once to a nice Christian woman at my bookstore as a good poolside read. One of the more shocking twists made her drop the book in the water.)"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"This is much more than a story of some pleasant and funny people and their city: this is a veritable , compassionate and humorous portrait of the human species, in that idyllic time,when everything seemed possible.

When you finish, you'll want to be magically transported to San Francisco and declared an unofficial member of Mrs. Madrigal's family at 28 Barbary Lane."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I first discovered Armistead Maupin's work through the PBS Miniseries. I picked up the book and within minutes I was hooked. His characters are well-defined, alive, complex, funny, sad... totally lovable - even the unlovable ones. I loved the interaction between the landlady's life and all of her tenants. I've read most of the series, and plan to finish it soon. I look forward to the next installment in the miniseries, too, but wouldn't miss the books for the world. I highly recommend these books to any student of human nature and to anyone interested in first-class literary enjoyment"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"After seeing the Miniseries on PBS (and buying it later) I became interested in this book, and then when out and got the rest of the series.

Only if you knew that sixothers followed, which fortunately for you: they do!I picked up the book after watching the mini-series on television. I thought I might be in for a disappointment, as t.v. sometimes adds a glamour that's not always apparent in the books. I was wrong. These books are almost as good as an afternoon of Spelling Dramas. Every character interacts with every other character, and it's not at all weird. Maupin even manages to bring Jim Jones back from the dead and it's altogether believable. I haven't been this excited about a series of books since I first met Ramona Quimby on Clickitat Street in the second grade! Read this book. Read the series!

I read the whole book in one sitting, taking my time with final chapters because I did NOT want it to end. When I was done, I grabbed my car keys and rushed out to buy the second book in the series.This totally magical, entirely enjoyable, at times improbable, absolutely wonderful book is one of my all-time favorites. Maupin writes in a very straightforward, minimalist style, but still manages to create vivid characters. The situations range from the mundane to the totally absurd, but are always intriguing and never less than believable. I couldn't recommend a book more highly.

From Michael's quest for love, to Mary-Anne's journey to independance, these characters face life and death together on all its myriad fronts. Set in the San Francisco of the wild seventies, this book can be an interesting romp of nostalgia for many, or a wonderful peek into the past for those of us who were there, but in diapers, at the time.The only word of warning I add to my otherwise hands-down reccommendation of &quot;Tales of the City,&quot; is that its once serial nature makes it seem to jump and skip at the start, until you are used to the characters and have a feel for their personalities. Once you've got them down, it's a wonderful read, and you'll catch yourself pining for the next one, &quot;More Tales from the City.&quot;"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I am going to just write a generic review....

Although the book contains several memorable characters, it has a mediocre style, poor structure, and lack of focus.

But the worst sin of the book is that the Mary Ann character is nothing more than a plot device."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Armistead Maupin not only captures the zeitgeist of San Francisco in the '70s, but through his characters, carries us through moments of the human condition, seperate from time, place and gender."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I read this book when I was in my mid-twenties, about the age of Maupin's protagonist, Mary Ann Singleton from Cleveland. I found the storyline exhilarating and the book a page turner, and I continued to be haunted for years by the idea of the heroine's metamorphosis as she left behind the duldrum and dark Cleveland for one of the greatest cities in the world, San Francisco. Young Ms. Singleton proceeds to encounter wild and wacky characters, adventures and experiences as the world of San Francisco seems to serve as a metaphor for the archetypel passage through early adulthood. Ms. Singleton was a typical midwesterner and even a bit dull in every respect except one - unlike most, she took a chance on life. She left everything behind and took off in search of her dreams. Joseph Campbell, the author and professor, would have loved her. In many ways, her story is an example of the myth of the hero's journey. Who needs Oddysseus, Beowulf or Siddhartha when we have Mary Ann Singleton? And Tales of the City is easier reading than the Illiad to boot.(Eventually, when I turned 30, I could take thinking about this book no longer. I packed up what few possessions I owned, and took off for Florida - I couldn't quite get up the nerve for California... I have this book to thank for my life and adventures here to this day.)My point is that this book is not just good but, for me, great - it became more than entertainment. In my case, life imitated art, rather than the other way around. I hope it will do the same for you."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"TALES OF THE CITY by Armistead MaupinHere's a fun book that you can sink your teeth into. TALES OF THE CITY by Armistead Maupin is a story about a group of characters living in San Francisco during the late 1970's. Vietnam has just ended, disco is king (or queen?) and no one has yet heard of Aids.The book starts with the introduction of Mary Ann Singleton. She's just moved to The City from Cleveland, Ohio, to the dismay of her parents. We see the world of San Francisco through her eyes. She first moves in with a good friend of hers. Actually, she hadn't seen Connie since high school. But she now lives in The City and so Mary Ann looks her up, hoping to find a place to live. They become roommates, but after a few days of Connie, Mary Ann has had enough. She eventually moves out and ends up living in an apartment complex at 28 Barbary Lane.The landlady is an older woman named Mrs. Madrigal, and she makes sure every one of her tenants feels right at home. Mary Ann's first day there, she finds a note and a gift taped to her door, a rolled up joint. It took some getting used to but Mary Ann soon feels right at home in her new surroundings. Life in the city was nothing like living in Cleveland!TALES OF THE CITY covers the story of Mary Ann and her adventures in the City, but also introduces a ton of fun and outrageous characters, including Mouse (Michael) who becomes good friends with Mary Ann. He has his own set of problems, including boy troubles. Mary Ann has to introduce him to her parents on the phone as \\"Michael is a homosexual\\" when Mom says, \\"...a strange man answered your phone.\\" Beauchamp and Dede is a supposedly happy and successful couple, but upon closer look one sees a different story. Beauchamp works with Mary Ann at her new job in The City, and his father is the big boss. And Dede has her own problems, when she finds out her beloved Beauchamp may be fooling around! And Mrs. Madrigal gets involved with everyone's affairs, it seems, and is one of the central characters on Barbary Lane. There are too many characters to list here, but all are unique and interesting in their own ways.Reading TALES OF THE CITY for me was like jumping through a time warp and reliving an era in which I was a little bit too young to fully enjoy. Growing up in the 70's, I was oblivious of what was going on in the adult world. Yes, I listened to Disco, but that was probably it in terms of my exposure to all that was going on back then. TALES OF THE CITY brings all that to life, and much more. I finished the book with a smile on my face. TALES reflected the happier times of a generation that was rebelling against authority and the government, while the rest of the world looked on. There is no real plot in this book, although the reader follows each of the characters own stories, hoping that they find what they are looking for. I highly recommend TALES OF THE CITY and plan to read the entire series (Six books in all)."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"This book will make you laugh, cry, and leave you hungry for more.

And I like to recommend them to people, but there's been some backlash from some folks about a certain laxity of morals in some characters' behaviours...It can be a wee bit difficult to reconcile 70s San Francisco with the 21st Century. Since the first couple of books in this series are pretty much collected compilations of the columns he wrote for the SF Chronicle, they're very much time-capsules of the period in which he was living and writing. It's tragic to read them with 20/20 hindsight, knowing whats we know about AIDS, but also important to remember why the 70s were the way they were. Maupin has always fearlessly and shamelessly mined his own personal life(and others') for fictional material, so it seems pretty safe to assume that, in broad outline (minus some of the absurdity and semi-magical-realism of the books) that the emotional plot-matrix is true and semi-autobiographical... i.e., he was there, he lived it, he writes about it, and to change the politically-incorrect parts would be disingenuous (though they weren't so incorrect then--they were pushing the envelope on what was moral, social and political---perhaps it was adolescent rebellion, but it was rebellion nonetheless).I wish I could have been there. I don't know if I would have behaved the way that Michael, Marianne, and Mrs. Madrigal do, but I would have loved to have known them, then and now."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I have just finished the sixth book of the Tales of the City series. I loved every one of them and am only sad the series has ended. Maupin introduces you to a group of diverse individuals in San Francisco who have been brought together by their address and their very eccentric landlady.

These books will stay on my bookshelves to be read again and again!"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I recently read this book and enjoyed it a good deal. Armisted Maupin fills his serial-soap opera with loveable characters that you are more than happy to see again and again. From Mary Ann Singleton, the innocent and trusting romantic, to the mysterious but kind Ms. Madrigal, we are introduced to an array of people from the late 70s, living in San Franisco. There are enough twists and plot turns to put most soap operas to shame! Pick up a copy and you won't be sorry. You'll just be ready to buy the next installment!"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Maupin's tale of San Fransisco is a fun-filled jaunt through the lives of the deliciously sinful characters that surround 28 Barbary Lane. Sex, drugs, and maybe not so much rock n' roll (this is the 70's - let's stick to disco) permeate the atmosphere as a cast of over 10 loveable people discover their place in the world. This is a plot that will not draw you in the way it could, nor are the intriguing characters all that worthy of sympathy. However I find myself in quite an introspective mood after reading a few chapters, as I ask myself the same questions posed to Mary Ann, Mrs. Madgrigal, and the others. My advice: take this series to the beach, and have fun with it."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"This book was completely compelling. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down for two days. Tales of the City is both a very realistic story and Melrose Place for the 70's. You'll love the characters and the drama they experience. I would like to say only good things about it, but although it was fun to read, it IS a paperback soap opera. Read it for fun."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"What a book! Maupin introduces so many characters that seem to be neighbors of mine that I feel I live on Barbary Lane! Eveeryone should have an Anna Madrigal in their life. She is like a Mother Hubbard protecting her flock. I promise you that if you start to read this book, you will not be able to put it down!

Set in the disco, drug, and easy sex days in the nation's hippest city-still coming down from its Summer of Love high-\\"Tales of the City\\" weaves the stories of several characters in gripping and fun serial fashion.Maupin originally wrote the vignettes as a series of newspaper columns. The book collected these columns together, so you can whip through the stories without having to wait for another installment. And you will whip through this book. The length of the chapters and the cliff-hanger prose ensures a quick read.It's a fun if not deep book. It's especially interesting if you live in or often visit San Francisco. For really that's what this book is: a love story about a city."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"The only reason this isn't getting five stars is because Mary Ann irritated me so darn much in the beginning. :)I saw the mini-series, read the book, then started making my friends do likewise. We still explain situations in terms of the series.

It wasn't for me; I considered More Tales superior. But read this one first, get to know and love the characters, and then just keep reading!"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"The compelling story of an apartment building brimming with some of the most interesting San Fransiscan characters one could imagine. Well written and believable, this story gets a strong recommendation from me."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"As the story (and series) begins it is the mid 1970's and a naive young woman from Cleveland is announcing her intention to not return from her vacation as planned but to stay in San Francisco. Her parents are appalled but fail in their attempts to 'talk some sense' into their foolish child and get her to return home. It seems that their little girl, Mary Ann has discovered that she is 'home' already, and that home is San Francisco, not Cleveland. As Mary Ann begins her new life we meet an ever expanding cast of characters, Connie, who had fled Cleveland some time before and now offers to show Mary Ann the real City. As she begins to settle into her new life Mary Ann acquires a job, an apartment, a lover and an eclectic group of friends who introduce her to things she had only her rumors about back in Cleveland. We discover that Mary Ann and her new circle of friends have secrets and lives that are entwined in the most amazing ways that will surprise and delight.This is a touching and often times hilarious novel. Maupin has managed to create characters that remind us of ourselves or at least someone we have met. He then places them in situations that at least begin on familiar ground before they are carried to absurdity. All too soon the final page is turned but the reader can take comfort in the knowledge that this is only the beginning."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Tales of the City by Armistead Maupin is unique in its composition. Originally composed as a fiction column in a daily newspaper, the story is told in bite-sized chunks that make it a quick and easy read. Unfortunately, for me, this composition makes reading the tales as a novel a bit more chaotic and less organized. I also found the interrelationship of the characters unrealistic, especially in a city as large as San Francisco, unrealistic and that threw me off a bit. By the end the interrelationships were almost comical.Those things aside, there is a lot to like about Tales of the City. It presents a nostalgic look at San Francisco of the 60's and 70's. Through its pages, the reader can connect or reconnect with the spirit of San Francisco. The book's origins as a newspaper column make it a quick and easy read that can be read at the readers convenience. The characters all have multiple dimensions and depths which make them interesting people. Tales of the City is a book that everyone should read at least once."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"If you're looking for a wonderful trip to a fantasy land, this is the book for you! The good news is that the trip won't end after this book. There are five more books in the series.I was given this book over twenty years ago and I immediately went out and bought each of the others after I had read the preceding ones. I have read through the entire series at least three times and it has been just as refreshing each time I have done so.If you're gay, you will love these books. They will take you on a nostalgic trip back to a time when gay life was indeed gay. Of course, it was a bit crazy, just as these books are, but that was part of the charm of coming of age.Whether or not you are gay, you will fall in love with the endearing characters in this book. They represent a cross-section of humanity. They get involved in some of the most delightfully comical situations. The book is full of laughs.I especially appreciate that since I am the author of a series of comedic books. [...] Armistead Maupin has undoubtedly been a significant influence upon my own writing.The nice thing about this book is that you could read it over the course of a long rainy afternoon. It could also be savored like a box of chocolates by just reading a chapter at a time. That is not my style. I love an engaging book and this is one that will make you want to keep turning the pages.This book, as is the case for the others in the series, is bound to become a classic.

It is a very fun reading book. I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Every now and then an author is able to capture the \\"magic\\" - flavor may be a more accurate description - of a time and place. Armistead Maupin has done that in _Tales of the City_.Set in San Francisco in the mid-1970's, the lives of his characters cross each other and intertwine. Originally written as a serial in the San Francisco _Chronicle_, it is reminiscent of Dickens: short vignettes with sharply drawn characters, plenty of drama and tension (sexual and otherwise) that frequently leave the reader with a cliff-hanger at the end of the chapter leaving you hungering for more.The writing is witty (every few pages I was laughing out loud - much to the chagrin of those sitting around me at the coffee shop where I was reading most of the book), a bit irreverant (sexuality, gender, race and class are all targets of Maupin's pen), and utterly entertaining. I thorougly enjoyed the stories, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"This was a lightning-quick read; there is not much particularly challenging about this novel, but it was a lot of fun. Maupin successfully evokes a very specific time and place (1970s San Francisco) and interweaves multiple storylines. Some important social issues (homosexuality is a big one) are dealt with in a non-judgmental and entertaining way.Tales of the City features several characters who rent apartments at 28 Barbary Lane from one Anna Madrigal, a mysterious woman in her fifties who has a sketchy past. Mary Ann Singleton fulfills the role of naive Midwestern newcomer who falls in love with SF while vacationing and decides to relocate, only to have significant trouble adjusting to the completely different social mores of her new home. There are, of course, many other characters, each with their own storylines. I am looking forward to reading the next installment of the series!"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I thought at first this book must have been written in the early 1990s because the descriptions of San Francisco are spot on. I was surprised to see that this book dates to 1978! My goodness -- the City hasn't changed! I'm laughing my ass off at this book. I'll have to read the other books by this author. It is so much fun to read a novel about a city that is just minutes away."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I couldn't put this book down. The characters are all excentric, yet absolutely loveable. If you are a San Franciscan or have at least visited, its an extra special treat."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"This is the classic. The book that sets the stage for five more excellent follow ups. This book was a Peyton Place/Valley of the Dolls combo that was far more entertaining than you would think. There's Mary Ann Singleton moving from Cleveland to San Francisco because the color of her mood ring said she was in the right spot. Of course she falls in love with a married man who is also into men and dates a child pornographer who is also a detective doing research of Anna Madrigal, the owner of 28 Barbary Lane for some unknown seedy purpose. Then there's Mona who worked for Halcyon Inc (or whatever the name of the company is...) as a graphic designer and she's in to quaaludes, pot, cocaine, meditation...basically the works...but for her, she had a...um....relationship with someone (like I am going to spoil that for you!) and moves out of the apartment leaving Michael &quot;Mouse&quot; Tolliver there alone.

Then buy the next. And then the next...."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"While &quot;Tales of the City&quot; is not the best book of the series, its an essential start. It is here that you meet the characters you'll come to love and care for through the other books. It's here where the essential character introductions take place. Maupin, I think, uses Tales to not only tell a good story, but to lay foundations for the next two books.&quot;Tales of the City&quot; is written in a sort of &quot;Mark Twain&quot; style. Mark Twain used to serialize his works in newspapers and thus his chapters are short and to the point. Maupin did the same thing with the San Francisco Chronicle. The book is the perfect thing to read if you don't have a lot of time to sit down for a long read since you'll be through three or four chapters before you know it.Tales is used as current commentary...current commentary for the 1970s. Maupin loved to try to weave current events into the stories. Here you'll see commentary on the Women's Lib movement and the Anti-Gay campaign of Anita Briant written as they were happening. &quot;Tales of the City&quot; is historical comment written as fiction in a lot of ways and as such it can be facinating.Finally, &quot;Tales of the City&quot; is an essential book on Gay culture and Gay self-esteem. It presents a world where straights and Gays basically live together nicely and can be friends. Maupin doesn't display San Francisco as a Gay ghetto and everyone, no matter what their orientation, plays off of each other nicely. It's a world I'd love to live in."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"First things first when it comes to reading Maupin's Tales of the City series -- learn to read in segments. This first book flashes from place to place and character to character swiftly so that the reader can get an overall picture of the situation. Quite honestly, it reads much like if it were a television series (which it was on PBS and Showtime...two miniseries, so far). Thus, if you expect it to be full of long chapters and focusing on a conversation or situation for a long while, you're going to be disappointed (much as one of the more recent reviewers of this book was, I note). Maupin's tale of a newcomer to San Francisco, the naive and reserved Mary Ann Singleton, and her misadventures with the residents of Barbary Lane (Mrs. Madrigal, the gay and proud Michael, the liberated Mona, etc.) is the stuff of Dickens' serials, brought to the 1970s in a flash of humor, adventure and out-and-out 1970s wackiness. I have read and re-read and re-re-read the entire series over and over again and have never failed to be entertained by the characters or the situations they find themselves in. Truly one of the most brilliant series out there. Give it a chance -- you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I read the 'Tales' series in 1994. I remember cracking open the first book and falling in love within the first few pages. These were characters that I really wanted to get to know, here was a picture of gay love that wasn't veiled or shadowed.A week went by spent entirely with my new friends (interrupted only by an inconvenient search through the bookstores of Perth for an elusive copy of 'Further Tales').I remember almost going into shock when I closed 'Sure of You', so strongly had Mouse and co. entered into my life. How could I return to my dull life after such pleasure and joy! Well I did, and a year later (the day I saw the 'Tales' mini-series at a film festival) I came out to my best friend. I realised that it was time to take some of that joy and freedom off the pages and the screen and into my own life. Six years later, I'm happy to report that there's many an interesting 'tale' to tell..."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"I first read &quot;Tales of the City&quot; in its first printing in the late 1970's and waited with baited breath for the next edition to be printed. Each time I picked up a new book, it was like visiting with old friends. All of Armistead Maupin's characters are so real that I shall never again visit San Francisco without thinking about Mrs. Madrigal, Michael &quot;Mouse&quot; Tolliver, Mary Ann Singleton or Mona. I especially liked the way in which Armistead Maupin delved into the psyches of each character. As the character of Michael was exactly my age when he was first created, and continued to age along with myself throughout the series, I very easily identified with his changing views of life in the city. It's a wonderful read which is a must for every serious library."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"This book is just fun, fun, fun--a well-written, absorbing novel that you won't want to put down. It takes place in the 1970s and intriguingly depicts the interwoven lives of a group of young people living in the same apartment building. It's the best kind of summer read--100% enjoyable, 100% intelligent, 100% good-hearted without being overly sappy.One other thing: this book does contain some depictions of sexuality--gay and straight--that could be seen as promiscuous, if you are inclined to think in those terms. However, the reviewer on this page who griped that Maupin was &quot;irresponsible&quot; to write this way (given the AIDS epidemic that surfaced in the 1980s) must not realize that this book was WRITTEN in the 1970s. It's an accurate depiction of how life was back then. If you read the other books in this six-part series, you'll see that as they move into the '80s Maupin DOES deal with AIDS by having his characters deal with it. These novels are actual snapshots of the time they were written, not some sort of retroactive nostalgia trip. They are fully realized, fabulous achievements, and open-minded readers will love them. All six books in the series are highly recommended."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"Tales of The City captures the very spirit of San Francisco in the 1970's, as the spirit of the city, which surely is represented by the nickname 'Frisco, died. The City was not moral, nor neat. The victorians were seedy, the City in decay. But, nonetheless, Maupin describes the city as it was; determined to have a good time as it always had. Maupin depicts the economic classes as if he knew them intimately, and portrays the provincialism as it exists, without making the City look the worse for it. I moved here in part because of these books, having awakened in me as they did, the memory of the San Francisco I knew, just after I cut the apron strings and was sent here by Uncle Sam. It is a different place today. Tales of The City captures it as it was. Yea, the people were lonely, they did a lot of drugs, had a lot of meaningless sex, and ended up in the 'eighties none the less. But didn't we all? The story is entertaining, especially when viewed for itself: it was a newspaper article. Unless your morality is a vague as your sexuality, Tales of The City will transport you to the recent past, in an age where we can't believe that history was actually being made, but it was, and we might have been there, but for some twist of fate, or geography. If it corrupts you...you were probably corrupted to begin with, and just waiting to be swept away."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"This is a fun, late-20th Century take on the old theme of the virtuous midwestern girl who moves to the big city. Ulnlike Sister Carrie, though, Mary Ann Singleton is not so much the focus of the book as she is the touchstone by which other characters are measured and reveal themselves. Unfortunately, she lacks some of the emotional depth and appeal of Siste Carrie. Indeed, most of the characters in the book are paper thin. The result can be amusing and an excellent vehicle for satire, but not something that has great literary value. Maupin is more like Tom Wolfe than Dreiser in his ability to spin amusing yarns that have a good sense of the pulse of American culture, but without the depth and pathos that make for great literature.The real hero of the book is not so much Mary Ann as it is the two most appealing gay characters (Michael Tolliver and the closet gay gynecologist) who, despite their untraditional lifestyles, conduct themselves according to a moral code that would resonate with traditional American and Christian values. Indeed, perhaps the book is most significant for its ability, 30 years ago in a different and less tolerant time, to portray gay characters realistically and sympathetically.I find some of the upper class characters to be unbelievable and less than paper thin. Maupin is at his best in portraying the less lofty. Also, as a heterosexual who lived in San Francisco just a couple of years after this was written, I did not witness the ridiculously loose sexual mores portrayed in the book. Either Maupin is exaggerating to an unpardonable degree, or I horribly mis-spent by youth.The plot is a soap opera, but the book on a whole is entertaining and worthwhile."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"This book was the beginning of some wonderful friendships for me. The characters are good folks. I first read this book several years ago, watched it made into a series (which I really enjoyed), read the follow-up books, and this year saw Armistead Maupin speak in Austin, Texas on his speaking tour.The characters are warm, funny, real (and unreal, in the best sense) and genuinely fun to &quot;be around&quot;. I was immediately reminded of the cast of the Mary Tyler Moore Show, with a squeaky-clean transplant coming into a new city, a new apartment, and making new friends. No, the characters are NOT interchangable, although in many ways, Mary Ann is much like Mary Richards, and Mona reminds me a lot of Rhoda, with her ascerbic humor, and even her weird relationship with her parent.But, as I said, this is not simply a re-hash of a popular 70s sitcom. In so many ways, it is a fun way to crawl into the skins of people in the San Francisco 70's-- a time and place completely unknown to me. And doesn't a good book transport you to another time and/or place? It demonstrates the attitudes of a completely different era--pre-AIDS and the somewhat amazing idea that there are (gasp) gay people who are actually happy and well-adjusted with straight friends and &quot;family&quot;.I echo what another reviewer said: be careful when you pick this book up at bedtime. &quot;One more chapter&quot; turns into ten more.For the last three books, I bought the &quot;omnibus&quot; edition &quot;Back to Barbary Lane&quot; which was, frankly, what I should have done for the FIRST three. It's more economical, and I prefer to carry around one hardback than 3 paperbacks.Buy this book. Or better yet, buy the &quot;omnibus&quot; edition. Oh, hell, buy BOTH omnibus editions....you'll read 'em all anyway!"},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"When you're sitting in a gloomy room in England with the sun having vanished months ago, there is nothing like re-reading the brilliant Armistead Maupin's 'Tales of the City' books. If you are new to these, they tell you all about the bohemian existence of some colourful and wonderful characters in historic San Francisco. The stories are wonderful and the books flow well into each other so that reading five in a row is actually quite easy and very rewarding. One of my favourite series I think."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"It was 1982 when I first read this book. Then, this book had been out of print and I'd picked it up in a used bookstore. What a great time I had reading this book!Mary Ann Singleton is the modern day Alice who happens to go through the modern day looking glass: San Francisco circa 1976.I often thought of this series of books as having been written similar to the manner in which Dickens wrote his books: there are not any characters introduced to the reader who do not serve some purpose in driving the plot or story. This is a tight little book. Originally written as a daily feature in the San Fran Chronicle, the \\"chapters\\" were compiled into a single novel for later publication. Maupin has said that even readers helped him turn the plots into specific directions.I love the characters in this book and its sequels. Maupin writes just enough that the reader can jump into the story using their own imagination.This is not a gay novel as I've heard it called. True there are gay characters. However, to be honest the true lead character has to be Mary Ann, who is completely straight and leads us or introduces us to many interesting and wonderful characters.This is a great quick read! Even if you're not a big \\"reader\\", this book will be a great \\"on the john\\" book, because the chapters are short and sweet (but I think your legs will go to sleep, because you won't want to put it down)."},{"Title":"Tales of the City","review":"A classic. Why should you read it? Because Armistad Maupin actually loves his gay characters; they aren't ashamed of their sexuality, nor do they apologize for it. He has a light and breezy style, with a lot of dialog. You could easily read this on a long, rainy afternoon. Published well over 20 years ago, I'm sure most gays will still see those all to familiar scenes (the bar posing, sex, drugs, that little silver dish with multicolored soap balls over the toilet...) that proves the old adage, the more things change, the more they stay the same."},{"Title":"The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary","review":"Here's your copy, pilgrim, of the book that lists the players and all of the stuff of researchers of the \\"League of their own\\" and a great reference book for any library, public or private.

Several other SABR members have it, as well and I haven't heard a single bad word yet. Well done!Mark BraunOld Timers' Baseball Association of Chicago"},{"Title":"Destinations Past: Traveling Through History","review":"Professor Lukacs might best be called a historic conservative rather than an ideological one. This collection of essays and articles reflects the mindset of a gentleman who wishes to conserve what is best from history. He has a few novel theories. Nationalism, not ideologies like Nazism, Communism and Fascism, has been the root cause for most of this century's struggles. One can disagree with Prof. Lukacs but one must respect his view. He hints in some fifteen year old essays that Europe would de-Americanize; as the age of the Euro nears, Prof. Lukacs was prescient. His theory on mountains and romanticism is fascinating. Before the English initiated Romanticism in the early 1800s, mountains were considered horrible. Today, Prof. Lukacs says we love mountains and their beauty; we are all romantics now. My favorite vignette was Prof. Lukacs's touring of Hitler's birthplace of Braunau on the 100th anniversary of Hitler's birth. The good professor made a side-trip from Braunau to a small Austrian village where a heroic peasant by the name, I believe, of Jagrstatter stood up to the Nazis and refused to be drafted. He was guillotined in 1943. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms","review":"The reason this book is good is because it will help you actually learn how to do organic chemistry instead of just memorizing reactions and their mechanisms. This book answers &quot;WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN?&quot;. A very important book for the graduate student in organic chemistry."},{"Title":"The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms","review":"Organic chemistry is rapidly-expanding field. New reactions pop out every day in research. How do you manage to secure the skills in writing and understanding these organic mechanisms? Many students try very heard to memorize reaction patterns yet unfortunately not able to master the concepts in mechanisms.This book is meant to fill this gap. It introduces to ligoic behind the organic reaction mechanisms. By looking at nucleophilic or electrophilic species, kinetic suggestions, lone pairs, possible synthons and leaving groups, disconnection approach, students are exposed in a wide-range of reactions. The goal of the book is to enable students to write correct and logical mechanisms for reactions that are not seen before.This book should accompany any undergraduate organic text and/or serves alone as a text for advanced course. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms","review":"Every organic-chemistry graduate student will want this book when studying for cumes (cumulative exams). It doesn't seem appropriate as a textbook, but provides a wealth of information to help students develop their mechanistic problem-solving skills. As a professor at a research university, I have recommended it to all the members of my group."},{"Title":"The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms","review":"This book was extremely helpful in studying for my PhD qualifier. I would suggest it to any first year (or later) grad student. One warning, though: this book has NO references!! I hope you never want to do any of these reactions in the lab... The lack of refs is the only thing keeping it to four stars instead of five."},{"Title":"The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms","review":"I came to graduate school highly focused on analytical and physical chemistry (I had been an analytical chemist in industry). My background in organic was fair at best. I was taught by Dr. Grossman from this book. While it took a good bit of work, I got a B in his class. Moreover, I continued to refer to his book long after the course was over. It helped me pass my final cumulative exam, and I still refer to it. I found it helpful in a organometallic course (in which, incidentally, I got an A, thanks in no small part to Dr. Grossman's book.)"},{"Title":"The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms","review":"I bought this book to practice mechanisms because I'll be taking a physical organic class in the spring that uses them heavily. I used this book instead of sitting in on a sophomore organic class, because by job as a TA conflicted.Anyway, this book is extraordinary. Dr. Grossman has taught me so many things about how to write a correct mechanism and how to recognize a bad mechanism when I see one. The book is written in a very clear and friendly manner and it's really quite hard to put down when you start reading it.The book also has practice problems and the book's website has the answers, giving even more incentive to practice mechanisms."},{"Title":"The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms","review":"I am a first year graduate student at UCDavis currently enrolled in the Ph.D program in theoretical organic chemistry.I had always felt comfortable with reaction mechanisms in my undergraduate coursework, however upon entry into the graduate program at UCDavis, I felt immediately over my head! I felt light years behind my expected level of mastery, and in searching for help to stay afloat, this book was recommended to me by my research director.I found it to be exceedingly helpful, as it starts at the very basics and works it's way to the extremely complicated by focusing on rational behind organic mechanisms rather than on simply memorizing trends.With great examples, and tons of practice problems (with the solutions available online for free!) Dr. Grossman's writing is lucid and clear, while not waisting time on filler material, this relatively short book (by text standards!) provides a very clear and very in depth analysis of the various mechanism types as well as commonly seen organic activity.With the help of this well organized and clear book, I was able to overcome my feelings of being behind the curve and came to a very noticeable improvement on my ability to solve complex mechanisms from current publications that I had little to no experience with. After finishing this book I am confident in my abilities to elucidate reasonable mechanisms for chemistry's most complicated (current and past) reactions. This has culminated not only in an A in my class, but has given me an invaluable reference for my research.Also available is an interactive version of the practice problems with step by step hints and feedback, available through Dr. Grossman's site for a small fee.Dr. Grossman has been personally very helpful with any and all concerns regarding the online content as well as the text it's self.If you are a student of organic chemistry of any level, I would highly recommend this book, not only to graduate students, but to any undergraduates taking organic chemistry at any level, from first semester to last.I can honestly say I have looked at many such books regarding organic mechanisms, and this is by far the best written, the clearest, and the most helpful in it's approach, structure, and it's focus on practice.I can't sing this books praises enough! I have recommended it to many of my students and colleges and everyone of them has come back a believer!Buy this book now! It's worth at least three times as much as the cost, and you won't be disappointed!I only wish all chemistry books were like this one!"},{"Title":"The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms","review":"This book is not the first of its kind. Audrey Miller wrote the first one-&quot;Writing Reaction Mechanisms in Organic Chemistry&quot;. Miller used a renovating approch to treat organic reaction mechanisms. Mechanisms are not a bunch of random knowledges to be memorized any more. They can be analyzed and mastered.However Grossman did a terrific job writing this book. It covers more material than Miller's. Both books are easy to read. Keys to answers of this book can be downloaded from internet(over 200 pages).This book is great for graduate student who's struggling on his/her cumes, for industrial organic chemist who wants to have a thorough review of organic mechanism. Great value for the money."},{"Title":"The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms","review":"This is a great intro book. The reaction mechanisms are explained. Easy to understand"},{"Title":"The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms","review":"I bought the cheapest possible copy of this book from Amazon. When I got it, it didn't quite look right. I own the first edition of the book, which I must say is outstanding in every way. What I received was not printed on the high quality paper that the first book was printed on. The lines in the drawings were not sharp. The printing was not high quality. Elsevier is a top notch publisher and I cannot believe that they would make a book that looks like what I got, even though it is a reasonably good copy. I strongly suspect that someone out there is making knock off copies of Elsevier's scientific publications and then offering them \\"new\\" at a sharp discount on Amazon. Buyer beware! If you buy the really cheap version, you may not be getting the real thing.So how do I rate this book? Well, Grossman's writing is outstanding. This is a great organic chemistry book filled with extremely useful information. Just be careful to buy the real thing. And if you get something that looks phony, compare it to one of Elsevier's real books you might find in a good university library. And if it doesn't look right return it to put pressure on anyone who might be selling illegal copies of it."},{"Title":"The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms","review":"Amazon.com is great because everytime I order anything from them directly, it comes on time and in very good shape."},{"Title":"The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms","review":"Being a PhD student in organic chemistry, I have read a lot of chemistry books in my days, and never have I come across a book that's understandable without a teacher's explanation.

It has already helped me out a great deal and I'm barely half way through!"},{"Title":"The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms","review":"Mechanism is the heart of chemical transformation, and this book is one of the best compilations of the \\"rules\\" of electron flow in organic reactions. Grossman does an excellent job of distinguishing different types of mechanisms and the different conditions under which they occur. He has a chapter for each of the major classes of transformations: polar basic, polar acidic, pericyclic, free radical and reactions in the presence of transition metals. The scope of this short book is impressive, and equally - if not more - impressive is the scope of the in-chapter and end-of-chapter exercises. The extensive online keys are like a getting a whole second book for free, considering that most modern texts charge for a solutions manual. The problems are challenging, but you'll find yourself working most of them with relative ease after a careful read through, which is very satisfying. It also feels great to come across new reactions in the chemical literature and suddenly realize how the transformations occur without ever having seen the reaction before. Grossman delivers on his promise of unveiling the art of writing mechanisms. For the price, this hardcover book is a steal and every organic graduate student should own a copy."},{"Title":"The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms","review":"This book is excellent for reaction mechanism. This book is helpful for the undergraduate's organic chem 2 and the grad school's reaction mechanism class. I learned how to move the electron in reasonable way. So in one word, this book is awesome book that I ever read for practicing reaction mechanism."},{"Title":"The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms","review":"When I took organic class at graduate level, I was really bombed by the reactions. It seems the teacher is only keep on throwing us the reactions until we are dead or surrendered(dropped).After one year frustrated struggling, I found this book and knew there is another way to approach the organic chemistry -- systematic approach. With this book, you can build up your own fundamental organic knowledge; you can really understand reactions not just memorize them for the sake of tests; you can efficiently learn something instead of forgetting them all after the tests.In my view, this book is by far the best organic book for the first year graduate student. It's a ladder between the undergraduate and graduate. It really gives broad and clear idea of what organic chemistry is going on and provides solid foundation for further studies."},{"Title":"The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms","review":"This is a very well written book - I mean one that you can read like a novel. In that respect it is probably the best (if not the only) book on the market. I enjoyed reading a lot, although I have learnt about all of the mechanisms way before from the March and other books. _The March_ is superior if you want to look at particular reactions, or have a more detailed view. Unfortunately it is a tough job to get through all 3000 pages (almost). March unlike Grossman avoids simplifications, but the latter gives you some (false perhaps?) feeling of certainty what is happening with the molecules.I would recommend this book for learning the basics of mechanisms in organic chemistry."},{"Title":"The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms","review":"I was a student of Dr. Grossman. He used this book as our textbook. It does a great job of breaking down sections like acidic, basic, etc. There are good problems at the end of each chapter to help reinforce what you have read. He uses words that are easy to understand, which makes the reading of the book more enjoyable. Overall, this is one the best organic mechanisms textbooks that I have read."},{"Title":"The Art of Writing Reasonable Organic Reaction Mechanisms","review":"Wow. I have been searching for a book like this since my undergrad days at the University of Pittsburgh. Not much more to say about this book than has already been said. I will however say that this is the most concise book that I have ever found on the theory of mechanisms. It is decievingly short, for it encompases all the major topics you will find in your 1200 page O-chem text, and dare I say, may be just as, if not more usefull.In organic chemistry it is not important to memorize a vast amount of material as, incorrectly, most neophyte students believe. The science really is an art with a few major rules that outline the whole of the science.

Qualifying/cumulative exams often make the graduate experience that much harder, and I've found that students often have a difficult time getting the practical knowledge required to pass these assessments. Fortunately, Grossman's textbook is an excellent guide for navigating through the first two years of electron pushing. The book is filled with many modern organic concepts (chelation control aldol reactions, selenium chemistry, rhenium-catalyzed annulations) and reinforced with plenty of problem sets. It seems that many professors include questions on their cumes that are heavily-covered concepts in this book. The one down side of Grossman's text is the lack of references/answer keys for the problem sets (but that's what post docs and research advisors are for).A word of warning: don't buy the book and expect to pass your exams without working.

It was worth the search.I'm pleased to see that it's available at amazon.com. Had the internet been around then, I would have saved weeks, phoning, and searching through shelves in second-hand book stores."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"Gripping. That is one word that comes to mind about this novel, this book, this story. Robert Fish is genius at what he does. What is it he does? He weaves a story about self loathe, self doubt, sefl triumph, in a psychological web of deceit, and takes the story and it's readers on a roller coaster ride of a devlish story of a Nazi War Camp General, who in order to escape the pending death of the russians at the end of WW II, undergoes a plastic surgery to become a jew-but he hasn't got there yet, as his 'plans' are muddled and his 'future' becomes something of a sporadic chance, something that affects him for the rest of his life, until he decides to do something about it. This character, a truly evil man, whom funny as it may seem, you come to empathize with if not just a bit, goes to hell and back again-over and over!Paced in three sections, Book I, Book II, and Book III, \\"Pursuit\\" is more so a story about survival and the need for self peace. It is a touchy subject that everyone can relate to, as our main character endures elements of life that test his luck, his emotions, and his ability to maintain his sanity and survival instinct. There is really not much more I can say, without giving away too much. the story gets a bit slow for about forty to fifty pages of the whole three Hundred and seventy eight, but they by no means stick out like a sore thumb. The best section of the book is that last one, which will have you in utter shock at what is not only going on between the main character, but also in the lives of the other characters around him.Again, all I can think is gripping, just gripping. And quite close to home too."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"I loved this book. It's a pity it's not in print anymore.

Algorithms that are extendible and accurate exist to perform basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. If you can perform the addition of two numbers zero through nine, then the addition of any two numbers can be performed by executing the following simple algorithm:1) Start at the rightmost column.2) Repeat steps 4 and 4 until done3) Add the numbers in the column, keep the ones digit in that column and carry the tens digit into the next column to the left.4) Move to the next column to the left and got to step 3.This algorithm will always work, no matter how many columns there are in the two numbers. However, some of the techniques demonstrated in this book are specific to numbers of certain types, which keeps them from being easily extensible.I have no objection when students that already understand the basic algorithms of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are shown special case algorithms, knowing such tactics reinforces their understanding. However, trying to teach arithmetic by using special case algorithms leads to a fragmented and limited understanding and is to be avoided."},{"Title":"Daphne's: Modern Italian Food","review":"A beautiful and elegant cookbook with simple recipes that produce restaurant style food.

They step on your feet, they buck you off, they spook at the littlest things, and you do so much work every day but you wouldnt trade the it for the world.

The cartoons are so truthful and the text so witty (like the description of feeling like you are naked in front of everybody when you are trying a new horse for the first time) that you will not be disappointed.

Of the magazines and books scattered by the bed, one has the title, &#34;Night Horses and Wet Dreams.&#34; I'm no prude, but I really don't understand the point of having this page and this illustration in a book that is otherwise perfect for 2 - 4th grade &#34;horse crazy&#34; girls.

These men suffered and persevered through hunger, thirst, fatigue, weather, geographical disorientations and Indian intimidations with the final result of course, being the eventual discovery of the Oregon Trail.An absorbing read and extremely well done."},{"Title":"Across the Great Divide : Robert Stuart and the Discovery of the Oregon Trail","review":"\\"Across The Great Divide...\\" is a fascinating story of adventure and travel, but is not so much specifically about the Oregon Trail as it is about the journey of a lifetime until the end of the book.Beginning with the proposals for a \\"far-flung trading venture beyond the Mississippi\\", made by New York merchant and future millionaire John (actually, Johann) Jacob Astor, Laton McCartney takes us from the east coast to the mouth of the Columbia River, on the border of modern Washington and Oregon states, and then back and forth around and across mountain ranges and other natural barriers and obstacles, not in search of the trail itself, but in search of financial gain through the early American fur trade. At times I found myself a bit confused about exactly what part of the country they were in. However, the occasional confusion did not really detract from the interest of the story. After a while, I found myself surrendering my \\"locator compass\\" and just going along for the ride. That ride included personality conflicts and human intrigue that seemed more interesting than anything one's imagination could create. Sometimes fact is, indeed, stranger than fiction, including setting on the sidelines watching an irritable and quarrelsome naval officer and sea captain, Jonathan Thorn, take his ship, the Tonquin, and crew to their destiny.In the process of what eventually does become the great discovery, McCartney dishes out lots of interesting and seldom seen bits of information, such as tidbits about different Indian tribes, how they relate to each other, how they developed their social interactions, and how they related to white men at that point in American development, and the importance of the horse in Indian history. He includes interesting snapshots of the challenges of survival in cold, mountainous weather, with little food and few supplies, with even a foreshadow of the infamous 1846-47 Donner expedition when one starving man briefly suggests they kill and eat one of their own party. And, he tells about the things some men will do to gain fame and/or riches; and, he includes for good measure, political and social intrigue.Perhaps I got so caught up in the fascination of the trip that I missed it, but the title character, Robert Stuart, got a little lost in the story. He was there, to be sure, and had a large part in the leadership of the adventure, but for me, the strength of the story had little to do with who he was and what he did.In all, I found \\"Across The Great Divide...\\" to be a very enjoyable and entertaining read. As for information about the Oregon Trail, I found myself having to consult the internet, because, somehow, the book's treatment subject that drew me to the book originally, the Oregon Trail, just left me unsatisfied. On the other hand, I had a great time with Mr. McCartney.Four stars"},{"Title":"Across the Great Divide : Robert Stuart and the Discovery of the Oregon Trail","review":"An interesting story of Robert Stuart, the white explorer who learned from natives the existence of the South Pass through the Rocky Mountains and used the Pass in 1812 on a West-to-East trip. (South Pass is the only wagon-friendly route through the Rockies.) The purpose of Stuart's trip was basically a management report on a private company's progress. The trip was through largely uncharted territory, and dangers were encountered, but this is not a compelling read. Here's the most frustrating part: John Jacob Astor, Stuart's boss, elected to keep secret the existence of South Pass. So this critical piece of geographical info was not used until the Pass was re-discovered in 1823 by William Ashley, who publicized it, leading eventually to the Oregon Trail. Astor never used his \\"trade secret.\\" That makes Stuart's trip an interesting historical footnote, not the landmark discovery it could have been if Stuart and Astor had publicized the existence of South Pass."},{"Title":"Across the Great Divide : Robert Stuart and the Discovery of the Oregon Trail","review":"\\"There's a race of men that don't fit in,A race that can't stay still;So they break the hearts of kith and kin,And they roam the world at will....\\"~Robert Service~Beautiful words paying tribute to the intrepid souls of the adventurers; the individuals among us who found it impossible to live entirely within the confines of civilization. Some had the means to travel, some traveled without means, but both kinds richly deserve the words written for them; about them - no matter how harsh the reality of their story; for theirs is of achievement extraordinaire.This is a book like that. I found it interesting, obviously well-researched and containing much information I didn't know about the early explorers of my own state of residence. Mr. McCartney did an important work in presenting history and in paying tribute to his gutsy ancestor within the same accounting.This expedition followed the Lewis and Clark Corp. of Discovery by only a few years, long before Fremont made his journey into Wyoming. They were conducting the exploring of passageways for trade of all kinds, but for the moment, the fur trade - for John Jacob Astor, one of the most astute businessmen of that century. While Lewis and Clark made mighty discoveries, but didn't hit the jackpot with the intended waterways due to the imposing mountains, it was Stuart who discovered an equally important \\"northwest passage\\" in the South Pass route, far to the south which is really where the mountains meet the plains - the gentle ending of the Wind River mountain range - allowing the vast traffic West to begin to pass through. And pass they did, the natives watching astounded as they were pushed aside in the tidal waves of emigrants that followed. I couldn't help it - the naughty thought occurred to me that Fremont, while indeed serving his country in his travels, was primarily the son-in-law of a politician wishing to make a name for himself after the real work was done.It does have controversy, of course - any great discovery is subject to it in the course of hashing out history. John Colter may have crossed it after he split from the L&C; expedition - it has been suggested - I'm not enough of a scholar to question some of it but for certain, this man was of the first white men to see it, and documented his journey.The list of names, rivers and landmarks bring it vividly to life for me, as they are dear, familiar places that I visit on a regular basis, thinking all the while of these men who came before. The Platte, Bessemer Bend, Independence Rock, the Snake river, Henry's Fork of the Snake, Fort Hall; the people of Stuart, Hoback, McClellan, Hunt, all of these people live on vibrantly in our country here - with the landmarks memorializing them. For them, life was to be lived - or lost - in the trying. I doubt that many of them aspired to the greatness they achieved - it was simply answering the call of the wild and unknown, reminding me of yet another free spirit - Robert Service - who said it all in his poem \\"The Men Who Don't Fit In.\\"One scenario I found difficult to believe was the part where the explorers were close to death from starvation. Men with firearms, ammunition, should have had no trouble feeding themselves. The country abounds with game even to this day, and it was abundance of twenty fold then. Even if the big game had become scarce in certain areas due to migrations, there were certainly rabbits, even in the winter. It made mention that they \\"were reluctant to fire their weapons\\" for fear of attracting the hostile Crow back to their whereabouts, which had to be the most of it, even though it didn't actually come out with the reason. Our Native people are, at long last, taking their rightful place in history too - this book demonstrates it too - for it was their homes that were being invaded and one can scarcely blame them for being insulted.A mass paperback tale it is not. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, found it scholarly enough without being dry, well-conceived, well-written, and am glad I found it. I'm also thankful for the reviews given it, which helped me decide to read it. It has a well-deserved place in my personal library."},{"Title":"Across the Great Divide : Robert Stuart and the Discovery of the Oregon Trail","review":"John Jacob Astor led the life most people do not even dare to dream about. He was a serial entrepreneur at a time when most of the world was composed of farmers. He was so successful at his businesses that when he died he controlled one-fifteenth of all personal wealth in the United States!Across the Great Divide is a remarkably detailed account of one of his (failed) investments. Directly competing with the Hudson Bay Company for control of the North American fur trade, he is so successful that he is able to finance the establishment of the first American fort in Oregon and supports this effort with his own ships and men via Cape Horn. Returning east overland, one of his employees, Robert Stuart, discovers South Pass, the route that subsequently becomes the gateway to the Far West and the Oregon Trail!This is a most singular accomplishment. In February 1808 Thomas Jefferson, sixty-five years old and in the waning months of his second term as President, is approached by Astor seeking Jefferson's support for a far flung trading venture beyond the Mississippi River. The proposal captured Jefferson's attention. After embarking from New York City and rounding Cape Horn, Stuart arrives in Oregon in 1810, only 5 years after the Lewis and Clark expedition! It is stunning to realize that Fort Astoria's erection and provisioning, completed after a long, arduous sea voyage that included stops at the Falkland Islands and Hawaii, and which cemented America's claim to the Pacific Northwest, is finished just a few weeks before the arrival of Astor's primary competition, the Hudson Bay Company, could lay further claim to Oregon for Britain.In June 1812 Stuart, a junior partner in this venture, is chosen to lead an overland expedition back to St. Louis and New York to report to Astor. Only two American led expeditions had crossed the continent before him, Lewis and Clark's and Wilson Price Hunt's which was part of this Astor venture. However, instead of following the northern route of his predecessors, Stuart heads south along the Rockies and strikes South Pass, the only pass in the 3,000 mile Rocky Mountains passable by wagons. Stuart follows the Sweetwater and Platte Rivers across present day Wyoming and Nebraska. In the process, this obscure messenger-explorer discovers the trail that would become the central route of America's expansion, the emigrant road that opened up the Far West to settlement. Astor's Fort Astoria is captured by the British during the War of 1812 and Stuart never again sees Oregon. Subsequently, he becomes one of Astor's primary field agents, working out of Mackinaw Island in Michigan.Laton McCartney's Robert Stuart is a most stalwart individual. When we stop to think that he was an entrepreneur, not an explorer, his accomplishment becomes all that much more impressive. He blithely embarks from New York on a three year endeavor that circumnavigates the known extent of the Western Hemisphere. His 10 month overland journey is so successful that all 7 people who start from Oregon reach civilization alive. This is a remarkably good book about American exploration and risk taking in an age and in a business when failure meant death. Well written and concise, it is the story of a long neglected explorer who discovered the Oregon Trail that 300,000 emigrants would cross on their way to the Pacific Coast."},{"Title":"Across the Great Divide : Robert Stuart and the Discovery of the Oregon Trail","review":"I thought this book was excellent. I thought it was very similar to undaunted courage, but I felt it moved a bit faster, and spent less time on all the minute details of the Astorians' adventure.

He essentially focuses on two themes: ethnicity, ethnic identity and the persistence and predominance of ethnic loyalties (as opposed to class loyalties); and national self-determination, particularly how to define this term and the international legal conundrums this concept has caused since it first became a part of mainstream political parlance about a century ago. In its initial sections, the book does succeed in shedding some light on the role of ethnicity and self-determination in the political history of the last hundred or so years, and how essential they have been to international relations, even if often ingored by mainstream scholarship-especially during the cold war-which tended to focus almost exclusively on ideology and political &quot;realism&quot; a la Henry Kissenger (which, as Moynihan points out, was far from realistic). Perhaps the best thing about this book is that is offers a good introduction to the problems of ethnicity in international politics, and provides an excellent reference list of sources for further reading on the subject. As an introduction, however, it suffers from being superficial at times. At times it seems as though Moynihan implicitly accepts the &quot;primordial&quot; thesis on ethnicity and nationalism, for he cites without critical commentary the all-too-common lament of many journalists and other armchair experts who bewail the &quot;ancient ethnic hatreds&quot; burning in some remote corners of the world. He doesn't really look into the fact that ethnicity politics and the ensuing nationalism tend to be the product of contemporary political agitation which often have little to do with historical fact. Although he mentions the general multiethnic harmony of certain pre-nationalist communities, e.g. in Central Europe, he doesn't really go anywhere with this. This the general fault of this book: its disjointed approach. At times Moynihan goes into excessive detail on certain examples while skimming over other cases. In addition, the text is riddled with extensive quotations (some as long as two to three pages) of other works or his own previous works on this subject. Since the book was based on a lecture delivered at Oxford in 1991, I can only assume that he rather hurriedly adapted the text for publication. This is unfortunate, for this could have been a really top-notch work on a very important subject."},{"Title":"Pandaemonium: Ethnicity in International Politics","review":"For me, a trained American political scientist, this book is a work of genius by one of our nation's foremost geniuses of the art of the political and sociological sciences. Daniel Patrick Moynihan is a renaissance man of sorts: His resume is long, varied, cross-disciplinary and distinguished. We have heard his voice ripple across the political and sociological landscape on more than just a few occasions: Always warning against taking the easy quick-fix route to social problem-solving, always warning against making the facile interpretations to domestic and international policy.More often than not, it has been his lone voice that has left a ringing echo in the wilderness. And just as was the case when Richard Clark sounded the alarm on terrorism, many of us in the State Department heard him but we just were not tuned into the same frequency: terrorism just seemed so far-fetched that we thought the guy was some kind of kook. The same is true with Pat Moynihan: We have all heard his spiel but just were not always tuned into the same frequency.Recall that it was his analysis that backed up the famous (or infamous depending on ones position on the issue) Coleman Study that set U.S. Education policy for a generation. It was his prediction too that suggested that there would be a social meltdown in the black family and he gave all the reasons why. It happened exactly as he predicted, and black leaders are still chasing their tails and firing at each other in a circular firing squad, in perpetual denial about the things Moynihan had made crystal clear in this respect a decade before the meltdown occurred. Then, he opposed the Reagan \\"Communist scare\\" because of the Cuban and Soviet follies into Angola: To Moynihan this excursion was a joke that would simply hasten the fall of the USSR, which is exactly what it did. His advice to the US government: to ignore it, actually got him \\"eased-out\\" from his post as Ambassador to the UN. And finally he was one of only a handful of experts that predicted the fall of the Soviet Union at least a decade before it actually happened: Making clear that it would be due to ethnic fragmentation as much as to anything else.Never did he \\"read the tea leaves\\" more accurately, nor have his predictions about the role and importance of ethnicity been more prescient than in the claims set forth in this book. He has localized the source of the disturbance as being the preoccupation with the internationally voguish term \\"self-determination of independent people.\\" Yet, when the term \\"people\\" are examined closely (or even the terms nation and state for that matter), he finds the same thing that Vlamik Volkan found: that people are bound together as much by their vulnerabilities and \\"chosen fears and insecurities\\" as they are by language, race, customs and a shared history. (Patrick Geary also found the same in this book Myth of Nations.) And chosen fears, grievances, and animosities have a very, very long half-life: They seem never to die. These aspects - international ethnic fears and grievances - seem to be a part of international relations that lies below the radar, too close to the ground to sweep up into the net of current techniques.Yet, it is the same phenomenon that Amy Chua (with only a slight but important twist) has dealt with in her excellent book \\"A World on Fire.\\" Chua shares Moynihan's concern about the volatility of ethnicity, but adds that when social stratification and a class hierarchy are imposed on top of it (which is most of the times) it becomes down right explosive.So in this book, we were not just warned again, but given a new vocabulary to consider in our search and research of ways to deal with this recurring Kryptonite. A phenomenon that is repeatedly being resurrected with great pain and angst in the post-modern era.Five stars"},{"Title":"With strings attached, reminiscences and reflections","review":"Charmingly written.

As a result, there is a lot of repetition, but that and the typos here and there and the mislabeled illustrations are a minor issue. The importance of this book is its validation of what Native America has said all along...the &quot;pipe&quot; has been with us for a long while, and it is almost as universal in Native North America as is the ceremonial/spiritual use of tobacco. The author says he hopes his research on the pipe will make &quot;leaders&quot; in the U.S. and Canada reconsider their positions on the use of the pipe in Native American spirituality, as those positions relate to its use (or repression of its use) in various contexts. As a reader, and pipe carrier, I too hope that it has the effect of allowing the use of the pipe in prisons, schools, etc. to increase. Recently I read that Canada is allowing Native citizens to take an oath in the court room using the pipe. Maybe this book has in some way, had an influence on this change for the better.The author primarily focuses on pipes with detachable stems, that are/have been used in ceremonial contexts. He suggests that archaeological evidence indicates that the use of the pipe may be older than the institutional religion that by and large tried to stamp out its use. His discussion of Native cosmology was also of interest."},{"Title":"Offering Smoke: The Sacred Pipe and Native American Religion","review":"This book offers an excellent compendium of information about the &quot;calumet&quot;, sacred pipe, or &quot;peace pipe&quot;, however you call it.

It will satisfy the needs of all, from the casual reader to the serious scholar. The only topic not covered is the techniques of making a pipe from the Catlinite or other pipestone.It has an extensive bibliography for further research and a very inclusive index.For what it's worth, I find this book an excellent purchase and it will remain on my reference shelf for some time to come."},{"Title":"Keepers of the Fire: Journey to the Tree of Life Based on Black Elk's Vision","review":"This book was given to a friend of mine as a gift.

I laughed out loud in public as I was reading it. The antics of the puny people as they deal with rats, the cheese famine and flatulence are quite entertaining.Who Cut the Cheese provides a cynical comment on the modern workplace, especially on managers who compensate for their incompetence by being cruel and manipulative. Sometimes the book hits a bit close to home. The advice it gives is accurate and very applicable in today's corporate world, and if you have no scruples, you could go far by applying it.

It's also what I would expect from the managing editor of National Lampoon.

Rather, the whole point of Brown's writing is to expose how extended and simple-minded allegories are used to smuggle into a conversation indefensible premises. Flatulence is only one of many unpleasant implications of the WHO STOLE MY CHEESE? allegory. Brown shows what would happen if people in real life fully accepted the premises of American corporate culture: cutthroat competition, the acceptance of any \\"change\\" authority hands out, and the cult of the CEO. The painful passages are not about gassy diets but at the end where the references to HEART OF DARKNESS as middle management jerks cut each other down and tear down civilization.In addition to \\"vulgarity\\" and sophistication, there are nice subtle touches, such as sly references to real life corporate disasters like Long Term Capital and Swedish Match Company. Brown is listed as the author of fictional books teaching the same quick fix cutthroat lessons of corporate business for other parts of life; my favorite is: CRY WOLF AND WIN! HOW TO FALSELY ACCUSE RELATIVES OF MOLESTATION AND GAIN ATTENTION AND SYMPATHY. Brown shows us that such immoral tactics are the ultimate meaning of the Jack Welch Way.WHO CUT THE CHEESE? is, in short, a brilliant morality tale for our times.By the way, someone should tell Amazon that the Forward's author, Krubenaker, is not a real person."},{"Title":"Who Cut the Cheese? : A Cutting Edge Way of Surviving Change by Shifting the Blame","review":"Any book as bad as Who Moved My Cheese? deserves to have not just one, but two parodies written about it, and probably to have both of those parodies read.

I read it about 1979/80 and for some reason quite a few details stick in my mind, so with that in mind I'll review it as best I can.Becker joined the artillery branch of the German army, primarily because it had the best uniform and he thought it would help him impress girls. With this training behind him he was assigned to the 13th Panzer Division as a tank gunner. He writes of his tank crew and several of the actions they fought in. I remember very clearly that prior to their final battle, their own tank was unavailable but they begged to take out a replacement one. They did not have time though to paint their \`score' on the gun barrel and they thought this might be unlucky. So it proved and they are hit. I can't recall precisely whether this is where Becker is captured but at one point his earlier good-will to a Russian soldier is repaid. In any case the second and larger part of the book covers Becker's time as a POW.I can't recall the treatment he encountered while the war still continued but Becker ends up spending quite a few years in a Soviet mine. He seemed to be treated reasonably decently and there always seemed to be many more Russian prisoners than German. A quota system operated where-by each inmate was to mine a particular amount of ore. To give himself something to do, Becker perversely often mined more, one time managing to produce four times his quota. The Russians thought him mad but it was a way to keep himself sane. It was interesting reading of the various ways that the Germans (and others) filled in time. In the end he is freed, I think during the major 1950 release.Given I can remember these things from 30 years ago, I'm inclined to think it was a well written and interesting book. I hope the elements that I've outlined might be useful to future readers."},{"Title":"Devil on my shoulder","review":"Accidentally I bumped on to the Russian edition of this book which had taken me completely (\\"Na voine I v plenu\\", Moscow 2012).Lively written but not about the war, rather of author\`s experience in captivity.Interesting testimony of the German soldier in Soviet land, which he failed to invade."},{"Title":"White Grass Cafe: Cross-Country Cooking","review":"Never used a cookbook so much.

Waddell's treatment of their tragic lives is nearly as timeless as they are. I like the fact that Waddell knows what she's talking about--her grasp of Abelard's revolutionary theological ideas (especially at the very moving close of the book, when he's working out his theory of atonement) is the furthest thing from superficial. It's precisely because of her scholar's knowledge that she's able to create a richly-woven setting for her two protagonists. This is something I've not found in any other treatment (especially *Stealing Heaven*, which is ghastly). She doesn't attempt to sensationalize the love story, and there's nothing in the way she presents things that's either anachronistic on the one hand or stilted (in that self-conscious, I'm-writing-medieval-dialogue way) on the other.I didn't find her Heloise at all bloodless; in fact, quite the opposite. I was pleased that Waddell lets us see Heloise's brilliant intelligence and intellectual fervor. (Abelard fell in love with her mind as much as anything). It's a shame this book is out of print here in the States. For anyone with an interest in the story of Abelard and Heloise (or even for anyone who simply likes good prose and well-done fictionalized history), this is a book that sould not be missed. It's a lovely, sometimes stunning read."},{"Title":"Peter Abelard: A novel","review":"This book was recommended to me by an utterly fascinating, extremely well read man I met in India. Just the fact that it is his favorite book convinced me to read it. The beauty of the prose is breathtaking, haunting. Even as someone who is decidedly not a Catholic, or even religious (making it an opportunity to learn about medieval Catholicism), I found Abelard's spiritual journey profoundly moving, particularly in the end when his faith is restored. It is one of those books, like most of Nabokov's and many of Turgenev's, that is so beautiful it cannot be absorbed in one reading. A note on the story: as the title implies, this book is first and foremost about Abelard. His famous love affair with Heloise is treated as but one aspect of his remarkable life. Even so, it is well worth it, even for those with little interest in the man himself."},{"Title":"Peter Abelard: A novel","review":"I've always been an admirer of the philosopher Abelard, and like everyone else, I found the story of his love affair with Heloise very touching. So naturally, I jumped at the chance to read a book like this. And I was not disappointed. This book was very well written. Rather than painting Abelard as an egotistical, condescending, self-absorbed brute as some writers have (I'm pointing a finger at the author of &quot;Stealing Heaven&quot;), this book portrays him in a more sympathetic light. In this book, he is more accurately depicted as a deep and insightful man. Helen Waddell builds on what we know about Abelard, rather than making a bunch of wild guesses. Her writing style, too, is vivid and eloquent. &quot;Peter Abelard&quot; is a must for anyone who is into the story of Heloise and Abelard or anyone who likes a good book. I highly recommend it.(But whatever you do, DON'T blow your hard earned money by buying &quot;Stealing Heaven&quot;) :)"},{"Title":"Peter Abelard: A novel","review":"A well-written tale of two historical characters. Lovers of romance fiction and of great fiction in general should not miss reading this book of the tragic and enduring love between abelard and heloise. Sublime."},{"Title":"Peter Abelard: A novel","review":"This brief 1933 novel encapsulating the life of Peter Abelard was hard to read and ultimately unsatisfying. Part of the problem is the author's assumption of a certain level of erudition and familiarity with the classics on the part of her readers, not a given these days. Abelard's fame as a learned rhetorician, teacher and philosopher attracted both great adoration in his time as well as the inevitable jealousy and ill-wishers. However, the lofty rhetorical argumentation on which Abelard's genius and reputation rested is hard to relate to in these modern days as having much importance or relevance to the \\"real\\" world. Discussions of what religious beliefs constituted heresy and elevated disputations on the nature of God and the truths of the Bible, hot button topics at the time, failed to much interest or engage this modern reader. The other center of gravity in the story is the tragic passion between Abelard and Heloise, but the depiction of their love affair likewise seemed remote and failed to elicit much emotional response. The other characters may have been famous clerics and scholars of the time, but they and their opinions are not so readily known today. Overall, I felt the author had \\"talked over my head\\" a good bit, the result of which was my lack of engagement with the novel.

I highly recommend this book !!!"},{"Title":"Digital Image Processing with Application to Digital Cinema","review":"This book provides a very practical up-to-date introduction and explanation of the concepts and state of the art behind the fast changing world of digital image processing, specifically for higher-end applications such as television and digital cinema. The author does a good job of providing easy-to-understand explanations and examples of the basics of this complicated science that allow a non-technical professional to understand the basics of how digital processing is used in video and image applications. But, he also goes further to explain the complicated mathematical principles of various image processing technologies for the benefit of the serious student. The MATLAB examples in the appendix and the suggested \\"for further study\\" exercises help provide tools and direction for readers who want to experiment with the principles in the book. Overall, this book should be very useful to the professional or student trying to understand the current industry thinking regarding digital processing and compression of images for high-end presentation applications like digital cinema at whatever depth of understanding they are needing."},{"Title":"Digital Image Processing with Application to Digital Cinema","review":"This is truly a great book, the math notations are clear and concise. A lot of good reference pointers in the book make it not only a fundamental textbook but also a good research resource. Many sample codes in Matlab are provided. For anyone working on image signal processing, it is a great resource library. The book is equally valuable to professioinals working on this subject and students (senior undergrad or first year graduate students) becoming familiar with the field.There is only one minor limitation on what it covers on the digital video compression section. Some of the newest techniques used by the H.264 and VC1 were not mentioned here -- such as intra frame prediction, deblocking filter, as well as mathematic coding used in the entropy coding. There is a discussion on the adaptive block based DCT, which is very interesting. Although a comparison with the current adaptive variable size tracking block and Hadamard transformation would be valuable as well.This might be a good incentive for Dr. Thyagarajan to write a 2nd edition :). In case he plans to write a new edition, maybe he can elaborate a bit more on the last chapter about what were Qualcomm's practical problems in this project and how they were resolved -- I would imagine he could have enough material to expand the last chapter easily to 40-50 pages from 15 pages.In summary, I like this book a lot, especially the wavelet section. It is one of the best and clearst treatments of the subject I have ever seen.I highly recommend owning this book and reading it seriously!"},{"Title":"Digital Image Processing with Application to Digital Cinema","review":"The book \\"Digital Image Processing with Application to Digital Cinema\\" is an excellent treatment on digital image processing techniques. Mathematical derivations are kept to a minimum so as not to lose sight of the main principles of image processing. Yet the book can easily serve the needs of both professionals and students equally well. The chapter on human visual perception is treated very well giving all details of known visual models, which are used later in the chapter on image compression. Image enhancement is an essential ingredient in all aspects of image processing and the book aptly covers enhancement techniques in detail with numerous examples. Transform techniques in general and wavelet transform in particular are given adequate coverage that most can follow. The chapter on image compression takes up these transforms and explains clearly how to apply them in achieving quality image and video compression. The book ends with a chapter on case studies involving two state-of-the art systems for distribution of movies in digital format. I enjoyed this book very much and I highly recommend it to all professionals, both in universities and industries."},{"Title":"Digital Image Processing with Application to Digital Cinema","review":"The author has provided the digital image and cinema industry with a serious text on image processing. Although the stated focus is digital cinema, this book can be utilized by anyone interested in the algorithms of digital image processing. The book is aimed primarily at professionals who are already involved in the field, but it could also be easily used as a textbook on the subject. Derivations are kept to a minimum and numerous examples in MATLAB are provided to illustrate the various digital processes as well as their effects. There are two chapters in particular that are often omitted in image processing texts. One is the chapter on human visual perception which emphasizes the importance of often mentioned phenemona such as contrast sensitivity as well as less often mentioned non-linear effects and their perception. The other is the chapter on image compression which is extensive and includes spatial, transform, and wavelet domain algorithms in detail. Most interesting is the section devoted to the use of the human vision model in the compression process. Although computer vision itself is largely omitted from the book, the author did include a discussion of basic edge detection methods.Chapter 1 introduces the readers to digital processing techniques in a brief fashion. Chapter 2 is a review of two-dimensional discrete signals and systems. If you are rusty on this subject, you will probably need an outside source to help refresh your memory. Chapter 3 describes human visual perception from a system point of view. Human vision plays a key role in the design of image and video compression and display systems, thus the chapter describes vision models in detail, in particular the model that predicts masking effects in digital imaging. Chapters four through six, though interesting, are pretty standard fare for digital image processing texts.The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is introduced in chapter 7. Without derivations and mathematical proofs, the computation of the DWT using subband coding is described and illustrated with examples. The chapter also explains the connection between wavelets and quadrature mirror filters and shows how to compute a wavelet function from the analysis and synthesis filters with examples. Chapter 8 is devoted to the discussion of image and video compression techniques. This rather extensive chapter describes the basic ideas used in the JPEG2000 and MPEG-2 standards.Through chapter eight, the processes and algorithms described could be useful to anyone in the field of image processing. In chapter nine the author turns to concerns specific to digital cinema. He does this by addressing some issues behind the special requirements of digital cinema when he discusses two approaches to image compression that meet its requirements - QUALCOMM's system and a system based on the JPEG2000 compression standard. These two systems are interesting because the QUALCOMM system uses the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) as the compression vehicle while the latter uses the DWT for compression. The chapter is rounded out with a discussion of some of the characteristics of digital projectors.One particular good characteristic of this book is Appendix D, which contains a variety of suggested MATLAB-based projects on the subject of digital image processing. Even if you already have several good texts on the subject of digital image processing, this one is excellent and has a unique contribution for those interested in applying image processing to the interesting field of digital cinema."},{"Title":"Pete's Dragon (Silhouette Romance, No 854)","review":"THIS IS A KEEPER --- DON'T LOSE IT!

The movie may have won an academy award but the book comes up short. More of a novella, or screenplay than a book. The author could have doubled the text and it may well have been a good book. I appreciate the drama of the two people pulled from separate worlds that are changed dramatically by unfolding events and raise themselves to previously unimagined feats of character and bravery. Still, it was a wasted effort, two little to hang it all on and a pointless ending."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"Forester's novel appears to be a fairly straightforward adventure tale, set in German Central Africa during WWI. Rose is the sister of an English missionary, who dies at the beginning of the novel after the Germans have driven off his &quot;flock.&quot; She is picked up by Allnutt, a Cockney mechanic who works for a Belgian mine, running supplies up the river in the flat-bottomed &quot;African Queen.&quot; He's basically a coward who will follow the path of least resistance, and so allows himself to be browbeat into a harebrained scheme by Rose. She intends to pilot the boat down river, through rapids that are generally agreed-upon to be unnavigable by a boat like the &quot;African Queen,&quot; and onto a lake the Germans dominate thanks to a giant gunboat. There, they will rig some explosives Allnutt has on board and ram the ship, blowing it--and themselves--up, thus striking &quot;a blow for England&quot; and avenging Rose's brother's death. Depending on how you read it, this is either the stuff of great derring-do, or a critique on the futility of heroism in WWI. As an adventure tale, the characters are rather too flat. Allnutt is drawn as too pliable a character, especially for one who has somehow ended up running a boat in the middle of Africa. Rose somehow becomes an expert pilot in a matter of a week, managing to master the nuances of a creaky and unwieldy vessel in extreme poor conditions. Along the way she sheds her proper upbringing and godfearedness with rather unlikely alacrity (unless, that is, Forester was trying to say that such beliefs are rather ephemeral anyway). Their love affair more or less works in the context of the adventure they're on, but it's very hard to imagine it continuing in the outside world. The ending is somewhat more interesting, foreshadowing some of the bleakness of Pierre Boulle's novel Bridge on the River Kwai."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"I was shocked to learn how bad this book really is. The title is so beloved by many as the Bogart/Hepburn classic, and one would expect the book to not only match the Hollywood translation but to dwarf it with typical literary superiority. Not so. The basic plot itself is brilliant enough in its simplicity: two unlikely characters (the archetypical Cockney grease monkey and the chaste maiden) have an adventurous float down an untamed river on a cocked-up mission to sink a German gunship. Ok so far. What Forester does with this promising seed is ridiculous and leaves the reader wondering whether this was all just a vehicle for Forester to deliver a little saucy \\"maiden-missionary-loses-her-virginity\\" stuff mixed in with his clearly evident views that missionaries are idiots. Forester's story is outrageous on all levels. From the timely and chance first meeting between Rose and Allnut, to the mere minutes that it took for Rose to hatch her ignorant plot to sink a German warship, to Allnut's agreement to participate, to the absurd success of the journey, to the ridiculous \\"Cockney ingenuity\\" with which Allnut fashions a propeller out of a coconut or some such stunt, Forester lays a number of eggs. The creme de la creme is Rose's glorious fall from grace. This whole angle of the book borders on soft porn, at least by 1930's standards. Are we to believe that this apparently devout missionary woman has maintained her purity for all these years just to give it all to this unbathed louse? Forester clearly delighted in this stuff: at one point, he actually describes Rose's 'chests' as literally levitating with her newfound vigor and energy - having replaced her former existence of Christian bondage with a new life of unbridled jungle boogie. Come on. Last criticism, with a SPOILER ALERT: the movie's ending is much better than the novel's. Whereas the movie made the boat (the very namesake of the book) into one of the main characters that ultimately sunk the German gunboat, Forester sinks the Afican Queen early and unceremoniously, and then takes the reader through an irrelevant account of Belgian naval manuevers and German military justice. Anyway, I've written enough: stick to the movie."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"I love C.S. Forester's Hornblower series. I didn't realize he had written the book the movie was based on! It was fabulous, and after re-watching the movie, I enjoyed both equally! ( p.s. - the price was great, and shipping with Amazon Prime - 2 days, what's not to love!)"},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"Although personally I do not believe the writers best work (Hornblower is just incredible), it is still a fantastic read. One of the best writers I believe in anything associated with maritime and naval stories.This story has only a few elements to work with but creates a great light read. The story is so good there is no need for any major complex twists, turns or tricks making it very digestible. A welcome read if you have just spent the last few books in heavy intense thrillers or of the like.The writer obviously knew what they were talking about as some of the details are not only incredibly interesting, but also incredible at creating suspense. The details do not bore you at all and treats you like you are intelligent enough to understand what is being said, which is a massive relief from the spoon feeding of other writers.The book is a well written breath of fresh air. Like tea on the porch in the fall. lol."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"Seen the movie, now read the book. This is an adventure tale about Charlie Allnutt and Rose Sayer set in WWI and was written by C.S.Forester in 1935. The book has been over shadowed by the 1951 film which starred Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn. The book stands on its own as a classic and centres on the relationship between the unlikely match of Charlie and Rose with the war as a backdrop. Charlie is a gin loving engineer and Rose is a religious missionary who manages to convince Charlie to take his rickety old boat, The African Queen, down a treacherous river to destroy a German gunboat patrolling the lake at the end of the river. The inter play between the two characters is developed beautifully as they influence each other to form a formidable team. Forester may have meant it to be many things, but to me it is a great love story. Two people who shine in the presence of each other. The novel is relatively short and keeps the suspense and sense of adventure high throughout. The ending of the book turns out to be more realistic and poignant than the film and just by reading it you will appreciate the brilliance of Bogart and Hepburn even more."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"I really loved the movie, but just want to warn you that the last part of the book is wildly different than the movie, and pretty much of a bummer....... Neither of the characters come off as being very likable. I was very disappointed and wished I hadn't read it. I am a big fan of C. S. Forester's Hornblower series, but it's obvious that he has a very cynical view of women and married life, and it comes through much more strongly in The African Queen."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"Rose Sayer, bent on avenging the death of her English missionary brother, enlists, or drafts, the cockney Charlie Allnut, captain of the steam launch Afican Queen, down a mighty river in 'German Central Africa', to enter \\"Lake Wittelsbach\\" and there, with makeshift torpedoes, sink the Konigin Luise, the German Navy steamer that then controls the lake for the Germans in 1914.Thanks to John Huston, Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn, everyone is familiar with the titular film, which is virtually the only cinematic representation of the East African Campaign of 1914-18. Stretching himself, CS Forester rises above his usual stock characterization in filling out the figures of Allnut and Rose, the latter being somewhat (and thankfully) more attractive than Katherine Hepburn. He really excels at describing, in an engaging way, the exhausting journey down the 'Ulanga/Bora' river, with all its attendant perils - heat, crocodiles, mosquitoes, hippos, leaches, etc. This is 'Heart of Darkness' but written in such a way that you can and want to finish the book.Once the African Queen reaches the Lake, there to confront the German gunboat, history intrudes. It is also at this point that the film, wisely, diverges. Without naming the actual participants, Forester introduces the fascinating story of the real-life Royal Navy expedition that, through incredible exertion, crossed Africa with 2 motor gun boats and fought the Germans for naval supremacy on Lake Tangayika in 1915. CS Forester's conclusion to this story, after effectively building tension and also spinning quite a nice little romance between his two heroes, is distinctly anti-climatic. Forester also includes several minor historical inaccuracies, such as the Germans arming their native troops with Martini rifles, and that these same native troops were rather dimwitted and rather cowardly. Given that the Germans, only a few hundred strong, fought a successful guerrilla campaign in WWI East Africa with only about 7,000 native troops, puts the lie to Forester's account, even if fiction.Michael Kitchen does a fine job in narrating this tale."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"The first C. S. Forester novels I ever read were the eleven volumes comprising the Hornblower series of nautical adventures in the British navy. Years before encountering those, which, by the way, are superb reading and far better written than the Aubrey/Maturin maritime novels of Patrick O'Brian, perhaps their closest competitors in readers' affections, I saw a movie entitled \\"The African Queen.\\" I was far too young then to know or care about the inspiration behind that 1951 film and was not even acquainted with the novels of C. S. Forester. That film must have made quite an impression, though, for, decades later, I can still hear the throbbing of the steam engine driving the Queen down the Ulanga and Bora River, so, when I chanced to encounter Forester's novel, there was nothing else to do but dive into it.The story line in THE AFRICAN QUEEN rushes along even faster than do the plots of the Hornblower novels. The story, set in Africa at the beginning of World War I, is replete with deathly disease, conquering Nazis, and never-ending derring-do amidst cataracts and rapids plunging down boulder-strewn canyons toward huge Lake Wittelsbach, whose waters are patrolled by the Konigin Luise mounting the Nazi iron cross flag. Oh yes, we mustn't ignore the love element that evolves between the spinsterish, virginal Rose Sayer, steeped in her brother's missionary zeal and stern religiosity, and her companion, Charlie Allnutt, a cockney with a highly questionable past. Primarily, however, this begins and remains an adventure story, and there's just enough love element to spice things up a bit.The novel is not without its flaws. There are undoubtedly critics who take it to task for the ease with which Rose loses her austere countenance (not to mention her virginity), given her strict, traditional upbringing and her circumscribed life. Her assuming almost instant command of the steamboat, her fanatical self-imposed mission, and her sheer strength of mind and unwavering determination appear too atypical for someone of her background. For our other protagonist, Allnutt, his ability to repair or cobble together everything the couple come to need as they careen down the racing Alanga or laboriously pull their boat across the stagnant delta of the Bora is nothing short of phenomenal. The reader's credulousness is sorely tested when Forester has Allnutt create a workable forge on the banks of the river and repair a kinked drive shaft and a broken propeller in the middle of the jungle.Still, this is adventure fiction, and the reader must not be overly critical of characters who find themselves in dire straits with only their imagination and ingenuity (or at least with the imagination of the author who created them) to succor themselves. I dare say that THE AFRICAN QUEEN, written in 1935, has yet to be bested by any more recent adventure stories--equaled perhaps, but not bested. The book is a very fast read and is not easy to lay aside, and I feel that any reader, from adolescent to antiquarian, who enjoys the vicarious mystery, challenge and excitement of a fine adventure story will not find THE AFRICAN QUEEN lacking.And just who is the real African Queen, the steamboat or Rose Sayer?"},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"A Great read.

Nevertheless, it's an inspiring tale of courage, intelligence, and mutual respect. Each makes the other a better person."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"First off, I want to say I wholly agree with the other two star reviewer.The basic set up:Missionary Rose Sayer is left high and dry after the Germans kill the villagers and her brother Samuel. Cockney boat owner Charley Allnut lets her ride along with him on his creaky old boat and Rose gets the brilliant idea to use the explosives on the boat to torpedo the K&ouml;nigin Luise and convinces Allnut to go along with it. Why he goes along with this is any one's best guess (I was sure scratching my head over it). But to get to that point, they must travel the river, avoiding the Germans and their guns, shoot rapids that no one has ever shot before to reach the lake where they will find their target.Shooting dangerous rapids in a creaky boat, being fired upon by evil German soldiers and risking all to strike a blow for freedom and Britain. Wow, that should be even better as a book, right? Not. Boring, boring, boring.I just never bought into the relationship that develops between Rose and Charlie, nor could I fathom why he'd merrily follow along on her cockamamie plan to blow up the Germans. How a sheltered on-the-shelf missionary managed to learn how to hold the tiller and guide them through rapids like no one has done before them really stretched the credulity meter, but even worse is how it all ends once they reach the lake and the K&ouml;nigin Luise. I won't spoil, but if you're expecting a big bang like in the movie, think again - it's a snoozer, albeit a mercifully short one. This was so dull it almost put me to sleep on the treadmill, and I only finished as it was I needed an Africa book for a reading challenge. Not recommended."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"The lady has the will, and the cockney has the ingenuity.

He knew a plausible method of turning an old river steamer into a torpedo, he knew the hellish consequences of losing a prop blade, of mooring in a mangrove swamp, of finding still water in a rapid..

This is a book for any age."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"There is really not much to say except that the Hollywood movie is not really very much like the book. (Why does this not suprise me?) The story and the characters are much more human, possibly because they are not &quot;Katharine H. and Boogie&quot; and this is not Hollywood. The thundering falls, the hunger,the heat, the gloomy swamps, the smother lake of water lillies, the endless toil and hours...and then, in the end, to see their mission fail. As heart breaking and riviting as any book ever writen."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"Some authors have the gift of putting words together in a way that entertains and enthralls the reader. C. S. Forester is one of the best. When Forester tells a story, the reader feels personally involved. We feel like we know the characters in a personal, intense way. If you have read Forester's Hornblower novels, you have read Forester at his best. The African Queen was made into a memorable movie starring Katherine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart. The book is more intense, darker, and far less triumphant than the movie. If you thrill to the successes of Horatio Hornblower in Forester's navel novels, you might find African Queen a little depressing at times. If you like depressing novels (and apparently many readers do) you might give this book five stars. The story is set during World War I and involves the attempt by a missionary lady and an alcoholic English boatman to travel down a river in Africa to do battle with the Germans. The interaction between the characters and the river creates a riveting story. Like Hemingway, &quot;I recommend Forester...&quot;"},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"I will not reveal the ending; I will say only that it does not end with the German captain of the Louisa marrying the protagonists just as the ship impales itself on the overturned African Queen's torpedoes. C. S. Forester's ending requires less suspension of disbelief, less \\"deus ex machina.\\" Throughout the voyage of refugees Rose Sayer and Mr. Allnutt down the Ulanga and Bora Rivers in German Central Africa at the outbreak of war, the reader is treated to C. S. Forester's literal, high resolution realism. Forester would not have felt the need to depart from that realism to enhance the final drama. Forester reveals the characters of protagonists Rosie and Allnutt as successive adversities beset them on their voyage. Their steam launch, The African Queen, is their vessel in both senses of the word: if course it is their boat, but it also represents a container in which the protagonists' spirits are blended in a purposeful collaboration. it is a touching human drama, and the realism is such that the reader's ears ring unceasingly with the high-pitched whine of mosquitoes."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"Throughout most of the book, I found myself thinking, \\"This is one case where I like the movie better.\\" Although the plot for the first 3/4 of the book is the same as the movie's, the characterization is a bit different. For example, the movie portrays Rose as a determind, principled, yet prim woman who slowly learns to love; in the book, she comes across as a bit immature, supposedly the result of being repressed by men her entire life, and is so thrilled with the freedom earned by her brother's recent death that she decides to kamikaze a German boat. Personally, I found the movie's Rose more realistic and likeable; the book's Rose felt too much like a poster child of feminist propoganda.In general, most of the novel is a bit heavy-handed is describing the character's motives, characters, and thought processes, and leaves very little to the imagination. Subtlety, apparently, is not Forester's strong point.The only thing keeping me from giving this book a lower rating is the ending. Forester truly redeems himself in my eyes with the ending, which is far darker and more realistic than the movie's. The ending calls into question everythng that you assumed that Forester was trying to tell you -- all the notions of heroism, patriotism, and true love. The last line is probably one of my favorite of all last lines,(Spoiler space)forcing you to ask yourself: Are Charlie and Rose truly soulmates, or has an extreme situation simply brought them together and instigated passion? While in the movie it is clear that Charlie and Rose truly love another, the book suggests that their \\"love\\" may simply be due to the arousal that arises during a near-death situation. For me, this very human, bittersweet ending enabled me to forgive Forester for his earlier heavy-handed treatment of the characters."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"When her village in German Central Africa is destroyed at the start of WWI, a missionary is rescued by a gin-loving river miner.
