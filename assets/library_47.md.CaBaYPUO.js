Even though it has been many years since I first read the book, it still holds a place in my heart as one of the most timeless and enjoyable books I have ever read. This tale of adventure is one that will always live on through the genertions and hold a place deep within our hearts."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In light of the previous critics words on Tolkien, I have this to share:To say that \\"The Hobbit\\" is flawed is like saying the The Mona Lisa is imperfect. To cite an \\"omniscient narrator who sweeps in on invisible wings from time to time\\" is to misunderstand one of the most important narrative styles of all time. To complain about leaving main characters in the dark for too many chapters is to ignore what Tolkien did for suspense in the world of literature. To criticize Tolkien for the descriptive style that, for the most of us, puts him miles above all other fantasy writers, is to be incapable of objectivity. And to find fault with putting the glory in the hands of Bard instead of Bilbo is to fail to grasp the meaning of the tale altogether. And if you think that the struggle between four armies does not begin until the last 100 pages of the book, then you just aren't a very good reader. The battle of four armies starts in chapter one.Every child I've read it to was completely fascinated by it and seems to have understood its worth above lesser fantasy.\\"The Hobbit\\" is quite possibly the greatest work of fantasy fiction ever written, and the one all comers will continue to be judged by.Maybe one day there will be another children's story as good as this.J. Lyon LaydenThe Other Side of Yore"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Ok,this is the most adventurous book I have ever read.This book is about a Hobbit Bilbo Baggins a very nice and polite hobbit. He never goes goes on adventures but thats about to to change.This book is great classic and is a must read.This book is a proluge to lord of the rings.So I suggest to read this before reading The Lord of the Rings.This book is about slaying a dragon for treachure .If you don't like adventures then this book is not for you."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The hobbit is a book full of magical creatures, magic, and with funny main characters called Hobbits. What is a hobbit you may ask, you will find many little things about them by reading the book, but the are short people looking things that have very thick hides the grow as there feet- they have normal looking feet, but just are tougher-so they don't use shoes. In this story Gandalf the grey (a very powerful, wise, and tall wizard) although our hobbit has no idea what is going to happen to him Gandalf has already chosen his adventure coming up. Bilbo (our hobbit) is set to meet with a number of dwarfs. They are off to find there right full home. Also one of the dwarfs is a soon to be king. They are all party of the dwarf community that belongs to one of the great huge mountains. On the way there they will meet many foes few allies, and a dragon. They will make quit a bit of coin from the loot they found in the mountain. Bilbo is also very skilled with a dagger, just not aware of it at the beginning of the story. At first he did not want to go and just wanted to stay home and drink tea. Later on in this magical story Bilbo fights large spiders and also finds a magical ring, the original ring belonged to the dark lord, and then to a mighty king, Smegule-who was once also a hobbit-was twisted and turned into an animal and obsess with the ring. He would call it precious and keep it close to him. Bilbo will take it and then use it agents the dragon and also agents the spiders. To rape this up The Hobbit is the prequel to the Lord of The Rings Trilogy. I recommend this book to anyone who likes books or a book about magic and creatures."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is an excellent piece of work done by JRR Tolkien. It combines adventure, fantasy, and folklore together making a thrilling book. This book was written because JRR was a professor of English at Oxford and had wanted to write something like this for a long time. The book shows that he spent much time on the book. Through this work, he became the father of the fantasy/adventure genre. I had to knock a star off though for the confusing laguage he used in conversation and in his descritions. Perhaps if one likes to think about something very deeply, this language would be a great source of thinking material. However, I enjoy the reading. I have to have adventure after adventure after adventure. This book portrayed that, however, the language did slow it up a bit. All in all, a very excellent piece of work by JRR. I have already begun the first book in series that follows this story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It was good, but a little confusing at parts, and a bit boring at part"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I loved this story; it had all the elements a good story needs. It had great mythical lands, hobbits, a band of hostile dwarves, a mage, goblins, trolls, and many other mythical creatures. The descriptions of the places were in-depth, and colourful. The plot was great; though the original quest was petty, it turned into a wonderful adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a book that you can't put down. It has action, comedy, and lots of adventures. This book is about a hobbit (a little person with big feet and hands) who goes on a quest with six dwarves. Along the way they run into trolls, wizards, giant spiders, gobblins, a very strange creature named Gollum, and a dragon named Smaug. The best part about the Hobbit is that it is only one of four books in a series that are all filled with action and adventure. I would recommend this book and all the ones in the series to anyone who can read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Reading Tolkien's masterpiece is like being drawn into a world so believable, one can reach out and snatch Bilbo Baggins' ring. No wonder this is the benchmark of all fantasy books, it is a true fantasy, with &quot;dwarves&quot;, elves, trolls, dragons, goblins, and whatever anyone can imagine."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've read many books, but this book is probally one of my favorites. It's set in the days with elves, dragons and wizards. This book is what I think best describes the term &quot;Adventure&quot;. It's filled with detail and description. One more comment to whoever reads this. Do NOT EVER see the movie they made for this book. It leaves out huge parts of the story and is very lame."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This was my first fantasy novel. I really had no interest in reading fantasy before. I heard this was an extraordinary book. I heard right. This is a master piece. Tolkien brings out the child that is within us all. He takes the imagination to new heights, introducing us to an extraordinary land filled with extraordinary people and creatures; some good, some evil. Bilbo Baggins the lead character in the book is goes on an adventure that is beyond his wildest dreams. The way in which Tolkien tells this tale, is worth the read by itself. This is a masterful prelude to the 'Lord Of The Rings', the greatest fantasy epic ever written!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was great! It was able to capture the imaginations of both adults and children with elements of fantasy and have a both complex and easy to understand plot. It is hard to believe how Tolkein managed to create this entire world. Read the Lord of the Rings, too! It's like a Bible! I LOVE IT!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is beyond it's expectations! It is a wonderfully written, and spectacular in it's intentions. J.R.R. Tolkien is a fabulous writer! He makes sense in every word he writes! I have read only one of his books, and I am fascinated! Read this book you'll love it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Excuse the melodrama of the title, but after reading some of the reviews on here.... I mean come on, to call Tolkien boring and not important is to not understand that his book pointed out the direction that fantasy literature was to go in this century. Just read any article of an authors influences or some of the dedications on current fantasy novels and Tolkiens name will appear hundreds of times. All I'm saying is read the book from the perspective that there wouldn't be a &quot;WHeel of Time&quot; or &quot;Belgariad&quot; or &quot;Magician series&quot; without the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Still worth another read. I find something new each time. Fun, excitement, danger!

I was transported alongside Bilbo in all these adventures. Never has a book had such an impact on me. And not to mention Tolkien 's style of writing! Eloquent and fun and just beautiful.

Tolkien certainly belongs in the highest echelon of writers. Recommend for all from age 12+."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A great story. Wonderful characters, plenty of action and a great plot. Great for all ages. I read it as a child and read it again after watching the movie. Brililant."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Quick, movie's out, read the book again! Since Peter Jackson chose to stretch one small children's book into 3 long movies it turns out you can easily read the book chapters covered by the movie faster than you can watch the movie, and reading the whole book only takes a few hours.As a children's book I think it is pretty damn good. You can see Tolkien building up ideas for Lord of the Rings: the easily-killed but numerous spiders are the building blocks for the much more sinister and powerful Shelob, the swords taken from the trolls were very reminiscent of the swords acquired from the Barrow-wight and used to kill the Nazgul, and the Battle of Five Armies is a smaller scale template for the epic battle of Helm's Deep.On a less positive note, I found the foreshadowing fairly annoying, and I'm not sure why it is there. Maybe Tolkien thought kids needed to be reassured that everything was going to work out in the end, or needed all the dots explicitly connected?&#34;...which shows he was a wise elf and wiser than the men of the town, though not quite right, as we shall see in the end....And the knotted ropes are too slender for my weight. Luckily for him that was not true, as you will see.&#34;Great children's book, and I'm going to score it as such, I certainly loved it as a kid.4 stars.

In fact, it is, along with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, my go to book when there is nothing else to read. The illustrations in this edition are wonderful.

Despite my deleting & reloading several times (6 at last count) I can't get the audio portions to work & I've been unable to get any help making them work.

I read this to my eight year old daughter, and she loved it. Now we've moved on to the trilogy. I can't imagine starting there. It starts too slow, is too pensive and descriptive at times - these are features that a fan will forgive, but for an initiate, these can be motivation killers. I got my daughter hooked through the Hobbit, and her interest has endured. We're into Two Towers now. The Hobbit moves at a quick pace, and is light-hearted enough to entertain younger readers. It is utterly lacking in a romantic angle, but this is more than made up for by the themes of friendship and homely virtue.

You will also find that this book is not the same as the other book because J.J.R Toliken had made such careful and intensive on this book, he created one whole new world with language, culture, calenders, etc. I am sure that it will help you because it have given such great influence about different methaphors.

Of course, by then, I was already into Mercedes Lackey and other fantasy, so the almost-nonexistant character personalities and and uninteresting creatures (Orcs and one smelly dragon.Wow.) showed their true blandness in contrast.And where are the female characters? E-mail me if there are some and I've just forgotton, but from what I remember, there are no women at all that are more than just mentioned. Was Tolkien really that much of a chauvenist?If you thought that this book was okay, but not fantastic, and that some parts were a bit too boring, whatever you do, DO NOT READ THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING!!!!

The characters are so happy it's annoying. I like characters with a lot of back ground and I like many characters I can relate to. A bunch of identical dwarves don't do the job. They also don't fit the spirit of dwarves, but then again after time they evolved into the grumpy alchoholics fantasy tends to portray them as. All the characters were corny and annoying. Anyway, don't get me wrong about it. I understood it. I loved the Dragonlance chronicles and Wheel of Time which made this book look so childish.

Throughout this book, Mr.Baggins undergoes many adventures, accompanied by thirteen dwarves and, for some of the way, a wizard. His companions and himself are heading towards a mountain of gold, with a dragon waiting at the end. When finally reaching their destination, they do not know exactly what they will find. Mr. Baggins uses his magical ring, which makes him invisible, to investigate on what they are up against. Well, things are easier said than done. Actually killing the dragon was completely out of their league, so they hid and waited for the right moment. When they couldn't stand hiding any longer, they came out, expecting to be burned by the dragon's flames. To their pleasant surprise, they found that the dragon had been killed by townspeople the night before. Thinking that left the gold to them, they celebrated. Around a week later though, they went into war to claim the riches all to themselves. Winning the war didn't do too much, since they had to spare part of the gold to their alliances. When the adventure of his lifetime was drawn to an end, Mr.Baggin headed back to the center of his motivation, home sweet home. A year had passed since he had left his hobbit hole, and he could have wished for nothing more than to be back in his cozy little home."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Wow, where do I begin this review, first of let me say that JRR Tolkien is one of the best storytellers of all time.

The adventure of Bilbo Baggins is the classic treasure hunt, complete with elves, dwarves, goblins, trolls and fire breathing dragon. Also, for the first time the reader meets such characters as Gandalf the Gray, Elrond Half-Elven, Balin, Gloin, and of course Gollum all who play either larger or lesser roles in the Lord of the Rings. Perhaps most importantly, is the account of the finding of the Ring of Power. Therefore, while clearly written with a younger audiance in mind, The Hobbit appeals to readers of all ages, for in it, the master of fantasy can clearly be seen honing the storytelling skills that have won him the praise of millions readers around the world. I can not wait until my neice and nephew are old enough for me to share this incredable tale with them."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a great tale of the change that just a little hobbit can make to the world, and to himself.Bilbo Baggins a small hobbit of hobbiton invited a guest over one day to share a cup of tea. That guest in turn turned into many guests who would pressure him to embark on the adventure of a lifetime.After a dance and a party, 12 dwarves and a wizard (Gandalf) would inform Bilbo that he was to be the burglar on their journey to take the treasure from the great dragon Smaug. After one night Bilbo and the others set out on their journey. They encountered many obstacles but in the end Bilbo could almost always be trusted with the rescue of his group.I like how J. R. Tolkien laid out this story as a great prequel to the lord of the rings trilogy. She explains many main characters as well as the plot very descriptively. She does not, however, explain the significance of the most important item in her series, the ring. She does though display the recent origin and some of its magic.But I think there is a subtle message in this story, the smallest being can make the biggest difference. The small little hobbit, that at one point was scared to leave his smug house, soon emerged to become the great warrior that he was. This Hobbit would still a ring from and out riddle a sea-demon. Break into an Elfish castle, free his friends, and guide them to safety. He would also deal with a dragon, and steal a plot of treasure that could last a million lifetimes. But his greatest accomplishment was maturing to realize that when in danger you have to step up.This is a great adventure and a fine read. I advise this to anyone, who like me wants a compelling book that keeps you into the story. If you do read this, however, look for the subtle messages, they are the most important."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"One day in my darkest hour, I was at a bookstore and picked up \\"The Hobbit\\".

The way this book was written allowed me to be able to read the book to my 8-year-old cousin without having to explain what was happening in the story. He enjoyed the book a lot and even asked if he could read it to me. The book is \\"addicting\\", it makes you want to constantly read on. \\"What will happen to Bilbo next?\\" \\"Where is Gandalf?\\" It also helps that Tolkien used \\"Deus ex machina\\"(Latin for god from machine), meaning that out of nowhere one of the characters will save the day, and that he used this method correctly by only using Gandalf for this once in a while and then not using him anymore.**The book is about Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit from Bag End in the Shire, and his being forced into a journey to steel back treasure from Smaug for thirteen dwarves that think he is a theif. His is forced into this journey by Gandalf, a wizard and old friend of Bilbo's family on the Took side, and his secret need to find go on an adventure, which is frowned upon by hobbits.

I was very interested in reading this book after I watched The Lord of the Rings movies that came out in theatres. I feel that this book had an ideal audience ages 12 and up. The concept of the book is made for a younger audience but there are some things in the book that make it for an older audience. The book references drinking and smoking which to little kids is not a big deal but some may think that younger kids are not suited for that kind of stuff.This book was full of literary techniques; the first example is imagery. Imagery is found throughout the book and in fact is on the first page of the book. The author does a great job of describing the characters traits and it paints a picture in the readers mind. Imagery is also used when the main character Bilbo is walking through the forest, the author paints the pictures of the forest through the use of imagery. Even though imagery is good in a book sometimes the author put to much detail in little things such as spending two pages describing the pony. The other literary technique used by the author was the use of personification. The author seemed to make everything in the book come to life. The best example I can thing of was when Bilbo met the little creature named Gollum. Gollum lived in the cave and when he ran from Bilbo he jumped into the water and the author described the water as running away from the shore. As we all know, water can not run thus the author was using personification to give the water human traits.This book had me so caught up in the rich plot; I couldn't even put it down. My emotions were mixed when I was reading it. At first I thought it was an adventure and then the book took my emotions and changed them because the characters ran into so many different challenges. My reactions to the book were good, but I thought that the whole story line was too quick. What I mean is that the stories plot seemed a little to quick to seem real. My overall impressions of this book were good. I liked the story line and I loved how the book ties in close with The Lord of the Rings movies. Before reading this book I was a little worried because it was a classic book and I thought right away that the book would be boring. I recommend this book to anyone who likes the fantasy world type of stories and people who liked The Lord of the Rings movies. I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars and I feel that everyone needs to read this classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Bilbo Baggins, a small, unimpressive creature called a hobbit, embarks on an adventure that will change the world of Middle Earth forever. In The Hobbit, J. R. R. Tolkien begins to weave the greatest fantasy story in literary history. Blibo lives in his cozy little hobbit hole, far away from any danger, in a place called the Shire. Life is peaceful for the Hobbits, especially Bilbo, but his peace won't last. When Gandalf and Thorin and Co. pay the little hobbit a visit and offer him the adventure of a lifetime, Gandalf goads the little hobbit into joining the dwarves' adventure. The dwarves (Thorin and Co.) plan to march to the Lonely Mountain where they will smite the dragon Smaug and reclaim their ancient treasure under the mountain. Gandalf had told the dwarves that Bilbo would go as their burglar, when in fact Bilbo was far from a burglar. As the group of fourteen treks towards the Lonely Mountain, Tolkien uses the timid hobbit, in various adventures, to convey how even the smallest being can become a hero to all. Tolkien made a comprehensive history to his stories, which makes the story feel real, like it actually happened. By never switching characters and always concentrating his writing on the hobbit, Tolkien creates a story that flows exquisitely. It captivates the mind, and Tolkien's descriptive writing makes the reader feel like he or she is actually there with the hobbit on his marvelous adventure.By: Joseph Hill"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"Now it is a strange thing, but things that are good to have and days that are good to spend are soon told about, and not much to listen to; while things that are uncomfortable, palpitating, or even gruesome may make a good tale, and take a great deal of telling anyway.\\"In The Hobbit, Tolkien has created his own world independent from our own. The fictitious Middle Earth is complete with its own history and family trees. Set in a time before Men are the reigning species, The Hobbit is unlike any other fantasy novel. The main character, Bilbo Baggins, is employed by a wizard with a questionable reputation called Gandalf. He's hired as a thief to travel with a band of dwarfs to steal back their long-lost treasure. Throughout his treacherous journey through Middle Earth, Bilbo battles fantastic Middle Earth creatures as well as his own fear. This book is a masterpiece no one should miss."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, written by J.R.R. Tolkien, chronicles the travels of Bilbo Baggins and his troop of dwarves. The overall setting is in the fictitious world of Middle-Earth. The story begins in the Shire at Bilbo's home and journeys through opaque labyrinths and inscrutable wilderness. The wizard, Gandalf, directly foreshadows the role of Bilbo in this book, and why he was included on this perilous quest, with the statement, \\"Bilbo is stronger than you or he knows.\\" Bilbo, while skeptical of his abilities, proceeds to prove his worth and valor again and again. Throughout the book, the virtues of courage and intelligence are shown to greatly influence the outcome of any predicament. Bilbo, an unlikely representative of good, triumphs over evil. Hordes of mythical beasts, such as goblins, trolls, evil wolves, giant spiders, and mischievous elves all oppose Bilbo and company in their quest for the Lonely Mountain. The areas of the journey in which there is darkness are always associated with evil. In the end, it is Bilbo all alone, and he is forced to demonstrate a courage previously unknown to him as he faces the personification of evil, the great dragon Smaug, guardian of the Lonely Mountain. One of the few grievances I have with this novel is the lack of complexity in the characters. Understandably, Bilbo is the only dynamic character, however we know very little about the dwarves that accompany him throughout this adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the unabridge verison of the book very enjoyable to listen to particularly because the songs are all sung instead of just read.

He is invited to go on a journey with thirteen dwarves who are going to their homeland to reclaim the land and their gold. The main character is Bilbo, who is afraid to take risks and likes to keep to himself. The head of the dwarves is Thorin, who leads the others to the gold. A wizard named Gandalf helps Bilbo and the dwarves on their journey. Bilbo acts as a burglar for the dwarves and rescues the dwarves in a lot of situations. The dwarves lead the way to the mountain to get the gold. Gandalf acts as a protector and advice giver to Bilbo and the dwarves. The characters run into a lot of trouble and adventures in the story. Each trouble is an adventure in the story like when the dwarves get caught by bad guys like goblins and spiders. They also fight a big battle with five armies. In all of the adventures Bilbo rescues the dwarves. My favorite character in the story was Gandalf because he was very powerful, and he was very wise.I can't really relate to any of the characters, except Bilbo, because he likes to stay at home all by himself. I also like to stay by myself too, so I can do whatever I want without anyone telling me what to do. I really liked the book; I thought the book was very imaginative. My favorite part of the book was at the beginning when the author described Bilbo's house in detail as if I were really there looking at it. If I could change a part in the book, I would have the dwarves-instead of Bard-kill the dragon. I recommend this book because it is a really good book.

Tolkien's style is very fictional with a very high vocabulary."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The book was very good at putting you in the middle of the story and the picture made the book form a life of it's own."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I loved this book. I have never been able to read a book very easily because I could never pay attention long enough, but this book really caught my attention the whole time.To begin with, a wizard visits the hobbit, whose name is Bilbo Baggins. The wizard puts a mark on the hobbit's door and then leaves. Later twelve dwarves visit the hobbit. They hire him as a burglar to help in their quest.He finally decides to go along, but highly against his own will. They start on the journey and have all sorts of strange happenings that occur. They encounter goblins and are taken into the depths of a very large underground network of tunnels. Here, Bilbo finds a ring that is quite magical. He does not know it yet, but the ring will prove to be a very vital part of their quest.After the goblins, they meet a man who is both Man and Bear. They manage to ask him for food and lodging for a while, though he does not like strangers. At night, Bilbo hears sounds of scratching and thumping, but does not dare to get up for fear of being eaten by Beorn, who is the Man/Bear. In addition, Beorn's animals have the ability to communicate with him and can do most anything that a regular man can.The Mirkwood Forest is quite peculiar in itself. The group of twelve dwarves and Bilbo must travel through a forest that is extremely dark. Although it is daytime, the forest is very dimly lit because all the trees form a canopy, which blocks all the light. Near the end of the forest, they become lost. They are forced to battle huge spiders and are eventually captured Wood-elves.Bilbo slips on his ring in time and is able to follow the elves as they take the dwarves to the cavernous hideout. Each dwarf is questioned to try to find out why he is traveling through the Mirkwood Forest. None will give the answer that the Elf King is looking for, so he throws them all in prison.While the dwarves are in prison, being quite well fed, Bilbo figures out a means of escape for all of the dwarves and himself. He also has time to learn quite a lot about the inside of the elf cavern. Bilbo gets the chance when a guard and another man go and taste the new wine that has been brought. Both become drunk and fall asleep. Bilbo is able to get all the dwarves out and himself.After this, they are not far from the dragon's lair. Smaug has taken all of the dwarve's treasure in gold and jewels and is in a cave on the Lonely Mountain. The quest of the small company is to reclaim the treasure that is rightfully the dwarves'. Bilbo faces Smaug and...I cannot tell you what happens, that would ruin it. They also face a war, but you will have to read to find out.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characters were very well developed and easy to remember. I usually lose track of who is who in a book, but this book was easy to keep track of the characters. The book is actually quite believable if the reader looks past the fact that the characters are dwarves and a hobbit. I was quite lost throughout the book wondering what the characters were actually feeling. I felt this was a very believable story.I have never been able to sit down and read a book as easily as I did this one. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants a good book. It keeps the reader on the edge of his or her seat and has action in almost every page that is read. I recommend this book to anyone, no matter who he or she is. This book is deserving of five stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It was certainly more book than I remembered from fifth grade! Such an amazing adventure.

The LOTR trilogy is so much better."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As this was meant to be a children's story originally it's understandable that this wasn't developed to take you from beginning to end in a expected transition but to be picked up each night in a segmented manner. The character dialogue which was at the time supposed to have been left to imagination rather than exact is rather awkward as well as the continual jumps from one scenario to another though they are great stories, it feels pieced together."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This was a great kindle purchase it was not expensive and it is a great story.

Very different tone than the Lord of the Rings, after learning more about JRR Tolkien it makes total sense. The Hobbit was written to a younger audience who would be adults by the time Lord of the Rings was published. Amazing, talk about attention to detail.Read this book if you haven't yet, it is simply fantastic. There is beautiful imagery, sword fights, dragons and trolls, what's not to love."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I did like the book, but I thought it was a bit boring in parts.

Absolutely loved it -- many of the lines have stayed with me ever since. I later read it twice more over the years, and now once more!I have not yet seen the new movie. I'm excited about it (loved Jackson's film adaptation of Lord of the Rings), but hate having to stop in the middle of the story. So I'm waiting for the trilogy to complete before seeing it.Just have to say there's something very special about this book. So delightful, familiar, and entertaining at any age, even after multiple readings. Try it again sometime, you're sure to agree!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Have read and reread this story from the time I was a little girl. At age 60, it still enthralls me! This format brings me in even closer to the story. Rw"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is one of my favorite books. The story is an epic journey, an adventure, which Hobbits notoriously abhor. But Bilbo is a very special Hobbit who proves his worth to his Dwarf companions, by rescuing them several times over. A classic tales with wizards, goblins, dwarfs, elves, and dragons. This is the book that put fantasy on the map, against which all fantasy books are measured. And most of them don't measure up."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Some of my favorite novels of all times are fantasy novels I love the rich imagination that comes with them. Amongst these wonderful fantasy tales is the novel The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien.Unlike several of Tolkienfs other books The Hobbit is much easier to get through. It is the kind of book I would recommend to any age and every generation.I would also recommend this book because it is an opener to The Lord of the Rings. The movie to that particular novel has inspired many people to read the book and The Hobbit is a story related to that. I would recommend this book if you plan on read The Lord of the Rings or if you already have.I myself enjoyed The Hobbit and by writing this review I hope to get others to read it as well."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is one of my favorite fantasy/adventure books I have ever read.Bilbo Baggins (the hobbit) is called to take part in an adventure when the wizard, Gandalf and a bunch of dwarves some by his house and tell him if he goes on the adventure he will get a share of the reward. The reason Gandalf and the dwarves came by was to get back the treasure stolen by the evil dragon, Smaug.On the way to the Lonely Mountain (Smaug's home) the hobbit, dwarves, and Gandalf have to get past evil goblins and trolls, wood-elves,savage wolves, giant spiders.If you like fantasy books, I HIGHLY recommend this book! This book is the prelude to The Lord of the Rings Series. I am definetly going to check them out since I loved this book so much. Also, in The Hobbit you learn about some of the things that happen in 'The Fellowship' such as where the ring came from.Also recommended: The Lord of the Rings series and the Harry Potter books."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"While it's obvious and easy to say Lord of the Rings is Tolkien's best work, I'll have to say otherwise. Rings is probably the greatest epic novel ever written, but The Hobbit touches me more closely. One should never read LOTR without having read the Hobbit first, afterall it is the first book and sets up a lot of the action that will follow. It's a great quick read, running only around 320 pages compared to Rings' 1500 or so. I highly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This novel lacks much of the complexity and subtlety of LoTR, but it is still a great novel in its own respect."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I gave this book 5 stars because that was as many as I could give. If I could give more I would! This is an entertaining, captivating and imaginative book. Tolkein creates a magical world where you feel that anything can happen (which in all truth could)and the characters he makes are both lovable (Bilbo)and despisable (e.g.Smaug). For people who love fantasy, this is the best in that context that I have ever read, save a few other well known books by the same author. I don't believe that anyone has not heard of Tolkien by now, either because of the movie Lord of the Rings or because of his reputable books. In either case, those who have not read this book (and also The Lord of The Rings series, which is a sequel of sorts to The Hobbit)READ IT NOW!!!Don't be among the minority. You won't regret it, I promise."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I thought it was a really good book. It had action in it most of the time. I didnt want to stop reading it.

Its mainily about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, he likes to be alone and smoke his pipe. Then one day unexspectedly a wizard by the name of Gandalf, comes along with 12 little dwarves asking to help them with a trouble that they have. but I wont tell you because you will have you read it and find out.

These types of books are generally out of my scope for books I like to read, but the more I read them the more I'm attracted to them.The story follows three dwarfs, involving the main character Bilbo Baggins and their quest for riches(that's guarded by a dragon). Throughout the story we see that Bilbo Baggins transform as a hobbit who never takes a risk and never does anything different from his schedule(at least this is how I perceived him) to an adventurer. Even if he does use some help from the magical thing he finds. ;)Overall a good read and a classical story that Ive heard a lot about but never read myself until now. You wont be disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Before being introduced to the world of Middle Earth by the LOTR trilogy I picked up The Hobbit at a yard sale (the best place to buy cheap books!) Unlike other books that I put aside to read later, I couldn't wait to get home and read The Hobbit. I was looking forward to learning about Tolkien's world before I saw the LOTR films (which hadn't come out yet).The novels begins with Bilbo Baggins as the respectable (and quite boring) Hobbit living in The Shire. Quite against his will, Baggins is recruited in his middle aged years by the wizard Gandalf to accompany on band of dwarves as their resident burglar and lucky number 14 on their mission to retake the treasure that was stolen from them by the dragon Smaug. Setting out without his kerchief, Baggins is in for the journey of a lifetime as he crosses forests and mountains on his quest to reach Lonely Mountain. Along this way this pint sized hero must battle trolls, orcs, and giant spiders as well as his own fears.This book introduces so many of the important races that make up the world of Middle Earth including the Elves, The Eagles, Orcs, and of course, Hobbits. It also gives us the first glimpse of The Ring of Power. In a whimsical and prosy manner, Tolkien tells the story of how a Baggins had his first adventure. This is my favorite of all fantasy novels and I can't recommend it enough. It deserves a spot on any bookshelf!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien fascinated me as no other book of fantasy and fiction. In fact, my preoccupation with the language of the Dwarfs led me to decode the rather complicated letters of their alphabet.After reading the book once, I reread it. I spent days or weeks working on clues throughout the book because I was determined to read the messages beginning on Page I, the Author's Note.It was not until I learned the completed alphabet and read the language that I could be satisfied that I had read the entire book.The story is a work of art in the description and storyline of characters and places visited. In my imagination, people and lives were incredulously conceived. Thus, my journey with the likes of Mr. Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, and the Wilderland will forever exist.The 1991 Green Cover Edition book is in my library.The Hobbit: Or There And Back Again"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A great fantasy book.

It's a very enjoyable journey into the world of J.R.R. Tolkien, written for a younger audience than the Lord of the Rings series. Because of this, I'd have to mark it lower than L.O.T.R., but overall is a fine read. It tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, who makes an appearance in the LOTR series as well.If you love LOTR, you will really enjoy the Hobbit. If you read the Hobbit first, then LOTR is jsut, oh so much better on all levels. I recommend reading the entire trilogyThe Lord of the Rings: 50th Anniversary, One Vol. Editionthen catching the incredibly produced and directed moviesThe Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring / The Two Towers / The Return of the King Extended Editions) [Blu-ray] .

Gandalf seeks help in the unlikely helpful Hobbit Bilbo Baggins (whom he calls a Burglar)... he's a Burglar but just doesn't know it yet!actually it's a good thing they brought the little fellow along because he pulls them out of fire many times over. the finding of the one ring, Smaug the dragon, spiders, Trolls, Goblins are part of many adventures they have getting to the Lonely Mountain to seek the Dragon's Gold!!i'd recommend this to anyone who likes hard back books and LORD OF THE RINGS. trade paper backs are nice as well, but nothing captures the writings of J.R.R.

Tolkien was a writer that could never be beaten...i have read it twice before but still enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The biggest theme present in The Hobbit is the quest; when Bilbo goes with Gandalf and the dwarves to Lonely Mountain. The quest has been in literature for hundreds of years, it is seen in Beowulf when he goes off to kill Grendel and it is also very much so present in the Arthurian Legends. The biggest quest in Arthurian Legend would have to be the quest for the Holy Grail. Arthur and his knights think that if they bring home the grail then a time of peace and prosperity will fall over their lands. Bilbo sort thinks the same way when he takes the cup from the dragon; he thinks that by having proof of his exploits that will make him an even more recognizable figure among the other hobbits.Another interesting parallel in The Hobbit to Arthurian Legend is use of named swords. It is with his sword Excalibur that Arthur was able to derive a lot of his power. The same goes for Bilbo after acquiring his short sword from the trolls, he does not name at first knowing that he has to prove himself with it but after that he names it Sting. It is with this sword that Bilbo was able to feel his own powerAlthough Tolkien publicly denied any connections between The Hobbit and Arthurian Legend it is defiantly easy to see where people are able to see parallels and connect the two stories together. Overall The Hobbit is a great read it does not take long to finish and interesting to see the differences between the movie and book. Everyone should read The Hobbit at least once in their lifetime."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love Tolkien's book The hobbit. It is a well written and fun read. Read this before you see the movies!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"While reading the hobbit, I encountered not only excitement and became very anxious to see what would happen next. This book is definitely a page turner. The illustrations are printed very clearly, and with very good notes on what they are. And then the annotations-useful engaging and very well done. You will WANT to read these. we discover how the book was written and what was changed between editions. There are fascinating tidbits about tolkens life and the experiences that made their way into the story.To further describe The Hobbit, Bilbo is a reluctant member of an adventure that will forever change his life and the lives of those around him. He accompanies 13 dwarves on a mission to reclaim the gold and mountain kingdom of their ancestors from the dragon, smaug. they have many adventures and mishaps on their journey to the lonely mountain including the climatic battle of five armies. Bilbo finds a magic ring along the way which leads, not only to a rise in his stature, but alos an new adventure for his friends in \\"The Lord Of the Rings\\".\\"Here is beauty that cuts like a knife and burns like cold iron\\" - C.S.

I would recommend the book you if you love mystery books. it's a great thrilling book"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I started reading \\"The Hobbit,\\" I was so bored. I never thought I could finish reading it and actually enjoy it. Around the sixth chapter, \\"The Hobbit\\" picked up the pace and became interesting. It surprised me that I was actually entertained by reading the book. At the conclusion, I was pleased with the action and the adventure. I was content with the ending also.One of the best parts of \\"The Hobbit\\" was not the quest to Lonely Mountain, but watching Bilbo Baggins' transformation. Throughout the book, he developed from a timid hobbit to a smart, stealthy, and more confident hobbit. I liked seeing how his adventures, especially the encounter with the spiders in Mirkwood, positively changed his character. I also enjoyed when Bilbo cleverly came up with a way to escape from Thranduil's imprisonment. The idea of riding down the river in old boxes and barrels was resourceful. He benefited from the quest in ways more profound than leaving with a chest of silver.One of my favorite adventures in the story was when Bilbo met Gollum. I loved when Gollum and Bilbo were engaged in the riddle game. The terms of the game made it more intense to me. If Bilbo happened to get a riddle wrong, Gollum was going to eat him. Personally, I believe it was one of the most important points in the novel. Here, Bilbo finds the amazing invisibility ring that helps him greatly throughout the rest of the quest to Lonely Mountain.J.R.R Tolkien used foreshadowing throughout the novel. The use of foreshadowing made the story more engrossing. When he used foreshadowing, I became more entrenched in reading. Tolkien knew exactly what words and phrases to use to paint a vivid image in my head. Throughout \\"The Hobbit,\\" I felt like I was actually on the adventure with Bilbo and the thirteen dwarfs. Without the frequent foreshadowing and the dynamic imagery, I personally would not have been as interested throughout \\"The Hobbit.\\"I would most definitely recommend this book to everyone. While it is challenging to read the first few chapters, once the real adventures begin, you will not be able to put the book down. As someone who does not usually read and enjoy adventure or fantasy novels, I am surprised that I enjoyed \\"The Hobbit\\" so much."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The hobbit is a very good read. It appeals to all age groups except for small children and just about anyone could read it and experience a different form of bliss or joy. The story follows Bilbo the Hobbit throughout his journey in Middle Earth. Bilbo and his friend Gandalf meet many people along the way from elves to a dragon named Smaug. During their entire campaign and travels they encounter much fighting and peril that ends up in an all out war with a surprise ending. Bilbo emerges alive and continues on the same life he lived before. Some individuals would say parts of the story are boring, but in the end they all come together to create a beautiful ending. This is a book that has been cherished for decades. Make sure your kids read it someday because it speaks to everyone. It is featured in much high school curriculum for a reason.

Tolkien who is,without a doubt, the father of the modern fantasy genre. If a new author wants legitimacy, he is compared with Tolkien. Just read the reviews on most new fantasy epics. Try Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time Series for one.This book lays the foundation for the Lord of the Rings (LOR), including an introduction to key items of power that figure heavily into the LOR trilogy. Thought long-winded at times, the Hobbit is entertaining enough to warrant the tribulations of the descriptions.Despite its drawbacks, this book is so rich in detail and backstory, that many books pale in comparison to this journeyman-piece.It is an irreplaceable work for all die-hard Lord of the Rings fans."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is very close to the original, just bringing some flavor to the storytelling without exaggerating.

The materials, binding, dust jacket, pictures are all top notch. This is how this story should be presented."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit\\" by J.R.R. Tolkien is commonly referred as a classic. While this is an often over-used term, it definitely applies in this case. Of the four books Tolkien is known for primarily, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", \\"The Two Towers\\", \\"The Return of the King\\" and \\"The Hobbit\\", this is the most satisfying. I t introduces and sets up key characters for \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy consisting of the three books previously named.In Tolkien's Middle-Earth, the principle races are men, elves and dwarves. There also goblins (orcs), giants dragons, wizards and assorted odd characters and fantastic beasts. Then there are hobbits who have as little to do with the rest of Middle-Earth as possible.They like it that way.Hobbits are interested in green growing things, eating and smoking pipe weed. When they aren't being industrious, they enjoy their comforts. They are very short in stature and move through the woods efficiently and silently. This isn't so they can sneak up on someone so much as it is to stay out of adventures.Of these conservative, predictable folk, there is one Bilbo Baggins. The Bagginses are prosperous and respectable as hobbits go. Which means Bilbo is perfectly happy leading his boring comfortable life. The only mild eccentricity noted in Bilbo's line is he's related to the Tooks through his mother. Tooks had been known to get into little adventures from time to time and as such were of questionable respectability.Central to this connection is Gandalf the Grey, a wizard. For some reason he has developed a curiosity and a fondness for these little people. Maybe it\`s because in his adventure-filled life, it's nice to have a little peace and quiet. Gandalf is also renowned for his fireworks of which everyone enjoys.One day the family friend shows up on Bilbo's doorstep. Shortly after this, Bilbo finds himself hosting not just Gandalf but also twelve dwarves lead by Thorin Oakenshield. Not long after this, Bilbo finds himself \`assigned' to this motley crew as a \\"Burglar\\". They are on a quest to recover Thorin's lost fortune.This is when the book really begins. This is a journey tale. That means Bilbo goes through transformation in the process of this quest. Relationships are developed and tested in a way none can predict. This being a fantasy they see and do fantastic things.Eventually Bilbo returns home no longer respectable. Along the way he has picked up a ring..........."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I remember when I was seven, I was in bed one evening.

My favorite adventures in this book was (1) when they got captured by the goblins and (2) Bilbo's riddle competition. I also like this book because it includes two chapters of Lord of the Rings. My favorite part in the Lord of the Rings was when Bilbo put on his ring in the party he had for his friends and escaped. it was strange that Bilbo was eleventyone.

Tolkein presents a story of overcoming fears by telling the simple story of hobbits who leave their beloed Shire. It is the story of a wizard, Gandalf and a hobbit of Bag End named Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo reluctantly joins Gandalf and a group of dwares in a search for a lost treasure. This is an exciting journey for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Here are a few words for those of you who have yet to read The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien:Best. Book. Ever.The Hobbit tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, who is (guess what?) a hobbit. Bilbo lives in his house (which is indeed, a hole) in the Shire alone, and loves the peaceful life. But one day he receives a visit from the wizard Gandalf, and everything changes. Before he knows it, Bilbo is swept up in an adventure he'll never forget.In his quest, Bilbo aids the dwarves from the Lonely Mountain. The home of the dwarves has been taken over by the dragon Smaug, and they cannot face him alone. And so, Bilbo sets off with this group of colorful characters, and their journey leads them through mountain ridges, elven cities, dangerous forests and more, the climax at the end being the great Battle of Five Armies.This book, like all of Tolkiens novels, is exquisite, unique, incredibly well-written...I could go on forever about its greatness. I have read a good many books despite my only fifteen years of age, and for me to pick this one as the best, well, you know it must be good.Even if you are not a fantasy reader, I believe that it's hard not to enjoy this story. It's more than just some old fantasy story, in my opinion. And for those of you who love fantasy, well, I must say, you're in for a treat."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I know i am a little late reviewing or even reading this book. Im 22 years old, and i felt that the movies, while good, just didn't fill in the blanks. I love The Hobbit. It is great for kids as well as adults. I just couldn't put it down. From the moment Gandalf leaves a dent in Bilbo's door to the moment Bilbo hands him the jar, I was rivetted. I took me 6 hours tops to read this book and I knew I was a Tolkien fan for life. I know i will read and reread this book for many years to come, and it is definitely something i will read to my kids! PEACE!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The story is about a young hobbit called Bilbo Baggins on a mission with thirteen dwarves and Gandalf the wizard to try and defeat the dragon smaug and try to regain control of thier treasure filled home in the lonely mountains. Firstly, Bilbo comes across some forocous, meat eating trolls and finds a beautiful, blue sword, calved by the elves and deicides to call it sting. He gets lost and comes across stone giants, and a mine crawling with goblins and in the mines he bumps into a creature called Golum, and steals his ring, and the ring has the power of invisibility and he used the ring to escape. Then Bilbo finds Gandalf again and they find a forest but then Gandalf said he had to leave so Bilbo contiued through the forest with the dwarves, but the dwarves get stolen by some wood elves and Bilbo tries to rescue them and he succedes and everyone escapes to Lake town and from there he goes to the lonely mountains and manages to get the lonely mountain back, but the devastating Smaug escapes and burns Lake town, but Bard who lives in lake town kills Smaug with his black arrow.Later war with the dwarves come and they try to kill the men and elves, but Gandalf stops them and tells them the goblin army are about to attack. Bilbo finds a shape shifter disguised as a bear and gets him to kill the goblin king and he kills the goblin king and thats the end of the tale. I liked every bit once the action took place. I recomend this book to age ten to adult and i hope everyone likes this book and finds it exiting. From Jaha"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read both the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit twice. And, like a scant few other people, I have seen the movies (note the sarcasm). In addition to this, I have read numerous Terry Brooks novels which, in my opinion, greatly rival Tolkien in originality and depth.With my esteemed credentials out of the way, here goes...I feel that of all the aforementioned books, the Hobbit is the best. It is an easier read and isn't nearly as deep as LotR, but this does not take away from it in any way. Trust me, I am a HUGE fan of LotR (movies and books), but the Hobbit is a much better read. It has a much more carefree feel to it, as the hero is a bit of a pansy and clutz. While it is obviously fictional due to the Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves, and Dragons involved, it has a ring of truth to it in that the hero, much like us, oftentimes will be afraid in situations that any normal person would be afraid in. He is no superman.LotR, while I greatly enjoyed it, seemed at times to drag on at times. This is due to the fact that there several tales going on at once, and while it leaves cliffhangers, the transition is often slow. With the Hobbit, I felt that everything was very fresh. There was just one main story and this story was told with enough, but not too much, detail.Many consider the Hobbit to be a great precurser/intro to the LotR. However, I feel that the Hobbit is great as simply a stand-alone novel. After I read the Hobbit, it was several years before I read LotR. I never felt like I was missing something, and as a matter of fact, I didn't even know a thing about LotR before I read it (this was years before the movie). In my mind, the ring was a trinket and Bilbo's tale was done.If your looking for a fun read that is just a little different than that lastest New York Time's Bestseller, then check out the Hobbit. I would give it 6 out of 5 stars, but that is not an option."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I can still remember the first time I heard this book. My grandfather read it to me when I was 2 years old, and from hen on, I love all things Tolkien.I later read it myself when I was 4, and got even more into the word of Middle Earth.This is a novel all young children should read or even hear as it brings out just imagery and wonder. It would help children to become better writers and want to read other stories.The poems are at times beautiful, fun, creepy but all around magical. And the journey that Bilbo takes can be a example to children that stepping out of themselves can be a wonderful learning experience.Also, it's a story that parents can have enjoy reading with or to their children like my grandfather did to me. It gives great family time while helping your child find a new side to themselves."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is good for beging to the end.This book is the best book of all of the lord of the rings books. I will racomend this to enyone that likes to read about fantacy and adventures. If you have not read this book you dont know what your missing. This book tell you how Bilbo get the ring and how he uses the ring in the book.

Buy it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Whereas other reviews have focused on Tolkien's excellent story, I want to recommend Alan Lee's fantastic illustrations. Lee was one of two Tolkien illustrators called by Peter Jackson for the making of the trilogy film, The Lord of the Rings. His brilliance shines through in the recreation of Rivendell and the warm feel of Hobbiton. As a life-long fan of the Lord of the Rings, I have never been disappointed by Lee's interpretation of a scene or character. His artistic skill hits the mark dead center every time on every concept. In fact, this is one artist of a few (if not the only one) who are officially recognized by Tolkien's estate as a bard of Middle Earth. Therefore, the illustrations in this beautiful edition of a great book by the 20th century's best author are bound to appeal to you as you read it. In this book, the arguing trolls are just as I've imagined them, and the dwarves are like real people, not plump bodies with noses the size of their heads. The eagles, too, are glorious. I heartily recommend this edition of Tolkien's wonderful fantasy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you like action and adventure then get ready to jump into the world of middle earth, (but middle earth is infested with evil things) like,orcs,dragons,goblins,and Belroc a demon from the anchint world.

But there are good things to who defend the people of evil like the elves of elrond the dwarves of morlia and the men of middle earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"WARNING- CONTAINS SPOILERS!The Hobbit was a very interesting story that I somewhat enjoyed. Please dont take any offense to my opinion, for they are not directed to offend anyone else. Tolkien had an extremley strong beginning.Learning about Bilbo and all the dwarves really drew me into the story. I absolutely loved the detail the author put in all the characters. It really helped paint a picture for me to capture the essence of the story. As the story continued on, my excitement started to linger off. I wasn't as excited about the dwarves and Bilbo. I think those challenges they faced definitely could had a stronger build up to that point where the problem comes into effect.The one thing that upset me the most was the ending. Throughout the entire story the author talks about Bilbo facing the dragon alone. You can assume that something will happen to the dwarves that caused Bilbo to defeat Smaug single handed. The truth of the matter is, the dwarves sent Bilbo in alone because they were cowards and didn't want to do the dirty work. Then some random guy named Bard from the lake town ends up defeating Smaug and throws the whole story out of whack. The dwarves are clueless for a long time about the death of Smaug, and the switch of tenses can definitely end up confusing the reader.All in the entire of the story as a whole fits the fantasy genre. There are high and low points but the journey the characters face, and the overall moral of the story will leave a lasting impression on me."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Being among the last people in America to read this book, as I well may be, makes this a rather difficult book to judge, particularly since it is already recognized as a classic and has been published in many, including collector, editions. Add to that the fact that, with such a long and exalted history and with so many previous reviews, it is readily apparent that nobody really cares, nor should they care, what I may think of this book. Nevertheless: I read it. So, like Bilbo Baggins, I must persist.Let me begin by saying that I have never read, nor do I ever expect to read, another tome by an author with such a fertile and expansive imagination. The depth and detail of his prose is truly astonishing. Using his imagination, he has woven an intricate mythical tale of trials, tribulations, despair, fear, struggle, and ultimate success such that one would almost believe that the author, himself, must surely have been there and experienced the scenes which he portrays.What struck me most about the book, however, was that the author's creativity allowed him to take so many well known characters from mythology -- trolls, elves, dwarves, goblins, etc. -- and weave them into a cohesive story with no loose ends sticking out, but he always did it with an unexpected twist. The golden ring which allowed Bilbo Baggins to disappear at will is a good example. Strangely enough, Baggins could not be seen at night, but, while still invisible during daylight, he had to be careful because his shadow could still be seen. The trolls are another: fearsome at night or in the dark but turned to stone if touched by sunlight. The author's ability to empathize with his characters also seems uncanny. The dreaded Gollum, for example, who lived for so long in absolute blackness and solitude that he became two distinct personalities and spoke to and answer himself in riddles. The final twists came at the end when quite unexpectedly, after all their struggles, Baggins and his companions didn't even get to do battle with the fearsome dragon they had come so far to slay. And the coup de grace came with the unexpected events at Baggins homecoming, which also seemed quite fitting and brought a chuckle or two.Needless to say: I was well impressed with this book and would recommend it, especially to younger readers. (My daughter says that she was tasked to read it in the fifth or sixth grade.) To me this is the ultimate in creative writing and always with an added twist."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Doug Anderson does a wonderful job fleshing out background information,explaining Tolkien's mythology, presenting a wide range of art works and much more in a format that is easy to read and easy to use.

Yes children can read this book and it is fun. How ever there is a lot more to this book than a cute story. And it has all the depth of the other Tolkien works with the exception of being shorter.Many people look at this story as a prequel to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", where in reality it is a stand-alone story with a perfectly good beginning, middle, and end. When you read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" there is enough description to forgo \\"The Hobbit.\\" Personally, I find that reading The Lord of the Rings first gave me the in-depth background to better appreciate The Hobbit.Many of the creatures and adventures will put you on the edge of your seat. You will recognize the personalities and grow along will Bilbo as he faces new challenges as he learns to deal with life.A good book to read first would be \\"The Power of Myth\\" by Joseph Campbell.

But the hobbit is a continuation of the lord of the rings but the setting is it actually before the lord of the rings. The hobbit is such a wonderful book, everything thing about it is great not just the plot but the also the setting. Tolkien creates this whole New World for all the readers to explore as they go through the book.The \`hobbit' is about...well hobbits, hobbits are half human size and the most unmagical being and wouldn't do anything unexpected.

I like this book, this is because it is in a whole different world where anytyhing could happen. It is a story with many high points, and suspension. Many parts where victory seems hopeless but they always get out.

(robes, large pointy hat, long white beard, magical staff)go into this book with an open mind, rand emember that is was not intended to be a great piece of literature, but rather a good story for younger readers, and you will love it.excellent book to read with your kids. or, if you want to remember what it was like to be one."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have been told that i am sad for reading the Hobbit.

The charactor development is unreal, you feel like you are right there with Bilbo and Frodo and all the other wonderful and dreadfully scary creatures that Tolkien has created. I must and I will insist that if you read this book, you have to read the Lord of the Rings. It takes what happens to Bilbo into another 3, more wonderful that the first, books of adventure, deceite, treachery, and magic"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is soooo good!!

True, this is a world of myth and fantasy, but it is not another world I speak of. It is our own world in another time- a time long ago, near forgotten save by a few, a time when elves walked the earth and small, manlike creatures called hobbits lived in holes in the ground, when dragons flew through the blue skies and orcs infested the mountains.

Master story teller J.R.R. Tolkien (John Ronald Reuel Tolkien) has created a compelling tale with a fast-page turning efffect. The Hobbit tells a story of long forgotten races of beings in an imaginary time and place. Particularly of a lonely hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who dicurages an adventure of any kind, but ends up finding himself on an endless journey fighting giant spiders, man-eating goblins, and fire-breathing dragons. I highly recomend this book to fantasy readers of all ages. A must read"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is the first to a series of five books on Middle Earth. After I read The Hobbit, I just had to get hold of the trilogy, The Lord of the Rings. The language is clear, simple, yet passionate and definitely romantic. The road to Middle Earth is laid before the reader; all he has to do is take it. The journey, it would seem, ends with the boat to beyond the sea in the 3d volume but to fully claim a share in Tolkien's Middle Earth is to go back to the 'history' of this magical world. Tolkien provides such a history in a 5th book which is just as, or even more, magical than the first four books. And to think that this fantastic journey deep into Middle Earth (and into one's own magic) starts with the road just outside the steps of a small hobbit hole in The Hobbit"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first read the Hobbit as a young boy. This book more so than any other that I read as a child opened my mind to the vastness of humanities imagination. The purity of J.R.R. Tolkiens fantasy allows the reader to become totally immersed in the fantasy and adventures of Mr. Bilbo Baggins, Esquire. From Dragons to Wizards the reader develops a sense of comraderie with the characters as the overcome foes and their own fears and failings.Now as a father of four children I have taken each one of my kids into this wonderful world. As each of my childred reached the age of five I would carefully tuck them in and then together we would imbark upon this most amazing adventure. Re-reading this book every five years or so has only brought closer to the characters and the story itself. But perhaps the greatest joy is seeing the excited look on the face of my child as Bilbo first tricks theTrolls or when he first steals the ring of Gollum in the caves of the Goblins and certainly the climatic event of the burglary into the den of the sleeping Smaug, the dragon who awaits all of them under the mountain. This is a book rich with adventure and fantastic episodes like no other. Truly this is a book to grow up with and I would venture to say -- to stay young with through the eyes of a child."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"&quot;The Hobbit&quot; is the greatest novel ever penned. With characters you feel like you've always known and a plot full of mischief, you won't be able to put the book down until it's finished. Filled with wonderful illustrations, this edition of Tolkien's masterpiece breathes life to the story in a most unbelievable way; the characters are vivacious and the colors grab your eye creating an excellent blend of imagination visual stimulation. On a scale of one-to-ten, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a resounding TEN.You cannot read better fiction!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The novel, \\"The Hobbit\\", by J.R.R. Tolkien is a great story of a small individual from a small human like people called the hobbits. He is taken on a great adventure with dwarfs. He encounters a creature called Gollum and finds a ring that makes the wearer invisible. He goes through caves, meets humans and has a close call with a dragon called Smaug.The book is a fun fantasy adventure story with a great deal of depth to the world it takes place in.

I recently reread it and it was better reading the second time around."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My father brought me and my siblings up on Tolkien.

My New Year's resolution was to finally do just that - with the help of Rob Inglis. His unabridged reading of the story on CD engages the reader so much more with the use of inflection, characterization and personality. It was surprising to discover a few of the words being read were different in my book, and in three places whole sentences were missing. Still, I am currently in the middle of the book and can safely say that I will repeat this experience once a year for the rest of my life! I love the story, the narration, and it is time well spent. As logic would dictate I look forward to reading the Lord of the Rings along to Rob Inglis' unabridged narration on CD as well!

I loved the illustrations and color."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" J.R.R. Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper.And years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was seen by anyone outside Tolkien's circle, Middle Earth was first introduced to readers. \\"The Hobbit\\" is simpler and less epic than the trilogy that followed it, but Tolkien's brilliant writing, magical world and pleasantly stodgy hero bring a special life to this early fantasy classic.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life, in a luxurious hobbit hole under a hill (\\"it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\"). He's the picture of dull respectability.But his life is turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield. They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king. Even minor characters like Beorn, Elrond and the menacing Smaug are given plenty of dimension.\\"The Hobbit\\" started as a fluke, grew into a bedtime story, and became one of the best fantasy stories in literary history -- a charming adventure in the time that never was. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love this book now i can read it whenever i want, fast speedy delivery, great shape."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I purchased these for gifts for some wonderful young artists who performed outstandingly in a children's theatre production of The Hobbit.

Yay hobbit it is awesome"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This was a slow read for me, but that is because I haven't been in the spirit to read. However, be that as it may, it was a good read. It started out with a Hobbit (or a small creature) by the name of Bilbo Baggins, and a wizard by the name of Gandalf. The dwarves were in pursuit to avenge their \\"treasure,\\" and needed a \\"burglar\\" (Bilbo Baggins referred by the wise Gandalf). In order to get their treasure, they ran into trolls, elves, wood elves, received some resources for their long journey, and came upon lake people who also aided them in their adventure. At the end, in order to avenge their treasure, that rightfully belonged to them so long ago, they had to fight a dragon named Smaug that doesn't so easily forget when danger is upon him, and he has a very good smell for dwarves. Although they ran into troubles along the way, and they appeared to have gotten their treasure, read more to see whether it was worth it in the end. And see what happens when greed is your number one focus on the prize at hand. Also see how Bilbo Baggins' \\"burgar expertise\\" may save more trouble than is worth in his reward to be received at the end of this journey. Enjoy this Reading Adventure!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Shipped in a timely fashion. The book is an older edition so the pages were yellowed, but that is normal.

I would recommend the Hobbit to everyone who has not yet read it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"There have been few collections that have been held in such high international regard than the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings novels. Even before the LotR movies, Tolkien was synonymous with THE original classic fantasy works and now they're absolutely huge. With this set, you'll get to see what the fuss is all about.The Hobbit is a prequel to the LotR. It is considered a children's tale and indeed Tolkien wrote it for his children. However, it's still very enjoyable for the adult and forms a great, easy introduction the the Middle-Earth universe. It tells the tale of how Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf the wizard and a bunch of dwarves set out to &quot;rescue&quot; a treasure-trove of gold from Smaug the dragon. The journey takes, to my recollection, something in the space of a year. In the course they experience all the classic elements found in a fantasy world - giant monsters, weird and wonderful characters, fantastical battles, spirited and magical helpers and loathsome dungeons. And all this told in the most easygoing and kind-hearted prose imaginable.For more serious fans of the Middle-Earth universe, the linkups to LotR give the tale an extra twist of flavour. It is here that the Ring is first encountered, and it is here that we first feel the breath of the enemy...If you've seen the movies and want to read the books, The Hobbit is a great place to start."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a great book.

There are many fantasy characters in \\"The Hobbit\\" book. And they are: trolls, orcs, wizards, elves, dwarves, a hobbit (which is a halfling), a dragon, and much more.

Bilbo Baggin's long, enthralling, and extreme adventure with the great wizard, Gandolf, and his thirteen dwarves, will make you want to read more and more. You might even finish the book in a day or two. As Gandolf and the dwarves persuade him to come with him to fight the evil dragon, Smog, and take back the gold that was once all of theirs, they are about to encounter the most exiting part of their lives.Every page of this book is a dose of excitement and action. The great part about the book is that the rising action keeps building and building drastically until the end. The Hobbit is a must read for all fantasy lovers. But even if you aren't a fantasy lover, you will still marvel this amazing book.By Will"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit combines an immense amount of creativity and imagination with a magnificent skill of conceiving such a storyline. Those who like all sorts of fictional novels probably enjoyed reading this book, however, it may have not been all that great for the trekkies who are more into sci-fi.JRR Tolkien has a distinct way of describing the characters and environments in his books. Since he is very descriptive, the scenes are fairly easy to get a handle on despite the fact that the book was written more than seventy years ago and that he writes with a unique European dialect, as does JK Rowling, the author of the famous Harry Potter book series. Both books are of British origin.The author of The Hobbit also has a knack for symbolism. The gold that the main characters are after represents happiness, and all the obstacles they have to face, such as the evil goblins, Mirkwood Forest, and of course, the dragon at the very end, represent the many hardships and barriers we all must face in our pursuit of happiness. On the other hand, there are also many things that help us along that path, like Beorn the skin-changer, or the elves of the Last Homely House.To sum up, this was an all around great book. By reading this, you can escape to a world where you have a good idea of how it all ends, but not down to every last detail. Those parts are up to the author. Nevertheless, every good book has those usual twists and turns."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Kindle version of this wonderful title includes JRRTolkien's drawings of key scenes (Beorn's Hall, the Troll's camp).

It certainly whet my appetite for the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I re-read this book (I could not find my original copy) and again enjoyed the tale. It refreshed the story in my mind as I look forward to seeing the movie by Peter Jackson, due to be released in a few days. This whole story is the pre-courser to the Lord of the Rings, and help that trilogy make more sense as you now know what adventures lead up to that follow-on masterpiece. J.R.R.

Tolkien despised allegory. Yet \\"The Hobbit\\" contains one of the greatest allegorical phrases ever: \\"the unexpected party.\\" Yes, life is a journey, a quest if you will--but it is also (when lived to the full) an unexpected party. And so it is that Bilbo Baggins is spurred on to leave his warm Hobbit hole to go on one of the most exciting and entertaining journeys in all of literature.Tolkien never thought this book would even be successful, much less attain its almost mythic status. In part, he was trying to write a story for children (and it is problematic even in this respect). No one however, can deny what a strange, original creation it is.The story takes place in a fully formed world (Middle Earth) of Tolkien's own imagining. It rings with the sound of ancient music and poetry. The elves, the dwarves, and men have all kinds of history behind them to give them depth. Only after finishing the Hobbit did Tolkien envision the importance of the Ring.What \\"The Hobbit\\" is--more than just being a prelude to the tale of the One Ring--is a great adventure story. An ancient people goes seeking to reclaim its home, a Hobbit discovers that he has more in him than even he ever expected, a people are freed from darkness at great cost, and something is found that was lost...all under the supervision of a mysterious wizard.This is a tale of good's triumph over many evils. A story about a seemingly forgettable little creature and his impact upon great events--a realization that: \\"So comes snow after fire, and even dragons have their ending!\\"I give \\"The Hobbit\\" my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit by J.R. R. Tolkien is a great book. In the book a hobbit is joined by thirteen dwarves and a wizard. They go on many adventures and unfortunately they run into a few misfortunes, but someone always saves them from the trouble. On the way through their adventure they meet some mean characters. Goblins, wargs, spiders and huge stone giants are some of the mean creatures that they meet up with. There are many surprises in this book. At the end of the book there is a very cool thing that happens.I think that this is a good book. I enjoyed reading it very much some days I couldn't even put the book down. This book is probably my favorite book I've ever read. I would give this book five stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read \\"The Hobbit\\" a number of years ago. When the first movie of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was about to be released as a movie, I decided to re-aquaint myself with Bilbo and Gandalf. It is a good book to introduce you to \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" In it you learn how Bilbo comes in possession of the ringThe plot gives you a feel for the world and characters that will take you into the \\"Rings\\" trilogy. Hobbit is full of action and adventure. There are a few times when you experiance author's intrusion. It didn't bother me, and durning those times I pictured Tolkien sitting and smoking his pipe while he told the story. I think the author was a master story teller of enchanting tales."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A father with his middle school son asked me recently what I thought of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; movie. I gave my two thumbs up and asked if they have ever read Tolkein. They hadn't. Our local church library had copies of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. I encouraged them to read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; aloud before entering &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. I have read most of Tolkein's fiction aloud to my sons, including our own hardback 50th Anniversary edition of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, &quot;The Simarillion&quot;, and several other works as well. Tolkein reads well. Several years ago, we unplugged our TV and started regularly reading to our kids. This has been one of the best parenting decisions we've ever made! Turn off the TV this week and read aloud to your kids. If you've taken them to see &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot; (I would advise children over the age of 10), then read Tolkein to them. Your children's imagination sparked by Tolkein's genius descriptive writing will create an even more detailed and wonderful Middle Earth than the blockbuster movie was able to create. Encourage their imagination to fill the big screen of their minds with Tolkein's epic tale, beginning with &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. This marvelous tale has always been my favorite adventure story.For two books with many more creative ideas for parents, look into &quot;The Family Cloister&quot; and &quot;The Christian Family Toolbox&quot;, both by David Robinson and available on Amazon.com."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you've never smelled cinnamon rolls on a frosty morning or have never lain in bed on the sleeping porch inhaling the perfume of night-blooming jasmine or if you've never read The Hobbit then you do not know the majesty of imagination.Do not be fooled! Though ostensibly a children's book there is a veil of darkness about it that only adults or precocious children can appreciate. Tolkien himself admitted adding the trappings of a child's fantasy to what was a basically dark and forboding story for fear of being laughed at for producing an adult fantasy. The Hobbit is a sweet, dark, and intoxicating work of fantasy that enrobes the reader in a parallel world of mythical events and beings that closely echo the themes of life necessary to adulthood. The Hobbit warns of power used for material gain and the horrors of greed and waste but also teaches the value of being true to one's self and friends. That The Hobbit succeeds so transcendently well that the reader barely realizes he or she has been reading a modern parable stands as a testament to the genius of Tolkien and his sheer love of the English language.When Tolkien began writing Lord of the Rings years later the early chapters were of a tone similar to The Hobbit yet, as he progressed, the tone changed to a more adult and complex use of language as the story began to progress. Tolkien fans say that The Hobbit is to be read as a child and Lord of the Rings to be read as an adolescent. I whole-heartedly agree. These books are life as we live it and The Hobbit is an outstanding introduction to the lessons, bitter, enobling, and ultimately wisening, that we must all learn or become but shadows of what we have the potential to be.I'm sure you know there is a wizard, a dragon, eagles, and furry-footed Hobbits, but there are also fearsome monsters, werebears, haughty elves, greedy humans, and even greedier dwarves. Evil in The Hobbit doesn't disappear when dear Mr. Baggins goes home to petty and avaracious relatives thinking him dead and auctioning off his home and household goods. And that is the greatest triumph of the book as I see it. For evil in Tolkien's world is never wholly put away but is instead resisted and overcome with the lessons of life gained in the struggle. All of us have our moments of dread, fear, and temptation. Listen carefully to Tolkien's quiet but enduring message and you will never be alone no matter what life gives you.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; isn't just a book you give your children to read, it's a lesson in the labors of life in the adult world."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a tale of gold, dwarves, an evil dragon, hobbits and the wonder of it all. After reading the book for the third time, it is amazingly still enjoyable. The style that J.R.R. Tolkien uses to write this book is so lively that it makes the readers feel like they are part of the adventure walking along side Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf and the dwarves .Tolkien crafts an interesting world inhabited by Dwarves, Hobbits, Men, Elves and others. The Hobbits like peace, quiet and good food. Adventure and traveling to far-off places is something they would really rather avoid if they could.Bilbo Baggins is one such Hobbit. He has lived 50 years in good comfort and does not wish to change that. Then, Gandalf (a wizard) arrives and invites him on an adventure with the company of a clan of dwarves. Bilbo is initially fearful and dismissive of the whole affair but he gradually becomes, in many ways, the leader of their troop.When a person starts this book, it will be very hard for them to put it down until they have finished it. This is because Tolkien presents his characters with such a charisma that it makes the readers want to delve deeper into the story to find out what happens next to the adventurers. He also presents such seemingly insurmountable obstacles that those that have been keeping up with the situations will have to read on to find out how the characters escape this one.The style is easy to follow and the story is straight forward with some twists. The book is good in the old-fashioned sense of story telling; there are no political agendas here but rather simply courage and the virtues of old. It is refreshing to read a book of battle, heroism, good and evil in our times of moral confusion and weakness.No matter how many times someone reads it, it will never be enough. There will always be things that were missed and caught the next time around, which is what makes THE HOBBIT such a great story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I know J.R.R. Tolkien is mostly known for the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but this book is a masterpiece in itself!! It is full of adventures, magical beings and knowledge. Professor Tolkein wrote it for his kids, and you can feel the love that went into creating this story as you read.I have read it twice, once when I was 13, and now as an adult, and I really do feel like this is a book for all ages! Both parents and kids will enjoy reading this, especially if it is together.The book is about Bilbo Baggins, a very unambitious, quiet and serious hobbit, who embarks on a very long, dangerous and unexpected adventure with a company of dwarves and a wizard. Along the way they encounter trolls, abandoned woods, elves, goblins, a dragon, a riddle loving monster called Gollum, giant spiders, underground passages, mountains and more!In the end, Bilbo Baggins discovers that he is capable of a lot more than what he thought he was, and discovers the gift of friendship, loyalty , laughter and song!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a wonderful story.You will love the characters and the adventures that they have.

THIS IS A MUST READ! p.s.If you want to read this book you have to have a good deal of time on your hands."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"How nice to pick up The Hobbit again as an adult. Even years later, this book is delightful. It's such a pleasure to follow Bilbo and the dwarves to the Lonely Mountain, and it's a pleasure to read some of the other reviewers, kids who've read the story over and over like I did. This is a great edition, the Alan Lee drawings and paintings are gorgeous, and he appeals to the Tolkien-phile with incredible attention to the details of the story. Two quibbles: one map is in the beginning of the book and the other at the end - how odd, it keeps the reader flipping back and forth. Why not just put them both up front together. Second, some pages fell out of my new book even before I'd read them. That's a bit disappointing when you've paid a bit more for the fancy illustrated hardcover volume."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"THE HOBBIT is a must-read for everyone who loves fantasy and adventure in a novel. In it, Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit (a good natured creature about half the height of humans) sets out on an adventure with a band of 13 dwarves and a wizard. This is a journey to regain the treasure stolen from the dwarves by a dragon. In it, Bilbo comes across elves, evil goblins, angry wolves, and much more. In the end, when they finally reach the dragon, surprising events occur that put a twist in the well-thought-out plot. The book is described so well you feel as if you are part of the adventure. You also get to know Bilbo and his friends as if you really met them. As a delightful prelude to Tolkien's famous trilogy THE LORD OF THE RINGS, it can be enjoyed by both adults and older children. Personally, it is one of my favorites, and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"While Tolkien was nowhere near as excellent of a writer at this point as he would become years later with the Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit is still an enjoyable introduction to Middle Earth. The story is more simple and the flow is more like reading a fable or children's story to me compared with the more serious and high fantasy style of the Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit is more fast paced. There is more action happening all the time but it's not as atmospheric. This is the story of Bilbo joining a band of dwarves to go get treasure from a dragon named Smaug. Along the way he braves many dangers such as orcs, trolls, giant spiders and meets Gollum and finds a ring. It's a good prelude but nothing amazing. However, the book does hold a special place for me because I found a copy in my parents book collection in the basement when I was a kid and it became the first book I ever read. I owe Tolkien a thank you for hooking me on books."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've loved this story since I was a kid, decided to re-read it on kindle. Wish the runes & maps were a little better formatted"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Well, who can criticize this Tolkien classic? The Hobbit is a fun read for kids or adults. The adventures of Bilbo Baggins, his trek across the Misty Mountains, through Mirkwood and finally to the Lonely Mountain, where he and the Dwarves face Smaug the Dragon will certainly be entertaining for years to come. Now what did become of that magic ring of his?Plot Summary: Bilbo Baggins is overtaken by a party of Dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield and Gandalf. He is employed as their \\"burglar\\", as they head for the Misty Mountains to rescue the treasure from the Dragon Smaug. On the way they encounter 3 Trolls that try to eat them, but the Trolls end up getting turned into stone, and then they are abducted by Goblins in the Misty Mountains. There Bilbo gets momentarily lost, finds the creature Smeagol and the lost Ring of Power. Escaping Gollum with the Ring and reuniting with the Dwarves on the other side of the Misty Mountains, Bilbo and the Dwarves will then become lost in Mirkwood and captured by Elves (all except Bilbo that is). Bilbo helps the Dwarves escape their Elvish prison in barrels that are sent down the river towards Lake Town and the Lonely Mountain, where Smaug lives. Finally arriving at Lake Town, Bilbo and the Dwarves approach the lonely mountain, where they enter via a secret door. Bilbo discovers a key weakness in Smaug's armor. He also discovers the Arkenstone, a precious gem of Thorin's ancestors. Smaug's weakness is learned by Bard (a noble man), who slays the Dragon as the Dragon attacks Lake Town. This causes Elf, Dwarf, and Man all to want Smaug's unprotected treasure, which is (mostly) Thorin's by ancestral right. But Thorin proves too greedy and selfish in the final moments, and will not share his treasure, even when just claims are made to it by Bard. Unbeknownst to Thorin, Bilbo delivers the Arkenstone to Bard, as leverage to negotiate and end the siege and stalemate at the Lonely Mountain. Thorin is outraged. Matters come to a head when the three armies of Elf, Dwarf, and Man are assailed by evil Goblins (Orcs) and Wargs. The Goblins and Wargs are defeated, in part due to the warnings of Gandalf, but Thorin Oakenshield is mortally wounded. Thorin apologizes to Bilbo for his prior anger at him, and dies. Bilbo Baggins then returns to Hobbiton, with 2 chests of Smaug's treasure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This was a gift and the recepient was very pleased.

I highly recommend this particular narrator for this book. It's the best I've found and I tend to be pretty picky with my favorite authors, of which Tolkein is one. Rob Inglis has a wonderful reading voice, varies his tone and delivery for the different characters & creatures (especially Gollum!) very well, and he does a wonderful job of singing the songs that Tolkein wrote for the dwarves, elves, etc. I will never listen to another version of this again. I am slowly acquiring each of the books on CD, as they are not available to download yet (which may be the one turnoff for some), but it is worth it!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit has now passed from popular fiction into literature that can be distinguished and honored beyond its genre. Which is amazing, really. Our notions of literature are usually reserved for those dusty old thick & smelly books our high school teachers tried to make us read. But this is it too. A story, but not just any story. Characters, but characters that are destined to become legendary. The Hobbit was indeed the first written. I think it is the most approachable and has the most crisp and concise language of all the JRRT books, and is a pleasure to read again and again. If you happen to come upon a biographical documentary of the author, it well worth viewing. The background of his service in WWI lends a greater nuance and a whole other level of depth to The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. In fact, you can't think of Mr. Frodo at the end of L of the R the same way again, but as returning soldier from the war to end all wars. On the whole, read the paper back if you must, but then, later, you may want a nice hard-copy to keep for those times you sit by the fire as you read and travel back to the Shire."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've read and been a fan of the fantasy genre for a relatively long time - about twenty years at this point. It is only now that I am getting around to reading Tolkien's stuff. The Hobbit is a great read, it's fun, simple, and has a good story. I'm more familiar with the LoTR stuff than this book due to the movies, and so it was nice to read the \\"prequel\\" so-to-speak. I liked JRRT's writing style - and his world-building, while rudimentary here, I think, was great. I can appreciate it for the huge breakthrough it was at the time.

Just as Bilbo probably felt, I was in a state of comfort when I was reading about the Burrow. From the moment the journey began, I felt as if I had become a part of the journey. I was able to envision every mountain, hillside, road, and creature, thanks to the powerful descriptions by J.R.R.

Tolkein has always been a great writer, but this I believe to be one of his best pieces, with an interesting story, action and adventure, and everything a good sci-fi story needs. All combined to create an excellent story. The story begins with Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf, 2 of the main characters. Frustrated with Gandalf, Bilbo invites Gandalf to breakfast or brunch on a later day, little did he know, Gandalf would accept the next day, bringing with him 13 dwarves. The dwarves plan to retake their family?s home, The Lonely Mountain, stolen by the great dragon Smaug. Early the next day, they depart, on their way to the Misty Mountains, their traveling slow and weary. Needing rest from the elements, and advice for a path through the mountains, they stop at the last homely house of Rivendell. There, Elrond, an Elf of Rivendell, shows them a path through the mountains, and also gives them supplies. On they?re route through the mountains, two storms collide, and they need shelter, only to find themselves taken into a goblin clan?s cave. The party successfully escapes, but without food or supplies. They then make their way to one of Gandalf?s friends. He gives them shelter, and sends them on their way through a forest, the only obstacle left between them and he mountain. The party faces many things in the forest, and is imprisoned by the wood elves. After escape, they make their way to a town, where supplied, they finally make their way through the desolation of Smaug to the mountain. They finally make it there, and inside, when Smaug is killed when attacking the town.

You must read this book before other people take them all.By Christian"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is by far the most exciting, adventourous, and humorous J.R.R. Tolkien book on the market. Being a huge fan of Tolkien's work, I have read just about every book there is to offer, and have not found one yet that is better than The Hobbit. The book starts by introducing you to a boring, normal hobbit that has no idea he will someday be one of the most famous hobbits ever. While sitting down to his usually noon tea he gets a knock on the door and opens it to find a pair of dwarves standing outside. Being his freindly self he invites them in for a cup of tea. Before long the door has been opened 6 times revealing a total of 12 dwarves that are all seeming to be of some relation. By the time Bilbo (the hobbit) knows what is going on, his tookish side gets the best of him, and he is swept out the door on an adventure of a lifetime. On the way Bilbo discovers their quest is to kill off a dragon that has taken their ancestors mountain along with all the treasures inside. Bilbo is quite pleased when he finds out his reward will be one fourteenth of treasure. Along the way, however, the group faces many hardships, dangerous encounters, and deadly battles. This book keeps you on your toes and guessing what is going to happen next. Unlike other Tolkien books I found it to be quite humouros. There are not as many battles as in the lord of the rings series, but there are just as many near death encounters. Overall this was probably the best book I have read in months, because of Tolkien's ability to make you believe that this could have actually happend. If you have read any other Tolkien book and enjoyed it, you will love this book! My advice to you is to purchase The Hobbit today and discover the mystical world of Middle Earth!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was never in to Lord of the Rings Or J.R.R. Tolkien until I saw the movie. I didn't like the movie very much until my friend brought it over and let me hold it. I instantly fell in love with it. And felt that I was almost forced to Buy Tolkien's Literary works. After much and much hesitition, I knew that I was bound to like the book so I said why not go all out and buy this GREEN LEATHERETTE HOBBIT, AND THE LORD LORD OF THE RINGS RED LEATHERETTE.editions of the book.I read the Hobbit in 6 days. The book starts off very entertaing but later on becomes rather dry. However not dry enough to make it unbearable.The Green Leatherette edition is 317 pages, and about 4 full color glossy drawings, and as well as about 10 or more other drawings. The Drawings are not bad, especailly since they were drawn by Tolkien himself who is known for his writing skills not his drawing skills. The book becomes dry when they leave the wood elf spot, and they have to go through mirkwood, where there are many spiders and other creatures. The book then picks up later when they arrive at Loneley mountain, the end of the book, where they have to steal the treasures from the Dragon Smaug who guards the treasures. Which is about 60 pages of the book, completely on the part with Smaug and before Smaug dies.The book I would reccommend to people between the ages of 5-?? the book is very good, and should be read by all readers of all ages.The book has illustrations but does not need them to help the story progress, I could litterally sit there and draw out the things described with out being bored, as other books do.The book has nearly no violence and is a very light hearted adventure of a \\"hobbit\\" Bilbo Baggins who never went on any adventures or unexpected events, but with his meeting up with the Wizard \\"Gandalf The Grey\\" he tells Bilbo about going on a quest that will make him rich. The next day, Gandalf comes back with the Dwarves who Bilbo will spend his adventure with and tells him everything(or not so much as everything).The quest starts simple enough and seems like a typical fantasy( which J.R.R. Tolkien is the author who spawned the genre as a whole) Bilbo is hired as a burglar to accompany a group of thirteen Dwarves to the Loneley mountain. Once at the Loneley mountain Bilbo will have to pilfer the Dragon Smaug of all his un needed treasures. The book starts simple but ends with many hardships and is very enjoyable, readers 5-12 highly reccomended,but other age groups don't expect much violence."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was just about the most fun reading experience I have ever had. I'm not sure whether the effect stemmed from the great quality of the book or from my particular developmental stage when I read it. Probably a bit of both. It's really just the simple story of a bourgeosis everyman who is thrown into a world of dragons, goblins, wizards, and dwarves and is forced to discover the greatness within himself. The plot arch might be that of Beowulf, substituting a typical well-to-do Englishman for the mighty thewed hero of the legend. The splendor is in Tolkien's wizardly story-telling and poetic vision. The story is worked to a minute perfection on every single page, every single sentence, even. Each chapter is punctuated with songs, or poems, making the Hobbit a true prose romance, in the tradition of the earlier great fantasists, such as William Morris, Lewis Carrol, Kipling, or ER Eddison. And every song is good.The Hobbit evokes a sense of nostalgia in this particular reader, a nostalgia for a lost pre modern world of primordial Northern England and Europe. As CS Lewis wrote somewhere, no other writer is able to capture the feel of Norse mythology, its symbols and moods, and weave them into a story the way Tolkien does. Tolkien employs his own private mythology, later published as the Silmarillion, to give the setting a sense of historical depth. For example, at one point the heroes find swords \\"forged during the goblin wars of Gondolin,\\" foreshadowing a subsequent encounter with goblins. Each encounter brims with invention and unique imagination seldom found in any other author, but at the same time invoking an homage to the other great heroic stories of the world. The eyrie of the giant eagles recalls the story of Sinbad in the rocs' nest. The riddle game with Golum, one of the most inventive scenes in any story, reminds one of the Sphinx from Greek mythology. And each riddle is brilliant.All Tolkien's works are incomparable, but the Hobbit is his greatest, I think, mainly for its simplicity. It lacks the Manichean overblownness of the Lord of the Rings or the Silmarillion. Here is not a cataclysmic war between absolute good and absolute evil, but a simple quest to get some loot from a dragon. The story is thusly more like real life, and closer to primeval mythologies of Europe in that there is no Zoroastrian conception of good and evil.The Hobbit has some real life relevance too, I suspect. I think there is a message in the Hobbit, about a cataclysmic world event, but to recognize it requires one to have an encompassing understanding of twentieth century history, a familiarity with Tolkien's own life (i.e. a sense of when the book was written), and penetrating awareness of the tropes of the fantasy genre. The story sort of picks up the thread started in the Worm Ouroboros, as pertaining to the allegory behind Gro and the ambassador. I've always wondered if any one else can answer the riddle of the Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" is the first story of Middle-Earth that was ever read by the masses. And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\").But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It's sillier and lighter, with less dignified Elves and Dwarves. But it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Much of the book involves Bilbo leading the stubborn dwarves through many dangers, and getting himself out of nasty situations such as spiders, trolls and a deadly riddling game. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty Tolkien was capable of -- and through it all is the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English than his later works, and the pace is a lot faster -- not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime.Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. He's supported by Thorin Oakenshield, the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. Crotchety wizard wizard, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter, but complex and sometimes menacing.\\"The Hobbit\\" was written for children, but adults can appreciate and enjoy it just as much. So read this book, then scoop up \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and continue reading. A timeless treasure and classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Rob Inglis narrates this book, and has distinct voices for the characters. He is not dry and does not read in a monotone like most narrators. I found it an enjoyable experience, second only to Jim Dale in the Harry potter series.As I said I'm picky... I would have given it a 5 star, but as the recording of the audio could be a bit better, and the CD's skip here and there throughout the story, it only gets 3 stars. The Audio levels go up and down a few times as well."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was a great story of the heroic journey of Bilbo Baggins. It is a part of the series The Lord of The Rings and is typically recommended to be read prior to the other three books. I thoroughly enjoyed reading nearly the entire story; there was hardly ever a part that even remotely let my mind wander elsewhere. I think that J.R.R. Tolkien did a fantastic job of capturing the reader's imagination and holding it there consistently throughout the entire book. This book has become a great staple in modern day literature and I definitely regret having not read it earlier in my life.The book began when Gandalf came to recruit Bilbo to go on an adventure with a tribe of 13 dwarves who had lost their treasure to a dragon. Bilbo was a great thief and Gandalf wanted his help to steal the treasure back. Initially Bilbo had no desire to leave his comfortable home in the Shire and said that he wouldn't go; he was too afraid to get out of his comfort zone. I think that this is a part of the book that people from today's world would definitely benefit from listening to; so many adults and teenagers are too comfortable with where they are right now and refuse to pursue anything even relatively difficult--no matter how rewarding. Sometimes the greatest things in life come at the greatest price.Eventually Bilbo agreed to go and help the dwarves, they met many obstacles along the way including trolls, goblins, monsters, spiders, and wargs. Gandalf rescued the crew from the trolls but as the story progressed we began to see Bilbo's true potential. Especially after Gandalf left and he had found a ring (whilst he was in a cave that he had gotten left behind in) that had powers which could turn him invisible. This made for easy attacks on the monster, spiders, goblins, and wargs that he met along the way. Finally after many trials and tribulations they all made it to the dragon and they were able to retrieve their treasure from beneath it and protect their prize from the greedy goblins that were in hot pursuit. Gandalf came and rescued them all, flying on the same eagles that had saved them earlier on in the book.I liked the ending of the book because Gandalf returned and rescued them; it was not exactly something that you expected and I am glad that the author brought the conclusion together in that way. All in all the plot was fantastic and the build up was impressive from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I originally picked up this edition so I would have a copy for my library, but this is a great tale. Why has Tolkien stuck with us all these decades? I still recall the slogan in the streets of San Francisco that \\"Frodo Lives\\" but never understood that until I read Lord of the Rings. But I digress.Gandalf the Gray, a wizard that the Hobbits look forward to coming by and showing a few of his tricks, recruits Bilbo Baggins to come with a troupe of dwarves to help recover their stolen treasure, guarded by the dragon Smaug, who has possession of the dwarf kingdom deep within the Lonely Mountain.I really enjoyed Tolkein's characterizations and creation of new races and beings, and hints at the affairs of the world that our little Bilbo can only dimly imagine. The Ring is introduced, found almost accidentally, and plays a larger role in the later novels in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.The banter of the dragon with Bilbo, its anger at being bated, its eventual fall and the dwarves return to power -- the battlefields come together against Men and dwarves thanks to old animosities coming to life. There's lots in this book. Battle, betrayal, love & honor, and poetry -- all written as if we were reading a translated chronicle of that which came before.What is our modern world but what we've built from the past? Tolkien shows the way, through fantasy, that we are larger than the sum of our parts.This particular edition is sadly free from illustrations except for a map or two at the end.Recommended:The Hobbit (Illustrated Edition)The Hobbit or There and Back Again. Illustrated by the AuthorMiddle Earth: The World of Tolkien Illustrated"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I picked this up on a Tolkien-high, interested in reading the graphic adaptation of the beloved novel it was based on. It had been a while since I read The Hobbit and had quite forgotten a few things, so I figured it was time to dive in.The biggest problem with this graphic novel is the amount of words per page. Comics almost never have multiple text boxes spread across a page, let alone a full novel's worth. Some pages were littered with these boxes, much to my annoyance. And some of these were ridiculously long. I don't think this would have bothered me as much if it were Tolkien's words, but Dixon lacks the charm Tolkien had.On the other hand, the illustrations are beautiful. Water-colored works of art grace the reader's eyes, always magnificent to look at. Indeed, David Wenzel did an amazing job of drawing the scenes and crafting the characters. Gandalf is perfect, as are the Dwarves and Bilbo. Smaug is awesome (when are dragons not?). The Elves weren't how I imagined them, but still fit the overall stylistic themes of the book.Taking these two together, the graphic novel of The Hobbit in no way compares with Tolkien's masterpiece, but it's definitely worth the read. I wound up skipping large blocks of \\"narration\\" text, letting the individual comic panes and character dialogue instead fill in the story. It was nice going back to the beginning of the journey that inspires The Lord of the Rings, and Charles Dixon's The Hobbit mostly met my expectations. Recommended for those interested in Tolkien, especially younger readers, but I would first recommend reading the novel before this one."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I can't believe at my age I had never read this book. I would recommend this book to readers of any age and genres. My only reference to these amazing characters was through film. The films don't do justice to Tolkien's mastery. Due to this book I have now purchased The Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Silmarillion. This book will be an added classic to your bookshelf!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In the fantasy novel The Hobbit by J.R.R Tolkien, a small mythical creature called a \\"hobbit\\" leaves his home on an adventure to help dwarves reclaim their stolen treasure. This happens after the hobbit was chosen as a burglar. The story's setting is long ago in Wilderland, a fantasy place. The main conflict is that long before, a dragon had raided a dwarvish town and stolen all of the treasures. The company of dwarves were eager for revenge on the dragon, \\"Smaug the Magnificent\\". Smaug was, unfortunately, a fearless and dangerous \\"worm\\" who lived in the faraway ruins of the town under the Lonely Mountain on the heap of treasures. Eventually, a team of 13 dwarves, a wizard, and a hobbit set off on a long journey. Along the way, there are many dangers. First, there are trolls who are hungry and would love to eat the dwarves. Luckily, they are all saved by the wizard. Next, over the goblin-infested Misty Mountains they were caught and taken into the heart of the goblin town, where they would have been slaves for the rest of their life. Then, in the dark, deep forest Mirkwood, they are captured by giant spiders who would eat them like flies. Only for Bilbo's quick thinking do they survive. And after surviving all of these ordeals, only to find a dragon at the end...Main Character:Bilbo Baggins the hobbit is the main character. He starts out with two sides of personality. One side is a respectable, jolly fellow who enjoys a comfortable life with two breakfasts a day if possible. The other side of him urges him to go on an adventure to faraway lands. The book tells of how his second side wins and he becomes a hero and burglar.Character Traits:The hobbit is jolly, excitable, and clever. Most of the time he is happy, and is not ever too grumpy. He sometimes has fits where he yells out strange things if he is scared. He is clever when the time comes. When the dwarves have all been captured by spiders, the hobbit came up with a plan on the spot! The hobbit is also stubborn and proud. He is looks down on the dwarves. Once, he sniffs, \\"all this dwarvish racket!\\" although \\" You or I wouldn't have noticed is the whole cavalcade passed within two feet of us!\\"Theme:The main theme of this book is the conflict between the good and the evil. The evil is always trying to thwart the good from doing what they have the right to do.Recommendation:I strongly recommend this book to children in 4th to 6th grade. The book is full of adventure and the outcome is often unexpected. Throughout the book, the language is engaging and playful which lessens the often scary scenes. I read it when I was 8, and now I am 9, I love it even more as I understand the story better!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is amazing, I love it and it's worth the money. I had it on my wish list and recieved it as a gift for Christmas. The binding is great, the pages are thick, fairly tare resistant... just don't let a baby get a hold of it, a baby could probably rip it.The cover and back are sturdy, and, well, when I say great binding, it's probably life guaranteed. The front is really great, around the picture in the middle are symbols, which I belive to be ancient Middle Earth runes. As for the print inside, nice and big, with pictures included. This is a great offer all together.For me, this isn't even worth taking off a half star because I personally think it's just cool, though some would disagree. When I got the book and I looked inside to see the pictures (my mother has a copy with Alan Lee art), I was disappointed for a second and didn't know how it was a Collector's Edition. The pictures were simple, not the great art that I had seen in my mother's copy. They looked like basic sketches of Alan Lee's work. I checked the front of the book to see who the author was and that's when it was suddenly really amazing. The sketches and pictures inside were actually sketeches drawn by Tolkien himself! This edition was so amazing, I found myself pulling it out every time I saw it just to look thorugh the pictures and the neat symbols on the front. I've read The Hobbit a couple times, as well as the Silmarillion, The Lord of the Rings, and parts of both the Book of Lost Tales and The Book of Unfinnished tales (I own more of his work than I've read). I'm quite a Tolkien fanatic. I began to learn Quenya and Sindarin and I know basic pronounciations for elven language in general, this was to improve my pronounciation of several places and things in Tolkien's works. I'm telling you what I know so that i can back up my belief that...When people say the Hobbit is more of a child's story. I have to disagree. My mother read it to me when I was somewhere between 6-8 years old and I was pretty bored. I didn't get most of it (I just liked the pictures and songs). She, however, seemed to be into it the whole time. I didn't find myself enjoying Tokien's work until I was 12. The Hobbit story itself is more fun and \\"bouncy\\" than his other works, but even if he had children in mind when he wrote it, it's not something childrn today can easily get into. Plus, the usage of words that are now used differently, only in England, or hardly seen altogether, would confuse many kids. For example, Tolkien uses the word \\"gay\\" several times. \\"gay\\", however, means happy. So when he describes something or someone as \\"gay\\" I can see too many 8-12 year olds, and even high schoolers, getting the wrong idea completely.My notes of warning:1. If you prefer detailed art over scetches, even if they are drawn by Tolkien himself, consider that before buying this edition2. Don't buy this for a kid thinking it's a simple childrens book. And if you believe them to have a large enough vocabulary to get into it, just double check to make sure they know the original meaning of \\"gay\\""},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is an excellent choice for any fantasy book lover.

I am fairly confident that this is the best edition ever printed. The actual book itself (without the dust cover) is clothbound in dark green and and has the title printed in gold on the spine. There is also a gold dragon outlined in gold on the bottom of the book (a really nice touch). It is very beautiful.The jacket is very beautiful as well. The jacket has gold everywhere and the golden color seems to catch and reflect light. The front cover has a picture of Smaug lying atop his hoard (hence all the gold). The back cover has a picture of the dwarves and Bilbo leaving Gandalf at the edge of Mirkwood. Spectacular. Overall, the jacket is very beautiful and makes the book shine.The story (as you may well know) is one of the best stories ever written. It remains (and always will remain) a classic. This book reflects the enchantment of the story. The thick, glossy pages and foolproof and durable binding are a testament to the quality of the story.The watercolor illustrations are another testament to the greatness of the story. Alan Lee dose a wonderful job replicating different events in the story. Alan Lee also drew gray pencil drawings taking up about a quarter of a page (those are done very well as well).Overall, the story is one of the best ever written and this edition of the story is probably the best version ever in print. The paper, print and binding quality is as good as you can get. Alan Lee also did a very good job on all his paintings and drawings.

This is not one of those monotone, same voice, no voice inflection, type of audiobooks. Rob uses various voices to tell this unabridged story of The Hobbit. There are times you feel like you're in Middle Earth, right there with Bilbo and the dwarfs. We listened to it on a series of short road trips and found it very entertaining. Rob keeps your attention! It's nice too, that when you get to the end of a CD, there's a little jig and voice over that informs you your at the end of the disc. We highly recommend this reading of The Hobbit. It will be great prep for the upcoming Hobbit film releases!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"After being given the Hobbit as a ten year old,i can say it singlehandedly kindled my love for reading. Eleven years later, I've read this book over twenty times, and still don't get tired of it. If you enjoy fantasy AT ALL and havent read the Hobbit you must give this book a chance."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you love reading, then good for you. Give yourself a pat on the back, and a wink in the mirror, there are not enough of us left in the world. But book worms beware, skip the reading this time and listen to The Hobbit as narrated by Rob Inglis. Listen as Gollum, Gandalf, Thorin, the house of the elves, the mountains come to life. Inglis even sings the many Middlearth folk songs that appear only as words in the book, folling JRR Tolkien's music but even having to create some of the tunes himself. As a twenty year old college student I remember this book fondly in particular as it was played in the car on road trips. I can only wait until I have my own family to read this book aloud to, but I will treasure and play this for the rest of my life. If you want to hear The Hobbit in a fresh and truly enjoyable way, don't wait for the movie."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"To make it clear I want to say that my three stars are only for the kindle edition maps.I like maps when I read a book that involves traveling, but unfortunately in the kindle edition the use of the maps for The Hobbit is not good!You can not make it larger and using the iPad you can not see it from the wright side.It always turns and is too small.When I tried to make it larger it just got blured.It is my only complain.I am otherwise a total admirer of J.R.R.Tolkien's books since 1991 and I have them in various editions.I love his history,because I see his stories as the History Of Middle Earth.I have read his books over and over again and I will read them many times more.They are my books for me.I usually read them when I feel stressed and I want to get away but cannot travel at the time.They take my mind off things."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book shows just how versatile Tolkien was. The written style is completely different from TLOTRs, although just as good. Read much, much easier than TLOTRs, it is a great kid's book-to kindle that little reader's flame-and perfect for Tolkien fans. It gives you a prelude to Bilbo's story before Frodo, and how he got the Ring. Would most definitely recommend it to any person of any reading level."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A truly enchanting tale which spurred an entire fantasy revival you can't say no this book. It is well written and easily read by all ages. Give it a chance I am sure you will love it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Rob Inglis does a fantastic job in performing the roles of all of the characters in this unabridged audiobook. His voice differentiations are fantastic and this is definitely one of the best audiobooks I've listened to. He makes it a real delight to hear, as you can clearly imagine the characters interacting with each other in this manner as they all sound quite distinct.So, being the unabridged version of The Hobbit, this contains the entire story from cover-to-cover, nothing missing. I feel compelled to mention that the tracks are not sorted by chapters. Since I first heard this version on cassette, it was never a big deal for me, but some people might be annoyed by it.I don't really need to mention that I think The Hobbit is a great book/story, but it really deserves a-lot of credit just in terms of a literary piece. It's one of those works that either really keeps you enthralled or bores you. It's extremely well written and has a great flow to it that really suits the audiobook format. A magnificent story with one of the best story tellers out there reading it to you. This is something I definitely recommend you own, if you enjoyed the book. It's certainly a tale worth being heard."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"First let me explain a few things: I teach high school English and 7th/8th grade Lang Arts in a small school. We read the book for both my language classes.It was coming down to the end of the school year and we had one more 'classic' to get through. I thought the audio book would bring the story to life more since the guy that reads it has a different voice for each character. I had a tough time getting the kids into the story. The reading-guy reads a tad slower than I expected and he sings every song. Some songs are rather drawn out and kind of cheesy so we would fast forward through those parts. It wasn't until the 4th chapter when I made the students read it themselves that they finally began to get into the story. By Ch 5 when Gollum comes into the picture they were more hooked. (Some, sadly, I was never able to convince that it was a good story.)All in all, the CD experience was okay. 1) I didn't have to read it myself, 2) at least the kids that didn't read it got pieces of the story in class, and 3) it kept us going because the kids liked not \\"doing work\\" per say in class those weeks.It was definitely an experience most had not had (hearing an audiobook). Bonus! I learned that a few of the students are better \\"readers\\" by listening to audiobooks! Perhaps I will try it again in the future for those with learning difficulties such as dyslexia, ADD, and dysgraphia. Audiobooks are the way to go with those and I had all 3 LDs in my classrooms this year."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the best book ever you must read it this is the first book i ever enjoyed reading and my grandma handed it down to my mom then my mom handed it down to me and my childen ( someday ) are definately gonna get a whiff of it i think everyone should read this book and i feel really sad for the ones that are deprived of not having it so BUY IT right now i have began reading the first book of &quot;the lord of the rings&quot; and i am on &quot;the felloship of the ring&quot; this series is the best ever and i was sad when the hobbit was over but my mom said that the next three books that i am going to read are just as good so i'm crossing my fingers... this is the best book read it! i am eager to hear from everyone about jrr tolkien's book so if you would like my e-maiol adress is u4everclr@aol.com and for those Bilbo and smaug the dragon haters this book took 15 years to write so it can't be bad!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read The Fellowship of The Ring about a month and a half ago, when I finished I decided to go back and read The Hobbit.

J.R.R Tolkein gives you a vivid flowing image of Middle Earth and almost makes you feel as if the book is reality, not fiction.

I am only 13 now and my father read me the book when I was 7 years old. At one point I wanted to believe that Middle Earth was real. The book has kept me interested for 6 years still and i have read it 5 times. I have also read Lord of The Rings and think that is wonderfully written.

Tolkien is a great book \\"you read before bed\\". I would recommend this for ages 10+. You could also say that there are three different climaxes, in the beginning, middle, and end, so this is a long, detailed book. The plot is detailed and is a classic example of fantasy literature. The book starts at the house of Bilbo Bagins, which is in a place where houses are built in hills and the people are very short or hobbits. His peaceful life is shattered by a party of dwarves and a wizard who takes Bilbo on a adventure through the Misty Mountains: with cold winters and hordes of evil goblins, Mirkwood: a forest where giant spiders and bloodthirsty elves live, and last, the Lonely Mountain, where a great treasure is guarded by the dangerous dragon, Smaug. Soon a series of events lead to the ultimate treasure hunt for an unsuspecting Bilbo Bagins. But as interesting as the settings are, it is the characters that bring the reader inside the story.One of the main characters is Bilbo Bagins. Bilbo is short so he is shy and wants to look big at times, yet he is shy in most other scenes. Gandalf is the wizard of the party and is the wisest. He saves the party many times and is a great negotiator. Thorin and the many other dwarves are the others in the party. They are seen as a bit short, fat, but strong warriors. Thorin and the other dwarves love the adventure and each one has unique traits that give the story a variety. Many of these characters bring the reader inside the story, and combined with the setting makes The Hobbit a classic fantasy.All in the fun, classic fantasy book \\"you read before bed\\" The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a great book, that everyone should read.

A prequel to \\"Lord of the Rings\\" (which I have already read), \\"The Hobbit\\" provides a much lighter tone than his more famous epic trilogy, but also provides the same wonder and excitement. \\"The Hobbit\\" may be more of a children's novel, but it sets the stage for his more ambitious Middle Earth trilogy, and is anything but childish in its storytelling.\\"The Hobbit\\" is a great introduction to Tolkien's Middle Earth and the rich tapestry of legends and songs that imbue a sense of aura to his world. Tolkien knows how to pique the imagination, and his vivid descriptions of dragons, elves, goblins, and the like let the reader's imagination run wild. Yes, this may be geared toward children, but any adult will thoroughly enjoy this reading as well.Perhaps Tolkien's most important lesson is that it does not take a strong, valiant warrior to become a hero. Indeed, Bilbo is the antitheses of a typical hero, being small of stature, pudgy, and reluctant to explore the world. Yet, when all the chips are down, it is this brave little hobbit who turns the epic quest of ancient treasure from mere certain death to an opportunity for success. Sure, he didn't single-handedly deliver the goods or slay the dragon, but he provided an instrumental part to their success, a success that seemed nearly impossible at the onset.Tolkien also warns about the effect of money and greed. As the dwarves (with Bilbo's aforementioned help) are ready to claim the spoils of their victory, their intense longing for treasure turns into unabashed greed. Indeed, if not for an outside event, this greed would have caused them to war against their allies. Even Bilbo is tempted by the treasures and outright steals a priceless jewel. It seems that no one is immune to the allure of treasure and gold.Overall, this is a great introduction to Tolkien's work. And, unlike myself, I would recommend reading this novel first before delving into the \\"Lord of the Rings.\\""},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Rob Ingliss does a GREAT job of reading here. I've only heard him on the audio productions of Tolken's 4 books, and wouldn't mind hearing his other stuff.The Royal Shakespearean actors are well represented by Ingliss. He has a different voice for each character, and the voices aren't too hard to distinguish from each other, which is no mean feat for a single person. (kind of reminds me of Mel Blanc (Looney Tunes, Bugs Bunny & gang) in this regard).If you loved the Hobbit, you'll love this book on CD.Just don't make the mistake of setting your PC or CDPlayer to \\"Random\\", or you'll be just as confused as my new-to-Tolkien friend was when he first heard it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Since about 1500 other people have written summaries of this book, I'll skip it.

This genre really isn't my thing, BUT The Hobbit is well written and a quick, easy read. I thought this was a very OK book. If nothing else, I'm glad I read it just because it is such a classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read this book numerous times, and read it aloud even more, but to hear it on this set of cd's is truly mesmerizing.I know it by heart, there was never a dull moment. And as always I wanted more. I am always sad to come to the end of The Hobbit, but now I can just pop it back on,turn off the TV and escape into the world created by the master himself. I was there with Mr. Baggins and his group as they traveled into the unknown and he traveled back a new Hobbit. The images conjured up by the narration is so amazing, I actually felt the wind on my hair & the rain soaking me to the bone.I am a 39 year old woman, married with an adult son. I have given this as a gift before and just recently I was called and thanked once by the 14 year old boy and then by his mother for bringing this story into their lives.This is a story with many underlying themes as all of Tolkeins works are. I would recommend this and all of his other works to other teenagers and fantasy lovers of any age."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"On Middle-earth great riches await and greater dangers lurk for those who venture to seek them. In The Hobbit, J. R. R. Tolkien, renowned Oxford professor of ancient languages, created a world so authentic I find it difficult to think of as fantasy. Tolkien used epic language and style when he wrote The Hobbit and the incomparable trilogy that follows it, The Lord of the Rings, as though he was retelling history. Sagacious wizard Gandalf ensnares home-loving hobbit Bilbo on an adventure with thirteen dwarves who venture forth \\"to seek the pale enchanted gold.\\" The dwarves' treasure was stolen by sinister dragon Smaug and now they want vengeance.I think Tolkien's theme of sticking together and helping each other out is timeless. I love the camaraderie between the companions such as when they are feasting at Lake-town. The book is third person limited point of view as told by an anonymous narrator but primarily reflects Bilbo's perspective. The Hobbit is an extremely fast-paced book. I highly recommend this book to anyone old enough not to be terrified of temporarily frightening dilemmas, and believe this lighter prequel should be required reading for anyone attempting Tolkien's masterpiece The Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"How would you like to be cooking breakfast and in a matter of hours be thrust into a world of adventure? Well...Bilbo Baggins, an older hobbit is sitting down to breakfast when he hears a knock on the door. He opens it to see Gandalf a particularly adventurous wizard. They agree to brunch and when the day comes he answers the door to see 13 dwarves and a wizard march in Bilbo is quickly drawn into a quest to kill the dragon Smaug and regain the lonely mountain.With creatures from all types of fantasy stories like trolls, goblins, giant spiders and dragons in their way. It is an excellent fantasy especially if you like resourceful protagonists, overwhelming antagonists and a hero who constantly wishes he had let the door be.This story is a real page turner because sometimes you don't have to turn the page to see that the tables have been turned. One of the best things about this story is that it is the classic \`slay the dragon' story with more than one twist.A lacking part was defiantly the denouement because at on part the author say \`Bilbo had never stopped to think how the treasure was to be removed' and I just thought that was never dealt with, he just got back to his house \`magically'.So overall I think you should read this book but prepare to be imaginative because this book has suspense in every active and more than one plot twist!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am not normally one to endorse 'dramatized' versions of books. An author's work deserves to be viewed as created by the author, not as condensed and interpreted by actors/directors, in the case of a movie dramatization or the audio presentation of a book.That being said, I am willing to endorse this dramatized version of J.R.R. Tolkien's &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. The storyline is true to the book, as are the dialogs. This Four CD collection presents an opportunity to listen to several hours of a classical fantasy tale, complete with songs, pronunciations of elven and dwarven words and names, and limited, appropriate, sound effects.I played the CD's in the car on a long road trip; it helped to keep my mind occupied as the miles ticked away. I purchased the CD version over the Cassette version of this B.B.C. production so that I might use this collection to entertain, and very likely introduce to the genre of Fantasy, my future children. I wholeheartedly recommend this collection to parents, and future parents."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" J.R.R. Tolkien first scribbed down the opening line of this book on an extra sheet of paper.And years before \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was seen by anyone outside Tolkien's circle, Middle Earth was first introduced to readers. \\"The Hobbit\\" is simpler and less epic than the trilogy that followed it, but Tolkien's brilliant writing, magical world and pleasantly stodgy hero bring a special life to this early fantasy classic.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life, in a luxurious hobbit hole under a hill (\\"it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\"). He's the picture of dull respectability.But his life is turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield. They want to reclaim the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar, even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life.So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. The quirky little band ends up battling goblins and spiders, nearly getting eaten, and imprisoned by Elves, while Bilbo finds himself in possession of a magic Ring from the treacherous Gollum. But even with a magic Ring, can he defeat a monstrous dragon and win a war against multiple enemies?Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and ancient Men for years before he ever came up with Bilbo's quest. But it's fortunately that he did, because while \\"The Hobbit\\" is overshadowed by the epic sweep of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the \\"Silmarillion,\\" it's still an entertaining story that lays the groundwork for his more famous works -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.Tolkien's writing is swift, light and full of songs and poetry-laden descriptions, such as interludes in the shimmering, ethereal Rivendell and the cold, terrible Lonely Mountain. The pace in this is much faster than in most of his other works -- not surprising, when you consider it was originally a bedtime story for his children.Most of the book's action is about Bilbo trying to keep himself and the dwarves from getting eaten, torn apart, or rotting in elf dungeons, but with some quiet interludes like a night at Beorn's mountain home. And the last chapters hint at the epic majesty that Tolkien was capable of, as well as the idea that even little people -- like a mild-mannered hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.This book also first came up with hobbits -- the peaceful fuzzy-footed countryfolk -- in the form of Bilbo Baggins. He's a likable little guy, if the last person you'd ever expect to be a hero -- initially he seems weak and kind of boring, but his hidden strengths and wits come up to the surface when he needs to. By the end, he's almost a different person.The dwarves are more comical, and the elves more whimsical in this book, but the supporting characters are still impressive -- the crotchety, mysterious wizard Gandalf, the dignified, flawed Dwarf king Thorin Oakenshield, and a Guardsman who becomes a king. Even minor characters like Beorn, Elrond and the menacing Smaug are given plenty of dimension.The 70th anniversary edition has some nice extras -- Tolkien's son Christopher wrote a new prologue for it, which is never quite as interesting as it should be. It also contains reedited text, foldouts, and it apparently has all of Tolkien's quirky, solid illustrations.That's more, this nicely-bound edition includes a duplicate of the original cover, from when the book was originally published -- a gorgeous scenic view of mountains, forests and sky, all done in black, green and blue, with runes all around the edges.\\"The Hobbit\\" started as a fluke, grew into a bedtime story, and became one of the best fantasy stories in literary history -- a charming adventure in the time that never was. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book can be a great purchase for two reasons. Those that love the Hobbit story and appreciate it as one of the greatest classic fanasty tales ever written, and would enjoy learning some 'behind the scences' history and info themselves (not exluding alternate covers and artwork from editions printed in other languages). It is a great purchase to add to your own library.Also, it works well as a gift. If you know a Tolkien lover who already seems to have all of his basic works and some hard to find ones to boot. They may not have thought about adding an annotated version to the stack. This is a great way to give them something inexpensive that they are sure to treasure for years to come."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I loved the illustration by Alan Lee in this version.

Luckily for readers of \\"The Hobbit,\\" the story of Bilbo and his adventures haven't yet had that transformation, and leave us to create a new picture of our own within Middle Earth.\\"The Hobbit\\" is the prelude to the widely known \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" series. It is one of few preludes, in my mind, that is actually effective. In the book the reader finds out much about J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Middle Earth,\\" and has insight into its following books. This story faintly foreshadows many things that are to take place in the upcoming trilogy. However, for those of you who have read the book amd trilogy, you will have noticed the difference in Tolkiens voice and personality in \\"The Hobbit.\\"In my opinion \\"The Hobbit\\" is much lighter and not as dramatic as \\"The Lord of the RIngs.\\" It has serious parts no doubt, but the prelude seems to be more of a pleasing and joyful story, where as the trilogy focuses more on a moral and getting a message across to the reader. I enjoy both reads, but when you are in need of something that will brighten you up and excite your imagination as well, \\"The Hobbit\\" is definetely the better way to goI guess you could also say that's why i enjoyed \\"The Hobbit\\" more than most books out at the moment. Lately all authors have been focused on is creating something,\\" brutally honest!\\" or ,\\"heart-wrenching!\\" and ,\\"so sad i wanted to cry!\\" Sure, those things are good in some parts of a book, but if all the book your reading does is make you even more sad than you already were... what's the point in reading it? And as for it being \\"brutally honest,\\"... well lets just say somethings are better left unsaid,and definetely better left unknown.As I said earlier, that's what is different about this book though. It seems that Tolkien was simply recording his fantasies about the most appealing and envied life-style we can imagine, then creating a story based around that dream. Then he took it further and created this entrancing tale into a epic saga getting an important and major point across to the readers of the book. The whole collection of stories is simply amazing, and it's hard to believe that one man can come up with all these details and individual tales of fiction.Enough about the series though, I'd like to talk more about the book at hand. \\"The Hobbit\\" starts with an explanation of our good friend Bilbo Baggins and his dwelling within the earth. It takes a moment to explain to us just a little bit about the life-style of a hobbit, and the Shire that they dwell in. The first chapter waists no time introducing the true story however, and after the brief explanation of a hobbit it jumps into the tale. In the next two chapters we have already left the Shire, and surprisingly Bilbo has been accompinied by 13 dwarves and an old wise wizard name Gandalf. In no time at all the reader has entered the Misty Mountains to the West and read as the company of travelers encounter orcs within the mountains.In the mountains, perhaps the most major part of the book takes place; Bilbo discovers the Ring. With the discovery of the ring, he also comes across an odd creature that later turns out to be known by the name of Gollum. Both of these discoveries are key points with in the entire prelude and trilogy.Once out of the mountains, the company meets a giant of a man named Beorn, and with his warnings proceeds into the Mirkwood Forrest.The story then goes on to tell of the expeditions capture by the elves of Mirkwood, and their encounter with Dragon, Orc, Goblins, Wolves, and more. To end the book the group of hobbit, wizard, and dwarf ends up with a vast amount of jewls and riches(which was their original goal to start out with) and has Bilbo return to his home in the shire safe, yet not untouched.Altogether i think the story of Bilbo was successful in being a book new and different for its time. It proved to be a happier and more enjoyable read than almost anything i can think of at this point in the world. And it surely opened up a new world to readers and introduced the magical world of Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am a sixth grader.The Hobbit by J.R.R. TolkienOne thing interesting about this book the Hobbit is the Giant Spider Attack when they barely have any supplies. Do you think they make it alive safely? To answer the question you must read this exciting book of fantasy, adventures, and an impossible quest. If you read this book I know you'll love it, becasue I thought it was GREAT!! There are many main characters in this book but the real main character is the Hobbit himself. The other characters are Gandalf (Wizard), Smaug (the Dragon)and the rest are the dwarfs named Balin, Dwalin, Fili, Kili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially Thorin. The first time the Hobbit heard a ding-dong on the door Gandalf was not there. Only one to come for teatime was a dwarf named Dwalin and he wanted coffee. After that all of the other dwarfs kept coming in his hobbit hole all thirteen dwarfs from a far off land. It all started with Bilbo or Mr. Baggins (the Hobbit), and a wizard named Gandalf had teatime on Wednesday. Thorin asked Bilbo to accompany Gandalf and the dwarfs on a quest. Biblo was thinking real hard about it if he should go, but finally agreed. When the dwarfs told Bildo they were homeless and on their own, plus to help them retrieve their stolen riches from Smaug the merciless Dragon who burns towns and a terror of the entire countryside. When Thorin (Dwarf) had a map to Smaug Palace and realized they had to kill the Dragon to save the contryside and get the dwarfs stolen riches back with the help of the Hobbit who has a special ring. You'll have an incredible adventure and excitement of a lifetime. Your New Fantasy World is just beginning."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was easily one of the best books I have ever read in my lifetime. This book has inspired me to continue reading the trilogy of the Lord of the rings. The size of the books look intimidating, but if they are as good as The Hobbit, then it should be worth it.The Hobbit was everything i looked for in a book. It was packed full of action, packed fool of fantasy, and packed full of dialogue that never bored you. Every chapter set the stage for the one that was to follow. It always left you reading and never being able to find a spot to stop because you want to see what occurs next in the plotline.Gandalf definitely stood out as a peculiar character to follow. In this story, it is very hard to tell what his real agenda is. It APPEARS that he wants Bilbo to go on his adventure for danger and excitement, but maybe what he really wants is what's best for him (Bilbo).Bilbo never intended on leaving The Shire to begin with, and ever since he took that first step out of the door, he continuously wishes he was back home sitting in front of a fire reading a nice book smoking some pipe weed. He faces some very hard trials on his journey to the Lonely Mountain. From almost being eaten by trolls, to being captured by the woodland elves. Still, Bilbo and his gang of friendly dwarves manage to continue onward.I would definitely recommend this book to anybody who has a fetish for fantasy books and action books. Take it from me; this book never leaves you bored at any point at all. Once you start reading and getting into the events of the story, you will find it very hard to find a place to leave off for another day."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I knew when I ordered the book that it was hard back, but when I opened the box and there was this beautiful green box with a very beautiful green book inside with a picture and the gold writing around the edge I was very pleased.

It is truly a beautiful book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Step back from the age of Aragorn, and indulge yourself in the prelude to the exciting Lord of the Rings trilogy. The Hobbit, another beautifully crafted work by J.R.R. Tolkien, is not only breathtaking but also full of surprises. Small and puny in size, the shy Mr. Bilbo Baggins follows a journey to help recover the long lost treasure of the grim dwarves that he eventually becomes comfortable with. From a mountain full of vicious goblins to killing eight-legged creatures to the cunning and ferocious dragon, Smaug the Magnificent, Mr. Bilbo trips upon adventure after adventure as he builds his respect and confidence as a tiny being in the vast world of Middle Earth.In this conglomeration of exhilarating events, I could not decide where it was most exciting for me. Yet what stood out the most was the hobbit&iexcl;s witty ways in challenging the large colony of spiders in the shadowy forest of Mirkwood, where a significant amount of the plot is set. The amusing part of this event was how the hobbit deviously distracts the spiders by throwing showers of pebbles and stones in his invisible self (he had already obtained the ring of lord Sauron at this stage), in order to save his fellow dwarves from captivity. In addition, his &iexcl;battle&iexcl; against these spiders also demonstrates courageous themes that had a touching effect amid the excitement: do not belittle little people, and expect from the unexpected. Indeed, this was so for hobbits were described as little Halflings that preferred comfortable settings, had no taste in bold and audacious adventures, and were nothing of worries. Yet Mr. Bilbo Baggins, with a taste of adventure in his ancestral blood, defied that by defeating a few of these spiders in the process of saving his warrior companions, which emotionally tied me in with these brave themes (mentioned above). It is no wonder this novel was so thrilling.I would highly recommend The Hobbit, not only to those fantasy-lovers out there, but to any other general reader. The Hobbit is well-fashioned to a degree where it is not too supernatural nor too dull and dry, since Tolkien&iexcl;s style is a tad dry. Nevertheless, The Hobbit is a novel worth reading and enjoying, for I assure you that it will definitely seize in the fantastic world of Mr. Bilbo Baggins and his companions through a journey into the perils of Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Wow!

Bilbo is brought along on a quest as a burglar to help Thorin (the main dwarf) and his party re-gains his mountain and treasure from the dragon Smaug.I think this book deserves 5 stars because it was so hard to put down. Bilbo and his party encounter many foes such as giants, goblins, wolves, spiders, Golum, and Smaug himself. Chapter after chapter, Bilbo and the dwarves got into more and more danger and enemies.

They both will tell each other riddles. If Bilbo wins, Goulm must show him the way out of the mountain. If Golum wins, he gets to eat Bilbo. Golum loses but won't show him the way out, so Bilbo tries on the ring. He discovers it makes him invisible. Golum assumes he knows the way out and runs for the exit leading Bilbo to it.I liked this book because it has so much adventure in it and I didn't want to put it down until it was done.

The first chapter waists no time introducing the true story however, and after the brief explanation of a hobbit it jumps into the tale. In the next two chapters we have already left the Shire, and surprisingly Bilbo has been accompinied by 13 dwarves and an old wise wizard name Gandalf. In no time at all the reader has entered the Misty Mountains to the West and read as the company of travelers encounter orcs within the mountains.In the mountains, perhaps the most major part of the book takes place; Bilbo discovers the Ring. With the discovery of the ring, he also comes across an odd creature that later turns out to be known by the name of Gollum. Both of these discoveries are key points with in the entire prelude and trilogy.Once out of the mountains, the company meets a giant of a man named Beorn, and with his warnings proceeds into the Mirkwood Forrest.The story then goes on to tell of the expeditions capture by the elves of Mirkwood, and their encounter with Dragon, Orc, Goblins, Wolves, and more. To end the book the group of hobbit, wizard, and dwarf ends up with a vast amount of jewls and riches(which was their original goal to start out with) and has Bilbo return to his home in the shire safe, yet not untouched.Altogether i think the story of Bilbo was successful in being a book new and different for its time. It proved to be a happier and more enjoyable read than almost anything i can think of at this point in the world. And it surely opened up a new world to readers and introduced the magical world of Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I know that over a thousand people have reviewed this wonderful book but I felt so strongly about The Hobbit that I just had to say sonething about it. The Hobbit was and still is a masterpiece, and will remain a masterpiece for centuries to come. One of the main reasons why is that its prose and style of writing is absolutely captivating. It has a simple and delightful charm to it that makes you want to keep on reading. Its plot is also a treat. It is not boring or stale, as I've heard others say, but lively. Also, with this book, there are many coicidences and connections among characters (so what if Bilbo didn't kill Smaug? Think about it. Could a little hobbit really kill a dragon twenty times his size, despite his cunning and discreetness? I don't think so). Best of all, though, it has a sweet message and theme that can actually leave you pondering about it for hours. I have read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and I have to admit that, in my opinion, The Hobbit is better, despite the Trilogy's genius. What can I say? It's an excellent read, and definetly worth your time. The only thing you'll regret is that it will go by too fast.Also, I wanted to comment on the Houghton Mifflin trade paperback edition. It is absolutely beautiful; I believe Alan Lee illustrated the cover. It is very durable, and the paper (I believe) is acid free."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love the hobbit. i read it in 7 grd. and it was great read it again in 9 grd. is was even better that time.

I read it simply to see for myself what all the hubbub was about, and I found that I thoroughly enjoyed it. Not really knowing anything about Tolkein or his books, I didn't know what to expect. I figured the book was overrated like a lot of others out there, but I can assure you that it most definately is not! Some complain of Tolkeins characters (females anyway) stopping at the neck. Inspite of the truth of this, it's effect on the story is virtually nonexistant. Tolkein is the father of fantasy and his books are the basis of the genre he pretty much created. If you are a fan of fantasy, this is the series that should have been read prior to any others. Most fantasy authors put a feel of Tolkein in their words (Jordan is one example), but that doesn't mean that they are trying to be Tolkein. So if you read fantsy after Tolkein, and think the author was trying to imitate Tolkein, don't jump to conclusions. A lot of authors see that as a way of paying homage to the man who wrote the books they know theirs will be judged by. Keep that in mind and read these books!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was by far the best book I have ever read.....and I have read ALOT of books!!

I began reading the Hobbitt and the Trilogy later, when i was around 14, and even today i get different things out of each reading. Although the book appeals to children, it is not simply a children's story and the information contained inside is essential to understanding the Trilogy, both the books and recent films.Beware: this is no frolic in the woods with friends. The subject matter is violent, frightening, and even sinister. I'm not just talking about the encounters with giant spiders and cruel goblins. Here are some of the themes:The greed of the Dwarfs. If you think they came to kill Smaug so that Lake Town could be free from tyranny, think again. They were there to get revenge and riches, pure and simple, and it led to much more violence.Bilbo's job title. He's called a what? THIEF. He is brought along because these dwarves need an experienced burglar to help them procure necessities on their journey. Bilbo is far from it when he leaves the Shire, but becomes much better at it along the way -- aided by the ring, of course. The shrieking cries of Gollum attest to that when Bilbo escapes the mountains (\\"Thief! Baggins! We hates it forever!\\"). Once endowed with the ring, which we later discover is pure evil, his thievery increases exponentially. Of course, he steals from the Elves to feed himself, but what *need* did he have of the Arkenstone?The twisted evil of Gollum. Here's a character whose full villainy can't even be extracted from \\"The Hobbitt.\\" Taken in context with his role in the Trilogy, he is a demented and pitiful being who is murderous, treacherous, and mono-maniacal. We've all met Gollum face to face in our lives.The arrogance of the Elves. Yes, they're beautiful people, and yes, they are \\"good,\\" but their high-mindedness and bigotry towards dwarves and men is rampant through all four books. They're holed-up in their forest hideout because they are so mistrustful of everyone else. They are isolationists without repentance, because they only see themselves as good, and all others as inferior.The spectre of life's Orcs, Trolls, and Spiders. The world is, and has always been, full of dangers. These are presented plainly in the \\"bad\\" characters, but also more subtly in those characters deemed \\"good.\\" Bilbo experiences the worst behaviour from nearly everyone he encounters, except Gandalf, who only abandons him to look after greater matters. Even Beorn, who houses the company and delivers victory in battle, is deadly and fearful. Bilbo is ridiculed for being a peacemaker, driven away in anger by his \\"friends\\" the dwarves, considered useless by men and elves, is seen merely as food for Gollum, the Trolls, and the Spiders, and faces death numerous times. His travels, like our own lives, are full of peril and rife with unpleasantness, even from those we love or admire.Bilbo's journey is not a happy one. Through it all, he remains mostly his cheery self, though he becomes tinged with cynicism from his experience (note his response to the thrush). In other words, he grows up. We can all relate to what he goes through.It's a much more sophisticated and complex book than most people will give credit for, yet is so well-written and timeless as to have the broadest appeal. There is no \\"type\\" to which this book would appeal, if read with discerning and open minds. One of the BEST pieces of fictional literature EVER. Pure Gold."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I read this book for the first time, I didn't get it. But the second time, I loved it. It is the best beginning for the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.

That's the gist of it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book deserves 5 stars for many reasons. The first reason is the plot. The second reason is the characters.The plot is good beacuse it has many parts, it has it's ups and downs but it's plot is special because some parts are sad someparts are exciting and some parts are just kind of regular.The characters are also very special. One he describes them so well that you can picture them in you're mind.

Taking place in a mystical land of the past, it feels as if the reader is along with the characters the whole way. Bilbo Baggins, the main character, along with 12 dwarves and Gandalf, a powerful wizard, as his companions must make the dangerous and peril filled journey to the lair of Smaug, the terror of an entire countryside!This book is a must read for anyone with a love for exceptionally written literature. Tolkiens descriptive language makes you feel that if you could meet the characters, you would be able to sit and talk as if you knew them. The book makes the reader feel as if he was with them every step of the way. There's never a dull moment, it grabs your attention from the beginning and doesn't let go.

Accompanied by dwarves and the wizard Gandalf the Grey he must help recover lost treasure from the dragon Smaug. On his journey he finds a magical ring with surprising powers. When they get to Smaug's lair Bilbo alone must defeat the evil terror of Smaug.I give this book a 4/5 stars because it's hard to get into. At first, there are lots of new characters you have to get to know. It starts out in Bilbo's Hobbit Hole where nothing but talking goes on. Than they start to journey and slowly the book gets better and better. The Hobbit does pack a lot of action though and the scenes with Smaug are exciting and captivating. I think Tolkien wrote this wrote this book in a great way. He used great descriptions and funny conversation to pull you in.Bilbo is the most in depth character in the book and as time passes you will learn all of his hopes and dreams. In the beginning, Bilbo is a stuffy, old, boring hobbit who doesn't think twice about going on adventures. As time goes on, he slowly crawls out of his shell and gets braver. At first, the dwarves don't like him because he's boring but when he gets braver and saves their lives, more than once, they start the respect him. Bilbo is a funny, clever, tricky, and witty character who is really fun to read about. In the end, he learns that even though he's small he can do great things to help shape the world.The best part in The Hobbit is the part where Bilbo confronts the dragon Smaug. Bilbo speaks in riddles and calls himself a \\"Barrel Rider\\" which greatly angers Smaug. He also learns of Smaugs weak point by using Smaugs arrogance against him. In the end, Bilbo makes Smaug so mad that Smaug goes on a rampage where he destroys caves and caverns. After, all of this Bilbo learns a valuable lesson, don't anger evil dragons.I wholly recommend this book for readers ten and over. It is written with powerful words and imagination.

In this epic about a little, non-adventurous person, J. R. R. Tolkien introduces Bilbo Baggins to his first adventure. The Hobbit starts off with Gandalf, the wizard, paying Bilbo an unexpected visit, not only bringing along thirteen guests, but bringing Bilbo the news that would change his life, forever. I enjoyed reading this adventure-filled epic, as it took me on countless journeys and introduced me to goblins, wild wolves, orcs, eagles, elves, and many, many more creatures found throughout the novel. The adventures never ended, and when I thought I was safe to conclude a happy ending, another villain was at hand. The twist and turns take readers out of their reading places and into the dungeons and caves along with Bilbo and his companions.I would recommend this epic to open-minded people who can let their minds wander once and awhile. People should not begin reading this novel if they are not imaginative and cannot picture weird creatures never before seen.

The protagonist in this story is viewed through third person, or narrator form.This hobbit, being so little, having big padded feet, and curly hair as they all do, must face many challenges. One of them is meeting Gollum, a horrible, sneaky little creature who lives back in the caves of the goblins. First, the dwarves that are with Bilbo and of course Bilbo himself are running from the goblins where he is knocked out. Second, when he wakes up he finds a ring and decides to go looking for the others. After walking quite a ways in the darkness he steps into something cold. At this time he meets Gollum.

Do you think Gollum is going to play a trick, or as Gollum would say, \\"play a tricksy\\" on Bilbo?Another exciting part is when Bilbo is like a kidnapper during the story. Bilbo is on the verge of being caught when he thinks up a plan to help his crew that he is with to get the treasure. He must get each of them and help them out of being captured. His plan is to get into barrels left over from food and drinks that are put into a river. Then they are floated to near the crew's destination.

Not that he exactly wanted to go on any adventures, which are very frowned upon by the hobbit society, mind you, but the crafty wizard Gandalf rather tricked him into it. So, Bilbo left behind his normal life and hobbit-hole and joined his companions to start their journey, \\"one fine morning just before May.\\"Throughout the story, I really enjoyed reading J.R.R. Tolkien's descriptions of people, objects, and even situations. The descriptions really allowed a reader to draw a fantastic picture in his head, while, at the same time, didn't put up too many walls or restrictions as to not allow much, if any, room for variations in different people's perceptions. From his head-to-toe description of a hobbit to his inside-and-out description of the Baggins' residence, Mr. Tolkien really makes the reader become a part of the story through his descriptions.I also liked the plot line in its entirety. Mr. Tolkien was able to keep things moving and keep the reader wanting to read, but, also, allow some parts to be less action oriented through his use of suspense. He didn't make the characters run into problems left and right during every leg of their journey, yet he wouldn't slow things down so much that he would cause the reader to lose interest either.The last thing I would like to point out that I liked in particularly was Mr. Tolkien's use of riddles in different parts of the story. In fact, Bilbo and Gollum's \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" chapter was one of my favorite parts of the book. I found it very fun, though also very challenging at times, to play along and try to figure out each riddle before reading on to see if I was correct. Also, another riddling part of the book that I enjoyed was when Bilbo spoke to Smaug in a very riddling manner.Though I liked most of Mr. Tolkien's style of writing and use of riddles, I found some parts a little hard to follow at times. \\"There a warm welcome was made them...\\" is one example. Not that it was necessarily all that hard to follow, more so that I don't hear talk like that very often, and it was a little odd to hear at first.Now, like I said, The Hobbit is about Mr. Bilbo Baggins who is pulled away from his home in The Hill and ventures past The Water when Thorin and Company hires him as a burglar. Everything starts out well enough and they make their way towards their destination. But, things make a turn for the worse when they run into three rather unpleasant fellows in the woods. They manage to push on, though, and get a nice rest, thanks to Elrond, before running into their next hardship. I'm talking, of course, about their run-in with a not-so-nice crowd on the Misty Mountains. Yet, somehow, they even manage to make it though that little skirmish, and Bilbo even picks up a little something along the way. However, Bilbo and the gang are far from safe, even after getting away from those whose acquaintances they had made on the Misty Mountains. Yes, once they had escaped the dangers of the Misty Mountains, they really found themselves up a tree! But, luckily, thanks to a little outside help, they made it safely to the home of Beorn, where they stayed for a short time before venturing further. All this and poor Bilbo and his companions still haven't made their way through the awful Mirkwood Forest, the marshes on the far side of it, or the valley of Dale, where the Lonely Mountain and the terrible Smaug himself awaited!Overall, I really enjoyed this book, and I would have to say that it's the best book that I have read, to this day. I would recommend this book to all who enjoy action, adventure, suspense, and a good plot line. However, I would also recommend that those who do decide to read The Hobbit have a good imagination and brush up on their knowledge of certain fantastical creatures, such as dwarves, elves, trolls, goblins, and wargs, a bit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit\\" to me was one of the best books I have ever read.

He enjoys a peaceful and care-free life but his life is interrupted by a surprise visit by the wizard Gandalf.They are embarking on a journey to recover lost treasure that is guarded by the dragon Smaug, at a Lonely Mountain.On the journey, Bilbo and the dwarves encounter all sorts of villains and obstacles. They have not traveled very far when they stumble upon a group of trolls.Gandalf leads the group to a place where they can get a short rest and they pass through the country of the elves.Bilbo has outwitted a creature called Gollum, and gained a ring that makes him invisible. This is certainly helpful in battling the Giant Spiders and getting the dwarves out of the Elvenking's prison. This is about all i can say without telling the rest of it. I thought that this was a good book because I was able to get into it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Whereas other reviews have focused on Tolkien's excellent story, I want to recommend Alan Lee's fantastic illustrations. Lee was one of two Tolkien illustrators called by Peter Jackson for the making of the trilogy film, The Lord of the Rings. His brilliance shines through in the recreation of Rivendell and the warm feel of Hobbiton. As a life-long fan of the Lord of the Rings, I have never been disappointed by Lee's interpretation of a scene or character. His artistic skill hits the mark dead center every time on every concept. In fact, his is one artist of a few (if not the only one) who are officially recognized by Tolkien's estate as a bard of Middle Earth. Therefore, the illustrations in this beautiful edition of a great book by the 20th century's best author are bound to appeal to you as you read it. In this book, the arguing trolls are just as I've imagined them, and the dwarves are like real people, not plump bodies with noses the size of their heads. The eagles, too, are glorious. I heartily recommend this edition of Tolkien's wonderful fantasy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, is a character most of us can relate to. He likes to eat and is a bit overweight. Bilbo desires adventure, but he would prefer to stay home and enjoy a quiet life. He prefers the familiar to the unknown. But once in a while something bigger than us gets in the way.The Hobbit's adventure begins when he is chosen by the wizard Gandalf to be part of a team that travels across Middle Earth to restore the dwarf kingdom of Thorin Oakenshield. The group must travel over the mountains, through a treacherous forest, up another mountain that is inhabited by a terrible dragon, sleigh the dragon, recover the treasure, and restore the kingdom.This book is the story of how a little Hobbit rises to the occasion, and takes on the challenge. I highly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is very good. Its about a hobbit named Bilbo who goes on a long journey with 13 dwarves and a wizard.

I read through it very quickly and all I could think about while not reading it is finishing the read. Still not sure how they are gonna make the book last 3 movies but that is besides the point.

Tolkien sure makes the story come alive as you read it.The focus will be on the materialistic part of the book. The cover is truly beautiful. Gold, green, red. It is covered with dwarfish rune language. The paper on which the book is printed is high quality. It is thicker than regular paper and even feels good to touch.The animations are in beautiful colorings on special photo paper. There is for example a picture of Rivendale, very similar to this: [...], however, it comes across even more beautiful in the book than it does on the screen of my Macbook Pro.I bought it for $11 which is a great price for this beautiful piece of art. I noticed when I wrote this review that it is $18, which is a lot higher (63%). The raise in price is most likely due to the Hobbit being out in theater. I am not sure that the price will go down. I would like to guess that the price will go down in a few months (unless the DVD and Blu-Ray release of the movie spikes the demand in Hobbit related products). If you would wait close to a year, I am afraid that the release of the second Hobbit movie would increase the demands, and thus the price of this book again.Recommendation: Buy it. If not now, in a few months (before the DVD/Blu-Ray release)."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Enchanting! Intriguing and written to appeal to any age.

Rob Inglis's narration is great, with enough vocal variation to distinguish among the characters.

Immerse yourself in Middle Earth, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit or There and Back Again\\" is the first story of Middle-Earth that was ever read by the masses. And to this day it remains a beloved favorite due to Tolkien's exceptional writing, realistic and lovable characters, and the fantastic, complicated world with its unlikely hero: a fuzzy-footed hobbit.Bilbo Baggins lives a pleasantly stodgy and dull life in the Shire, in a luxurious hole under a hill. (\\"It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort\\") But his life is completely turned upside-down by the arrival of the wizard Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. The dwarves, led by the exiled king-in-waiting Thorin Oakenshield, want to regain the Lonely Mountain (and a lot of treasure) from the dragon Smaug, who drove out the dwarves long ago. Why do they want Bilbo? Because Gandalf has told them that he'd make a good burglar (even though Bilbo has never burgled in his life).So before Bilbo is entirely sure what is going on, he is being swept off on a very unrespectable -- and dangerous -- adventure. Bilbo and the Dwarves battle goblins and spiders, are nearly eaten twice, are captured and Bilbo is forced to riddle with the treacherous, withered Gollum, and ends up escaping with a magical Ring. But even after these obstacles, the dragon Smaug is still in the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo is not entirely sure what to do to deal with this enemy.Author J.R.R. Tolkien had been crafting his mythos of Elves, Dwarves, Wizards and Men for years before writing \\"The Hobbit,\\" but \\"The Hobbit\\" is the first story that people had the opportunity to read. It began as a line scrawled on a sheet of blank paper, and then into a bedtime story for his children. And even though it's overshadowed by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Silmarillion,\\" this book is an essential link. It's definitely sillier and lighter, but it provides the springboard for a lot of the stuff in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" -- especially the magical Ring that Bilbo finds in Gollum's cavern.The concept of hobbits started in this book -- the quintessential peaceful \\"wee\\" people, based on British countryfolk, with simple pleasures and unexpected depths of strength and resourcefulness. And, of course, fuzz on their large feet. Tolkien's Elves are a little more ethereal and less dignified, and his dwarves are a bit more comical and less grim. But Elrond hints at the full majesty of the Elves, and Thorin Oakenshield is still the most dignified, proud and impressively flawed dwarf there is. The last chapters of the book hint at the epic majesty of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" and some of the same victory/loss themes. And of course, the idea that even little people -- like a hobbit or a bird -- can change the world.Tolkien's writing is quick and light, while providing sufficient detail to let you picture what's going on. The dialogue is less influenced by Old English, and the pace is a lot faster (not surprising, since it was originally read to his kids before bedtime). Bilbo is a likable little guy -- he seems to be the last person whom you'd expect to be a courageous hero, but he shows incredibly strength and smarts when he's under pressure. Supporting characters like Thorin, Bard the Guardsman-turned-King, the king of the wood-elves, and even Smaug himself are never cookie-cutter, but multidimensional and immensely interesting to read about.\\"The Hobbit\\" was written for children, but adults can appreciate and enjoy it just as much. So read this book, then scoop up \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and continue reading. A timeless treasure and classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I never used to like Harry Potter- I had never read the book. I did and I wanted to read more more more. This is the same way.

He, a wizard (Gandalf) and 12 dwarves set off for a great adventure to defeat the great Dragon Smaug and get back the treasure he once stole from the town of Dale.

Children and adults alike will find themselves drawn into Tolkien's world. There are so many elements a teacher can draw from this text: characterization, imagery, setting, plot, etc. However, unskilled readers might have some difficulty with it for a variety of reasons. They might have trouble reading long narrative paragraphs with little dialogue, keeping track of all of the character and the characters' roles, and understanding the abstract concepts found in the work. We recommend this text for upper-level high school students, who are more experienced readers, and able to draw a lot out of a text.

It's about a peace-loving Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins is his name, who lives in a little Hobbit-hole, like all normal hobbits. What's a hobbit, you ask? A hobbit is (or was) a quiet, peace-loving creature who usaully lived on hills and disliked normal human, or, as they say, &quot;the big people.&quot; They didn't believe in modern technology and got most of their resources from nature. Well, on day, when Mr. Baggins was sitting upon his rockin' chair outside his little hole, the great and mighty &quot;Gandalf the Gray&quot; came and forced him to come upon his journey. Forced.

Only, the book itself covered up the fact that it was a long read. I hope others will decide to stick with the book and not leave it because of it's length.Also, I thought that the book was interesting that a \\"Hobbit\\" which is small in height, actually saved dwarves, I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Without the hobbit, once self-confined to his home, the lands around the Lonely Mountain may never have found the greater peace that they did. In the beginning of The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins hated the idea of adventure, but he could only do so much to stop this one when thirteen dwarves and one wizard came to his little hobbit-hole in the hill.The lot of them needed his services as a burglar to gain their treasure back from he dragon, Smaug. He hesitantly agreed to go, and on the way, the group found Bilbo to be very handy, noble, and adventurous. Though the one to actually kill the dragon was a warrior from Dale, Bilbo played a large part in the entirety of the greater peace found after Smaug's death in the lands around. I strongly recommend this book to adventure-lovers and those in need of some inspiration.One reason that I liked this book was that it had many points of great suspense, such as when Bilbo woke up to find a giant spider's eyes and legs tying his legs together to eat him. Bilbo luckily woke up in time to kill the spider. Also, when Bilbo and his friends had to fight off the trolls, it seemed possible that Bilbo would get his toes singed, or they would all get eaten. It was a point of great suspense when Bilbo darted invisibly from tree to tree, away from the spiders who were trying ton eat him and his friends, who were hanging from a web some way off.Another good part of this book was the mystery that loomed in the background, though sometimes it was unnoticed until it was directly brought up. For example, when Thorin was lost from the group, it was quite unknown where he had gone, and it wasn't brought up for quite a while. Also, it was a mystery how Bilbo would get into his barrel, which he didn't get to, because he didn't think of it, but ended up floating down the river on top of it. It was quite a mystery how they would get out of the trees surrounded by wargs and goblins, but were eventually saved by eagles.My favorite part of this book was the way it often made it seem impossible for the dwarves and Bilbo to go any further, like when they were in the Goblin's passages, in front of the Great Goblin, about to be eaten, or when they got caught in the forest with no idea of how to get out. The best example was when they got stuck in the elven-palace, guarded by elves and a spell-ridden gate.The Hobbit was a very satisfactory reads, full of suspense, adventure, and friendship. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good book that keeps you turning the pages through Bilbo's adventure.-K.Carson"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"My review is of the collector's edition of The Hobbit. Out of the several editions of this book I've owned over the years, this is the one I treasure the most. It is also the one my kids read as they first discovered the works of Tolkien. Great book and a great edition."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"After seeing the epic motion picture trilogy, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" saga can be difficult to picture individually for readers. This happens all to often when the adaption between a book to a movie or play takes place. Luckily for readers of \\"The Hobbit,\\" the story of Bilbo and his adventures haven't yet had that transformation, and leave us to create a new picture of our own within Middle Earth.\\"The Hobbit\\" is the prelude to the widely known \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" series. It is one of few preludes, in my mind, that is actually effective. In the book the reader finds out much about J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"Middle Earth,\\" and has insight into its following books. This story faintly foreshadows many things that are to take place in the upcoming trilogy. However, for those of you who have read the book amd trilogy, you will have noticed the difference in Tolkiens voice and personality in \\"The Hobbit.\\"In my opinion \\"The Hobbit\\" is much lighter and not as dramatic as \\"The Lord of the RIngs.\\" It has serious parts no doubt, but the prelude seems to be more of a pleasing and joyful story, where as the trilogy focuses more on a moral and getting a message across to the reader. I enjoy both reads, but when you are in need of something that will brighten you up and excite your imagination as well, \\"The Hobbit\\" is definetely the better way to goI guess you could also say that's why i enjoyed \\"The Hobbit\\" more than most books out at the moment. Lately all authors have been focused on is creating something,\\" brutally honest!\\" or ,\\"heart-wrenching!\\" and ,\\"so sad i wanted to cry!\\" Sure, those things are good in some parts of a book, but if all the book your reading does is make you even more sad than you already were... what's the point in reading it? And as for it being \\"brutally honest,\\"... well lets just say somethings are better left unsaid,and definetely better left unknown.As I said earlier, that's what is different about this book though. It seems that Tolkien was simply recording his fantasies about the most appealing and envied life-style we can imagine, then creating a story based around that dream. Then he took it further and created this entrancing tale into a epic saga getting an important and major point across to the readers of the book. The whole collection of stories is simply amazing, and it's hard to believe that one man can come up with all these details and individual tales of fiction.Enough about the series though, I'd like to talk more about the book at hand. \\"The Hobbit\\" starts with an explanation of our good friend Bilbo Baggins and his dwelling within the earth. It takes a moment to explain to us just a little bit about the life-style of a hobbit, and the Shire that they dwell in. The first chapter waists no time introducing the true story however, and after the brief explanation of a hobbit it jumps into the tale. In the next two chapters we have already left the Shire, and surprisingly Bilbo has been accompinied by 13 dwarves and an old wise wizard name Gandalf. In no time at all the reader has entered the Misty Mountains to the West and read as the company of travelers encounter orcs within the mountains.In the mountains, perhaps the most major part of the book takes place; Bilbo discovers the Ring. With the discovery of the ring, he also comes across an odd creature that later turns out to be known by the name of Gollum. Both of these discoveries are key points with in the entire prelude and trilogy.Once out of the mountains, the company meets a giant of a man named Beorn, and with his warnings proceeds into the Mirkwood Forrest.The story then goes on to tell of the expeditions capture by the elves of Mirkwood, and their encounter with Dragon, Orc, Goblins, Wolves, and more. To end the book the group of hobbit, wizard, and dwarf ends up with a vast amount of jewls and riches(which was their original goal to start out with) and has Bilbo return to his home in the shire safe, yet not untouched.Altogether i think the story of Bilbo was successful in being a book new and different for its time. It proved to be a happier and more enjoyable read than almost anything i can think of at this point in the world. And it surely opened up a new world to readers and introduced the magical world of Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In a mythical or maybe just forgotten time, many creatures lived in places like the Shire, home to Bilbo Baggins, Hobbit.

You will recognize the personalities and grow along will Bilbo as he faces new challenges as he learns to deal with life.A good book to read first would be \\"The Power of Myth\\" by Joseph Campbell. Then you get a clearer picture of why the story progresses as it does."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit reminds me of nothing so much as a well turned bedtime story. It is a book I've enjoyed reading again and again since I was a teenager."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a charming and complete-in-its-own prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Full of adventures and excitement, but without the weight of such a complicated set of story lines as the Lord of the Rings series.

Great cover, good binding, and nothing at all wrong with it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I wanted to reread this book while camping, but did not want to bring my 1960's version. This fit the bill for what I needed in both condition and price."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Very well written, which makes the story seem somewhat better than it actually is. Still, it's not bad, and I probably actually enjoyed it more as an adult than I did the last time I read it as a kid.As to this audio edition, Rob Inglis's narration is quite good---I enjoyed listening to his characterizations and performances of the songs and so forth. Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In his book, The Hobbit, J.R.R. Tolkien does a masterful job of telling the story of the Bilbo Baggins and his adventures with the dwarves. Though The Hobbit is an outstanding piece of writing by itself, it has far more depth behind it than just a fanciful tale. The Hobbit is the prequel to the Lord of the Rings saga--though it was written last--and is written from a unique standpoint that is not familiar to the other books.The Hobbit, though written by Tolkien, is portrayed as being written from the perspective of Bilbo and is titled There and Back Again by the hobbit. This is an extremely interesting vantage point given to the reader as they receive first-hand account from Bilbo on all of the situations as well as have the chance to experience his thoughts on the adventures. This gives readers the feeling that they are actually being told an account of actual occurrences and they get to feel everything that Bilbo does during each exciting encounter, as well as his evolution from a simple hobbit into a \\"burglar\\". Tolkien authenticates that Bilbo is the author by adding in personal commentary on the side such as \\"You can believe me when I say that,\\" and \\"That I can assure you\\". Through Bilbo, Tolkien describes the melancholy, comfortable life led by most all hobbits and how they shunned any sort of adventure. He then proceeds to show throughout the story how Bilbo gains confidence as well as a love for adventure that turns him into an almost unrecognizable character by the end of the book.Another aspect of the book that added to its effectiveness as a whole was its actual content. Since the book was written last in the series, fans would have had questions as to how the ring of power came into the picture before the release of The Hobbit. This book not only entertains readers with constant action and suspense but introduces the origin of the ring and how Bilbo attained it in Golum's lair. It also goes further into depth and shows how Bilbo received his sword, Sting, and gave it its name as well as his mithril armor, both of which he passes down to Frodo--his nephew--in The Fellowship of the Ring. Tolkien also does an excellent job at describing the times in which the book is set in. To someone who just picked up the book without foreknowledge of the Lord of the Rings would find it extremely bizarre that animals can talk and how the dragons and goblins and dwarves and hobbits come into the story. However, the manner in which Tolkien casually describes and introduces these characters gives the reader the perception that it is totally normal for such things to be in Middle Earth. To one who has read all of the books related to the Lord of the Rings as well as prequels to them, such as The Silmarillion and The Children of Hurin, one can identify the time in which the story is set and how things changed between the time of The Hobbit and that of the start of the Lord of the Rings.The Hobbit is a work of literature that is entertaining enough in itself to cause anyone reading Tolkien's series for the first time to become absorbed in it, yet at the same time the book has enough detail and depth that one who has read all of the related books will find themselves enthralled and deeply satisfied at the book's conclusion."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I must have bought my paperback edition (Ballantine Books) back in 1966 when this particular edition came out. The pages are yellowed and dog earred and yet, I can read the pages of this edition. I still love the maps of the Wilderland and Desolation of Smaug. I still have the cover, although it's long since detached itself from the book binding. But now that I know there's an annotated Hobbit--well, perhaps it's time for a new edition.I always knew there was something different about the Hobbit from The Lord of the Rings.After reading some of the reviews, my mind has been set at ease. It's simply, Hobbit was written for children, The Lord of the Rings for adults. (although in my opinion older chldren could love both of them. If they can plough through 900 pages of Harry Potter books, they certainly can read LOTR.The Hobbit is simply delightful. What's a hobbit? A small creature around waist high (maybe) who adores pipes, good food and comfort. He has furry toes and goes barefoot.One day, when Bilbo Baggins (hobbit) was ejoying the things hobbits enjoy, Gandolph the Gray (wizard) comes calling to invite Bilbo on an adventure. Bilbo is reluctant. No adventures for him. Hobbits simply do not like adventures. But, to get rid of the pest and enjoy his creature comforts once again, he agrees. Hoping that Gandolph and his friends that would be coming would NOT come.Not so. The next day, one by one, twelve dwarves and finally Gandolph spill into Bilbo'shouse. And, so begins the adventure, which lead them to a dragon called Smaug, the dwarves stolen treasure and a ring, which Bilbo wins in a contest from a cave dwelling creature named Gollum. The ring sets off the trilogy LOTR.The book was written in 1937 by J.R.R. Tolkien who taught at Pembrooke College, Oxford, from 1925 unti 1945. His specialty was Anglo-Saxon and then as Merton Professor of English Language and Literature. Other works include: Farmer Giles of Ham, The Adventures of 'Tom Bombadil and LOTR. He has a marvelous sense of humor, even when things seem the blackest.Bilbo's role as a \\"burgler\\" is hilarious. And even though Bilbo is no burgler, he seems to fall into the role every time the dwarves end up in trouble.I give this five stars because I love it and it really is a classic.Patricia A.

Even though they are not ones to venture out looking for trouble, it seems to have come to \\" Mr. Baggins \\".I enjoyed all the detail about \\" Hobbit Lifestyle \\" and would like to learn even more in detail."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I purchased the Kindle edition of The Hobbit and it was a really nice read for a change from more serious and deeper books I've been into recently. This is purely an adventure book so none of the characters except Bilbo's get any development worth mentioning, but then again this is a book for children and Tolkien himself said so. I found the story to be great, it had great great turns and even a couple of (almost) surprising twists; it definitely kept my attention. Tolkien's writing is really good too, I found it fairly easy to read as an ESL person. The only problem I found, and I don't know if it's just me, but - does Tolkien not know how to use his commas very well?Regardless, I think this book is worthy of five stars. I would recommend it to children and any adult with interest in fantasy (though I know a few that didn't like it)."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"With 667 reviews and pending ~~ I better keep mine short and sweet so the reader won't get overwhelmed!I tried reading J.R.R.

Just pick this book up and get lost in Tolkien's magical world!1-17-02"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a book that can be enjoyed by all, but is mainly appreciated by two very seperate audiences. As a fairy tale style story it can be read to young children and generally enjoyed, but the true depth of the story is mainly appreciated by those old enough to read between the lines and understand what an amazing and detailed world Tolkien has created and placed this story in.Unfortunetly, the &quot;bed-time story&quot; style of writing can put off some older and most young adult or teen readers who find the book too childish for their likings. To anyone who feels this way after reading through a few pages all I can say is this - allow yourself to get past the all of that. Pay attention to the great characters and excellent story. And then look deeper and appreciate the wonderful and deep world Tolkien has created. From Bilbo's Hobbit-hole to the Last Homely House to Smaug's Lair every location is detailed and rich with character.If you haven't read The Hobbit, go read it right now. If you've already read it, then I'm sure you can understand everything I'm saying. If you don't, then read it again. This is a book that, on the first read, is an incredibly entertaining, original, and creative story. And every subsequent read allows you to peel away more layers and see deeper into the world of Middle-earth. And once you begin to see just how incredible a place it is, you should go on and read The Lord of the Rings - a novel that allows you to delve even further into the mythology and provides yet another eminently enjoyable story that anyone can (and should) love."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A big world of magic, fayries, dragons, dwarves, elves and other creatures has been described in this book of travels.The way in wich Tolkien describes these characters is of an unbelievable and honoust way of writing, so pure ,so precise in detail and character,as if true, as if alive,as if these travels of Bilbo could have once be described in your primary school historybooks. Looking at the maps,seeing all the sequals of this book, all the information available, it as a truly magical book that will keep you intrigued all the way through,it certainly has got me hooked on Tolkien for life!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a great book all by itself, but this nice edition makes it even better. It has a nice leather cover, good paper, and drawings by Tolkien himself! When I look at it, I want to read it again and again! I really advise you to buy this edition."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Looking to be drawn into a portal that leads to the world of fantasy? Tolkien's The Hobbit will take your imagination on a wonderful, magnificent flight of fantasy and enchantment that it has never experienced before. Starting with the first page, Tolkien will grab your attention and reel you further and further away from reality and into this magical world he has created. This world is like none other, and is described right down to the mountains that surround it and the sky that engulfs it. Tolkien describes exactly what's happening in every scene and enables you to picture every plant, every cloud in the sky, and every character depicted in such a way that you will never forget. The storyline is so extremely fascinating and addicting, that you won't want to put down the book. Tolkien's attention to detail is magnificent, and his imagery is outstanding. The action scenes are extremely suspenseful, and they force you to read on in order to see what will happen next.The Hobbit is one of the best books I've ever read, and I recommend it to people all ages, especially those who have an interest toward mythology and fantasy. Don't get the conception from the front cover that this is a child's book, for it is far from that. The Hobbit not only will titillate your imagination, it will reflect certain truths about the real world. The Hobbit addresses the problem of determining the \\"right\\" way for a hobbit, or any ordinary person, to live his life. Should one concern himself with great deeds and wars, and risk losing the humble perspective afforded by the simple life? Or should the ordinary person never look outside his or her own quiet existence, and risk ignoring the larger perspective that might have allowed him to do great things for the common good? My advice is to go ahead and read the book and see how you feel, for if you don't you'll miss the adventure of a lifetime."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The first time I read this book, I thought it was soooo boring, and just forced myself to plow through it (it was a Christmas gift from my brother, and I didn't want to hurt his feelings) I ended up skimming a good portion of it, and feeling that it was a waste of time. A couple of months later, I blew off the dust and made the decision to really READ it. I couldn't believe all the good stuff I had missed. I loved it. Skimming doesn't seem to work for this series, unless you've read them before.Anyway, The Hobbit was a great book. It was filled with quirky descriptions and personalities, and even the songs and poems are interesting (most of the time :-). Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, unexpectedly finds himself on a mission with Gandalf, the great wizard, and a bunch of arguing dwarves. Their mission: to find the treasure of Thorin's (head dwarf, descended from kings) ancestors and desolate Smaug, the feared dragon of The Mountain. Bilbo's occupation is a thief; not swiping radios from the nearest department store, but helping the company retrieve the treasure.Though doubtful at first, the dwarves begin to admire Bilbo in his talent to get out of nasty scrapes (of which there are several). Bilbo proves his honor, though being &quot;just&quot; a little hobbit, and nearly everyone leaves happy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit: a young hobbit (by their standards) by the name of Bilbo Baggins is thrown into a great adventure with the 13 dwarves and the wizard Gandalf the Grey. Their quest is to go to the misty mountains and reclaim the treasure and let their dwarf leader Thorin take back his throne. They were driven away by the evil dragon smaug many years ago now they are back. Yet, the most important thing that happens in the quest has nothing to do with any of this, although it will change the world forever...I recommend this book, because it is an epic fantasy that is so well written and truly mind boggling. Tolkien takes you were you never could have gone with out him; he takes you to a different world. That seems almost realer than ours. If you like fantasy you will cherish this book.By: Michael"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien intended \\"The Hobbit\\" to be a children's story, and the matter-of-fact writing style in which it was written makes this rather apparent. Nevertheless, the prelude to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is endowed with its own special magic that captures the attention and imagination of its readers and takes them to a place that is as real as it is fantasy: a place of hobbits and dwarves, a place of trolls and elves, of spiders and dragons, of heroes and goats. In fact, Middle Earth can be likened to the whereabouts of our own subconsciousness and its function as the battleground for competing human emotions and values.As the story opens, we are introduced to a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, a creature not unlike a munchkin in appearance but perhaps less squeaky in voice. Passive and gentle, he is recruited by the mysterious wizard Gandalf to contrast the abrasive nature of Thorin and Co. (a group of dwarves on a quest to recapture their stolen treasure from the clutches of Smaug the Dragon). How can this unassuming and timid little being possibly be the protagonist? Indeed, he is of little value early in the dwarves' quest. Yet Bilbo's latent desires for adventure (attributed to his Took side, as we are so informed) are slowly awakened, and soon we are taken aback by his ability to manipulate enemies and rescue his friends time and time again. Still, it's hard to root for the dwarves, controlled as they are by their greed and selfishness, and eventually they have to pay for their sins. It may be too late before Thorin and Co. come to value the hobbit's appreciation for cheer and brotherhood over gold and other material possessions. Is not unity and charity better than suspicion and avarice?Some may bicker that Tolkien's approach is too straightforward. And granted, \\"The Hobbit\\" isn't very Dickensian when it comes to names. Heck, one of the huge, ugly trolls the dwarves encounter is called William. With a name like that, I had trouble picturing a troll at all and thought he might start up a conversation with, \\"Excuse me my dear Thomas, but it appears you have some mutton on your face. Care for some more tea and crumpets?\\" Irrespective of a handful of critics, however, most readers will come to love \\"The Hobbit\\" for its enchanting scenic representation of Middle Earth, its memorable characters (especially Gollum and Beorn) and its original storytelling. Best of all is it's wonderful simplicity and an opening that's as a portal to escapism: \\"In the hole in the ground there lived a hobbit...\\""},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the book that started it all. Tolkien tells an enchanting and magical tale about the journey's of one Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo gets into all kinds of trouble with the band of 13 dwarves he must accompany. There are elves, dragons, goblins, and wizards in this book; everything that makes fantasy great. This is an excellent book to read if you are just starting to read the fantasy genre. It really has everything. I made the mistake of stopping after the first 50 or so pages. A few months later, I picked it up again and it blew me away. I read the last 100+ pages in only two days. It turns into a real page turner towards the end. Please pick up this book and you will be whisked away to the enchanting land Tolkien creates. It's a great escape from the day-to-day drone we are used to."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is great! It should be a cornerstone for future authors so they may know what true writing is all about! The book portrays the adventures of a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins as he is hired on a quest for treasure. He finds courage and adventure in him he never knew existed until he travelled from his home to the lonely mountain, where the treasure is along with a dragon, and many more trials and tribulations on the long journey in between. I HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone and everyone. This book has such a faced pace edge to it that the action never stops. As soon as you think that the character couldn't possibly entangle hisself in any more ordeals, the story takes a new twist and has you on the edge of your seat. You will find yourself wanting to be right alongside the title character, Bilbo Baggins, fighting goblins and puzzling a nightmarish creature named Gollum! This book was so well written and the detail tolkein put into this book makes it immortal. You can see everything that tolkein saw when he wrote this book. I commend tolkein for such an outstanding job he did with this book. I am now a true believer in the magic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was very imaginative and had a lot of depth.

It is the story of a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, the unlikliest of heros. He is lured into a journey by the wizard Gandalf, and lives through the adventures with the help of his comapanions, a band of thirteeen dwarves. Everything from magical swords, to goblins, elves, riddles, and the most famous dragon ever to take wing, The Hobbit shines above all other fantasy novels of its time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It all starts off with Bilbo Baggins a jolly, plump little hobbit who goes on a journey in a far away land. He starts off with 12 dwarfs and one mysterious old wizard. He meets dangerous animals and is almost attacked and killed by wood elves. The hobbit saves his friends many times from horrible situations and in the end there is a large battle and a winner emerges. Bilbo, the main character, is an intelligent, but frightened hobbit who turns out to be a hero in the end of the book. I would definitely recommend this book to someone who is interested in magical journeys and far away places. It had a funny beginning, interesting characters and a happy ending. The book overall was very good and is one of my favorites. The book makes you feel like you are right in the middle of their journey with Bilbo.

He is defintely the last person you would send off on a dangerous journey. When Gandalf the wizard stops by in search of someone to share an adventure with, Bilbo doesn't know what he is getting into. Soon thirteen dwarves arrive on the hobbits doorstep in search of a burglar and before he is prepared he is wisked out the door and off on and adventure. The dwarves' main goal is to return their home in the Lonely Mountains and reclaim their stolen fortune from the dragon Smaug who long ago demolished the dwarves home there. Along the way they meet giant spiders, evils, horrifying wolves, and a subterranean creature named Gollum from which Bilbo wins a magical ring. By the time Bilbo returns to his home he is a completely different person and ready for bigger more dangerous adventures This is a great book full of adventure.

If you do, you'll love The Hobbit, written by J.J. R. Tolkien. This novel is full of suspense, peril, and adventure. You don't know what will happen next. Mr. Baggins (Bilbo), a hobbit, has a variety of adventures from being assaulted by trolls to being trapped in a cave. The adventure starts when a magical wizard meets Bilbo offering him adventure that he politely refuses, only to find himself tagging along the next day. Bilbo finds that the adventure he has been assigned to is full of peril, and he desires more than once that he could be back in his comfortable hobbit hole. Accompanying him on his adventure are thirteen dwarfs. The dwarfs get into more trouble than Bilbo himself, and he saves their lives more than once. Gandalf (the wizard) helps them on their way, but only for a short while because he also has business that must be taken care of.

Tolkin in 1937. It tells a tale of high adventure, undertaken by a company of dwarves and a rather unlikely (and somewhat unwilling) Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, who would rather have been sitting in his easy chair at home watching his tea kettle come to a boil than be off in search of gold and jewels guarded by a very much alive and deadly dragon. Along the way, this band of travelers enjoy some good fellowship around the campfire, as well as run into some trolls, goblins, elves, and giant spiders. The story takes place about 60 years before the story of The One Ring.While written as a story for his children, the tale ultimately has an objective, and that is to teach children that unbridled lust and greed, coupled with obsession, can have diasterous consequences. Here it is shown in Thorin's lust for gold and precious jewels. His unwillingness to do what is right and just leads to a World War in Middle Earth, with all the major powers and some of the minor ones taking part. Ultimately, it leads not only to his own death, but to the death's of his sister's children and to the deaths of uncounted thousands of other dwarves, elves, goblins, men, and other creatures.The version I am reviewing is the Kindle edition, made available on April 19th, 2009. It is remarkably free of typographical errors. It is also illustrated, in black and white of course. Though the drawings are not too useful on the Kindle 2, they may be useful when viewed on the Kindle DX, because they are full page illustrations. Here you are on your own, for I cannot say with certainty that it would be so."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've been a huge Tolkien fan since I was a kid, and have collected a tremendous amount of various editions of his books in various forms over the years, so I figured I'd heard it all and seen it all. I will admit that I have only read the introduction and skimmed the book so far, but what I have seen and read opens a whole new chapter in my understanding of this book.This book is printed for the 70th anniversary of The Hobbit's original release, and includes a brief introduction by Tolkien's son Christopher. The text also has been updated to account for various corrections through the years from Tolkien and his publishers. What I liked best about this edition is it includes drawings and color illustrations by the man himself, J. R. R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Looking for a good book to read? If boredom comes knocking at the door, reading The Hobbit is a great excuse for staying put! In 1937, J. R. R. Tolkien wrote this classic book as a prelude to his vision for the upcoming Lord of the Rings series. Originally, The Hobbit was not a well-liked book, but when The Fellowship of the Ring was released, it became exceptionally popular because readers realized that The Hobbit filled a gap. This book recaps in detail events, which the trilogy only brushed upon. Questions are answered. Definitely, The Hobbit will be cherished by new and experienced readers alike.The story begins. One day, Bilbo's doorbell rang with mysterious, unexpected visitor. Bilbo was a hobbit, which is a creature that looks like a very short human. Living in a forest called the Shire with a large colony of other hobbits, Bilbo lived in a house carved into a small knoll. Hobbits are known for their love of simplicity and dislike of change; however, Bilbo was about to be thrust into an adventure whether he wanted to or not. When he opened the door, he found that his visitor was a wizard named Gandalf. Unquestionably, Gandalf was a good man because he protected the innocent and foiled malicious schemes. After a particularly long discussion, he finally persuaded Bilbo to go questing across the land with him and thirteen dwarfs to rightfully recover an ancient dwarf treasure of gold and silver. Years ago, the treasure had been stolen and hidden in a mountain fortress where it was now guarded by an evil, fire-breathing dragon. Although Bilbo was reluctant to go with Gandalf, the excitement was as exhilarating as the moment when a child learns he or she is going to Disneyland. He was going questing.Shortly after leaving the Shire, Bilbo and the rest of the travelers encountered the first major obstacle of the time-consuming, tedious trip. To leave the Shire, a traveler would have to travel over a secluded, dangerous mountain, which only had one small, curving road. The travelers were in peril. This road was known to be inhabited by goblins, but no one knew for sure since no one had ever returned; however, the traveler's fears were confirmed. They were separated and ensnared by goblins. While trying to escape, Bilbo stumbled upon an underground lake and found the Ring of Power. For those not familiar with the history of the Ring, the others books go into more detail because the Ring is more important, but the main idea is it makes its wearer invisible. Using the Ring, Bilbo was able to save his friends and allow them all to escape. After traversing and barely surviving an enchanted forest, the travelers were finally at their destination. However, there was still one more challenge ahead of them: the evil, fire-breathing dragon Smaug, who was the guardian of the treasure.Normally, if a treasure hunter endeavored to enter the ancient mountain stronghold, he would have to survive a passage through a giant wood gate, because it was the only entrance to the city. However, the dwarfs knew of another entrance, which had only been used for a secret escape route. Using this underground entrance and the Ring, the dwarfs, Bilbo, and Gandalf were able to enter without Smaug knowing, or so they thought. When they tried to remove the treasure, the battle began. However, Smaug was not the only one who was fighting the dwarfs. When the Elves and Men who lived in the area heard about the treasure, and that the dwarfs were trying to take it all, they wanted their share. In reality, the treasure belonged to the dwarfs as it had been stolen from them, but the Elves and Men were covetous and wanted more wealth. It would seem that the thirteen Dwarfs, a hobbit, and a lone wizard would be wiped out by the massive armies, but Gandalf's timely intervention saved the party. Because he was up high in the mountain, he could see for miles in a panoramic view. Another army was coming, an army of goblins and dark wolves! Realizing that in order to survive they would have to settle past differences, the Men, Elves, Dwarfs, Gandalf, and Bilbo made up past differences and proceeded to ride to battle. Will Bilbo survive the battle? Will differences be settled? Will good triumph? Reading the book is the only way to find out whether Bilbo and the Ring survive.Reading The Hobbit is a great activity, which people of all ages will enjoy. After people try to comprehend the original books, they often complain, \\"The Lord of the Rings trilogy is grueling to read as it is difficult to follow the plotline.\\" The Hobbit is different. Apparently, Tolkien tried hard to make The Hobbit more appealing to a broader audience. The plot is easy to follow and the characters are well explained. Personally, the only thing that this book needs is a movie because the others become great movies, and The Hobbit would probably be even better. When this charismatic fantasy novel has been completely read, any reader will agree that The Hobbit is a great book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I was in fourth or fifth grade, every afternoon we'd have private reading time. One kid in our class had a copy of this book called \\"The Hobbit\\", with this smug looking dragon on the front guarding some glowing gold. Between the pages of his book there was a bookmark with a royal red tassell on the end. I was more interested in the bookmark at the time, but I'd never forget that image. For ages I thought a hobbit was a type of dragon!A couple of years later, my younger brother got into Tolkien and would tell me bits and pieces about \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings\\" (the riddles, the heroes, Gollum, etc). One of my Dad's friends was into Tolkien and Middle Earth too. I had an encyclopedia of works of fantasy, and they spoke of Tolkien like he'd hung the moon. I was into fantasy, but looking at the covers, thick volumes, and the elven language everywhere, I avoided Tolkien's books. For ages, the only work of his I'd looked at had been \\"The Father Christmas Letters\\", which I thought was all right. I saw the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies, tried to follow them, though I ended up falling asleep halfway through \\"Return of the King\\". Though to be fair, I hadn't got much sleep the night before I saw that one.What was wrong with me? Fantasy lovers seemed to get so much out of Tolkien, but I could never catch on, try as I could. I tried one last time the other day, picking up a copy of \\"The Hobbit\\". Tolkien had written this as a children's story, so maybe I might be able to plug into his world a little easier here. I was right, and I did. It's a pretty good book.The book is all about a hobbit (a quiet, short creature with hairy feet) named Bilbo Baggins. He's very friendly, very helpful and a something of a homebody. He lives in a world full of all sorts of magic and wonder, but he has no interest in adventures. Or does he? Gandalf the wizard seems to think he'd be quite an adventurer, a burglar in fact. Gandalf is so confident about this that he's gone and invited thirteen dwarves to Bilbo's house. Gandalf has told them that Bilbo is going to lead them back to their ancestor's homeland, to get back both their treasure and territory guarded by Smaug the dragon. Despite the promise of a share in the plunder, Bilbo is not at all interested. Still, he gets dragged along, and after facing trolls, goblins, wolves, elves and giant spiders, becomes all the more stronger a hobbit for it.I think the main reason I'd been so put off by the idea of Tolkien's work is the way that others have interpreted it. Peter Jackson's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films, for example, are all in washed out, filtered or pastel colours and are full of mud, sweat, metal and bleakness. I found this book showed Tolkien's fantasy world to look nothing at all like that. In the book of \\"The Hobbit\\" the dwarves wear bright hoods, the autumn leaves are a deep red, enchanted waters are a mysterious black, the gems in Smaug's cave reflect light in every colour of the spectrum. There's a flavour to the work that's just absent in about every interpretation I've seen of the work. It's hard to put a finger on it. C.S. Lewis described such moments as \\"the joy\\" and \\"northerness\\". It's like behind every object, every tree, there's something deeper. This is a world you can get lost in. The narrative is warm and witty, as if your grandfather was telling it to you, complete with asides and hints at the story to come, which was nice. There is something of a twist at the end, with a message within the twist. It's not what you'd expect, and it may disappoint some, but I found it to be rather interesting.J.R.R. Tolkien was a Anglo-Saxon language professor of at Oxford university, and it really shows. He's very particular about the words he uses. Check out the way that Gandalf tells Bilbo off for his vague use of \\"good morning\\", for instance. There's a lot of plays on words too, and lots of poetry. I haven't read as much ancient and classic literature as I'd have liked to, but I can see elements of what I have read in the Hobbit. Beowulf, one of the oldest stories in the Anglo-Saxon language, (and one I've read) features great halls, feasting and battles with a horrible beast by water, and so does \\"The Hobbit\\".I heard that during the 1960s a lot of the trendier types were into to Tolkien (the Beatles had wanted to make a movie around one of his works, for example). \\"The Hobbit\\" has strange creatures, unusual names and a wizard who can puff mulitcoloured smoke rings which he can command, so I do kind of understand why this happened. Kind of funny actually. I also think it's funny that throughout the book Bilbo is caught in a fantastic place, longing to be in his warm and cosy home, while Mr Tolkien was probably in his warm and cosy home writing, longing to be in a fantastic place.The edition of the book I read came with illustrations and a couple of maps, I'm guessing drawn by Tolkien himself, as there's no other credit for them. They also added to the depth and the \\"northerness\\" of the story.\\"The Hobbit\\" I can see now has been rather influential on the world of modern fantasy. Joe Dever's \\"Lone Wolf: Flight from the Dark\\" features green scaly Giaks riding Doomwolves, similar to the goblins and the wolves they ride in Tolkien's work. Dever's sequel \\"Fire on the Water\\" features a mountain with a cave going through it, rather like Smaug's mountain. J.K. Rowling's \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" has a dark forest full of giant spiders, as does the Hobbit. I could go on listing examples, but I think my review's getting a bit long.I'll probably get round to reading \\"The Lord of The Rings\\", but before I do I'll probably get my hands on one of those Middle Earth inspired prog rock CDs (Jon Anderson's \\"In Elven Lands: The Fellowship\\", Glass Hammer's \\"The Middle Earth Album\\", etc) get some atmosphere going.Recommended to lovers of fantasy and adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Back in the late 1970's, in an era when radio drama was disappearing from public radio, the American prodcution of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; were created with a full cast of voice actors along with music and sound effects. Reminiscent of the radio dramas of the 1940's and 50's, these productions were usually aired on Sunday afternoons, when a family could listen and enjoy the week's story. Released on Jabberwocky Audio on cassette tapes, I remember the Christmas when I received the entire collection of Jabberwocky's stories on tape. From &quot;The Hobbit&quot; to &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; to &quot;The Red Badge of Courage,&quot; all were classic tales. They even re-released on cassette some of the original radio productions, such as &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; and &quot;The Gift of the Magi.&quot; These stories were designed to get the listener interested and promote reading the books the productions were based on. They were not designed for an adult audience, but rather for children and families to share. Wonderfully edited and masterfully performed, many modern audiences find these old productions a little silly or even perhaps dated, but play it for a child, and they will listen in rapture, just as I did 25 years ago when they were new. Of all my collection of the Jabberwocky tapes, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; are the only ones that I have trouble playing today, because they have been played so many times over the years that they are worn out. We would play them in the car on road trips, I would play them in my room while putting together a puzzle, and I played them for my friends, who enjoyed them as much as I did. I am delighted to have it on CD to listen to over and over again. At seven years of age, I had not yet read the books when I first listened to the tapes. But the tapes were perfect for a small girl just getting interested in reading. If only all the rest of the old radio dramas were also on CD! I would buy them all. It was unfortunate to come to this website and see the poor reviews written by people who have no understanding of the history of the production or what demographic it was originally intended for. I look forward to the day when I can play these CD's for my own children and see the wonder and delight in their faces when they hear the same stories that I grew up with."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed The Annotated Hobbit when it was first released in the late 1980s, and when I heard it was to be re-released at first I thought I wouldn't bother with another copy. Then I saw the new edition and was amazed. There are many, many more notes, pictures of different editions, and illustrations in general. So even if you have the first edition, this is well worth the price.The real joy of reading an annotated book, especially one as beloved as The Hobbit, is the additional insight one gets into the author's &quot;creative juices&quot; or as Tokien himself said &quot;the leaf mould of the mind.&quot; The Annotated Hobbit is additionally valuable in this respect because Tokien was a painstaking and thorough author, who concerned himself with every niggling detail of his world and of the concrete details of his book's publication."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Masterpiece. A work of Art. A lasting piece down through the ages. How ever you look at this book, it is all those things and more. Most notable is the endurance that this book has, lasting over sixty years and still a favorite of millions, perhaps billions.The story is that of Mr. Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit. Hobbits are peaceful creatures who live in and around Hobbiton. One day, Bilbo is approached by Gandalf, a wizened wizard who sees Bilbo as a necessary force for the gathering of a party of dwarves bent on revenge and getting back gold stolen from them by Smoag, a nasty dragon. In the midst of this party and all that they encounter upon their journey to the Lonely Mountain (where the treasure of Smoag and Smoag himself lay) they encounter other forces, strange creatures -- some friendly and some very unfriendly. Deadly spiders, Trolls, Goblins, Wolves round out the deadly enemies. Elves, Men, Elrond half-Elvin, Byorn, and dwarves, round out the good guys. And of course, we can't forget Gollum...the dispicable creature within the Misty Mountains whom Bilbo encounters and gains the ultimate power over the lands....the RING! A magic ring that renders it's wearer invisible, but also takes part of the person away (as you learn in later books). But the Ring is mainly a sideline to the main story which is the success of good against evil thanks to a little, nothing of a Hobbit. Even the smallest of creatures can have a monumental impact, is what Mr. Tolkien was trying to tell us I think. That, and don't judge a book by it's cover.Enjoyable in everyway and a book to pass on to your children and their children. Please read it! It will change you, just as it changed the lands before humankind."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a great book, if you can follow what's going on. I am a student who has read the book separetly from school, twice, and I am angry that other students have written inadequate reviews. The first time I read this, when I was eight, I was not following and comprehending what I was reading and would simply scan over all the pages, so of course it was boring, but I knew that I wasn't paying attention, so I didn't think badly of it unlike the other students who have taken the liberty of writing their opinions to Amazon. The second time I read it, I payed attention while I was reading and enjoyed the book. For those students which have disgraced The Hobbit's average rating, if they they didn't pay attention or missed a day in class, the book would be boring when it shouldn't. If you had to read The Hobbit for accademic purposes, please do not display your opinion as it has probably been damaged by the educational process."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I'm am 13 years old and I have read this book 37 times! I loveit! It is an excellent book to read if you love fantasy. I love Elvesand Dragons. And most of the creatures of Middle Earth are so original and captivating that one can't help but love them. This book was one I could not put down! The detail makes it a difficult book for some, but if you have time on your hands it is a good suggestion. And the Lord of the Rings continuing afterwards is even better, but the Hobbit is a sort of introductory to these books as well as a story in it's own. I highly recommend that you not think about reading it and go on! You won't be disappointed! It is a masterpiece, a novel telling the story of Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves, Goblins, Men, a Dragon and a wizard called Gandalf. It transports you to the mystical land of Middle Earth where only your door seperates you from adventure and danger. It is very imaginative as well as wonderous. An absolute must-read! -Bonnie Adams"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I mean no offence but I am not going to review The Hobbit as a novel, I find it quite a useless task.Let's only say that it is a beautiful book, admirably suited for kids from 10 years on, provided you were able to teach them to read and you manage to get them away from their Playstation.This edition, though expensive, is a good one: paper is fine, print is fairly good, the binding is solid enough.Illustrations are those by the author, so they will not excite joy screams from your kids.This edition, in my opinion, is perfect for youngsters who love their books and keep them safe from rain and ketchup and for any adult who wish an average hardback edition of a wonderful tale."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This story has non stop action in every chapter.

It's a great tale of survival through untold hardships, when all seems to have failed, and yet, a little luck, and a little perseverance sees them through.The Hobbit is a great introduction into Tolkein's world and a great set up for the Lord Of The Rings.

The Hobbit is a timeless masterpiece, and it will thrill readers for years to come. The main character, Mr. Bilbo Baggins, is a quirky little hobbit on a rather remarkable quest. He takes the reader over mountains, across rivers, and through battles. This book is nonstop excitement from start to finish. I highly suggest this novel to anyone looking for an adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is an example of fantasy fiction, including fictitious races and legendary creatures like elves, dwarves, and dragons. Bilbo in the The Hobbit is someone we can relate to strongly, even though he is not human. The theme of The Hobbit is tha an ordinary person (or hobbit) can do extraordinary things. This is an importnat theme in literature because we, as ordinary people need to oknow that we can do extraordinary things when called upon to do so."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a fantastic tale that will cleverly intertwine your reality with The Middle Earth.

Not only will it provide the backdrop for the LOTR, it will provide a action-filled tale that is sometimes overlooked in the world of fantasy literature."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a very entertaining read and the prelude to The Lord of the Rings Saga. I never give any plot \\"spoilers\\", I'll just say it's the introduction of the great character Bilbo Baggins, and he takes you on quite an adventure after a visit from Gandalf the Wizard. What I like is it's much easier to follow the story compared to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The Hobbit has a more simple yet adventurous plot, but in many ways it's better than the other Tolken books, because in the Lord of the Rings trilogy that follows, there are so many places and names, it's easy to get tired of remembering everything (something that's less of a burden in the feature films too) you feel as though you have to take notes to keep along with the story, with The Hobbit, you won't feel it's unnecessarily convoluted with characters and places, and the novel is just as exciting as the others to read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I found this book quite by accident, while being at the library looking for something completely different. Having heard of this book before, I read a few pages, and I started to get hooked. The book is about a little hobbit known as Bilbo Baggins and it follows his adventures around Tolkien's magical world. Gandalf and some dwarves head out to fight goblins, trolls, spiders, and many other creatures, all for a chance at untold riches. However the treasure is guarded by a cruel dragon known as Smaug. I enjoy Tolkien's writing style and I especially love his humor. This is probably one of the finest books he has written. It is a shame how you can hear the cash register ring as every subsequent book was written. The Hobbit is not the easiest read however, and Tolkien's colorful use of words can be hard to follow at times. I would recommend this book to anyone who already enjoys Tolkien's works and to any fantasy lover. This book easily makes the 5 out of 5 mark for me."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is one of my favorite books of all time. Perhaps it is because I read it as a child, and it first introduced me to dwarves and elves in a way far different from their Disney counterparts. Perhaps it was the humanity of characters laid out for me to see. I am not sure exactly what it was, but after rereading it for the upteenth time, it still has not lost a smidgen of its charm.Sure, Lord of the Rings is the serious book, the more adultish, more classic quest fantasy to save the world from mortal peril sort of thing. The Hobbit is more of a quest to save Bilbo from living his life without a single thing happening that was unexpected. I think this central difference, combined with a younger target audience for this book, makes this book have a much more carefree attitude, and a generally much more merry tale.The pace of the Hobbit is pretty rapid, since really the journey of this story would have been of a similar length as Lord of the Rings, with a lot of detail simply missing from this book. The first leg of the journey was almost identical to Frodo's in route at least, yet it is over in a couple of chapters. Really, the lesser significance of this quest required a lot less development early on.What you really do see happen in the Hobbit, which is nearly absent in Lord of the Rings, is how a bit of a fussy homebody is changed into a daring and wise companion by means of the journey. Bilbo proved to be the lucky 'fourteenth' man on the quests of the dwarf Thorin to reclaim his homeland and treasure, and that was lucky for not only the dwarves, but for Bilbo himself. Even Gandalf discovered that there was more to Bilbo than meets the eye, as the hobbit proved himself useful in a lot of very different situations.It is a wonder to see a character develop like Bilbo during the course of a single novel. It is an exceedingly rare sight these days, to see something like this happen, and it is refreshing to see it again here.The songs in this book aren't the poet things from Lord of the Rings, but more like drinking songs with simple rhymes. This [songs] is not a favorite now a days, but I kinda like them. Trying to figure out a tune to go with each one is difficult at times, but it makes it that much better. You can always just skip them, like I did when I was a kid.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Some May have wanted a facimile of the first edition that was changed in later years to reflect the lord of the rings like printing the original riddles in the dark and so on.This has the same forward from the 1987 gold anniversary 50th edition.

The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings inspired me to become an English instructor and travel the world in search of adventure. Now, with all the talk of a \\"prequel\\" movie based on The Hobbit, I decided to go back and read it again. For a children's book there is an amazing relevance and persistence of indelible imagery untouched by the decades. The story's moral lessons about the destructiveness of greed and avarice are needed in this era of Wall Street bail-outs and 21st century piracy. My used copy arrived in good condition, but without the charming dust jacket designed by Tolkien.

I was fascinated by the story and have read the story on my own at least five times as well as the subsequent trilogy. The Hobbit accomplishes something few books can. It draws into an entirely different world, full of advenure, magic,and wonder. The characters are so believable and authentic that we treat them as if they really exist and we are just reading accounts of there deeds as if the book were a newspaper. This world is also an improvement on our own in that this world has clear cut heroes and villains and the issues it addresses are not muddled, but are presented in black and white.

I was suprised at how well the story was rounded, even though it had been translated into a cartoon. I had no idea, however, that the real magic of the story is told in the pages of Tolkien's masterpiece. When it was first published in 1937, the publisher and Tolkien had no idea that it would blossom and grow as it has (few authors think that their books will do as well as Tolkien's, and can only hope for the high mark which Mr. Tolkien has achieved.) Now, 62 years later, we find that it is perhaps THE most beloved book of the century.The well rounded plot and interesting, dynamic characters make &quot;The Hobbit&quot; the finist book in it's genre. Many other authors have tried to emulate Tolkien's masterful performance, but have all fallen utterly short of the high mark which Tolkien sites at. In my book, J.R.R.

It was almost addictive how he sets the mood for the next chapter. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Bilbo is detailed so well it is just like a movie and his description of the characters is astounding. The story just hooks you from the time of the party at Bilbo's home. I loved it and would recommend it for anyone with a sense of magination and adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I like this book because Bilbo(a chubby, furry footed character) is so unsuspecting of what is going to happen. He gets smarter as he is trapped on the long staircase of Smaug, and he fellow friends follow him to the the treasure. If you like books with adventure and fantasy characters, read this book and let Bilbo's adventures take over your mind!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Although I don't like fantasy very much and didn't truly like the plot of The Hobbit, I must say that it was well written and very good. The especially enjoyed Gollom. I read this book for school and at frist found it slow, but as we approched the Lone Mtn. I couldn't put it down.It was the first book I've ever read that's truly challenged me. I agree with a comment I saw earlier, the Hobbit wasn't written on the R. L. Stine, Gossebumps, three sentance-paragraphs level. This is a true novel. So what if the paragraphs are long? Grow up.I also think that I will read the Lord of the Rings tril. just so I get some challenging, school appropriate, GOOD literature for once, instead of R. L Stine and Co."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What else is there to say? The title explains it all. I don't think I've ever read a better book.

I really can't say how much I liked this book. I recomend this book to every one who likes adventures books."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I cannot speak highly enough of the Hobbit or Lord of the Rings. I have read many of the classics, such as Beowulf, Frankenstien, and Fahrenheit 451. As great as these books are, I believe that Tolkien's works rise far above.The Hobbit is a lighter adventure story, suitable for children, though even adults will find it a superb story. Tolkien's words paint a vivid picture of Middle Earth - of its beauty and its darkness. He does such an excellent job of portraying the characters that by the end of the book, you would be able to predict how any of them would react in a given situation. I believe that this is a book which would appeal even to people who think of fantasy literature as wierd and far-fetched. After you have read the Hobbit, which everyone capable of breathing should be required to do, run out and get Lord of the Rings and read it. This is a continuation of the story began by The Hobbit, and is a much darker tale. In L.O.T.R. we catch a glimpse of the deep and rich history of Middle Earth and its people. If you have not read any of these, then, by all means, stop what you're doing, order these books, shut yourself in a room, and don't come out until you've finished. You will be a better person because of it.Are you still reading this!? Weren't you listening? GO GET THESE BOOKS AND READ THEM NOW!!! You're only hurting yourself by delaying it, you know!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Okay, I think this is the 2nd best book in history! (The best being the lord of the rings). This thing says that you can read the lord of the rings without reading this. Untrue. The person who wrote that is a ben sova. I saw the cartoon movie at 6, and read the book all in 1 day when I was 7. Unbeliviable? I learned to read at the age of 2! The book was so good, I coulnd't stop reading. The book was rather short, compared to my lastest reading at that time: Ivanhoe! 556 pages! Rather good book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This was perhaps the best book of all time second only to his other works. Tolkien is an absolute genius.

It was great to revisit the characters again and we topped it off by visiting Hobbiton - well worth a visit if you ever get the chance. I plan to read LOTR again as well and it is good now that there are movies - it makes visualizing the characters so much easier!! A great read!! Michelle"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What made me want this particular version of the book, I wanted something nostalgic that felt official and this is exactly what I got.The book feels great to read and the gold touches make it that more special but what I love more is that it has J.R.R Tolkien's original drawings which also include the four color pieces he did.The cover box is also a neat touch, this is one my favorite books to read and now it's one of my best presented books.Recommended for all ages and a must have for any \\"Hobbit\\" or \\"Lord of the Rings\\" fan."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"what else could I say this is a great book and great version for the kindle app, if you havent read the book do it before the movie comes out."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Amazing reading of The Hobbit!

The young Bilbo on his unwilling quest. It will live forever."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is one of those novels that appears on every list of \\"Books to Read Before You Die\\", and with the movie coming out in 2012, this seemed to be the perfect time to read it!Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit living a quiet, unassuming life in his hobbit hole until Gandalf the Wizard and a group of dwarves come to recruit him for an adventure to steal their treasure back from an evil dragon. To complete their quest, they will need to travel through unknown lands where many dangers lurk.I absolutely loved reading this epic tale of adventure and can't believe I waited this long to read it! Bilbo Baggins is a great character that shows you can do anything, no matter how unfamiliar or out of your comfort zone if you put your mind to it and have a little faith. The descriptions of the lands that the group was traveling through were fantastic and allowed me to feel right there with Bilbo and his friends. I enjoyed The Hobbit so much that I may even tackle The Lord of the Rings next!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Wasn't sure how I'd like reading on the Kindle Fire....but it was great....I re-read the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings every couple years, now I have it in a convienent format!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this Tolkien book a long time ago and re-read it in preparation to seeing the movie of the same name. The book was fun, Bilbo was an extremely reluctant hero. His adventures just came upon him and he survived in spite of or because of his own bumbling but pure heart. As Bilbo and the dwarves and Gandalf neared their goal of destroying Smaug in his Lonely Mountain lair, there were unintended consequences of their acts to other groups including the community of men down the river. I liked it that things were not so black and white. Certainly this book is a much better read than the movie which I found to be overly somber and incredibly violent with very hard to believe fighting sequences where nobody gets hurt. Read it and compare. You'll see what I'm talking about."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Every single day I was waiting and waiting to read it to see what happened next. I am really excited to read the Lord of the rings series.

I always check Amazon first and am always glad I do."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Nice book, nice publishing, some problems with formatting of the poems and focusing on words for translation, but overall impression - OK."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The most impressive thing about this graphic novel version of The Hobbit is how true to the original source material it is. A person finishing this book will have a very strong understanding of exactly what happened in the novel. I agree with other people that this would be a great way for a 7 year old to be introduced to the story.The only thing I would want to change about it is its size. It feels just a tad too small to comfortably fit all the text and panels that it crams into each of its pages. I also feel like the color palette is a bit too bright and cheery throughout. I think the whole thing would have felt more true to the spirit of the book if the saturation levels were pulled back a bit. It might even benefit from being printed on matte paper stock. As it is, the glossy paper and bright colors just don't feel quite right."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This excellent pillar of the fantasy genre is compelling to the bone. The adventure Bilbo embarks is one to envy. The most outstanding detail about Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" is the books natural flow, as it simply carries you along as you slowly and cheerfully deepen into the quest. One of my favorite characters is by far, Beorn. Sadly, if you haven't read Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\", I shan't be able to tell you more about him than he is a fascinating character. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This graphic novel sets the bar for fantasy literature writers and readers as well. It is a satisfying retelling that weaves a story for the reader to discover and leaves one wanting more without gaping holes in the mythos.Perfect as an introduction for younger readers."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"One of my favorite fantasy books of all time. Personally, I enjoyed The Hobbit much more than Lord of the Rings. If you haven't read this lovely little book yet, you owe it to yourself to do so. A real treat to be enjoyed by kids and adults alike."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I enjoyed this 'story in itself' - although I felt it was aimed at a different age bracket than the Silmarillion.An epic tale of Bilbo Baggin and friends in the precursur to The Lord of the Rings.The Ring of Power comes into the most innocent of hands - and the strings of destiny are pulled together.Enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read The Hobbit when I was in High School, but I doubt that I had the cognitive ability to actually appreciate Tolkien and his amazing story. The Hobbit is a classic, a true gem in literature. The Hobbit was more amazing than I ever remembered and I loved revisiting this classic story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you're wondering whether or not you should read this book before the LOTR, it's a must. Gives very useful background info about major characters in LOTR and is in itself entertaining. It starts off kind of slow but quickly speeds up. Well worth the buy, haven't reread it yet but definitely will before the first part of the movie comes out."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Loved this book for my Kindle, so easy too! Right to my kindle, no plugging it in and doing anything extra. Just a simple click. Although, it would be nicer if there was a way to double check things with the whisper net thing before you buy it. I ended up buying another book first cause I didn't understand how simple it was. I LOVE my kindle and I love how easy it was to get this awesome book. It's a nice easy read, you don't have to know everything about the books because it's just the beginning. That and just a warning for the reader - you'll want to read the rest of the books!! Not to mention just more Tolkien!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbits - J.R.R.R. TolkienI would strongly suggest that anyone considering reading Tolkien for the first time choose the \\"The Hobbits\\" as their initial book. There is a good reason for this since many of the events that propel the three volume \\"Fellowship of the Rings\\" originate in \\"The Hobbits\\". The reader is introduced to a full gamut of characters and beings that play critically important roles in subsequent books.I have no interest in summarizing the plot since any discussion along these lines would spoil the revelations to be discovered by new readers.This exceptional fantasy tale that can be enjoyed by adults and children alike. This would make a fine book to read to a child. Be sure to set aside a couple of free hours because once you begin this book you will not want to put it down until the last page."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a really exciting tale of a little hobbit and the huge adventure he goes through. I read that one of the reasons J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the book was for his own children to enjoy, but the intended audience of this book could be anywhere from 13 up to adults, as I know a 30 year old who claims to have read it 5 times and as recently as last year. Because of how well the book was written and the great characters, this is a great book for someone of any age to read.The only background information you need to know about this book is that it is a prequel to the Lord of The Rings series. I do not have many criterions to judge this book as it is the first one I have ever read from cover to cover. To summarize the book, Bilbo is convinced to go with a large pack of Dwarves as a thief to help them get their mountain back from an evil dragon called Smaug. Along the way they run into trolls, elves, spiders, goblins, eagles, and participate in a huge battle.I really enjoyed all of the books key elements. The plot really worked well for someone my age, it had a great reward at the end of all their hard work, and it had some amazing characters like Bilbo, Gandalf, and Thorin. It had sad parts too at the end where a main character learned a good life lesson. Knowing that this book was wrote before the Lord of The Rings I think it sets up that book really well. It already lets you meet a few of the main characters and makes you interested to see what happens to Bilbo and his ring. I haven't read any other books like this so it makes it hard to compare to books like it, but I know that I would be interested in reading more books like it if there any.The great characters and the adventure in this book really have made it an enjoyment to read. From the very beginning of being introduced to Bilbo and all his adventures with trying to escape being eaten by trolls, trying to get out of a goblin cave, being chased by wolves and spiders, and helping the dwarves escape from an Elvish prison along with trying to defeat a dragon and survive a war I really had a great time reading it. While I expected this project to be no fun at all, the book was so great it has made this little project turn into its own huge adventure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I enjoyed reading this book to my three sons and they in turn wanted their children to enjoy the same book.That's why I searched for this book long out of print."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the second time I've read The Hobbit. I think I enjoyed it more this time. Tolkien just takes you away to Middle Earth with his words. I am so looking forward to the movie The Hobbit and I'm thrilled that Peter Jackson is on the project."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The book is far more interesting than the movie. Tolkien had an imagination that enabled him to entertain anyone who enjoys fiction."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Beautiful story, I will read again soon. Purchased on my Kendal, it was formatted nicely, and included some illustrations. A truly great read!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I bought this edition about 7 years ago.

It\`s magic and quite a few strokes of brilence from our favorite burglar Bibblo Baggins!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The book was in great condition and I immediately shipped it off to my hubby in Afghanistan to give him some more reading material to pass the time until he returns home. It's one of his favorites and since the movie should be coming out soon, he wanted to read the book again before he saw the movie. Thanks!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was just about the most fun reading experience I have ever had. I'm not sure whether the effect stemmed from the great quality of the book or from my particular developmental stage when I read it. Probably a bit of both. It's really just the simple story of a bourgeosis everyman who is thrown into a world of dragons, goblins, wizards, and dwarves and is forced to discover the greatness within himself. The plot arch might be that of Beowulf, substituting a typical well-to-do Englishman for the mighty thewed hero of the legend. The splendor is in Tolkien's wizardly story-telling and poetic vision. The story is worked to a minute perfection on every single page, every single sentence, even. Each chapter is punctuated with songs, or poems, making the Hobbit a true prose romance, in the tradition of the earlier great fantasists, such as William Morris, Lewis Carrol, Kipling, or ER Eddison. And every song is good.The Hobbit evokes a sense of nostalgia in this particular reader, a nostalgia for a lost pre modern world of primordial Northern England and Europe. As CS Lewis wrote somewhere, no other writer is able to capture the feel of Norse mythology, its symbols and moods, and weave them into a story the way Tolkien does. Tolkien employs his own private mythology, later published as the Silmarillion, to give the setting a sense of historical depth. For example, at one point the heroes find swords \\"forged duing the goblin wars of Gondolin,\\" foreshadowing a subsequent encounter with goblins. Each encounter brims with invention and unique imagination seldom found in any other author, but at the same time invoking an homage to the other great heroic stories of the world. The eyrie of the giant eagles recalls the story of Sinbad in the rocs' nest. The riddle game with Golum, one of the most inventive scenes in any story, reminds one of the Sphinx from Greek mythology. And each riddle is brilliant.All Tolkien's works are incomparable, but the Hobbit is his greatest, I think, mainly for its simplicity. It lacks the Manichean overblownness of the Lord of the Rings or the Silmarillion. Here is not a cataclysmic war between absolute good and absolute evil, but a simple quest to get some loot from a dragon. The story is thusly more like real life, and closer to primeval mythologies of Europe in that there is no Zoroastrian conception of good and evil.The Hobbit has some real life relevance too, I suspect. I think there is a message in the Hobbit, about a cataclysmic world event, but to recognize it requires one to have an encompassing understanding of twentieth century history, a familiarity with Tolkien's own life (i.e. a sense of when the book was written), and penetrating awareness of the tropes of the fantasy genre. The story sort of picks up the thread started in the Worm Ouroboros, as pertaining to the allegory behind Gro and the ambassador. I've always wondered if any one else can answer the riddle of the Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I would just like to say that I feel sorry for the people that gave this book a rating of 1. This is one of the most incredible books ever written. The people who gave this book a 1 were mostly people who had to read the book for some assignment. My opinion is that no book should be forced upon a person. My own father was made to read the hobbit in college and he hated it, only because it was kind of child-like. I, on the other hand, was not forced to read it and I love it. Again I just want to say that I feel sorry for those who think this book is horrible."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I heartily endorse other exultant reviews of this masterpiece. As for the students who were forced to read this book for school and therefore did not like it, no wonder. Nobody should be forced to read a book this fine. This is the origin of an entire literary genre, fantasy fiction. What other book can lay claim to producing such enthusiasm among so many people? I love this book more than I can say! It has given me and my family much pleasure and enrichment over the past 20 years. Read it!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a nice piece of fantasy. The book is very good."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien's books have been with me ever since the second grade, when I was first introduced to his world of Middle-Earth through The Hobbit. The Lord of the Rings came next with me through junior high and high school (I've read the trilogy 3 times) and now I'm a few pages away from finishing The Silmarillion. Tolkien's imagination and attention to detail cannot be outdone, and those who slapped Tolkiens first literary triumph with a &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot; rating had really take another look. The Hobbit intruduced us to a world as real as our own, therefore it stands to me as a real masterpiece. It gives you a taste of Middle-Earth, an exiting and thrilling touch of what his other books have to offer. If you want to begin to lose yourself in enjoyment and/or want a whole new world to explore, start with this book. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I remember when I was in 4th grade and my English teacher began to read the Hobbit to the class. Immediately I was drawn into this incredible story; it was *certainly* like nothing else I'd ever read! Even when the teacher stopped reading it for class, I'd skip lunch and recess just to hear him read this story.Fast forward. I am 19 years old now, and I just finished this book for the 3rd time. I still find it surprising that this book is really that good. Of all the things I liked when I was in 4th grade, the Hobbit is the only thing that I still like - no, love - today. TRULY a great book. You discover new things in the story each time you read it. Even after the third time, it still is a *truly* enjoyable book to read.Children's literature? No, children's literature nowadays is along the lines of &quot;Goosebumps&quot; or &quot;Sweet Valley High.&quot; This isn't ANYTHING like today's &quot;children's literature.&quot; Steer your kids away from the Goosebumps tales and get this book for them!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read The Hobbit 10 times already, and believe me, one does not get bored! Escaping goblins, guessing riddles to save your life, and meeting the dragon Smaug, trust me, life can't get more exciting for a timid little hobbit, especially Bilbo! My social studies teacher read it, my cousin read it, my uncle read it, my friends read it, even my 6 year old sister read it! ( well, I read it to her) If you want a good book, THIS IS THE ONE TO READ! Bilbo also gets to do some fun stuff like meet Elrond the elf, ride down a river on a barrel, and fly in the sky on the back of an eagle. If you think this book is good, try reading the Lord of the Rings trilogy. IT WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I cannot number the times I have read this and the other Middle Earth books.

It's an adventure story that's great fun to read, but it also deals with friendship and loss. We truly feel what Bilbo goes through in the story. His sorrow is our sorrow, his heroism gets your own adrenaline pumping. The characters are wonderfully developed. If you want a fun book to read, I highly recommend The Hobbit.

The illustrations are top notch and as many have mentioned, the inspiration a great deal of the production design in the LOTR movies. Simply beautiful, and my son, five yrs old, loves the story which is a joy to read aloud. In fact, though I read it to myself all of the other times, I now realize it was so obviously written to be read aloud! And Tolkien makes it easy. The words beg to be acted out and dramatized as it's recited; an aspect I really had not realized before."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a classic book and I really enjoyed the audio version.

Because of this, it is often a first introduction to Tolkien's world. It is, of course, the story of Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit who dwells in that hole.

Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, has led a pretty quiet life so far but it's all about to change. Gandalf, the wizard, on the other hand did not have a very good reputation with the hobbits but he's who saw the potential adventurous spirit in Bilbo and recommended him to the dwarves as the lucky member of their group. So begins Bilbo's adventure. Bilbo left home, was caught by trolls, met elves, fought goblins and wargs, and saw in part the battle of the five armies."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Ok so I had always been a fan of Greek mythology and just myth's in general. After watching all of the LOTR movies I was left with a desire to keep learning of this amazing and beautiful world. I found the creator of middle earth and did research I bought virtually all of his books. I started my journey to learn everything about Tolkien Mythology. This book is simply put out of this world, perhaps from middle earth. This book is supposed to be a children's book but I believe the reason for that is the story not the writing. The reading is above average and you cannot expect a child to fully understand or capture all of the context like it is meant to be captured. So I think this book is best to read to children and explain every detail about it or for older children around 12-16. I had never read any of Tolkien's literature before and started of with this book and I am inclined to read it again because you cannot squeeze all of it's genius out in one read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"First let me say that I have read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; six times, the first time being twenty six years ago when I was twenty-one. Each time I have read it I haven't tired of Tolkein's marvelous storytelling abilities and the depth and staying power that this tale has.Called &quot;The Enchanting Prelude to the Lord of the Rings,&quot; one might come away with the erroneous perception that &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a preface of sorts that can be easily skipped. Frankly I don't know how anyone who has not read this book could fully appreciate any part of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; either in print or on the big screen.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; is the story of THE Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. Yes, Frodo's adventures are literarily noteworthy but do not exceed in any sense the heroic adventures of Bilbo. The book also introduces readers to the dwarves who are the precursors of Gimli. In fact the tomb discovered by the Fellowship in Moria is that of Balin, one of the dwarves introduced in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and one of Bilbo's favorites.This book also gives us our introduction to Gandalf, the wandering wizard, and to Gollum, the hapless possessor and slave of the great Ring of Power, along with a wonderful cadre of other enchanting characters.If you haven't read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; but have enjoyed &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and/or &quot;The Return of the King&quot; either in print or on film it's not too late. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; will fill in many of the blanks that inevitably arise when starting with Tolkein's trilogy.Once you've read it please join with the rest of us Hobbitophiles in screaming bloody murder until Peter Jackson consents to bring this one to film.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I chose to read this book because many peaple told me that it was interesting. When I started to read the book I learned that this was true. I also started reading this book because I heard the name Hobbit in a movie commercial for the lord of the rings. I also started to read the book, because when I read the summary at the back of the book, it seemed pretty interesting.The main character is Bilbo Baggins. This creature is a Hobbit. They are furry footed beings with a non-adventuress personality. And Bilbo was no exception. At first, he did'nt even think about adventures. But when the story nears the end,he wants more to go on more adventures.He is a very funny and intresting charater, with many good qualities.I like this book very much. This is because it is in a whole different world, where anytyhing could happen. It is a story with many high points, and suspension. Many parts where victory seems hopeless but they always get out. I like science fiction books because I like learning about different creatures and places. The Hobbit is probably one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is what Harry Potter is not. Let there be no pretense in saying \\"The Hobbit\\" is among the finest pieces of older children's fiction ever.Bilbo Baggins is a humorous, lovable sort of hobbit. In fact, if I were to meet a hobbit, I should hope it to be Bilbo.What Bilbo brings is boldness in the midst of genuine concern over the task at hand. He is afraid, but not so much that he doesn't rise to occasion.Delicious language. Images you can taste and smell. A story that matters, and is well-told.Read \\"The Hobbit\\" and be entranced. If your children or nephews/nieces are old enough, read it aloud to them. Read it to your class. Show them Harry Potter is not bad, but Bilbo is better.I fully recommend this book.Anthony Trendl"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The hobbit is full of adventure and excitement. At the beggining a lazy hobbit,Bilbo Baggins,is sitting at his porch.Then a wizard named Gandalf unexpectingly comes to his door. He asks Bilbo if he wants to go on an adventure. Bilbo refuses. But that doesn't last long. Soon enough Bilbo is with Gandalf and a group of 14 dwarves. He meets a giant, giant spiders, and a lake that makes them sleep.

The only downside to the book, was the fact that the pages (the outside, not the actual part where you read) were speckled with green dots (intentionally) For some reason.

The Lord of the Rings is much more in depth, descriptive, and more entertaining than the Hobbit, but it also includes several references that only one who has read the Hobbit will fully understand.The Hobbit is the story of Bilbo Baggins and his journey away from his comfortable home in Hobbiton and across Middle Earth in order to defeat the Dragon Smaug. Bilbo travels with 13 dwarves whose homeland has been taken by the evil dragon, and their journey is aided by the wizard Gandalf who has chosen Bilbo to join the dwarves in their quest. The Hobbit is a fairly simple story in which Bilbo and his new friends encounter many dangers and hardships along the way, but most importantly, it is the story in which Bilbo finds the Ring that will eventually be the centerpiece for Tolkien's subsequent classic.Read The Hobbit to enjoy a quick story that will give you the background and introduction to Hobbits and Middle Earth that will make reading The Lord of the Rings much more enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this book last year.....I LOVED it. I thought it was the most exciting book I had ever read. Remember, &quot;thought&quot;, I am now reading The Lord of the Rings epic. Now these books are exciting. All of you dumb idiots who rated it one star because there wasn't any lower stars than that, did you know that Tolkien made a whole earth? Did you know he made 15 total languages for The Hobbit and LOTR? ... Didn't you think Gollum, the trolls, goblins(Orcs), Wizard, Dwarves, wolves, hobbits, or Smaug(Dragon) was exciting? If I were you at home, it would be the best book you ever read....Buy it...Now! It is an AWESOME book. Those of you who rated it one star, read The Lord of the Rings and then rate them...I know what they'll say. For more info on the Hobbit, it's about a hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, that lives peacefully in a hobbit hole. One day some dwarves leaded by Gandalf, the Wizard. They offer Bilbo to be a &quot;Burgular&quot;, a person who steals treasure for pay. He accepts...and thats when the excitment begins. What happens in The Hobbit has a lot to do with what happens in LOTR. The RING is the coolest thing Bilbo brings back with him."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is not only a book, but a key to open our imagination and let it flow freely. It is a modern fairy-tale, with no known fairies. They are there, but with changed names and concepts.It is a very orignal piece of art, however for as original as the story be it contains great influence of Nordic Mythology, which is never mentioned as a source for more information. Mr. Tolkien wrote a soberb story, giving room for the child everyone carries inside. Wasn't Bilbo quite persuaded to go by his &quot;dad&quot; Gandalf? And as problems appeared wasn't Gandalf the 1st to be thought of... Bilbo learnt all out the hard (and maybe best) way and that's why he became a hero!It's a book which brought a whole new Universe, continued on other ones, The Lord of the Rings (great), the Simallarion (I personally didn't read it, but I don't expect much either. The characters I'm interestd in are far out from the tale there...) and even games, which knows no bounds (Middle Eart Role Playing Game, D&amp;D...) . And now, finally one trilogy to rule them all!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Although this book starts off pretty slow it has an amazing story behind it. The book is based on a character named Mr. Baggins and as you can tell he is a hobbit. This little hobbit is on an adventure with goblins to regain stolen treasure from a ferocious dragon. Little does he know that he is also up against a heartless demon under the mountains and more. I think that all fiction lovers should read this book and the rest of the series that follows.

Before I knew how to read, like every child, I liked to look at the pictures. Even as a child, I noticed that sometimes the story was better than the pictures, and sometimes the pictures were better than the story. Although there have been countless versions of The Hobbit, this version has the illustrations to match the wonderful and timeless story. The story is about a young hobbit who is rudely torn from his comfortable surroundings to embark on a heroic, sometimes horrific, sometimes hysterical adventure. The Hobbit started a fantasy tradition that has only gained momentum with time. Tokein's discriptions of the adventuring party's trials and tribulations are both heartwarming and at times gut-wrenching. The pictures in this version definitely do this classic justice. I especially enjoy the rich picture of the dragon Smaug hording his vast treasure and the evil swamp creature Gollum harrassing poor Bilbo the Hobbit. Of all the versions of The Hobbit, this one is the most richly illustrated and the one that is totally worth getting"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"After reading the Harry Potter books, and countless reviews saying that they were no where near Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit series...I thought I would check it out. Tolkien is the master of fantasy, it has been determined, I decided to judge for myself. I had started reading the Hobbit a few times before, and enjoyed it, though I would always put it down for something slightly more riveting, interesting, or something that just came out :::cough Harry Potter book 4:::: and I had to read. When I finally picked it up again, determined to read it before I read the LOTR, and determined to read them before the movie, I was pushed gently at first and then given a sudden yet enthralling shove into the Middle Earth.The adventures of Bilbo Baggins are like no other. They are calm enough to make you feel cozy inside, yet interesting enough to make you keep reading. Tolkien's gift for writing, though celebrated many times, is never as strong as the first time you read the first page of the Hobbit. I lived through each moment, and found myself picking up the book subconciously and just reading it, as though I was thumbing through my life story, as oppose to that of Bilbo.Tolkien created one of the most subtle and real realities I have ever come across. He created a totally believable spiecies of creature (many, actually), a totally believable plot and a wonderfully magical tale that will leave you all warm inside, and wanting more! The perfect push-off point for the Lord of the Rings. Every time the LOTR got slightly boring, or slowed down, I just remembered how calmly I had been able to read the Hobbit, and it kept me from giving up altogether. Definitely a &quot;must-read&quot; to anyone who enjoys good literature, and a great starting point for people who are wary of fantasy.Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go sweep my hobbit-hole now."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I resisted reading this book for a long time. To be honest, I was biased against fantasy and science fiction; believing they were not &quot;real&quot; literature. If it hadn't been for the upcoming movie, I probably wouldn't have picked up &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; which a friend recommended I read before plunging into the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy.I'm glad I did. From the beginning I was enthralled with the characters as well as the tale, and soon found I was reading it while walking home from work, on the stairmaster at the gym, and at night when I should have been sleeping. Tolkien imagined an amazing world, and then popolated it with likable characters and creatures, with just enough adventure mixed in to keep the pages turning.&quot;The Hobbit&quot; got me hooked, and I'm already starting the trilogy that constitutes &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book got me started on the Tolkien books!

Tolkien was the ultimate &quot;philologist&quot; in both a literal, academic sense and in a broader, more general sense. That is to say, he was a true &quot;lover of words&quot; and no writer has ever &quot;sub-created&quot; a magical world on the basis of a deeper knowledge of, and love of, words. What is more, as any true philologist, he saw very clearly the power of myth and how language and myth interweave. The longer trilogy with followed allowed him to unfold all these aspects of his writing in a fuller, deeper way...and yet there is still something about the Hobbit, the antechamber of Middle Earth that draws one back to it again and again. It is eminently readable and approachable, for one thing. One can easily plow though it for a light evening's reading.

Yes, there are goblins, and elves, and dwarves in the book but it is not just a fantasy that just throws out shallow fantasy characters. Tolkien makes you understand the characters and makes you want to be a part of their lives. Even though they are creatures of fantasy you will begin to fel for them just like you would the characters of any great book.

Sometimes I can't put them down. Sometimes it takes me forever to finish them. In regards to The Hobbit, I can say that I have read and reread this wonderful book many times. While I have read The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and most would curse me in some form of literary blasphemy, I have to admit that I enjoyed this book more than the trilogy. If I remember correctly I've read it about five or six times. (Coming from a very inconsistent reader, it has to be a pretty good recommendation.) While I loved the trilogy, I did find that the pacing of The Hobbit to be much better, and aside from the fact that this book was geared more towards children, I found the story to be exciting and very entertaining to read. (I suppose I am a bit biased since I watched the cartoon movie from when I was a child and this film greatly fascinated me, enough to end up reading the novel.) Regardless of the fact that this novel was geared towards a younger audience, one can't deny that it holds its own as a great tale of adventure and personal growth. Bilbo Baggins' transformation is one that all readers can relate to. One can't deny the impact Tolkien's work has had on the world of literature, and this piece is no exception. In all this book is a wonderful introduction to the world of J. R. R.

That is were I stumbled into \\"The Hobbit\\" on amizon.com. I first read this book in eighth grade for a book report. I am now eighteen years old. The first time I read this book was five years ago and I still can remember every bit of it. This book is very exciting and imaginative. There is a new adventure for Bilbo Baggins, one of the main characters, on every page. The one thing that you must have is an imagination. J.R.R. Tolkien gives us a very detailed description of the characters, surroundings, and events the characters encounter.I remember when I read this book, I felt like I was apart of the adventure.The description in the book gave me the ability to see how the characters looked like, so as I was reading it I felt like I was able to see the characters speaking to each other. Like the time when Bilbo finds the ring and runs into the Gollum. Tolkien's description of the Gollum and of what Bilbo was felling made me feel like I was Bilbo hiding from the Gollum. If you read the book, you will now what I am trying to say.Another grate thing about this book is that it is easy to read. The chapters are very interesting, and you will never get bored from it. This book is great for all ages, especially for the people that liked the Lord of the Ring. If you were still wondering how Frodo's family gets the ring, this book would clear all that up for you.In my opinion, this book is a classic and will always be one. This book shows great descriptions, and keeps you wanting more. The Hobbit is filled with mystery and adventure. You will not be able to put the book down. If you are looking for an exciting book, look no further you found the perfect book.

And what's worse, your friend Gandalf the Grey has helped them. That's exactly what happened to Bilbo Baggins in the book, The Hobbit.The plot of the story is amazing. It follows a story line that is so imaginary, it almost isn't imaginable. The main hobbit in this story is Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is whisked away on a dangerous journey with 13 dwarves, determined with the task of recapturing the grand dwarf city. Thorin, the greatly respected dwarf king, is determined to be the King Under the Mountain, as his grandfather and great-grandfather once were. Smog the Dragon has captured the ancient dwarf city and has destroyed the once prosperous city of Dale, the mortal man's city. Thorin and Co.(Bilbo and the 13 dwarves) are determined to kill Smog (well, at least the dwarves are. Bilbo thinks this is all a wild goose chase!) and recover the lost treasures. But before they get to the mountain to destroy Smog and recover the lost treasure, they must get there. On the long way there, they drag themselves into mortal danger many times. Some of these dangers are hungry trolls, giant spiders, and an entire underground kingdom of goblins. There are many more, but it would take a full page to name them.This book was extremely good, especially if you like books with a lot of suspense in them. Tolkien uses intricate detail and vivid words. I could just imagine every part in the book as if I was there.Bilbo is a touching character that we all can relate to. Poor old Bilbo just wants to be left alone and wants to have everything just so expected and predictable. But on the other hand, he loves adventures (sometimes) and he loves suprises. But he alsc just wants a good pipe to smoke, a comfortable hobbit hole, and some good company. And surely we can all relate to that!!I recommend this book to children and adults of all ages. Some parts of the book are a little intense, such as when the Wargs try to eat the 14 travelers plus Gandalf in one part. Otherwise, this is a touching, loving, humorous book. Although, you might not like the book so much if you don't enjoy action/adventure books.In conclusion, this book is wonderful. I really loved it.

I would recommend it for readers over thirteen that are in to adventurous books. Readers might find it particularly interesting because the story The Hobbit precedes The Lord of the Rings. The book gives readers a little bit of back ground to the three Lord of the Rings movies.The story is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. One morning in his Hobbit hole he awoke to a loud banging on his round wooden door. In came a wizard and twelve dwarves for what Bilbo thought was breakfast. He was surprised to find that they were planning to take him along with them on a journey to reclaim their lost gold from a dragon in the depths of a distant mountain. The journey to the mountain makes for an interesting story. They encountered goblins, great wolves, eagles, wood elves, and of course the dragon. They have very high times and low times along the journey, coming to near death on several occasions. As I read this book I almost felt sorry for all the little things that Bilbo was dragged into. By the end Bilbo becomes the hero, which was pleasing to compare his hero status to how he started the journey.JRR Tolkien uses his knowledge of the rural environment and his imagination to create an enticing piece of writing. Tolkien uses foreshadowing countless times to make the reader find the book irresistible. He has an interesting way of talking to the reader about the story by using \\"you\\". It is almost as if he is telling his tail directly to the reader.I thought this book was very entertaining and well written. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good piece of literature. I rate it a nine out of ten."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this book years ago, in junior high. I had heard about it before, and had been interested in reading it, but had not had a chance. I enjoyed the story immensley, even though it was below my reading level at that point, it was a great background when I read The Lord of the Rings later. If you plan on reading The Lord of the Rings, read The Hobbit first. You will understand a lot better where Bilbo got the ring, and how he knows Gandalf, the elfs, and the dwarfs.This edition of The Hobbit is one of the most beautifully published books I have ever seen. Every page is thick, high quality glossy paper with wide margins, and MANY MANY illustrations. In addition to occasional colour illustrations on their own pages, there are smaller, half page or so, grey illustrations scattered throughout the chapters. If you are a fan of Tolkien, this is the edition of The Hobbit to buy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Who would have known that J.R.R. Tolkien's dark, war-ravaged epic fantasy Lord of the Rings would have sprung from such an innocent, light-hearted adventure?When a peace-loving Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins has his humble home visited by the legendary wizard Gandalf the Grey and an entourage of 13 dwarves, Bilbo finds himself embarking on a quest that will take him all across the great lands of Middle Earth, meeting a host of characters and creatures both friendly and not, and stumbling across great treasures and wild predicaments.I truly feel sorry for anyone who would dismiss the Hobbit as a \\"children's book.\\" While it may have been intended that way, it hardly reads as so. The Hobbit is intelligent, gripping, sophisticated and wondrous. I found that I always had a smile on my face for the greater portion of the book. Tolkien's vivid and often times comedic approach to Bilbo's situations help convey an intriguing and entertaining story that can be enjoyed by anyone.The characters, for the most part, are very well developed. The main characters (Bilbo, Thorin, Gandalf) get the most attention, but Tolkien balances the 12 remaning Dwarves and other side characters quite well. Bilbo's encounter with Gollum is chilling and memorable, and the finding of the Ring seems so very insignificant in the grand scheme of things...yet who would've known that such an innocent discovery would have led to the tragic, dark and terribly evil events to follow in Tolkien's legendary Lord of the Rings?This book should definitely keep you enthralled and reading to the very end. Like I said earlier, though this may have been intended to be a children's book, it hardly reads like one at all. I don't ever remember reading any books way back when I was a kid that were this epic, descriptive or intelligent. All you need is an open mind with a little twinge of fantasy, and you'll definitely enjoy the Hobbit. You can't read the Lord of the Rings without reading the Hobbit out of principle. I don't know why I waited so long to read this book, but now that I have, I am very glad that I did. It's probably one of the best books i've ever read. I very highly recommend it to anyone remotely interested in fantasy. Most of the fantasy today is inspired by The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings.This Leatherette Collector's Edition of the book sports some illustrations inserted into key areas of the book,gold embossment on the cover of elvish 'moonletters' and runes, as well as a leather sheath for the book. Definitely worthwhile for any Tolkien fan! On a side note, if you REALLY want to add dimension and life to the characters, I suggest watching The Fellowship of the Ring and The The Towers either before or just after you read this book...Gandalf and Bilbo and company just have so much more personality afterwards!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien's deceptively simple story of the well to do hobbit named Bilbo Baggins who has adventure thrust upon him is a land mark book in the fantasy genre. Just about Every fantasy novel written since owes a debt in one form or another to Tolkien. I think part of the reason why Tolkien's work resonates strongly with so many people lies in Tolkien's reoccurring theme of the ordinary person thrust into extraordinary circumstances. Bilbo, like all of the Hobbits in Tolkien's Ring Trilogy, is at heart a simple fellow who shows great courage in the face of terrifying odds. Tolkien, a Medievalist and professor of Linguistics at Oxford University, took his vast knowledge of language and ancient myths and used them to create a world unlike anything we've ever seen before. Frank Herbert's Dune trilogy is the only series I can think of which has come close. The Hobbit has it all. Vast armies, an underdog hero, dragons, wizards, lost treasure, giant spiders, and magic rings. The Hobbit is my absolute all time favorite story.Preston McClear, MalibuBooks.com"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book called &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, is about a little ordinary Hobbit called Bilbo Baggins, who had an unexpected adventure. This adventure was filled with lost treasure, magical dwarves, mystical elves and fearsome dragons. Here, is Professor Tolkiens first book that takes place in Middle-Earth. Just the fact that such a small and &quot;un-adventurous&quot; little person like Mr.Baggins going on an adventure made this book a great page-turner. But with the addition of magical creatures, fierce warriors and Smaug the Dragon, I believe that this book should be recognized in the &quot;Authors hall of Fame&quot;.The detail in this book was magnificent, letting you picture the lush environment of Rivendell, the harsh, cold Mountain range of the Misty Mountains and the dark forest of Mirkwood, with its hidden eyes of darkness and spiders the size of elephants. The characters had complex personalities, family tree descriptions, and their appearances were, in my opinion, described perfectly.Smaug, the dragon who guarded the dwarves' treasure, was quite a funny character. Not comically funny, but in the way that he talks to burglars, and the nasty habit of exploding with fury, when so much as a single coin is missing from his stockpile of gold. All in all, this book was a work of literary art, and descriptive genius. On a scale of one to ten, I would give it a ten and a half, and I believe it is suitable for all ages. If you are looking for a great book, you should consider &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.Written by:TheCarrot.net editor, nick"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"At the age of 28 and having read the Lord of the Rings series 3 times, as well as having watched the first two installments of the films in the theatre, I must, shamefully, admit, I have only recently read the one book from which the epic series was born and I LOVED IT!I can't believe it took me this long to finally read The Hobbit, but I am mightly glad I did!If you have only read the series, then you are missing out on several &quot;in&quot; jokes all pertaining to Bilbo's exciting and dangerous adventure. Immediately upon finishing The Hobbit, I re-read The Fellowship of the Ring, again, and it suddenly opened up for me. I found myself laughing at events, phrases, etc. that I missed entirely before.The Hobbit is well worth reading, even if have already read the series (though I would recommend first-timers to read this first), because you'll just get so much more out of the series.Moreover, for those who have only seen the films, READ THE BOOKS! I'm serious. The films are great fun, but the books are real, intense, go deeper, and just carry you away from your daily life into Middle Earth. Don't you just love escapism? I do! Cheers!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A beautiful novel with one of my favorite endings. Brings back memories of someone I lost not too long ago. Thanks tolkein"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first read this book in 3rd grade. But now in 4th I'm still mystified by the magic of this book. J.R.R Tolkien has a way of combining words imagination and real life in a science-fiction novel. But all in all it is the best book I ever read. For those planning to read lord of the rings I highly advise you to read this book. Not only does it help you understand but it also gives you an easier read to prepare yourself for the intriguing and confusing words in lord of the rings. Now after reading it again I would still read this book out if curiosity and would buy bilbo's last song. Very exiting book for read aloud for teachers"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I had not read The Hobbit since I was in my 20s--I'm 63 now. I saw what was to be the first of 3 episodes based on t by is book and felt I had to read it. I remembered little of the first reading and thoroughly enjoyed getting lost in the story!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"OMG! this book was awesome! I saw the first part of the Hobitt and I think that the book makes more sense even from a kid who is reading Lord of the Rings!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I must admit I saw the movie first. I am glad now that I have read the book. Not only does it have so much more detail than the movie it also helps explain so much more about the movie. It is an easy read and such a wonderful journey."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I never watched the lord of the ring movies and never cared much about fantasy novels. With the new movie coming out recently this book shot back up to the top of the charts and when looking for something new to read there it was. I figured what the heck and gave it a try. This book was an easy read, the characters where non complicated and the writing was simple but entertaining.I then went to see the movie assuming it would be no where as good as the book but I was completely wrong. They did such a good job and added in so much extra fantasy that the book paled in comparison! Go figure."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you like J.R.R. Tolkien then The Hobbit is a must read. My son and I are reading it through Kindle and LOVE IT! Even if you have seen the movie, it is worth the read as there is so much more."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I first read this back in high school when it was required, and never fully appreciated it. What an intriguing and magical world Tolkien created here. For such a short story, the characters and settings have great depth and hold the reader captive all the way to the end, or there and back again."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When you read a good book, you sometimes can't stop singing it's praises. In my opinion, \\"The Hobbit,\\" is one of those books. I actually had not read this book until a few years ago, and regret not reading it earlier in my life. 'The Hobbit' is at one level simply a charming adventure story, perhaps one of the most charming and most adventurous ever told. If you haven't read it, you should, because it is quite enjoyable. Read it to your children and luxuriate in the excitement and joy that shines from their faces. That's enough.Many people often imagine heroes as strong and comely in form. Comic books are filled with mythic heroes whose exaggerated human virtues amount to \\"beat people up\\" good. Tolkien's protagonist is radically different than such heroes as, Lancelot, Beowulf, or Batman. Bilbo Baggins is small, mundane, weak and sometimes whiny. Of all characters in this story he possibly possesses the least amount of \\"fighter's instinct.\\" Yet, he is not a completely mundane character. Bilbo is one of my favorite of all times characters as he is gentle, simple, and humble. He bears no grudges and desires no vengeance. Bilbo is indeed another breed of hero; A hero who succeeds though a mixture of luck and common sense. Bilbo is a unique take on the everyman hero!Gandalf is also a favorite of mine, despite being a deus ex machina in several situations. The wisdom of Gandalf along with his pure, unfailingly good, although slightly grumpy demeanor make him quite interesting, and mysterious.The Hobbit is an outstanding book that I highly recommend to all adults and their children!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In this book, The Hobbit, or There and Back Again, by J.R.R. Tolkein, is a story of self discovery from the point of view of a hobbit who sometimes resents said \\"journey of self discovery\\". Throughout this book, you watch as the hobbit becomes a completely new hobbit. At the start, he was described as \\"a well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins,\\" by the end of the book though, he becomes Bilbo, Warrior against the Goblins, Peace-maker of Nations, Burglar of the Dwarves, and the owner of a very special yet suspicious ring. The plot of this story was very effective because it kept things very interesting. There were many various adventures that took place during one big overall adventure. Tolkien never let the story get too dry and always kept the reader interested with exciting events. I also greatly enjoyed the point of view being from Bilbo's perspective. I think that everyone can appreciate the story of an underdog. Bilbo was a rather uninteresting hobbit, and I think everyone can relate to that sort of unexciting life, but then suddenly he got to travel on a fantastic adventure! It almost gives the reader hope that maybe someday their life will take them on an unexpected journey. I somewhat agree with what bernie \\"webviator\\" said about how this is not a children's book. It most definitely is not a children's book, but I also have to point out that although the book itself may be too advanced for children just as ALice in Wonderland is, the story is still suitable for a child. Sometimes more a simpler mind can appreciate things much differently than a more advanced mind, but they would still appreciate it nonetheless. Tolkien's style of writing is very nicely illustrated in the line: \\"Upon his tomb the Elvenking then laid Orcrist,\\" the entire story has a magical and almost spooky tone, the author does this by creating many amazing creatures and magical objects throughout the story. I love this writing style because it successfully creates a completely alternate universe in which the story takes place, and it becomes an escape from the real world. I would recommend this book to anyone who is willing to witness an adventure or would like to discover the \\"Tookishness\\" in themselves."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkien's main character in, \\"The Hobbit,\\" is Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is evidently a hobbit, who is unknowingly volunteered to go on a dangerous adventure with 13 other dwarves. A wizard by the name of Gandalf is the one responsible for volunteering Bilbo. As the 14 journey towards the Lonely Mountains to retrieve their long lost fortune, they are faced with many fantastical obstacles.The wild adventure leads the 14 dwarves to many creatures and goblins, including one named Gollum. Bilbo wins a gold ring from Gollum, which later on becomes the basis for the series, \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" What does this ring mean for Bilbo? How does it change his unwanted adventure?I am not usually a big fan of fantasy type literature, however I enjoyed, \\"The Hobbit,\\" very much. I waited to see the cartoon version of, \\"The Hobbit,\\" until after I had finished the book. My sister and friends had always loved Tolkien, and I had never given him the chance. Tolkein did an excellent job of making a very unreal setting, real to the reader. The setting and characters were extremely well described. Tolkien describes every tiny thing, right from the beginning. Even the hobbit's hole, which is not an important part of the story, is described in great detail. An author's ability to suspend disbelief is very important to the pleasure the reader obtains from the book, especially if the reader is already skeptical. There was really not a transition from realistic world into the fantasy world. The Hobbit instead slowly leads the reader into a more fantastical world through the chapters. The adventure and plot of the story really keep the reader interested and not wanting to put the book down. I can now understand why so many people have gone crazy over Tolkien's writing. I plan on reading Tolkien's, \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" series very soon. I just cannot get over the great detail he puts in his setting and characters as he writes.I think that the Hobbit would be a difficult read for elementary students. However I think it would be perfect for middle school or high school students. It could be used as an excellent choice to read aloud to students in elementary. I am not sure about parents reaction to Tolkien's writing, but I would love to use some of his work in my own classroom."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" is perhaps one of the best-written books about the advantages of having parties. Written relatively early in his days as an Oxford don, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a strongly autobiographical novel about Tolkien and his status as a party man. His reputation as a party enthusiast was so secure, in fact, that Tolkien regularly was the host to impromptu parties as other Oxford and even Cambridge professors would appear uninvited at his home with the expectation of a good meal, some beer or wine, and rousing party games.It is such experiences that form the basis for \\"The Hobbit.\\" A sedentary fellow, much like Tolkien, Bilbo Baggins finds himself the unassuming host of a party of dwarves (more established professors) and the wizard Gandalf (the president of the university).Wooed by promises of great wealth, and strongly encouraged by Gandalf, Bilbo joins the dwarves on a quest to regain their lost ancestral gold, an action that represents Tolkien's own quest for tenure, a position that, once secured, would guarantee him employment, a place to live, social status, and ultimately a healthy retirement package.The story follows Tolkien-as-Bilbo's journey to the heart of the Lonely Mountain, where he must confront the dragon Smaug (the experience of teaching undergraduate and graduate students) and be swept up in the dramatic Battle of Five Armies, a situation not unlike peer review.And in the course of the story, Bilbo acquires a magical Ring that secures his reputation with the dwarves, much as Tolkien's literary and liguistic prowess, developed through education, secured his position in academia.A thoroughly fascinating and enchanting book, \\"The Hobbit\\" will have you wishing again and again for the opportunity to attend more parties and, even more, to host them yourself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit&#65533; is a lightly-written fairy-tale of Hobbit Bilbo Baggins&#65533; journey to the Dwarven home. It includes elves, a wizard, and wonderfully odd characters such as Tom Bombadil and the River&#65533;s Daughter. Bilbo is caught up in a strange adventure with a troupe of dwarves and a wizard. The tone of &#65533;The Hobbit&#65533; is very different from the rest of the series; it is an adult story written as a children&#65533;s story. Bilbo awakens one morning to an old man blowing smoke rings outside of his &#65533;hole in the ground&#65533;. This old man rested on a staff and wore a pointed blue hat, and his beard hung nearly to his waist. It seems the old wizard, Gandalf, has chosen Bilbo as the fourteenth man to accompany a troup of thirteen dwarves. Thirteen is an unlucky number, and in any case they needed a good burglar. That Bilbo never considered himself a burglar, and in fact had never burgled, bothered the wizard not in the slightest.I think that part of the success of &#65533;The Hobbit&#65533; can be attributed to its &#65533;moral&#65533; about war (which I can&#65533;t explain further until you&#65533;ve read the book, and then you won&#65533;t need me to). But it is also an engaging story of a middle-aged nobody&#65533;s coming-of-age. Bilbo passes through fire, literally, and emerges, if not a hero, than at least a story-teller.Overall I think this is a great book and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in a good read. Other good books are Paul Omeziri's Descent into Illusion and L ARon Hubbard's Battleship Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's great galaxy of hobbits, wizards, dwarves, elves, goblins, and dragons that he so deftly invented all by himself is quite vastly celebrated throughout the 20th century. In fact, his unique vision is so immensely popular that anything tasting of mystic whimsicality is at once labelled &quot;Tolkienesque&quot;. And over the years, his very first story, &quot;Hobbit&quot; had been getting its share of artwork from many different artists. Some are brilliantly colorful and others are just plain drab. Here in this 60th-anniversary book with the title in gold, Alan Lee created very gray watercolor paintings for its illustrations. Unfortunately, I find them quite dry and lifeless though he does have a good hand at drawing characters, trees, and mountainous passes. Instead, I would have preferred brilliant, deeply detailed fantasy art dramatically showing every emotion, every conflict, and every magic-working either in full colors or in very dark, gloomy tones. But with a very deep depth rather than those rather transparent watercolors."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This edition is supposed to be enhanced with media clips on iOS kindle apps.

I can still remember getting into bed while he sat in a metal office chair reading till I fell asleep.At the age of nine I was enthralled by this story with tales of Wizards, Goblins and Dwarves. It was all so fantastic I was transported to a different world and loved every minute of it. After this tale my Dad then read me the Lord of the rings trilogy and even though I am not a fan of Sci- Fi, I do love these stories and still get a thrill out of reading them over and over.All these years later I am a father now and wanted to share this with my son and possibly start a tradition that I hope he passes on to his children one day. My son is young and has no idea what is going on but he loves to hear my wife and I read to him.

Bilbo Baggins then talked to the dragon and made dragon Smaug go to the Lake city and destroy it. But a man who's name was Bard shot down the dragon Smaug and made for the Lonely Mountain to take the gold because they thought Thorin and co. was dead. They found that Thorin and co. we're not dead so they asked for some gold because they were also robbed of their gold because the dragon Smaug took it as well. Thorin refused and that almost started a war between elves,men,and dwarves. But the goblins came to take the gold and that stated The Battle of the Five Armies.

However, for older customers, the print is a tad small."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, the first part of the Rings Trilogy, was a fun and entertaining escape novel. But I was surprised that it didn't give us much of the story behind the ring or its evil power. In fact, it seemed in this story to be relatively harmless and actually quite helpful for Mr. Baggins. There was none of the ominous dread of the dark forces finding its bearer. Even Gollum did not play much of a part except at the beginning when Bilbo first finds the ring and finds out its secret power of invisibility."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Very entertaining. Such a cute book, easy to read.My First book on my new Kindle, made it even more enjoyable"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Although I have been a huge fantasy/sci fi fan since I first picked up a book, I just recently began reading Tolkien' s works. I read the fellowship of the rings and found it a tad difficult to get through as it took me awhile to adjust to his writing style and method of storytelling. I then began the hobbit after seeing the movie and I couldn't stop reading it. It's a classic that I think everyone should be exposed to. The only reason I didn't give it a five is that it read like a children's story and although that may be how it was intended to come across I found it confusing at first. All in all, the hobbit was fantastic and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the fantasy genre and is looking for a fun read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I plan on reading this book more than once.

The Hobbit is, according to us hardcore fans... The \\"middle beginning\\". And also the best place to start the Lord of the Rings saga.

It is by far the best novel i've ever read. i started it in grade 8 for a novel study at school and just got so rapped up in reading it that i was finished it in three days! Normally i don't like novel studies but this was an exception. Tolkien wonderfully provides the concrete details and lets you do the rest, he makes you use your imagination to make it seem like you are actually there. Bilbo is by far the best character in the novel. Tolkien is in my mind the best author for adventure books. i give this book 2 thumbs up. It was great."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit may have been intended for children, but it has captured the hearts of adults as well. It is a wonderful entry point into the Professor's world of Middle Earth. From my initial reading I was enchanted by it. Bilbo is one of the greatest fantasy heroes (or anti-hero) ever created. His adventures, which lead directly into The Lord of The Rings, are enrthralling, thoughtful and entertaining. Parents who read this, tell your kids to put down those joysticks and pick up this book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This novel is one of the best ever written by the greatest author ever. I first read this book when I was in third grade, and still love it five years later. This story was the first to get me into the fantasy genre and it has truly been a marvelous journey ever since. To anyone who enjoys a good story, read this tale of elves, dwarves, dragons, trolls, hobbits, and wizards. Also, if you choose to read this novel, don't forget to read the even better Lord of the Rings Trilogy by the same author. Remember to read this first, however. Don't listen to the other reviews which state that this book is a load of hogwash. It is, in fact, a wonderful adventure that a reader will never forget."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Don't miss this classic book!!!! Plz"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Tolkein mananges to create a wonderfully enchanting and enthralling world of mystical creatures and magic that no one could resist. Even before I could read, I was hearing about Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf and all the dwarves in between. My father is a big &quot;great works of literature&quot; fanatic. Maybe I'll get him to write a review on his big college paper topic: the relation of the cultural atmosphere and names included in many of Tolkein's writing to the ancient Anglo-Saxon times. It's actually quite interesting, if you like that sort of thing. The prelude &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is as good a read as the trilogy &quot;The Lord of The Rings&quot; that follows. I definitely recommend this book"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I thought that The Hobbit was a very good book. It had a lot of Characterization and Depiction. The part where Bilbo joined the fight at the end of the book was the best part. I wish that he didn't get knocked out so I could know what happened."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I think The Hobbit is one of the best books ever written (which of course stands with The Lord Of The Rings)! In which Tolkien tells of a Hobbit of the rich kind. Marvelous adventures and chapters so cleverly named! An anchantment indeed! I give it 2 thumbs (and one fuzzy toe) STRAIGHT UP!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"unlike some, i didn't give teh hobbit 5 stars becuase TOlken completey skipped the entire battle that the entire novel led up to. howerever, on a positive note, Golium was the best character in the novel by far. According to one of my chums, golium is presesnt in a lot of lord of the rings. I love the riddles!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Cute. This is a simple child's tale that serves as a nice springboard to the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy. It stands by itself as a nice story, yet is good enough to make you rush for the real McCoy- the next three books. The fertility of Tolkien's mind is amazing, and the places and creatures described in the Hobbit are such that it would have taken scores of other writers several lifetimes to conceive of them. Bilbo Baggins and his company are loveable characters, and my only criticism of the tale is that they seem to escape every jam they find themselves in, to the point that you stopped wondering whether or not they would make it with each new challenge that presented itself."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this book about 15 years ago &amp; didn't enjoy it much. So I wasn't expecting to enjoy it the 2nd time as well, but 15 years can change a lot of your perceptions. The book was engaging and delightful. Even though I knew what was going to happen, I found myself enjoying (and thinking about) some of the hidden messages throughout the book.If you read this book when you were a kid, you should definitely pick it up again as an adult."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Mighty fine book. I think I shall read Lord of the Rings now!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was a good book to me because i like different kinds of books that have DnD like material in them. This book will fasinate people to all ages that are ready to read a long yet good book. It starts out in a small community of hobbits in a place called Bag End where Bilbo Baggins and other hobbits live. One morning while bilbo was smoking his pipe and making smoke rings, a wizard or enchanter named Gandalf came and talked to Mr. Baggins. Later that night a company of 13 dwarves arrived and had a feast in Mr. Baggins house in honor of the band they made up to go steal back some treasure from abig mean dragon named Smaug. Smaug had stollen a sacred treasure from the dwarves long ago and Thorin, the leader of the dwarves wanted to get it back. Their quest was a dangerous one, they had to battle through ravaging orcs, quick wolves, dangerous spiders, and the powerful elves. They also met some friends along the way including a giant man who could change into a giant bear. I think the ending is really spectacular, but your going to read it for yourself. I hoped i have convinced you to buy the book and if i didnt there are plenty of other reviews that are better than mine. Dont forget the other JRR Tolkien books, there also as good and interesting"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a classic tale of how a non-adventurous little hobbit turns into a legendary hero of sorts. It is about Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit from Bags End, who, with the guidance of Gandalf the Grey, joins thirteen dwarves on a quest to reclaim their ancestrial homeland that was taken from them by Smaug, and evil dragon. On thier journey, many problems arise in which Bilbo proves his worth countless times. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially thoe who love fantasy books. This could be read as a childrens tale or by an adult who likes fantasy or fiction type books. It starts out slow but revs up to a very exciting plot. J.R.R. Tolkien will keep you guessing what happens next."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you read fantasy, you have to read Tolkien. Each of the many fantasy books I've read borrows elements from Tolkien. Tolkien is the godfather, midwife, and guiding saint of fantasy*.

Howard, who comitted suicide before he had a chance to develop as a writer."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"So,the book is ok and so but at my personal opinion i mean that the book The lord of the rings is better in its contets it has a deeper story.The hobbit is a book I would recommend to everyone who want to have a dream world on its hands and won\`t fall into it.Anyway the book is good, very good but I would prefer other ones of this author because he has better books then this. Sillmarilion or The lord of the rings perhaps?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is easily a 5-star story, but I can't give it that because the five stars must be reserved for the Lord of The Rings, Tolkien's three-book continuation of the fantasy tale of Hobbits and Middle Earth, which is even better.I can find no way to criticize this book. It is simply marvelous. Bilbo Baggins' adventure to conquer the evil dragon, Smaug is the epitome of fantasy fiction. But as good as it is, the Ring Trilogy is somehow even better.It is possible to read the Ring Trilogy and thoroughly enjoy it without ever having read the Hobbit, but my advice is to read the Hobbit first. It provides a good deal of background so that the later story is easier to follow, plus I feel it's a let-down to read the superior Trilogy first and then follow up with the Hobbit.Then again, that's like trying to decide whether it's better to first wear diamonds or gold, or drive a Ferrarri or Porsche. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"That's what i felt about this book WOW!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Dwarfs,trolls,and dragons come to life in J.R.R.Tolkens The Hobit .Bilbo never thought would go on a adventure till Gandolf a wizard came across the bridge.Bilbo was sent to get back dwarfs money back.Read this great book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Oh crap!

Those just getting into this book from the movie should make sure to read it too!

Dragons, wars, elves, deep forests, high mountains...all the elements are here. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This fantasy novel demonstrated an amount of description, that has not been seen in any other book I've read.

First I must say this: If you do not like this book you are one of two things, a person who had no childhood or you have totally no imagination. The Hobbit brings curiosity and wonder to our everyday boring live, to think that there might be a world where a kind of adventure or life forse like this does exsist is something to live for. To be a child and think about fairies, goblins,magic,and wizards bring curiostiy to the mind. This book helps you get away for life to a world of wonder and wizardry and brings the joy of being a child to my heart."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you want something to get involved in ((I mean really involved in))then you should definitly read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; by J.R.R. Tolkien. He has captured a world none of us will ever see, and has brought it wonderfully to life. The on-going saga is wonderfully told in &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; the next three books dealing with Bilbo Baggins and his nephew Frodo. Read them! You'll fall in love them!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien, who invented 16 languages for &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, displays his brilliance throughout this wonderful book! Easier to read than &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a must for anyone considering reading THE trilogy.

I have read this book 11 times, and I am not some sort of weirdo--really. That sort of testimonial should be enough to persuade anyone to read this truly wonderful gem of a book!

Then read it again, and again, and again....you won't be able to help yourself, I guarantee."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"the HOBBIT was an enjoyable fantasy written early this century by a man who is now dead. I can't understand why so many people are calling it the worst book, or over rated. When reading THE HOBBIT, you must remember at least 2 very important things: 1) it's a fantasy...there aren't many popular fantaies these days, especially among teen agers, so please keep an open mind when reading this book. 2) it was written for children. when Tolkein first wrote this book, it was a child's fantasy book. the next 3 that followed, the popular LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, were intended for older audiences. I recomend that people crtisizing Tolkein's writing style please remember this very important fact."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Do you like journeys and magic? Well than The Hobbit (by J.R.R. Tolkien) is just the book for you. The Hobbit takes place in a \\"Fantasy Land\\". It starts out in a hobbit hole and leads to different places (caves, caverns, towns and other mysterious locations). In case you didn't know, a hobbit is a small creature; smaller than your average dwarf. But unlike a dwarf, hobbits don't have beards. Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit and also the main character in the book. One day Bilbo was quietly sitting alone at home, when he meets a wizard named Gandalf. There are dwarves that help them too. On their mysterious and dangerous journey they work together to vanquish Smaug, an evil dragon feared by the whole countryside. What'll happen to Bilbo, Gandalf, and the 13 dwarves when they encounter giant spiders and other creatures?The Hobbit is a great book because it talks about magic and journeys. J.R.R. Tolkien describes elves, dwarves, giant creatures, and best of all, \\"Hobbits\\"!! You should read this book because it's magical and mysterious. The author uses exquisite invisible rings. The sequel to this book might be better though. The Lord of the Rings has hobbits, giants, rings, and other journeys too. So what are you doing reading this for, go get this great book!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The story was good and interesting. I could barely put it down. The large variety of creatures from hobbits to spiders and dwarfs to goblins expanded my imagination. It was an adventure to read and reread over again. the story kept me at the edge of my seat. It was never ending action there and back again."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot, It is a book that in my opinion every fan of fantasy should read. Being the prequel to The Lord of the Rings trilogy it explains a lot of story elements that might otherwise be difficult to understand. This is one of my favorite books it ranks right up there with the books in the trilogy. Tolkien is a master of descriptive writing, but at times he gets almost too in depth and the story loses some of its edge and excitement hence the rating of 4. The characters are all very well developed in this book. It was this style of writing that made it much easier for the people to make the lord of the rings of movie"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I refer to the Folio Edition version of this novel.I read this book with my eight year-old son just after reading the third of the Harry Potter books (I had read 'The Hobbit' many years before). With the immanent release of the movie version of 'Lord of the Rings' following the release of 'The Philosopher's Stone' I wondered if my son was ready for 'The Lord of the Rings'. I had read 'The Lord of the Rings' several times many years ago and my memory of it was that it was a bit gruelling for a young boy to appreciate. 'The Hobbit' seemed to be a more gentle approach to the mythology of Tolkien.I was also interested in how the older book compared with Harry Potter. I have no doubt that it is much superior despite the fact that some aspects of 'The Hobbit' have dated and are a bit local in their English feel. My son was quite engrossed and had no trouble refreshing the story each evening before we set off on a new chapter.We finished reading the novel at our holiday house by the beach over the Christmas break, and this meant that our younger son was exposed to the end of the story too (he's just 5). But he appreciated the story and both boys took to weaving Middle Earth stories about the adventures of their holiday.This is a great story for sharing."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the first fantasy book that I ever read. Some will call The Hobbit a children's book, and I suppose that it could be. But, at age 23, I really enjoyed it. Each chapter has it's own plot, complete with problem and resolution, and a hook at the end to keep you turning the pages. Although Tolkien has his long-winded moments in this book, as LOR readers should be familiar with, the plot is great. I have read The Fellowship of the Ring, and I (GASP!) think that this book is better, from the standpoint of not being bored with any of it. Of course, once you read it, you'll want to find out what happens next, and the LOR series will soon follow.I highly recommend this book. It's entertaining from start to finish, and it's a great book for people young and old."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book, The Hobbit was very much enjoyed by me and my companions on our journey across the mountains. Every night we would bond together when reading this amazing book. Thank you lord for having it written."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I have read this book and I loved it. It is good almost from the start. I prefer it over the Narnia series prelude 'The Magicians Nephew' which I've also read. The Hobbit is better than most of the books in the Narnia series. It should be required reading, tying in adventure and fantasy and making a pretty little bow.Plus, with Houghton Mifflin, the Original Publisher, you can't go wrong. Happy Reading."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"i first read this book when i was in 8th grade (abt 10 years ago)and i fell in love with J.R.R.

Tolkien's Hobbit has created a 20th Century myth base on the Jungian archetype of modern man' search for a mysticalcenter. The key to the Hobbit is that is the beginning of theatomic essence of the great journey of the Hero. The call toadventure is the beginning of the trilogy of the Lord of the Ring. The universal secret of the Hobbit is that he has achieved the power of riddle of the Egyptian god thoth who hasgiven man the cleverness of speech but not the &quot;gravitas&quot; of speech. This gives him a superficial victory over ring. TheLord of the Ring brings Frido into the second stage of the callto adventure which prepares the hero to enter the underworldwhich is controlled by the powers of darkness and chaos. Thelife and death struggle lead not only to the destruction ofthe ring but the recovery of the great boon or great treasure that reveals the secret of Tolkien: the bliss is the greatcenter of the human quest. The bliss of discovery andknowledge of the real vs. illusion; good vs. evil and thereality of enviroment over the commerical poisioning of Gaia.The trials and tribulation are part of the Two Towers andthe Return of the King represent the struggle to escape fromdrowning in the evil and poison of the soul. Frido must returnto the world or face a Rip Van Winkle sleep into the ages ofevil. The grand epic of the Lord of the Rings captures themythic quality of human existence which transcends race, sex,nationality and re-affirms Jungs universal discovery of theprofound meaning of myth which has been lost and found in thetwentieth century. Jung like Tolkien had been in a T.S. EliotWasteland of World War I and the utter collapse of WesternCivilization into the dustpan of history. The Tolkien mythhas attempted to re-integrate Marcuse's One dimensional Maninto a new world based on new languages and new insight intothe Middle Earth. Jung's great perceptions of the healing powerof myth explains why The Lord of the Rings holds a new paradigm of hope in the background of the Great Terror in New York anddisintegration of human integrity."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is about a band of dwarves, a wizard, and a hobbit.

I am glad I took the time to read this excellent story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It took me about a year to read The Lord of the Rings - all books and about 2-3 weeks to devour The Hobbit. I like to say that Tolkien wrote the former for someone of similar education as him, a professor of English or some such at Oxford, an expert of the English language and history, whereas The Hobbit was written for children - for well-educated smart and savvy children but still for children and who knows? Maybe I am a kid at heart. I Loved The Hobbit!The story is beyond engaging. The descriptions are brilliant. The humor is well-placed and just delicious. The dialogues that Bilbo Baggins carries on in his head and the conclusive remarks that Tolkien makes here and there, makes you think he is just sitting in a park, surrounded with kids, doing a reading... and making observations. Oh I just loved it.I do wish there was more of Smaug, and I had hoped that he would be the ultimate climax to the end. I felt a similar way in The Lord of the Rings. The ending happened and then Tolkien was going on and on in an anticlimactic sorta way. The story really should've ended but who am I to complain? There was more of Bilbo to read and love.Fantastic read even if you are not a fantasy fiction junkie. Tolkien paints a world that all would enjoy entering so enter."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is so awesome!I read this book on a rainy day and I couldn't stop reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Over my lifetime (so far!)

A place where evil exists and is growing, but also a place where good exists and is willing to stand up to injustice, slaughter, and violence.Fans familiar with the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy will recognize characters, stories, and events from this tale, and will likely delight in learning more about Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, and the discovery of a certain ring. Rereading this story, it did seem a bit unpolished and lacking in places in comparison to Tolkein's later works, but I still enjoyed the visit to Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"A wonderful tale that captivates the minds of all ages and a great beginning to all the amazing that will follow from the mind of Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"We bought this for our nephew who seems to be enjoying taking adventures through books. This is one of our very favorite books, and I can't wait until our kids are old enough to read it. I think everyone should read this book, and feel sorry for all the people who sat in the theater around us who have never read it."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is easier to read then Lord Of The Rings and not as dark. Enjoyed reading it very much."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This light-hearted tale is surprisingly great. I first read this book when I was 20 years old, so I didn't have the attachment to it like many people I know. I read it, enjoyed it, but felt like it was a trifle compared to The Lord of the Rings books that I read soon afterwards.I've gone back to reread the book in preparation for the new movies. I'm glad I did. Tolkien's writing is fantastic. His authorial interventions give the book a good dose of humor and set up the tension for the story very well. Gollum emerges as a well-defined character right from the start. The \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" chapter is definitely the highlight of the book.I had a few issues with the book. Some of the resolution to the story isn't as satisfying as I'd like (certain actions are done \\"off screen\\" and other actions are performed by minor characters that we haven't followed on the adventures). There are so many characters (specifically dwarfs), that very few leave a real lasting impression. The book doesn't line up very well with the sequel, but I guess that is more the problem for the sequel.In the end I was surprised how much I got sucked into the book and the writing right away. The world of Middle Earth isn't as fleshed out and \\"real\\" as it is in the Lord of the Rings, but what is here is a great adventure tale that is thrilling and well-written."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It's the Hobbit for darn sake.

I hope the upcoming movie doesn't disappoint!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I decided to write this review after seeing the recently released The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey film.This version of the text, with accompanying illustrations, is a must for any parent who wants to ensure their kids read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings before seeing the movies. The movies are a blessing and a curse from a parent perspective: we want our kids to read the books and to enjoy the movies, but easy access to the movies may result in the reading portion being ditched. After reading this version, your kids should be able to tell you which parts of the movie(s)(more are coming out!) were accurate and which were not. The Hobbit, as a story, has a significantly lighter and more playful tone and plot than The Lord of the Rings. Young children will naturally gravitate toward The Hobbit (a quest to recover gold from a dragon is mighty tempting to any youngster) but illustrations give the text tangibility and will solidify retention of the story. Reading The Hobbit, particularly this version, is a great way to get your kids hooked on Tolkien before turning to the Lord of the Rings, which is a much more challenging text. Hope this helps if you're deciding whether to make this a family purchase."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This Pocket Edition of The Hobbit contains the full text of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic story, with the maps and black and white (but no color) illustrations that are to be found in larger editions. The charm of this edition is its smaller (dare I say hobbit-like?) size, which can fit easily within a pocket or handbag. Thus it becomes easily portable or, if one is as consumed by a love of Middle Earth as I am, it is exactly the right size to become a treasured talisman to be kept close to one's side.Inevitably many will consider this Pocket Edition to be suitable for children, and indeed they will find the story as charming in this version as in any other, nevertheless I would question the wisdom of giving this edition to a child as his or her's very first exposure to Tolkien. The larger editions containing color as well as black and white illustrations (preferably Tolkien's own) would better introduce a new reader to the magic of Middle Earth.Nevertheless this charming edition has great appeal and deserves to be part of every Tolkien collector's library."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The novel The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien tells the story of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. He is forced to join a group of dwarves on a quest to reclaim their families' ancient treasure from the evil dragon Smaug. It is a dangerous journey and during the quest it is Bilbo who saves the dwarves on more than one occasion and finds Smaug's weak spot to get back the dwarves' treasure. Although at the beginning of the story Bilbo does not believe he can achieve the dwarves' expectations, he ends up surpassing them. Bilbo becomes the unlikely hero of the group after many an example of his courage and ability to perform under pressure. The Hobbit is a wonderful adventure, fantasy novel which appeals to all ages. It can be read as a straight adventure story by younger readers, or as a more moral story by the older reader. Tolkien has tried to ask a question of the reader: would they rather sit at home and do nothing and have a quiet existance, or go out into the world, get involved and make a difference. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a love of exciting, fantasy and adventure stories. Although The Hobbit is around seventy years old, the underlying themes of the book are ageless."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a masterpiece of Fantasy literature. It combines elements of drama, comedy, suspense and adventure to bring your emotions to the surface. The book appeals to fans of the Fantasy genre of almost all ages. The grandfather-telling prose in which The Hobbit is written will appeal to adolescents while the sheer language, storyline and myths that Tolkien has created will surely entice the adult readers.In the opinion of this reviewer, no Fantasy fiction author gives as vivid depictions of all aspects of environments, characters and story as well as Tolkien. So much, in fact, that many popular authors since have tried to parallel Tolkien's writing style. The Hobbit (and The Lord of the Rings) is the echelon of every Fantasy book written since and should belong in every Fantasy liturature reader's library.This reviewer strongly recommends the 1997 edition of The Hobbit which marks the 60th anniversary of the first edition. The book is in beautiful hardcover format filled with lavishly painted illustrations by noted Norse myth artist Alan Lee. The illustrations serve as a wonderful supplement to an already well depicted story. The paper and typeface used in this particular edition is of the highest quality and will last for generations to come. It is wrapped nicely in a glossy paper sleeve, edged with gold foil on the top and bottom in which ancient runes of old are scribed. The sleeve is also adorned with one of the many beautiful paintings of Lee.In conclusion, please be sure to make it a point to read The Hobbit if you have not already done so. If you have had a chance to read it, you will have been rewarded with an incredible journey of the mind and will most likely want to read it again and again during the course of your lifetime, with each reading giving you a greater appreciation for Tolkien's talent."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is one of the best books I've read.

While the binding is excellent, and rare color illustrations by the author have been included, the book is poorly printed on cheap paper, the black & white illustrations are appalingly reproduced (seemingly on a cheap scanner), and the first chapter of 'Fellowship of the Ring' has been crammed (in small type) into the back of the book, like the sequel to some crummy D&D; novel.Bitter disappointment. The old hardcover edition, while not very well bound, was much nicer, printed on crisp white paper with the original b&w; illustrations very well reproduced.When will publishers learn...?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I already reviewed THE HOBBIT, but I'd thought I'd review THIS version.

I'm still quite content with mine, but had I known about THESE versions I would've gone for them. This is the best edition of THE HOBBIT I've ever seen. I gave it four starts due to the size of the actual book. It's beautiful and all, just a little large. Best read on your lap, or sitting down at a table."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As an avid reader of Fantasy novels, none has had such an impact on me then that of Tolkien's classic The Hobbit. Words alone cannot describe the full force of what this book has done to shape fantasy writing in the 20th Century. It is a book in which everyone can associate themselves to in one way or another. There are many very human issues which arise out of this book, and it does not matter if you have read it once, or a hundred times (like me) that you still grasp something new and exciting about the nature of the book.I truly believe that this is a masterpiece which has and will stand the test of time for now and many generations to come. I would happily give it six stars if I had the opportunity. I hope that people who have yet to experience its wonder do so, for the joys this book has brought to so many people (as seen by these reviews) can be shared to even more people. Any comments appreciated."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Here is one of the letters Tolkien received about the Hobbit that he sent to his son, Christopher.

I think it is the most wonderful book I have ever read. It is beyond description... Gee Whiz, I am surprised that it's not more popular...If you have written any other books, would you please send me their names?John Barrow, 12 yrs., West Town PA.I thought these extracts from a letter I got yesterday would amuse you. I find these letters which I still occassionally get (apart from the smell of incense which fallen man can never quite fail to savour) make me rather sad. What thousands of grains of good human corn must fall on barren, stony ground, if such a very small drop of water should be so intoxicating! But I suppose one should be grateful for the grace and fortune that have allowed me to provide even the drop. God bless you beloved.

He uses just enough variation in his reading to identify characters without over-emoting and the singing was really well done. We listened to this the weekend before The Hobbit movie came out and the movie seems like a Silly Putty version of the novel with very small scenes stretched to ridiculous proportions. I prefer this original. Definitely worth buying."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I recently read \\"The Hobbit\\" for only the second time in my life, and I have to argue with the people who say this is a children's book. I disagree wholeheartedly. Although there are elements of children's fantasy tales in the text, the themes and actions of \\"The Hobbit\\" are much more oriented to adults.I won't waste time rehashing plot points with this iconic text; instead I will focus on some features that stuck out to me.First off, if one is familiar with the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, I think their reading of \\"The Hobbit\\" will yield some interesting insights and they will catch some details that people not familiar with LOTR would miss. One can read, and greatly enjoy, \\"The Hobbit\\" as a standalone text, but I think it is much better when considered within the framework of LOTR.Another observation that surprised me was just how unlikeable the dwarves are in this book. Tolkien frequently mentions in his other works that dwarves are foolish and selfish, and usually only do good works when prompted by circumstance, but on this reading of \\"The Hobbit\\" they greatly annoyed me. Perhaps because of how much they remind me of most of humanity. And maybe that was Tolkien's intent? An allegory for how humanity often only makes the right choice when goaded into it, as opposed to it being our first and natural instinct.Although there are moments in the text that are a little slow going, they are few and far between, and Tolkien focuses much less on the minutia of detail about Middle Earth in this book as opposed to some of his others. I had also forgotten how action packed the last 100 pages or so of \\"The Hobbit\\" are. I was recently arguing with a friend that the decision to make the films of \\"The Hobbit\\" a trilogy was just greed as the book could not support 3 films. I was wrong, if the movies are well done, there is more than enough in this text to justify three films.This rereading of \\"The Hobbit\\" has made me want to jump back into Middle Earth, and I sense that I will be picking up and rereading more of Tolkien in the very near future. As for \\"The Hobbit\\", I will gladly revisit Bilbo Baggins and his adventures again and again over the course of my lifetime. No greater praise can one give a book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I had recently saw the movie and was intrigued to find out how the story ends so I bought the book. I'm not a big reader and have never liked paperback size 4 font books and this was def an excellent choice for me.

Its absolutely gorgeous and will look great on the bookshelf when I'm finished."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've read this more times than I can count. Love it! And when the movie comes out on DVD, I'll have my own little marathon."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Better than the movie? Of course. A classic now and forever more and it's suitable for all ages. You're never too young or too old for The Hobbit"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I started reading the book for th love of movie.

I have not yet downloaded the Kindle edition but it would clearly be more convenient to carry around than the paperback. The book itself has a much more tightly focused story than The Lord of the Rings. (This makes me worry about the decision of the film-makers to turn it into a series of three feature films. There was easily enough material in The Lord of the Rings to support that treatment but I can't see how it will work for The Hobbit.) Anyway, for anyone who hasn't yet read it I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read this book with my mom as a kid and enjoyed the adventure. I read it again as an adult and have enjoyed it on a whole new level. Tolkien's writing style isn't for everyone so I'd recommend trying a sample first. I'd also recommend reading it before you see the movie, as I've found it difficult to get through LOTR now that I can just watch the movies."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"After all, that's what the author did. The first time I read this, I was in First Grade. I loved it. The author brings you into a world all his own, brilliantly detailed and filled with marvelous characters. The hero of the story, Bilbo, does good and wonderful things in the service of his companions, even when he knows they may not appreciate it.If you are a parent who is concerned about what to read to your children out of moral or religious concerns, you have nothing to fear from this book. The author, a Christian and friend of C.S. Lewis, did not let any muddled theology into his book. It is simply an unforgetable adventure with magic, (no explicable source)Goblins, Trolls, dragons, an enchanted river, and giant spiders. You and your children will enjoy this book for years to come."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, and it's more involved sequel (TLOTR), is without question the first and strongest source of my desire to read and to write. As a child, my camp counsellor read segments of The Hobbit as a bedtime activity. I often fell asleep to the tales of Bilbo and his dwarven companions, only to wake up saddened that I didn't make it to the climax of the scene before nodding off. At 10 years of age I came home from camp demanding that my mother buy me this most remarkable book so that I might learn what exactly happened to my new friends (the counsellor wisely wouldn't tell me what I had missed!). I read the book (the first adult book I actually chose to read without a teacher making me) and then read it again! The detailed painting of Middle Earth, and the characters thereof, ignited my imagination.I became an avid reader, always in search of that magic that would transport me to another place, another time. Though I have found many, many books that I have enjoyed reading, there has never been a book that has so utterly captured my imagination and my heart as Tolkien's The Hobbit.The Lord of the Rings is truly a masterpiece of modern literature, and I would recommend it to any that are in search of a wondrous adventure, but I have never mentioned the trilogy without insisting-demanding-that the person first get lost in its prequel. Though TLOTR stands alone, The Hobbit, with its easy style, scaled-down history, lesser characters, and fewer scene changes, is completely indispensible for a deep understanding of what comes next.Tolkien's biography may scare off the casual reader if they hear of his scholarly background, but do not be fooled: His works are more accessible to the reader than anything by Ann Rice, Stephen King, or Frank Herbert. Though no less intelligent or involving Tolkien manages to give the reader a much more &quot;immersive&quot; experience, transporting them into his world, rather than projecting the world onto and around them as most other authors do.I took a cue from that long-ago camp counsellor and began to read The Hobbit to my little son, the moment he was past Green Eggs And Ham. Often now(he's seven), he asks me to read specific passages to him, usually the Bilbo/Smaug confrontations or, sometimes, the adventures with the trolls or the spiders.Yes, this book is a vehicle in which I share &quot;quality time&quot; with my young son. It is also my literary inspiration. I enjoy writing. Whenever I run into a block I pick up my copy and open it randomly. By the end of the page, I'm back at my typewriter, filled with renewed enthusiasm, if not new ideas.I cannot recommend this novel more heartily, and cannot recommend more desperately that you read it before some teacher tells you to do it as a book report. Do it as an assignment, and you will go into the story filled with a bitterness that will ruin the glory of Middle Earth.Remember: when my son, Matthew, is in one of his moods during the day, or depressed about one thing or another right before bedtime, I lean over and whisper something in his ear that brings a smile to his face and a twinkle to his eyes...&quot;In a hole in the ground there lived a Hobbit...&quot;"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The movie will be out soon. However, there is still time to do the right thing and read the book first! From what I hear, the movie is going to be outstanding. But even if our collective hair stands on end, the earth shakes beneath our feet, and a magnificent rapture proclaims us saved for all time...well, I digress. Anyway, my point is, it would be nice for audience members to acknowledge one of the greatest works of fantasy ever put to paper before they see the movie. So if you are debating whether to read the book or wait for the film, let me promptly put an end to that discussion: READ THE BOOK!!!Why is The Hobbit so great? For me, it has always been the character of Bilbo Baggins. He is lovable yet flawed, brave yet frightened. He is, for lack of a better description, very human!Like so many that toil through work days, constantly fighting through the challenges and sorrows of life, Bilbo finds himself thrown into the cross-hairs of evil and injustice. While we face the daily barrage of family problems and feuds, enemies, disease and the general unfairness of life, Bilbo also finds himself on a similar battlefield. Instead of a sinister real-life boss, Bilbo matches wit with the manipulative Gollum. Instead of a gang of criminals, Bilbo battles spiders. No matter what the fictional representation may be, the same code of honor all righteous men hold dear is manifested in Bilbo's duty to do the right thing.After all this time, Tolkien remains the ultimate master of placing the reader front and center in this remarkable fantasy. Tolkien makes us relate to the main character because Bilbo is just like you and me. Bilbo is every man. He is the reluctant hero kicking and screaming his way through the avalanche of predicaments that sooner or later pay us all a visit. His triumph is our own. In my opinion, The Hobbit is a testament to this truth."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\`The Hobbit' by J. R. R. Tolkien is often described as the prequel to the much longer \`Lord of the Rings'. I often thought that designation simply does not do justice to the importance of this little \`children's' book.I have an almost reverential respect for the novel, having bought my first copy of this work on a cold February day in 1965 in the Lehigh University bookstore. I began reading it on the bus on the way home from my college classes at about 1:00 PM, and simply could not put it down. I finished reading it at about 8:30 that evening. The experience is not unlike Dorothy's opening the door of her Kansas house to step out onto the grass of Oz. I am totally unsurprised by a statement that says that the entire first page of \`The Hobbit' has been reproduced in \`Bartlett's Familiar Quotations'. There are few more magical or evocative openings to novels I have read in my whole life. I can appreciate that there are adult readers such as my Hemingway loving uncle who simply \`don't get it'. I am often driven to the point of dispair when I can't interest young readers or listeners in \`The Hobbit'. Like \`Winnie the Pooh' and \`Alice in Wonderland', I really think these are books designed much more to bring back memories of childhood in adults than to engage young readers. And oh how much I enjoy reading \`The Hobbit' aloud!\`The Hobbit' shares many similarities with \`Alice in Wonderland' in that both authors were distinguished Oxford dons who created the works out of stories they made up for young listeners. The differences are as interesting as the similarities. While Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) was a logician, Tolkien was a philologist. So, while both, in a sense, studied language, the differences in their avocations are evident in their text. Dodgson's works are full of logical curiosities and Tolkien's works are full of linguistic inventions, going so far as to create parts of at least three different languages to put into the mouths of his \`Hobbit' and \`Lord of the Rings' characters. But Tolkien went much further than simply creating languages. Even Carroll dabbled in creating words (see the poem \`Jabberwocky'). Tolkien created whole histories of a huge continent ruled by demiurges very similar to the Olympian gods and populated by at least three races of immortal elves, seven clans of dwarves, dragons, trolls, giant spiders, goblins, shapeshifting men, giant eagles, intelligent wolves, and some horrors too unspeakable to bring up here, as they do not appear in \`The Hobbit'.This history was probably not committed to paper as Tolkien was writing \`The Hobbit', but it was certainly in the back of his mind. And, it is this sense of great depth to Middle Earth's history that gives one great added pleasure in reading this book.For the three adults who don't know the story of \`The Hobbit', it is the tale of a band thirteen homeless dwarves lead by a former king of their clan, Thorin Oakenshield who wishes to reclaim his home and treasure from a rather large and rather cunning dragon named Smaug. Thorin meets up with the wizard, \`Gandalf the Gray' and over a pint of ale, hatch the scheme of hiring a thief and raiding their treasure from right under the dragon's nose. The thief who Gandalf selects is a most unlikely adventurer, a hobbit who is even more set in his comfortable ways than is usual for these very comfortable rural folk. But hobbits happen to have a few attributes that make them especially good at burglary. They are quiet in the extreme when sneaking up on something and they are exceptionally good with slings and hurling projectiles by hand.I will not tell much more of the plot, as the unfolding of the story is by far one of the greatest pleasures. This is in no way a character study; it's all about landing in trouble and getting out of it by the skin of their teeth. Aside from banishing a major league dragon from their cozy mines, the main point of the story is the finding of a magical golden ring, which is the jumping off point of \`Lord of the Rings'.There is another less obvious connection between \`The Hobbit' and \`The Lord of the Rings'. Gandalf's support of Thorin's adventure is not done out of the goodness of his heart, it is done to remove a major calamity from the playing field before Sauron, the ultimate heavy in \`The Lord of the Rings', can make use of Smaug. Even though dragons seem to be a pretty independent lot, there is no questions that Sauron could not bend even Smaug to his will, especially if Sauron recovered the \`One Ring'.One thing which always disappointed me about the great historical back story behind \`The Hobbit' and \`The Lord of the Rings' is that the origin and history of the wizards in Middle Earth is never fully spelled out. The history of the elves is done in great detail, but little is directly told of Gandalf, Saruman, and the other three wizards. The only thing of which I can be sure is that unlike Beorn, the eagles, and humans, they are not native to Middle Earth. There is but a single reference to a race of magicians in \`The Silmarillion', but neither the name Gandalf or Mithrandir appears anywhere in this last of Tolkien's major works.Since having read \`The Hobbit' and \`The Lord of the Rings', I have searched in vain for tales of equal quality and there are none. Arthurian legends come close and next to Gandalf, Merlin is easily my favorite fictional character, but Tolkien seems to have hit a mother lode of wonder and lore was before and remains hidden to other writers."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The story is superb, but I will not cover the story.The cover, pages, and binding are of high quality. I also purchased the Lord of The Rings Illustrated edition. These are a companion set and worth every penny. I recommend this edition if you are a fan of the book and don't want another $10 copy of the book. This is a beautiful edition that will last for generations. The pictures are beautiful and do not detract from the story as written. This is the edition to buy if you love this book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Here is one of the letters Tolkien received about the Hobbit that he sent to his son, Christopher. His son was stationed in South Africa during WWII and Tolkien sent him chapters from Lord of the Rings as he wrote them.From a Letter to JRR Tolkien's son Christopher (JRRT, Letters #87):Dear Mr Tolkien,I have just finished reading your book The Hobbit for the 11th time and I want to tell you what I think of it. I think it is the most wonderful book I have ever read. It is beyond description... Gee Whiz, I am surprised that it's not more popular...If you have written any other books, would you please send me their names?John Barrow, 12 yrs., West Town PA.I thought these extracts from a letter I got yesterday would amuse you. I find these letters which I still occassionally get (apart from the smell of incense which fallen man can never quite fail to savour) make me rather sad. What thousands of grains of good human corn must fall on barren, stony ground, if such a very small drop of water should be so intoxicating! But I suppose one should be grateful for the grace and fortune that have allowed me to provide even the drop. God bless you beloved. Do you think The Ring will come off, and reach the thirsty?Your own Father.P.S. It's nice to find that little American boys do really say &quot;Gee Whiz&quot;."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I loved this book in my childhood and it was the \\"one\\" (excuse the pun!) which set me to loving fantasy. I suppose you could say this is entry level, which then leads to the more mature Lord of the Rings Trilogy - just like the Harry Potter books seemed to get more and more complex as the series went on. Anyway, it's a great first step into the fantasy genre and will immediately make you aware of the pretenders out there; In fact, annoyingly so. I now spend my time looking for something as great, but still original. This has led me to the likes ofPerdido Street Stationby China Mi&eacute;ville,13 1/2 Lives of Captain Bluebearby Walter Moers and the little known but excellentInto The Treesby J. Alastair Nash. Just knowing those names has save you hours already!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you love Michael Hague's dragon illustrations then this is the copy of The Hobbit for you. His illustrations capture the tone and the mystique of Middle Earth better than any others I have seen."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit has always held a special place in my heart, even compared to Lord of the Rings. While The Hobbit obviously doesn't go as far in depth into the history of Middle-Earth as Lord of the Rings does, in many ways The Hobbit's simplicity is its charm. The book is quite simply the quintessential adventure tale. I love how the book begins quickly and follows with a series of short, ordered adventures. Tolkien handles the character of Bilbo brilliantly allowing him to become more adventurous, but also making sure that he doesn't lose his Hobbit roots. Best of all, Tolkien throws in a few twists that make the Hobbit far more interesting than most fantasy stories. The trouble doesn't end with the slaying of the dragon (for those few who haven't read the book yet, I won't spoil it). For readers wanting more than an adventure story, Tolkien also weaves a compelling commentary on the power of greed and the nature of adventures. No wonder this has become a classic. I can't wait for Peter Jackson's Hobbit movies to come out.A brief note about the annotations. There are a lot of them. Most of the annotations note changes from the previous versions, particularly changes made to account for discrepancies between the 1937 Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings. The \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" chapter underwent particularly dramatic revisions. Other annotations discuss the origins of words or concepts in the story. The book also includes dozens of illustrations from various versions of the Hobbit. Few of these sketches impressed me, except for Tolkien's, whose is surprisingly good. I'd definitely recommend reading the annotated version if this is your second or third read through this story, but for first time readers it might prove more a distraction than a help."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I've always loved the Hobbit, so even though I own the hardcover version, it made sense to get a digital copy for my Kindle. I wasn't sure if the Kindle version would do the book justice, but this edition is quite good. Tolkien's images are beautifully reproduced, and the songs are formatted in a way that meets the style treatment Tolkien envisioned. My only complaint revolves around two issues common to many Kindle products:The first is that in a few places there's an unexpected line break in the middle of a sentence. This happens on many Kindle books, and seems to be a symptom of a greater problem, where these books are not as carefully edited as hardcopy books. But this is a minor issue.The second problem is that when you click on a link in the \\"Illustrations\\" list to view the map or illustration, only on the Kindle itself can you quickly get back to where you stopped reading. On the iPhone or iPad there's no convenient \\"back\\" button for this action, forcing you to manually find your way back to the page you were on prior to looking at the map or other illustration. You can create a bookmark, but it's an extra step that's complex and shouldn't be necessary. This is an interface problem related to the Kindle software itself and not really a complaint with this specific book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I bought the graphic novel version for my kids under 10 years old to introduce them to the Hobbit. It gives a good summarized version of the story with good drawing. The only exception would be Bilbo seems a bit too heavy and round to make a convincing adventurer.

I love the simple beginning \\"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.\\" It plays to my curiosity immediately. Bilbo is such a likable character. His initial hesitancy to do anything unexpected is relatable. I think his subconscious sense of adventure lives in a lot of us...in me. While on his journey he realizes what he is capable of. I like how he accidentally saves his traveling companions from perilous situations over and over again coming off as the unlikely hero.The subtle finding of the \\"One Ring\\" was intriguing leading to the introduction of the mysterious creature Gollum. I like his big round pale lamp-like eyes. The game of riddles between Bilbo and Gollum was particularly entertaining while full of angst. His eagerness to eat the juicy \\"scrumptiously crunchable\\" hobbit was creepy.The Battle of Five Armies was swift and exciting. \\"The elves were the first to charge. Their hatred for the goblins is cold and bitter. Their spears and swords shone in the gloom with a gleam of chill flame, so deadly was the wrath of the hands that held them.\\" I love it from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.

Tolkien, should be made into a movie and in the hopes that you would be willing to direct it.Mr. Spielberg, it came to my attention some time ago that the story The Hobbit should be remade into a feature film and although I know that you probably have an extremely busy schedule it would be a great honor if you would see about directing my movie. As you may already know, The Hobbit has already been made into a movie and that the movie The Lord of the Rings is already in the makings, I still wish to have a remade and revamped version of the story, preferably using live action rather than animation. I feel that the adventurous story of a hobbit as he and his friends make their way to a dragon's lair, in order to slay him, would make for a wonderful movie. There are many fantasy adventure fans out there just waiting for another movie based on this popular book. This story has all the makings for a great movie: a likable and funny main character, a old and wise father figure, a multitude of helpful friends, and the freedom of creativity that only a fantasy story can give. The basic structure of a good lesson, namely the advancement from complacency and boredom to adventure and mystery, and the combination of action packed adventure could possibly even make The Hobbit a better seller even than E.T.The wonderful tale of an adventurous hobbit, of the new friends he makes and their struggle to take back their home should make for a superb movie. Along with the possibility of several sequels if this first movie works out there are the endless possibilities for creativity and ingenuity on the part of the director. Thanks to the advancements in visual arts and computer graphics it is now possible to create the vivid and vibrant universe that was originally created by J.R.R. Tolkien in his wonderful story. My only hope is that you will accept my proposal for a movie based on The Hobbit and that you might be able to direct it yourself or at least pass it on to someone with as much vision as yourself. I thank you for taking the time to read my request and I hope you consider the opportunities available for success."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"POSSIBLY THE BEST BOOK OF ALL TIME, AND IT'S ONLY IN 300 PAGES!

They go on wild adventures and fight goblins, trolls, and giant spiders. Once they reach Lonely Mountain they find Smaug the dragon guarding what they had wanted most, the treasure.

A book of adventure and friendship, of bravery and cruelty. Poor Bilbo Baggins just wants to live a nice, comfortable life in his warm, snug hobbit hole like any other hobbit, but comes Gandalf, the magician who makes lovely fireworks displays, bringing a horde of dwarves with him, and from there it only goes downhill. They need a quiet, sneaky hobbit to help them recover their lost gold from the evil, fire-breathing dragon Smaug. Many dangers lie along their path, but courage and heart win them through. In the end, Bilbo realizes that there are much more important things in life than being comfortable and a world full of beauty beyond the Shire.

An enchanting classic ~ i find it casts a spell over me each time i read it. I am able to enter into the story, suffer along with the characters, feel with them, be sorry for their travails, be saddened by their foolishness, and mourn as Thorin Oakenshield, Kili and Fili die in battle. It is difficult to read this book and not see foreshadowing of &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; though that is not the best way to read it. It does not tie perfectly with the latter book, there are a couple of points which don't link, quite. But for the most part i see the trilogy in the book, and had to be careful not to push it too much to the girls ~ apart from anything else, it is probably a little above them right now, and it would certainly be a major commitment to read. Standing by itself, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a wonderful story, with a well-wrought plot, characters that are near enough human for us to relate to them, yet far enough from us for the enchantment to work, and enough stylistic ties to legend, myth, and saga that it is familiar to me and will ring echoes in the girls' ears as they read further."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien can only be described as a mideival fantasy. It is the story of how a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins sets out on an adventure with some newly made friends to find the fortune that awaits them. His companions are 13 dwarves variously sized but all about half the size of a human. The wizard Gandalf also greatly helps on their adventure. The reason all of this got started was because when the head dwarf of the group named Thorin Oakenshield, was just a young boy the castle he and his family lived in was destroyed by the dragon Smaug. His family and friends were all killed and he barely escaped with his life. He vowed revenge and to take bake the kingdom that would have once been his. His long time friend Gandalf helps get the motley bunch together and they start on their adventure. On their way they encounter such things as goblins, spiders, elves, ravenous wolves and the horrid golum. In the end it turned out the dwarves started a huge war which they ended up winning and as they vowed, they took back what was rightfully theirs. I would absolutely recomend this book to anyone, anywhere. This is not only one of my favorite books, but listening to other peoples reviews, their favorite too.

The whole story of going to take back what is theirs even though they must face impossible odds, they themselves spoke that they wouldn't make it, the book is also written in some old English to make the characters seem older and mature. Though the book does a good job in letting one know what the characters are thinking and feeling, one cannot get a good grasp of what the characters are like. I believe the book lacks in this, because the characters are in such extreme emotional and physical conditions. I liked the message of I got from the book which was the underdog taking a stand, and not going out without a fight no matter the odds.This book makes you feel what the characters are because like I said it feels like you are right there in the middle of it all.

Bilbo goes on an adventure with some elves to reclaim a stolen treasure. They must retrieve the treasure from the dragon namd Smaug who gaurds it. Along the way there are many adventures and exciting things the travelers encounter.This book is for young teens to young adults. It has a good theme that kids can relate to. Bilbo is different than everyone else and he doesn't think he is much of an adventuror or hero. In the end though he realizes that even though he may be small an different he can use those things to his advantage. All he needs is to believe he can do it and then he can. Kids can relate to that and realize that if they believe in themselves they can achieve anything.This book stirred many self motivating emotions. It made me feel courageous. If there was something I needed to do and I was scared of it, I should just be brave and face it. I'm sure it would make many younger kids feel the same way.I thought this book was a very interesting book. Some parts were less interesting and exciting than others but there were really exciting moments which made up for the dull ones.

I can see even now how his world got turned upside down and what amazing adventures awaited him. He was the quintessential reluctant hero, who delivered grandly in the darkest hours. What an amazing story!What really tickled me later was to realize all the minor ways and passages that Tolkien created in this masterpiece were but gates that lead to entire worlds. Each of those little plot offshoots would yield millenia of history, entire sagas, in the later books.Back then who would have known, least of all I, how far and wide the world was. I don't think Tolkien himself knew, and the biographer's may agree with me.The Hobbit is forever enshrined as a classic children's book, but to me it carries a greater significance. It is essential reading to be weaned into the stupendous world Tolkien created, to journey through the agonies and bliss of The Lord of the Rings, and finally to flood the senses and overload the emotions in Silmarillion.But to begin the voyage, one must read the Hobbit.To not complete the voyage, one must forever wonder, to what depths and heights of genius did Tolkien's mind travel?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is about a band of dwarves, a wizard, and a hobbit.

Lord of the Rings-The fellowship of the Ring(part one),The two towers(part two), and the Return of the King(part three). Each book is tied to one another in a continuous plot. These 3 books are page turners as well, filled with suspense and uncertainty. The charactrs are not your typical heroes also. One does not know what to expectfrom each, yet you undersand their own unique personalities. They are very human in nature, even the wise Gandalf. The three part series is more complex in plot also in comparison to the Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"From the first to the last page, Tolkien creates the perfect picture of Middle Earth for the mind. The reader is lead on a journey with the group and visits enchanted and cursed lands that is described like no other. This book opened the door for modern fantasy and remains the standard by which others are measured."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Written By: J.R.R. TolkienIt is a Faiytale Adventure.It is a story of Bilbo baggins, who is a hobbit. One day he finds himself in an adventure with dwarf. After his adventure he realizes he barely excapes with his life and adventures are funner than he thought.In a way this is very much like, The Call of the Wild by Jack London, because Buck and Bilbo were both taken from there home and force to go were they did not want to go; but Bilbo made it back to his home and Buck didn't.If you don't like reading try reading this.I very much like the style that Tolkien wrote this book in, because it keeps you wanting to see what is going to happen to Bilbo. On page 17, when Bilbo said, &quot;Good morning&quot;. Gandalf asked him what he meant by the phrase &quot;good morning&quot;. Tolkien makes you think about what the characters say and do. If you have never been on an adventure yourself, you should try going with a Hobbit named Bilbo. Even though Tolkien is a great writer, there are some drawbacks to his style. To you students read this over the weekend because you may not be able to put it down."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, Tolkien captivates the human imagination with the fantastical tale of a Hobbit, who wanted nothing more than to stay in his hole sipping tea, when a wizard and thirteen dwarves recruit them for their journey and steal back their stolen treasure. Bilbo, the hobbit, represents what the majority of western population is like, fat, lazy, and unwilling for adventures, yet somehow the wizard, Gandalf, stirs his longings for adventures that are buried deep inside of Bilbo, the side which he calls \\"the Tookish part of him.\\" Tolkien is much like Gandalf, he finds us sitting in our homes, eating cake, drinking beer, and smoking our pipes, and even though we might not think we want to go on a journey, Tolkien rouses us up to come on a journey, go places you've never been, and meet people you never knew. Bilbo's journey is a page turning classic that is the prelude to the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy.Tolkien uses incredible characterization in his vast list of characters. The dwarves each have there own unique characteristics and hilarious names such as Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Dori, Nori, and Ori. The dwarves mainly have one thing on their mind, and that is to steal back the treasure that was taken from them long ago. In fact they don't even like Bilbo, but only bring him along, so as to not have an unlucky number in the party. Gandalf is a favorite character in the story, he is wise beyond years, and yet so much of him is a mystery.On Bilbo's journey he runs into trolls, a host of goblins, warves(wolves), and slinks away from them all, with the help of Gandalf and the dwarves, and a certain ring that makes the wearer invisible, which he just happened to win, by pure luck, in a riddle-competition, with a strange creature. The Hobbit is a page-turning classic that takes us in to the world of Middle-Earth and onto an unforgettable journey."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is a good one.Bilbo don't want to get to adventure but Gandalf let him join.He went on the journey to the misty mountains and met many difficulties.Grab one book now and read about this fantastic book!!!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The movie is probably good but for me the book stinks .

If I didn't need to finish it for book club I wouldn't have finished it at all."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was a very good plot, but Tolkien's style of writing in this book is not as good as in the LOTR trilogy. It starts very abruptly, and i hated that Thorin Oakenshield got killed! Okay."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Ordered this for my daughter's reading list to compliment the book she was reading. Excited to begin."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I had to read the Hobbit for my advanced English class.. Lets just say that this book and I don't get along. Its well written and has a good plot. But its just the way the narrator and characters speak confused me whole time. It deserves stars for just being an ok book, but I would never read this of my own will."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Even with the understanding that 'The Hobbit' is a children's book (despite the views of those who want to lump everything Tolkien ever wrote into a single 'fantasy' category), 'The Hobbit's main problem is that it just isn't very exciting.There is certainly a lot of potential,but the story moves much too slowly, and seems twice as long as it actually is! There were some mildly entertaining scenes early on, but the endless descriptions of rather mundane activities(such as the dwarves' past, present, and future mealtime activities, and the various kitchen utensils they used)took up too much space! After a while, even the exciting parts of the journey began to blend together, and it all got very monotonous by the end.Even as children's literature, it's not very compelling. Maybe I'm just biased, since I'm not a big fan of this type of fantasy literature, and prefer having at least one 'Earth human' character along. Tolkien's rambling sentences, bad dwarf poetry, and the general 'smugness' of his narration (which seems to change from being a typical unseen, omniscient storyteller, to Tolkien himself making asides to his children)make 'The Hobbit' a chore to read. Where many people got sucked into the story, I just felt disconnected and boredIn fact, I didn't quite finish the book, skimming quite a bit of the middle, and not quite making it all the way through the last two chapters.I tried reading 'The Silmarillion' first, and found it too dense, then found this one to be a very simple story which the author made far too complicated because he didn't know when to embellish and when to keep it simple. I still plan on reading 'LOTR' someday, but for now, I need a break from talkin' about Tolkien!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I love this book. Okay, so when I first read it at age seven i freaked, but i still love it. It's a nice little fantasy book, with a nice tidy ending that still does leave some strings hanging loose (the Ring being the most important). It's pretty simple (the plot, that is), and the adventures involved are fun to read, although the narration style occaisionally encroaches on this. It does contain fairy-tale-like characters and elements -- the dragon, the treasure, the elves (though they are not the typical fairytale elves), wizards, dwarves (who are also not-so-typical) -- but is half the adventure-quest sort of book. It's not the serious quest tale that The Lord of the Rings is, but it's certainly a necessary part of the story. Light, quick, and adventurous. A great book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"The Hobbit\\" is one of my favorite books ever.I think it is almost more enjoyable then LOTR because it is a little more light-hearted and such.I really like Bilbo, even if all he wants to do is be a coach potatoe. It's part of his charm.buy the book. It's awesome."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Imagine this! You are sitting at home on a nice summer day when you hear a knock on the door. Innocent enough, right? Wrong! You answer to find a troop of wayward dwarves on your doorstep! So, without so much as a warning you are dragged off to an unwelcome whirlwind of an adventure!This is exactly what happened to Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag-End, Under-Hill, The Shire. Especially chosen for this dangerous quest across Middle-earth, Bilbo goes with the dwarves. The mission is to regain their mountain from the evil dragon, Smaug.Challenging many creatures on the way (such as trolls, goblins, giant spiders, and of course the strange beast, Gollum) they finally come to the mountain. Now the company must face thier greatest challenge, Smaug.This extraordinary novel is about a country bumpkin's transformation to a travel-hardened hobbit of the world.

A wizard with words, JRR. Tolkien weaves an enchanting story of the quest undertaken by 13 dwarves led by Gandalf the Grey and a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins.When we first start this tale, we see a hobbit outside of his hobbit hole, smoking his pipe, and blowing smoke rings. Gandalf the Wizard comes by asking if Bilbo was interested in a quest filled with intrigue and treasure. Being the respectable Hobbit he is, he declines and instead invites Gandalf to tea the next day.This is how the greatest fantasy book of all time starts. Not just a book for children, I myself am 14 currently, and have read this book 5 times. It is a tale that leads you through an exciting quest filled with adventure and mystery with the reward of insurmountable wealth at the end, if they complete the quest at all.If you are looking for a book that will keep you entwined for the rest of your life, pick up a copy of the Hobbit, or any of Tolkien's other books."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit was grappling! It made me feel like I was the main charecter. The book is about Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit Who meets Gandalf the wizard, who takes Bilbo and a group of dwarfs on a adventure to reclaim the dwarfs' lost treasure and kill the beast that killed almost all the dwarfs in the castle that it took over. This book is for someone 7+ years old and likes magic, elves, goblins, etc., etc,. etc."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is must for any person that loves a good imaginative story. It is my favorite book and I'm only 10! When you first start to read it it might seem just like an ordinary fantasy novel, but it isn't. J. R. R. Tolkien spent a lifetime working on Middle-Earth. It is filled with songs and poems that help the flow of the story. Don't expect sing alongs some of them are in a different language that isn't used by humans on earth. As you read the story you realize how much meaning the little hobbit really has. You also realize that there are so many things that happened before that particular story. Even when some people tell their own name you can tell that they are the sonn or daughter of an important person long ago. No one should miss out on such an amazing story."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I collect editions of Tolkien's work, and received this one from my wife for my birthday. A wonderfully interesting twist on a classic! It is done &quot;comic style&quot;, with balloon dialog through out, but the story editing was done very well, and the illustration is absolutely beautiful. It really is a must have for any Tolkien fan, and a nice departure from the many hardcover and paperback editions you probably already have. It would be an excellent introduction to Tolkien's world for younger readers as well."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"i am 14 years old.

I then went and did my best nerd voice saying &quot;yo d&amp;d is shhweet. (heh) But, a few days ago, I picked this book up. As I read it I found myself not being able to stop reading. It was an amazing book. To anyone who thinks that this book is for dorks or geeks like I did, &quot;you are sadly mistaken&quot;. It is fun to read unlike most books. To me, this is &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; of fantasy books. I am only too glad that I decided to humor my mom by reading this amazing book."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As an adult, I went back reread this little guy. I was blown away!

Required reading for any book lover or anyone with an imagination."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"After years of my friends bugging me to read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings I finally took their advice. The Hobbit is one of the best books I have ever read. I liked it so much I read it twice. The second time was more enjoyable then the first. I currently own it in paperback but I plan on purchasing a hard copy and reading it again.I suggest reading it immediately. If I only would have listened to my friends."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings Trilogy are books that simply grab your imagination. I first picked them up my freshman year in highschool and I haven't been able to put them down since. I have read all of them 5 times at least, and each time they seem to get more magical. Tolkien, like no other writer, is able to take the reader and actually put them into his book. His writing is full of detail, and the vividness of the scenes he paints grabs the readers attention and doesn't let go. It is by far the greatest literary work of the 20th century, and in my opinion the greatest ever."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"It took me a while to actually read this book. I had started it when I was in junior high, but became too swamped with school reading to finish it. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more then. It's not that it's bad... it's just sort of plain.I guess you have to take into account that it was written in 1937, which I didn't realize until I finished it. I had always assumed that &quot;the Hobbit&quot; and its earthy themes was a product of the sixties. Apparently not. So this means that the world was a very different place when this book was written.I also tried to keep in mind that the whole fantasy genre grew out of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy; so these progenitors may seem tired because a lot of what I have already read has drawn quite liberally from these sources. Or maybe I'm biased against the whole adventure story thing. The risk of the adventure story is that the adventure *is* the story and that each part of the adventure is an isolated incident with no bearing on the next. In the case of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, there's the orcs, then the goblins, then Gollum, and so on. And, yes, Bilbo grows with each incident. But the story is so consumed with the incidents that it includes precious little else. The characters are flat and predictable -- and I think I'm supposed to like Bilbo, but I don't. I know he's supposed to be the anti-hero, the everyman rising to the occassion. But I just find him annoying.I have another issue with the narrator. Yes, I know it's the whole bard thing, I get it. It still doesn't stop me from thinking that there is a better way of telling this story. It's a little more aimed at kids than I remember when I attempted it a long time ago. Which may account for the lack of description, which, when included, is very vague in this novel. I want to know more than cusory details. When Bilbo gets lost in the mountain and stumbles upon Gollum, I never got the cloying sensation of twisting, dark tunnels. Instead, we are treated to something that is more akin to directions. Left. Right. Down, down, down. It cuts right to the action, so there's no tension and release. Things just happen and go away.And that, friends, is the whole problem in a nutshell:Things happen and go away.I am told that Tolkien wrote this as a bedtime story. I don't know if that's true, but it does have that sort of quality to it. I feel bad saying this, because I know it's a classic, but I think I like the animated movie better...Good for kids, adults will be disappointed....Unless, of course, you're a fan. In which case, you hate me."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is supposed to be an enhanced edition, but audio content is not working on any of my devices including the Kindle.The story is of course worth 5 stars, but selling an enhanced version that does not work is worth \\"no stars\\" or a single star.Just get the regular version is my recommendation."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Okay, I know I'm setting myself up for a lot of flack by giving &quot;The Hobbit&quot; only three stars, but I don't think these reviews are worth much unless you're willing to be perfectly honest about your opinions...even if those opinions happen to be different than those of everyone else on the planet, or in the solar system. So here goes.I'm twenty-eight, and I've been a huge fan of horror and sci-fi books and movies since I was about 12. I haven't read much in the way of fantasy fiction, however, even though it's such a closely related sibling to the two genres I love so dearly. As a kid, I loved the Narnia books, and I recently enjoyed the Harry Potter series quite a bit. So with the new movies based on Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy coming out, I decided it was time to dig into these pillars of the fantasy genre.I decided to start with &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; since I'm the kind of person who always reads forewords and afterwards. I had heard so many people talk about it over the years, that I felt like I had already inhaled most of the characters and plot points like second hand smoke.Okay, let me start with some of what I liked: I think &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is an original, often charming and fun-to-read story with some great thematic floorboards holding it all up. I like that Bilbo Baggins has some roguish family blood in his veins causing him to crave adventure in a most unhobbit-like manner. It is inspiring that Bilbo is unafraid to follow his own path. His actions and his unbending courage to be himself make him a role model for anyone. In addition to Bilbo, most of the other hobbits, dwarves, and elves that inhabit this book are also quite likable.It's generally a fun quest story that appeals to the imaginations of all ages. There's a dragon guarding some stolen treasure, and a series of fortunes and misfortunes along the way that keep the reader vested in the group's concerns.But there were also a couple of major shortcomings to &quot;The Hobbit&quot; that, in my view, kept it from being a great book. Now here's the part where my opinion will probably veer off from most anyone else's. But like Bilbo, I feel compelled to be my own self.I felt that the style of the narration was overly intrusive; it made me feel less than involved in the story most of the time. I've read the complaints that &quot;The Hobbit&quot; reads too much like a kids' book. I didn't feel that exactly, but rather, that the point of view was just too off-putting. There's an omniscient narrator who sweeps in on invisible wings from time to time, taking you away from characters and events you've invested large chunks of pages following.Also, despite a pretty decent set up and first half, I felt that the book's ending just wasn't very well constructed. The writing isn't actually bad, but the dramatic momentum is often lacking. With less than a hundred pages left to go, a huge inter-race war breaks out, taking you away from the story you've spent most of the book following. When you finally get back to the end of the original quest, the role of hero and dragonslayer is unceremoniously taken from Bilbo by a character that we hardly know.I just felt that there was way too much narrative gear-shifting throughout this book. It felt like I was taking a ride with someone who's just learning to drive a stick.I don't mean to offend anyone with this review. I just felt it was best to be honest. I know lots of people who love this book, people whose opinions I greatly respect. I'll just have to live with a differing opinion on this. In my view, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a pretty good story with some major structural flaws that detract from the pleasure of reading it.If you grew up with &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as I did with &quot;Star Wars&quot; or the stories of Ray Bradbury, you probably have the urge at this moment to poke my eye out with a key or to do something equally terrible. So I'd like to extend a peace offering of some kind. I don't think &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is a bad book, and I think if I had first read it as a young kid, I might have loved it. The same way that if I hadn't seen &quot;Star Wars&quot; until I was an adult, I might have only criticized its bad acting and been blind to the bottomless ocean of magic that swells hypnotically under its surface."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was looking forward to getting this book because I had seen it a while back but could never find it and when I finally received this, I was upset.

It is one of my all time favorite books. The cover is pretty neat. I didn't have as many problems with binding and poor quality paper as a lot of the 1 and 2 star reviewers apparently had. However, as I finished the wonderful story I was needless to say, quite shocked. Where was the gold that was suppose to come spilling out of the last page? I thought this novel was full of magic and I assumed the 70th Anniversary Edition would really amp it up. I mean at this point in the digital revolution why the hell are there still paper books? Where are the goddamn holograms that illustrate the action on every page? And why didn't this magical 70th addition come with a long wizard pipe? How the hell am I suppose to enjoyed Tolkien's wonderful words without smoke rings in the shape of dragons flying around my head? Way to go whatever publishing house is responsible for the myriad let downs I experienced after reading this particular edition.J.RR Tolkien's corpse is subsequently cursing those philistines for ruining his wonderful work.

While The Hobbit obviously doesn't go as far in depth into the history of Middle-Earth as Lord of the Rings does, in many ways The Hobbit's simplicity is its charm. The book is quite simply the quintessential adventure tale. I love how the book begins quickly and follows with a series of short, ordered adventures. Tolkien handles the character of Bilbo brilliantly allowing him to become more adventurous, but also making sure that he doesn't lose his Hobbit roots. Best of all, Tolkien throws in a few twists that make the Hobbit far more interesting than most fantasy stories. The trouble doesn't end with the slaying of the dragon (for those few who haven't read the book yet, I won't spoil it). For readers wanting more than an adventure story, Tolkien also weaves a compelling commentary on the power of greed and the nature of adventures. No wonder this has become a classic. I can't wait for Peter Jackson's Hobbit movies to come out."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Got this for my Xoom. I love being able to read one of my favorite childhood books again.

I have heard some people say they find it hard to read, but I've never had any trouble with it. As for this particular version of the book, it is easily my favorite. The gold inscription around the front cover is a very nice touch and it goes well with the green. It contains 8 illustrations and two maps which are all colored in black and green rather then the original black and white illustrations. There are also four color plates (colored illustrations) that are in full color. The binding is nice and sturdy and the printing is perfectly clear.

It is one of my first fantasy novels and I recommend it to any one who has ever doubted fantasy novels.If you have seen the Lord of the Rings and are curious as to why Bilbo is so important. Then you really do need to read this book to understand his back story.It has well driven characters and it really rounds out Bilbo's character, and why he is considered strange to his family, and others around him. This book is really worth the time to read and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Professor JRR Tolkien had made his mark as an authority on Anglo-Saxon language and mythology, by the time he wrote The Hobbit, in 1937, but the novel was his first great literary success, and of course what introduced many to it's majestic sequel, The Lord of the Rings.65 years later, it still enthralls millions of readers, both young and old. It is a wonderful story to captivate readers aged 10 to 110. It has inspired much creative work, including the theme of a popular computer game during the 1980's. In essence Tolkien was the father of the Sword and Sorcery genre of literature, which has provided the material for so many successful novels, movies and games.Lighter in tone than the Lord of the Rings, it nevertheless contains many references to things deeper and darker than on the surface, such as Gondolin, the last White Council, the Necromancer, and the ring.The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion provide a deeper journey into Tolkien's Middle Earth. But younger readers can also enjoy it, for it's own benefit.I first read the book, when I was twelve. It wet my appetite for all things Tolkien and led me to then read the Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion.The Hobbit is the story of the adventure of Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit of the green and pleasant country of the Shire, recruited by the wizard Gandalf and a company of Dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield, to wrest the Dwarves inheritance from the Dragon Smaug under the Lonely Mountain. The company must first battle Trolls , Goblins , Wolves , and Giant Spiders , and comes into contact with Elves , Eagles , Men and other inhabitants of Tolkien's wonderful world."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is the book that changed my mind about books. In high school we had to choose a book to report on, and a friend said The Hobbit was kind of interesting, so that's the one I chose.To say I was happy with my choice would be a gross understatement. From the first page my imagination seemed to mesh perfectly with Tolkien's world, and without the \\"speed of absorption\\" imposed by a movie, I was wonderfully soaking up all the detail that Tolkien includes in all his works. I was there.I could go on and on, but this is fantasy at its best. And, I feel, that reading it better readies you for the presently popular Lord of the Rings -- it makes the movies all the more clearer, richer, deeper.An excellent fantasy classic."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is about a hobbit (a race that are short and are generally very merry and have happy lives). Now this Hobbit's name was Bilbo and he had the average live of a hobbit (routine, organized, planning ahead, being very lazy, and eating half the time). He got a surprise knock on his door one day from his wizard friend Gandalf accompanied by thirteen dwarves. Bilbo and them eventually set out to the other side of Middle-Earth (Tolkein's world) towards the Lonely Mountains where the evil dragon Smaug lived and stole the dwarves mountain earlier. From there, Bilbo has become less lazy and brave and discovered many traits he never knew he had.This book is a prelude of the better Lord of the Ring trilogy. This is a must read for all who wants to read something new. Overall this book has an exciting storyline (kind of funny at some points) and the author has a unique writing style. It has excellent development of the main character that turns from a lazy bum to a brave soul who has wormed out of more than one tough situation"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"There are many many different illustrated editions of this classic and except for Mr. Tolkiens original renderings this is by far the best illustrated rendition of the Hobbit.Michael Hauge is a master illustrator in the grand old style and truly makes the story come alive, his work is reminiscent or Arthur Rackham at times. Of all the illustrated versions on the market today (many of them very weak indeed) I find Mr. Hague's to be exceptional. He also did a wonderful job on another classic, the Wind in the Willows. Any book illustrated by him is worth looking into (literally).Very Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In my opinion, there is only one other book that surpasses The Hobbit, and that is The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (which Tolkien originally wrote as one book). J.R.R. Tolkien was without a doubt a true literary genius. The Hobbit sets the stage for the magnificent trilogy which follows, but it is a fine work which stands on its own. Tolkien's vivid imagination transports one to a land whose inhabitants include dwarfs, elves, trolls, dragons and other familiar fairy tale creatures, but these are not the elves and dwarfs of Grimm and Hans Christian Anderson. These are REAL beings which are believable. No tiny elves that flit about here; these are the ancient ones, the healers, the wise ones of Middle Earth, the immortals. They are tall, elegant and powerful beings to respect, and indeed sometimes fear.As for the wizards...Gandalf the Grey is no mere human, but a powerful being sent from above to help the inhabitants of Middle Earth, in this case a Hobbit, an unusual creature one cannot help but love from the start. Hobbits love life; they love to eat, love companionship and a warm hearth. They are the kind of folk one is drawn to, and relates to...a homey kind of people who till the soil and tend their gardens. One can almost smell the hot bread steaming fresh from the ovens.I found the Hobbit back in the mid-sixties and have been an avid Tolkien fan ever since. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes adventure, suspense, wit and humor. It is no mere childs tale...this one is for all ages to enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Literarily speaking, chapter one of The Hobbit is the best thing ever written for children in English. What follows is a series of increasingly improbable adventures, which arose naturally out of Tolkien's storytelling practice with his own children.While by no means proof against enjoyment by girls, it must be admitted that The Hobbit is very much a boy's book, its cozily domestic subtext serving to highlight its absence of female characters, its wilderness settings and grisly violence. Its saving grace is Tolkien's enchanting sense of humor, which continues to be consistently reassuring throughout.What it requires of its readers is not however boyhood, or even childhood: what it requires is a sense of adventure. Anybody with one of those is ill-advised to neglect reading this justly renowned neo-saga, which was legendary in character to begin with, and has since become legendary in nature as well.Its most distinctive features are the maps, the verses, and the medieval authenticity. There are two maps, one of which is used in the story repeatedly. The verses are in ballad measures, including dwarf and goblin as well as hobbit songs. The early section of the Old Norse Elder Edda (Dvergatal), from which Tolkien took the names of his dwarves and wizard, remains even now displaced in an appendix at the end of Hollander's standard translation.Initially published in 1937, The Hobbit's composition was contemporary with Tolkien's pioneering published lecture on Beowulf, which revitalized the scholarship on and initiated a modern criticism of that sternest of British works. Read for publication by Tolkien's future lifelong publisher Rayner Unwin at age 10, The Hobbit sold unexpectedly well in the United States in its slightly inferior first edition (later revised to conform with The Lord of the Rings) and produced an immediate demand for a sequel, which did not however appear until those who had read The Hobbit as children were beginning to have children of their own.Various protestations to the contrary, The Hobbit remains an indispensable prerequisite to The Lord of the Rings. The Fellowship of the Rings movie might have been better, if its producers had filmed The Hobbit first.I trust that it will eventually be confirmed, if it isn't known for a fact already, that the Los Angeles meteorologist, who coined our familiar term for urban air pollution, really did mean to name it after the dragon in The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I was a little confused at first with all the names in the book, but after the second chapter I had everything undercontrol. I loved the great detail Tolkien put into his writing, it literally made me feel like I was walking along side Bilbo throughout his troubles. Whenever he ran into tough situation, I would stop and think of what I would have done in his place. Tolkien does a very good job of setting the right atmosphere for each scene to make the story even more intense. I was really impressed with how well each new character was described, it really helped me picture what they looked like and how they expressed themselves, no matter how unhuman they were. This is the best book I have read in several years, but from what I've heard best books are just ahead. I am hoping to jump right into the Lord of the Rings trilogy, hopefully they are just as good. I would definatelly recommement this book to anyone interested in going on a good adventure through caves, woods, mountains and giant spiders nests."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The HobbitThis novel, The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo has never been or had an adventure, until he gets a visit from some dwarves and a wizard named Gandalf. They convince him to come help them win their gold and treasure back from the dragon Smaug. On the way they meet goblins, trolls, wargs, giants, giant spiders, and of course Smaug the dragon. Bilbo shows the dwarves his worth and they grow to respect him.Bilbo Baggins is friendly and likeable, but also scared and confused. Most of the dwarves are strict and ready for anything, but some, like Bilbo, seem scared. The book starts off slow telling about hobbits, but after the first chapter it becomes a little interesting. The ending was very good, since the author goes on a little to tell what happened to Bilbo when he got back home.In the beginning the author gives too many details on hobbits. Some of the vocabulary is old fashioned. In some points of the book, like in between the adventures, the story gets a little slow and boring, but during the adventures it is very interesting. I think the book would be more liked by children ages 10-15. Overall the book is good. I give the book 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Welcome your kids to the land of magic and make-believe. The Hobbit is classic many would have been familiar with. In country like the Philippines, the book opens the eyes of young people to a whole new world, an entirely different culture. It's a far, far different world from the local tales of legend and magic.This particular edition is handsomely illustrated by the same artist that designed the illustrated centennial edition of LOTR and the movie. It's slightly bigger than the wider than the LOTR centennial. I just wished the publishers did not use matte coated paper for all the pages. The pages stick to each other after some time in a hot and humid environment like the Philippines. I wish only the full-pages of color illustrations were printed on coated paper.As for anyone living in the third world, this is a mighty big investment. But if you have a choice between this or the illustrated centennial edition of LOTR, pick LOTR. But if you can afford both, get them both. Nice books to display and tickle kids imaginations with."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This was a great book and all the books are amazing.

This edition is well made and is a handsome addition to my collection of classic books"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a lovely, charming little book. It is quick paced and very entertaining, a pleasurable respite from the often bogged down with hidden meanings of what too frequently passes for literature. I'm not trying to denegrate some high-class piece of thought-provoking insight, some Don DeLillo, some Thomas Pynchon, some William Gaddis, et. al. But how often have you picked up a book and become absorbed with a story, with what's going to actually happen next without the instrusion of some pretentious, philosophical meandering? It is a break for the serious-minded high art fan, a great read to the lowly John Grisham afficinado. All in all, a wonderful passage of time, transported to a magical place almost too real for the span of time you are being a voyuer, watching and waiting some never was characters fight never was creatures in a fundamentally never was land in this imaginative terrain that you have to believe in for such a short period of time. Going on to the massive sequal, The Lord of the Rings, you are even further left in awe of the thought and sheer imaginative brilliance Mr. Tolkien put into his life's work to create, with such immaculate detail, a new mythology for all the world to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"For those of you reading comments on this book I can assure that it is one of the greatest fiction works of all time and that anybody who says anything different is truly a moronic idiot and merely a waste of precious DNA."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I'd like to get this straight right off the bat.....this 'Annotated' version of the Hobbit is for readers who are already hooked on Tolkein. First time readers would be better served to get one of the non-annotated ones and familiarze themselves with Tolkeins world. Oh! And read 'The Lord of the Rings' as well before you attempt reading 'The annotated Hobbit'.I have read a lot of annotated books over the years and I have to say that this one is one of the most seamlessly done. Understandably, as you try to read the comments you lose some of the continuity of the text, but they are usually so informative that you gain more than you lose by reading them. Some of the notes are written for the more scholarly inclined, some are just plain amusing.A great bonus is the collection of illustrations from all over the world....giving an insight as to how different cultures see the same objects. That was the beauty of the old books...you had to imagine the scenes. That beauty is forever sullied now as everyone is going to see Tolkein's characters as they appear in the (very bad) movie adaptations of the 'Lord of the Rings'.All in all, if you already have a version of the 'Hobbit', buy this book. It is one of those books that will reward repeated readings."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Bilbo Baggins, one of the small, fat persons called hobbits, is just minding his buisness one day when 14 dwarves arrive for breakfast! Little did Bilbo know what was in store for him. Soon Bilbo was away on a weird adventure, the story in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.I liked this book because it had great characters which were described with great detail. You can see the great detail in this excerpt: &quot; They are (or were) a little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves... They are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they dress in bright colors (chiefly green and yellow)&quot;. I liked the fact that the author described his characters with great detail. It makes the story able to come alive in your head, which helps me to understand it and be &quot;drawn in&quot; to the book.I also liked that there was an incredible amount of adventure. You can see adventure in this excerpt: &quot; It is almost dark so that its vastness can be only dimly guessed, but rising from the near side of the rocky floor there is a great glow. The glow of Smaug!&quot;. The adventure also makes you become &quot;drawn into&quot; the book. It makes this book a real page-turner. It also explains the characters a little bit more by how they react to situations that have high-pressure.Although this book has excellent description, I was sometimes frustrated by the lack of suspense, especially in the beginning. You can see a little bit of dullness in this excerpt: &quot;By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was less noise and more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous,&quot;. The beginning makes you want to throw the book down and never pick it up again. I almost did that myself. But I suggest trying to read on. It gets very much better."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I always think of The Hobbit as the forgotton classic, as it very much lives in the shadow of Lord of the Rings. Yet The Hobbit deserves almost as much praise as that most incredible of adventures. Not only that but it is vital that The Hobbit is read prior to tackling Lord of the Rings, as it is really the first book of four not the pre-cursor to the trilogy.Having said that though, it is also improtant to note that The Hobbit does have a very different feel to it when compared to Lord of the Rings. This tale is far more light-hearted and filled more with boyhood dreams of adventure. Lord of the Rings on the other hand is a story of war that centres around the ring of power owned now by the Baggins'.The Hobbit is a must read for any Fantasy fan."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I do wish I could review the book separately from the edition.

I can follow along with Book Club friends. The drawings are very nice and large and within the story, not at the end of the book.Also I find it easy to \\"go to\\" a specific page or chapter.

If you've already fallen in love with the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien and are looking for a beautifully illustrated edition of the Hobbit, then look no further. The Alan Lee illustrated edition of The Hobbit is nothing less than wonderful. Upon removing the dust cover you will find green cloth binding with a beautiful gold dragon engraved in the lower right corner, non other than Smaug himself. The pages are crisp and bright white. The illustrations, some in color and others black and white, are scattered generously throughout and intermingle beautifully with the story. The detail in these illustrations definately added to my enjoyment of this timeless classic. It is my understanding that Mr. Lee was in charge of designing and constructing the set for the motion picture Lord of the Rings and I can see why. He has captured Tolkien's world better than I would have thought possible. Tolkien created his Middle Earth at a time when other feet were planted firmly in this world, and in so doing opened us to a whole new experience. What a wonderful joining of talents. Who could ask for more?"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"If you are going to shell out heavy coin for a hardcover edition of this wonderful book I recommend you go with the version illustrated by Alan Lee. It is a beautiful book with wonderful illustrations and very readable print (no 7 pt grainy characters smeared across porous paper will be found here).As to content, little can be said that has not already been said. Be aware that much of the charm of The Hobbit is derived from the cheerful homeliness of hobbits. They sing songs, smoke pipes and tell stories. They are hardly candidates for action-adventure heroes, but when duty calls they rally to the challenge.So if your reading palate leans toward episodic Harry Potter tales where each chapter calls the characters to brave the gaping maw of death, or Steven King-esque cliff-hanger chapter endings that propel the reader into the next daring adventure, then this book will put a little needed variety into your diet. It contains action and adventure, but these things are tempered by a comfortable quietude.So give it a shot and I think you will find the slower parts of the book are as, if not more, enjoyable than those more adventurous portions."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This is a tale of gold, dragon, Elves and the wonder of it all. After reading the book for the third time, I must say it is still enjoyable. The book serves as a stand-alone novel or as a prelude to, &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; (LOTR)Tolkien crafts an interesting world peopled with Dwarves, Hobbits, Men, Elves and others. The Hobbits are a race of comfort-loving people about 2-4 feet in height. If there is one thing they like it is peace, quiet and good food. Adventure and travel to far-off places is something they would really rather avoid if they can.Bilbo Baggins is one such Hobbit and he had lived 50 years in good comfort and does not wish to change that. Then, Gandalf (a wizard) arrives and invites him on an adventure with a company of Dwarves. Bilbo is initially fearful and dismissive of the whole affair and then gradually become a leader of sorts of the company.The style is easy to follow and the story is straightforward with some twists. Of the two books, I must state my preference for LOTR. The complexity of the world in which the novels are placed (Middle-Earth) that is merely hinted at in, \\"The Hobbit,\\" is much more developed in LOTR.The book is good in the old-fashioned sense of good story telling; there are no political agendas here but rather simply courage and the virtues of old. It is refreshing to read a book of battle, heroism, good and evil in our times of moral confusion and weakness. \\"The Hobbit,\\" is good for children and adults; adults will probably appreciate LOTR more though."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is J.R.R. Toliken's book about a young hobbit whose name is Bilbo, goes on an exciting adventure that raises his love for exploration and adventure. Bilbo is someone who hates adventure and trips. He never has liked any excitement in his life other than peace and tranquility. He is also a perfectionist and never likes a mess. But deep down inside of him, he has an uncovered facet that is awakened when he goes on an exciting adventure that will completely change his life.Bilbo unexpectedly ecounters twelve dwarves that are embarking on a journey to reclaim their lost treasure from the evil dragon Smog, who lives in the Desolation of Smog on the other side of the land. On his journey Bilbo encounters dangerous goblins, elves, giants, and demons. He also encouners friendly bears and eagles that help him and his dwarf friends along the way. Use your imagination to solve riddles and find out what will happen next in the suspenseful story like Bilbo and his friends did. To find out more about this book, I suggest you read it.There are many mysterious characters in this wonderful story. Such characters are Gollum who is a scary fish monster who lives in a secluded cave in the mountain of the evil goblins. Gollum is always hungry and wants to eat Bilbo at first sight. But to save his skin, Bilbo pleads for his life and must answer five challenging riddles. With much luck and brain power, Bilbo solves them and makes a great escape from Gollum and from the dangerous goblins.I also would like to recommend this book to anyone who likes to read. It is full of suspense and adventure. It is fun and interesting and full magic.

Unlike the Lord of the Rings trilogy (which are darker and more complicated), The Hobbit is suitable for most children of elementary school age (I'd say third grade and up, generally). While there is danger and adventure (and some very unsavory characters), there is not much violence or bloodshed. We have enjoyed the beautifully illustrated (by Michael Hague),large, softcover edition, published by Houghton Mifflin. If you can find this edition, buy it --- with the caveat that a couple of the illustrations are a bit scary, at least to younger siblings!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"How could I possibly fit every glorious thing there is about this series of books into 1000 words? Tolkien is a genius and there is no way to deny that. He has managed to create an entirely different world, every tree, every creature, every nuance of language, every folktale; everything is on these pages that might possibly exist in middle earth. That I believe is Tolkien's true genius, his ability to construct this world in his head and to let us visit it, completely and fully for four glorious books. However, maybe that is not the extent of his genius. Maybe not because Tolkien also tells a ripping good tale throughout these novels. The prelude with Bilbo being swept up by a band of dwarves and being sent against his will to battle a dragon takes about a night to read, despite the fact that it covers over 300 pages. And then you start the true trilogy, and the ring that Bilbo finds which seemed like a neat little trick in The Hobbit (it grants the wearer the benefit of invisibility) this ring is suddenly so much more than a very handy parlor trick. It is THE ring; crafted ages ago in elven halls with unspeakable power and unfightable draw. Men kill for it, dwarves kill for it, everyone would kill for it and suddenly you are swept off on another adventure with another unsuspecting hobbit that covers all of middle earth and includes the fate of the world...all over this little unassuming ring that must be destroyed. The journey you take in these books will not easily be forgotten, here I am getting chills thinking about the epic battles between good and evil that spring up like weeds around the path of this little ring and Frodo, the hobbit who is charged with destroying it.

But then they remember the dragon.This book takes place in a place called the Shire, and Middle Earth. It was long ago, and it might be true, might not.The main character, Bilbo, makes me feel very good, and I want this story to go on forever.This was one of the best books I have read so far, and I ask you to read it.

It takes place during the medieval times. The main character, Bilbo, is a halfling called a Hobbit that is smart, fast, he hasn't been on an adventure, andd he loves his Hobbithole in Hobbiton. The major conflict in the story is a dragon called Smaug steales a lot of treasure so Bilbo, 13 dwarfs, and a wizard go along to get the treasure back and slay the dragon. The author makes the characters really strange. This book is like The Fellowship Of The Rings and The Two Towers. I recommend this book to everyone 8 and up.A person that likes action or adventure storys would love The Hobbit. I really like how Tolken decribes the characters and setting very gook, and it is also exciting.

Tolkien is the fantasy epic that started the fantasy genre altogether. Tolkien is a master of the English language and his wonderful writing and beautiful world make one of the best novels of fantasy literature.For those who are not familiar with this tale, it is the story of Bilbo Baggins and a band of dwarves that set out on an adventure to the Lonely Mountain to reclaim the treasure of an old Dwarve civilization. Along the way we run into goblins, elves, giant spiders and much more intrigue.I recommend this novel to any lover of fantasy or books in general. This is the book that put me onto the fantasy genre. Tolkien makes Middle Earth seem like it's a real place with the depth that he goes into with each race of species living there. After this wonderful novel I recommend the granddaddy of all fantasy, The Lord of the Rings. Be sure to pick up this great novel.HAPPY READING!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"When I first read The Hobbit I was 13 and although I did not fully understand everything and the language was not easy I loved it and finished it in a day. I could not put it down. Now I am older (I\`m 20) and I see and read books deferently. I judge them and try to be more critical about them, but THE HOBBIT is still one of my favourite books. I admire the author because of his imagination that has no limits. The language is rich and colourfull and the characters very interesting. It is something everybody who want to escape the everyday life and spend at least a couple of hours in a magical world, should read.We get to know Bilbo - a hobbit that starts on an adventure. he travels trough the Middle Earth with a group or dwarfs. He joins them as a thief (he cam move very quietly) on a quest to the home of the dragon Smaug, who guards an old treasure that origilally belonged to dwarfs. On his way he also meets a strange creature called Gollum and from him he gets a very special and magical object (I will not tell you what it is in case you haven\`t heard it, read it, or seen the movie yet :), but you can imagine what it is right?)It is also the begininng of something much larger, it is the starting point for the Lotd of the Rings.Tolkien\`s source was the celtic and nordic mythology, but he created creatures of hisown also - the Hobbits and also the Vargs. He created a new elven lenguage.It is less complicated than Lord of the Rings and notably written for a slightly younger public, but it is one of the masterpieces of fantasy and it always will be."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"&quot;First published in the United States more than sixty years ago, J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Hobbit' has become one of the best-loved books of all time. Tolkien's fantasy was then adapted into a fully painted graphic novel, which became a classic in its own right...&quot;These words are found on the back of the graphic novel's cover, and I'm glad that's all they say about the possible quality of the book. Thankfully, the graphic novel isn't praised to be as equally good as the actual book, because while it is indeed good, it doesn't compare to Tolkien's early literary masterpiece.I'm not familiar with American graphic novels (Japanese manga is more my trade), so I can't fairly compare this graphic novel to other graphic novels. However, I can say that this book does make use of the term &quot;graphic novel&quot;: it runs somewhat like a comic book, using pictures, and is occasionally filled with excerpts of storytelling from the original book. So it's not really a comic book, and it's definately not a novel, so it most likely really is a graphic novel, but I really can't say for sure.The artwork of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; graphic novel is like everything else that's been used with the Middle-Earth licence: some will like it, some will hate it. The color scheme reminds me of an oil painting and the character designs appear somewhat &quot;old-school,&quot; although some people won't have any trouble with that style. To my knowledge, all of the story of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is in the graphic novel, but expect some scenes to be condensed. The pacing can be a little off, and sometimes things just happen out of the blue. Still, the execution of the entire graphic novel is very well done and, and it does manage to capture quite a bit of the believability of Tolkien's world of Middle-Earth.This is where the biggest problem arises. The graphic novel is good, but it is no substitute for the actual book. To read this graphic novel as a substitute for the book is like reading Cliff Notes in place of an enjoyable literary classic. It's interesting to read after reading the book, but that's it. Reading the graphic novel before the book and expecting to get the exact same experiece takes away a lot of the magic Tolkien created.All in all, this graphic novel is good, but it's nothing compared to the real deal. I recommend only reading this after reading the original book; to do otherwise would be denying to yourself the beauty and magic of Tolkien's early masterwork. It's a classic graphic novel, but nothing more."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"There isn't much to say about a book that has a great story, magical yet believable characters, and a magical world full many a creature.

I like the interaction with the goblins and wargs. Tolkien's mythology is rich and detailed. I think this could have been longer as some parts feel glossed over such as the episode in the forest with the elves.Some find the ending unsatisfying but it was important for Tolkien to tie up the story of the dwarves; the squabbling over the treasure with the elves and men after the death of Smaug was realistic.I can't really see how this will justify three movies (2 is pushing it) but I am sure it will be fantastic.

In 2012 I wrote a new review, and am editing my original text to include this new review. Mike London 10-3-2012]New Review 2012: \\"In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit.\\" Thus begins the most famous series in fantasy literature. For such a universe of high caliber, the sentence is a rather unassuming beginning for quite an unassuming, down-to-earth race known as Hobbits.Unfortunately \\"The Hobbit\\" has become overshadowed by \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", seen as an \\"enchanting prelude\\" to the more substantial sequel. C. S. Lewis said in \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\" that to accurately judge an item, you first must know its purpose. The books were written for different purposes - \\"The Hobbit\\" as an entertaining story for his children, and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", initially a seqeul to \\"The Hobbit\\", became much more a continuation of \\"The Silmarillion\\". For those who underestimate \\"The Hobbit\\" using the criteria of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" as their guide are missing out on a rich work.What are Hobbits, you may ask? If you go researching where Tolkien got inspiration for the Hobbits, you will soon get mixed up in \\"The Denham Tracks\\" (a 19th century list of various folk-lore creatures) and E. A. Wyke-Smith's \\"The Marvelous Land of the Snergs\\". Honestly, neither of these will get you very far.The Denham Tracks reads like a laundry list of folk-lore creatures, and though the actual word \\"hobbit\\" appears, there is no context for what a \\"hobbit\\" actually is. \\"The Marvelous Land of the Snergs\\" will get you a tad bit further. Snergs are creatures about half the height of man (like the Hobbits), enjoy their food (again, like the Hobbits), and there the resemblance ends. The World of the Snergs is far removed from Middle-earth, having more to do with 19th century adventure stories set in fantasy with such dispargant elements as a vegetation Troll (by far the best character in the book), witches, knights similiar to stories of King Arthur, ad a waylaid sea crew hailing from the ship [on the ship] \\"The Flying Dutchman\\"Tolkien certainly anticipated the question, for he answered this inquiry within the opening pages of this very book. They are a race two to four feet high, shy of \\"Big People\\", and have no beards, unlike dwarves. Hobbits are chubby, \\"dress in bright colours, (chiefly green and yellow)\\", and wear no shoes because of the hick tufts of hair and thick leathery soles of their feet. They eat as often as they can.The story of \\"The Hobbit\\" is well known, having been published in 1937 and continually in print (save only for a brief interruption in the early 1940s, when Great Britian were facing paper shortages due to World War II).\\"The Hobbit\\" began life as an entertaining story of Tolkien's children (as so many of Tolkien's stories began as well). Written between 1929-1933, the book details the adventures of Bilbo Baggins. Gandalf the Wizard meets with Bilbo in the opening pages, telling him he is looking for some \\"to go on an adventure\\". Bilbo, not quite as respectible as he would like to believe himself to be, tells Gandalf life was much more interesting when Gandalf was around, but no, he would not have any adventures, thank you very much. Naturally, thirteen dwarves show up, and ultimately Bilbo sets off to reclaim the gold that the Dragon Smaug has stolen from the dwarves. Like the later Aragorn, Thorin Oakenshield, the chief dwarf, is a king-in-exile, and wants to reclaim both his throne and his gold stolen by the dragon..The real meat of \\"The Hobbit\\", and one of the reasons why I believe the book has had such a long lasting appeal, is the book's transformation of Bilbo.\\"The Hobbit\\" shows the reader how an unassuming modern character ([for [all his]] though Bilbo lives in the far removed past, he is THOROUGHLY MODERN) goes from being an out-of-place bumbler in situations far removed from his life expereince to an equal among beings and races that belong only in the distant past [When - give examples of this]Although initially inept, Bilbo, just as Gandalf predicted, proves to be a worthwhile companion, coming through for the dwarves on several key occasions, such as freeing them from the Elven prisons, fighting back the spiders, and facing the dragon alone. He even eventually aids in bringing about a resolution to the growing distress between the Dwarves, Men, and Elves after the fallout of Smaug's demise (albeit, rather unconventionally, using the Arkenstone, the Heart of the Mountain and the jewel which Thorin prizes above all others). [the whole affair of ] This journey, this transformation of Bilbo into something more, something greater, is the true heart of the book. Tolkien himself said that he removed Gandalf from the story shortly after Beorn's house, due to the dramatic need for Bilbo to proove himself without assistance from the wizard. Fortunately, Tolkien was able to use Gandalf's absence as a springboard into more expansive story ideas when he began developing \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" after the unbridled success of \\"The Hobbit\\".Also, the book displays a moral complexity often not seen within the confines of children's liteature. By this, I am referring to the whole matter of Bilbo's handling of the Arkenstone, the chief jewel of the hoard that Bilbo and the dwarves are setting out to recover. The claims of the Elves and Men, and counter claims of the dwarves, and Bilbo's claiming of the Arkenstone and how he wants to use the Arkenstone to move the uprising [ever renewing] battle toward resolution are complex and startling legal in tone.For all its story-book qualities, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a much different work from its subsequent [work] heir, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Although early manuscripts explicility prove Tolkien was casting the \\"The Hobbit\\" in the universe of his mythology from initial composition, \\"The Hobbit\\" features several elements and passages that are altogether incongruous with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", especially in the First Edition published in 1937.For one, the ring found in Gollum's cave is not the One Ring, the Ruling Ring of Sauron. The magic ring was simply that - a magic ring, a stage prop that, in the words of Tom Shippey helped equalize Bilbo in the archaic world he found himself in. Tolkien only began developing the concept of the Ruling Ring AFTER publication of \\"The Hobbit\\" when he was trying to come up with ideas for a sequel. When reading \\"The Hobbit\\", readers, especially those who know the sequel, may approach the Ring as though this was truly a dark and sinister ring, which the text does not simply support. Indeed, Bilbo's deception about the ring, so important in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", is not explicit in \\"The Hobbit\\".Next, and probably most fascinating of all, is the nature of Gollum himself. We all know he's a hobbit, long ago corrupted by his long possession of the One Ring. However, prior to 1951 when Allen and Unwin (Tolkien's publishers) published the revised version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\" that Tolkien had written in 1947, not only was Gollum explicitly NOT a hobbit, we were not even sure what kind of creature he was (or what his physical size was). He was more akin to Tom Bombadil and Beorn, a one item category unique unto himself. There were no textual indications of Gollum's size in comparison to Bilbo, leading some illustrators in foreign editions to show Gollum as a much larger creature than he would later become.Then there's the matter of the original version of \\"Riddles in the Dark\\". Initially Gollum was going to give away his magic ring as a gift if Bilbo won the contest as well as show him the way out; after winning, Gollum is unable to find the ring (naturally, as Bilbo had already found the ring), so he showed Bilbo the way out, constantly apologizing. In \\"The Return of the Shadow\\", Book Six of \\"The History of Middle-earth\\", we find Tolkien trying to work within the parameters of this original chapter. Naturally, Tolkien ultimately abandoned the original conception and rewrote the chapter in 1947 as a specimen of what a new chapter could look like and sent this to his publisher. Tolkien was quite surprised to see that, four years later, Allen & Unwin published the rewritten version, and Tolkien accepted the text as authoritative.While that's the most interesting of the differences, there are still several passages at odds with Middle-earth as described in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". There is no Shire. There are references to policemen and an unnamed \\"king\\". The trolls fit more into fairy-book stories than Middle-earth, and, as Douglas Anderson points out in \\"The Annotated Hobbit\\", Tolkien references other trolls with multiple heads, a thing not found in Middle-earth. Then there are the stone giants, which only appear once and then are never heard of again in any other story, before or after. There is speculation that one of Bilbo's ancestors took a FAIRY wife, a conception wholly alien to Middle-earth. There are no fairies in Middle-earth. Then there's the matter of the ruins of the mysterious city upon which Lake-town is built upon. This ruined city is mentioned only in \\"The Hobbit\\"; it goes unnamed, unreferenced, and undocumented in any of Tolkien's other writings regarding his legendarium.Probably the single biggest difference between \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is there is no developed nomenclature in \\"The Hobbit\\". The majority of the names are simple descriptions of the things involved: Bilbo lives in The Hill, is traveling to the River Running, visits a city named Dale, as neighbors across the Water, etc. There are very few proper names in \\"The Hobbit\\". The thirteen dwarves names and Gandalf (with the exception of \\"Balin\\") are all simply lifted from \\"The Devergatal\\", a section of the Elder Edda In \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" however, nomenclature is king, and Tolkien spent vast amounts of time creating vast landscape, cultures, and races all with their own unique linguistic flavour.There are also some geographic inconsistences between the two works. From the bridge to where Bilbo and the dwarves meet the trolls is within sight; however, in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", this same spot takes Aragorn and company SIX DAYS to go from the river to the spot where the trolls are.Tolkien was aware of these differences, and in 1960 wrote several different passages and revisions to bring \\"The Hobbit\\" stylistically more in line with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". These passages were published for the first time in 2007 with \\"The History of The Hobbit\\". However, he showed the revised passages to someone (it is unknown who) who discouraged him from changing \\"The Hobbit\\".Ultimately, \\"The Hobbit\\" is a much different experience than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", much more akin to classical fantasy fairy tale books such as \\"The Wind in the Willows\\" and \\"The Marvellous Land of the Snergs\\" in both style and tone than \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Too its credit, the success of \\"The Hobbit\\" was what prompted Tolkien to write the sequel.In the seventeen years between initial publication and the appearance of the first volume of its sequel (1937-1954), \\"The Hobbit\\" never went out of print (save only for a brief period during World War II due to paper shortages) and was a tremendous seller, without support from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". It is indeed a rich work, and is an undisputed classic. This book is so much more than a \\"prelude\\" to bigger and better things. It's a keystone work in children's fantasy, and stands among the titans of literature.....-----Original Review: \\"Inferiour to L.R.? I think not! No, just different!\\"The biggest problem with this novel is perception. Tolkien wrote this story for children; to be more specific, this was written for HIS children. There were several stories like this, but it was this, The Hobbit, that was his master achievement in children's literature.The Lord of the Rings ( a single epic, NOT a trilogy) was written to cash in on The Hobbit's success. Tolkien wanted to get on with the more serious work of his mythology, and ultimately that is what happened with The Lord of the Rings. It became attached to his mythology, and became as important to him as The Silmarillion.So delineation is required if you want to read this. Do not go in with the thought that The Hobbit is a \\"precursor\\" or any such nonsense to The Lord of the Rings. Think of it like you would think of any other children's classics: children's classics. If you take it on The L. R.'s terms, this is a failure, primary because it is not written to be like that. But, on the flipside, The L. R. is as much a failure in children's fiction. It is not children's fiction, it is epic fantasy, and one should not equate it with children's fiction. That is EXACTLY what people try to do with The Hobbit. They try to put it in the same type of genre or playing field as The L. R. They are both masterpieces, and I love them both dearly. But one is for children, the other with adults.Of course, Tolkien is part of the problem. How many books do you know that is a children's book and has an adult sequel? Not very many. The Hobbit, scarcely 300 pages, was written and published in the children's market. He then talked to his publishers, and they wanted a sequel. So he began \\"the new Hobbit\\", as C. S. (Jack) Lewis so aptly put it. He was preoccupied with his mythology, and the sequel was drawn into it. So we have two works, spanning two different genres, and as far as surface connections go its little more than prequel/sequel. Instead of looking at The Hobbit as a prequel, a precursor to his ADULT masterpiece, an inferiour version, think of as his CHILDREN'S masterpiece. The Hobbit is top of the class in children's fiction, one of the few contenders against such other great children's works as Narnia and Wrinkle in Time. The Lord of the Rings, likewise, is THE crowning masterpiece of the fantasy genre, of which its influence is incalculable to that fantasy market. Both are as important as the other, just in different fields.I haven't talked about The Silmarillion much. I have already reviewed it, so I won't go real in-depth here. But the same thing happened with it. People, expecting another Lord of the Rings, were inevitably disappointed with the Biblical style of the published version. If Tolkien wrote that book out in narrative form as he did Lord of the Rings, it would be ten times longer than Lord of the Rings. The biggest problem with Tolkien is people have to many preconceptions that are incorrect.So, basically, in conclusion, think of it like this:1. The Hobbit - Children's masterpiece. He scores big with this one.2. The Lord of the Rings - a single fantasy, not a trilogy. (Tolkien was always quick to point that out). The Crowning achievement of modern fantasy.3. The Silmarillion - the Bible of Middle-earth. Much more for students of his work than the causal reader.[From the Amazon.co.uk review: Enjoy Tolkien's Middle-earth! I certainly have!Mike London]"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"In evaluating \\"The Hobbit\\", one naturally can compare it to the later \\"Lord of the Rings\\" works by Tolkien. While it may not live up to that epic trilogy, \\"Hobbit\\" is rather remarkable in its own way: Tolkien's ability to turn what essentially was a children's bedtime story into an engrossing novel filled with adventure.For a basic plot summary, \\"The Hobbit\\" sees Bilbo Baggins, of Hobbiton, set off on a grand adventure in the company of Gandalf the Wizard and twelve dwarves bent on reclaiming their rightful treasure from a greedy dragon named Smaug. Along the way, the company meets up with some eclectic creatures ranging from trolls and giant spiders to great flying Eagles and even a pathetic little creature called Gollum who is hiding a \\"precious\\" whose significance cannot yet even be fathomed.Whereas \\"LOTR\\" reads like an epic, \\"Hobbit\\" reads as if Tolkien is telling you a story (with both the language and tone of the book reflecting this). It is full of strange creatures and sometimes rather terrifying events, but at the same time it is rather light-hearted, with the merry gang progressing rapid-fire from one adventure to another. There is none of the doom-and-gloom or Middle Earth politics that is often the focus of LOTR.Easily the \\"crown jewel\\" of this novel, though, is the portion involving Gollum and his \\"precious\\". Whether read before or after LOTR, these scenes will stick in your mind long after anything else in this book. Much more reminiscent of the darkness of LOTR.Thus, \\"The Hobbit\\" is basically the \\"first steps\\" of the greatest fantasy story ever created. I can't rate it as better than any of the LOTR books, but if you like a lighter tone and less \\"weight\\" in a book, then this one might just appeal to you even more."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"As I said, it's a great classic.

As they pursue their quest, we come across many other inhabitants of Middle Earth. Some of them are friendly and others are inherently evil and blood thirsty. Hobbits, dwarves, man, elves, trolls, wolves, eagles and the infamous Gollum are properly described to advance the plot but not extensively enough for you to loose interest. I couldn't derive a definitive moral message from the novel but it was immensely entertaining nonetheless. Two points worth mentioning about \\"The Hobbit\\". First, the language Tolkien used is so elegant and eloquent. I couldn't help but compare it to other temporary writings which seemed a bit vulgar! Secondly, there are many songs (lyrics) throughout the book and some riddles too. Personally, I found them entertaining and conveyed the spirit of the situation whether it was warring or a peaceful one. This book surely has popped up \\"The Lord of The Rings\\" on my books-to-read list. Now, I can't wait to watch the movie and make a comparison.

As for giving this as a gift I would recommend it to those that are probably over age 10, and with caution at that, as a younger sibling might take revenge on the older by destroying the book, which is rather nice. Preferably it would delight the heart of an older Tolkien fan, a teenager or older, One who would appreciate what it is. As far as for what occasion it could be given, telling you would be rather pompous of me. I myself have chosen it as an anniversary present."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"What can I say that you don't already know about this book. It lives up to its reputation as classic, high fantasy complete with all the trolls, goblins, elves, dwarves, dragons, and of course hobbits that could possibly fit into one volume. Good for just about any age, I read it for the first time when I was 9 or 10, and have enjoyed it throughout the years and still enjoyed it on this last read through. Some things seem new every time I read through it. If you like fantasy or magic, this is a must read."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I liked the book its great it had a lot of adventure in it it was really entertaining this is a great book"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"\\"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.\\" Who wrote this line? J.R.R. Tolkien did. This book is a fantasy adventure about a band of dwarves, one wizard called Gandalf, and a hobbit called Bilbo Bagins. Together they embark on a journey to retrieve a lost treasure form a terrible dragon. On their journey they face Trolls, Goblins, and Wood Elves.This is one of my personal favorites. This is a fantasy adventure like no other. I would recommend this book to lovers of fantasy adventures. This book is a prelude to Lord of the Rings trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit is a tale straight from the imagination of the #1 adventure story-teller of the 20th century, J.R.R. Tolkien. A young Hafling, name Biblo is drafted against his will into an adventure that forces him to face down trolls, goblins, and a horrible dragon. The Hobbit is a tale of magic and adventure that any Tolkien fan will enjoy reading, for the simple reason that it is a good example of his wild imagination.Readers above the age of 12, however, will find the book somewhat childish, as was Tolkien's intent. The story he wrote for his children, as is apparent in the ease of reading, and toned-down violence. If you do not plan to read The Lord of the Rings, I suggest you ignore this book. If you do, however, plan to read the best adventure story of all time, read the Hobbit only because it leads up the story about Bilbo's nephew, Frodo Baggins, and his adventure in The Lord of the Rings. You can finish it relatively quickly, and better enjoy the sequel trilogy. I read at only 350 words/minute, and I was able to finish this book in two nights (a total of maybe 6 hours).If, however, you would rather read a story to a young child, this book would serve as great entertainment. I further suggest that you be sure to purchase an illustrated version, as if your reason for purchase is thus, a child would enjoy to see Tolkien's monsters monsters come to life."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book is about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins that has a lot of courage and spunk. i wish i had that much courage. i think this book is for advanced readers that are very sufisticated."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The main character, Bilbo, starts out hating adventure, but in the end he has a slightly different opinion. This is a wonderful fantasy filled with adventure and suspense. With zany characters that make you want to continue reading. Many people have read this book and there is a reason why."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"While it is not absolutely critical to read the Hobbit in order to enjoy the greatest work of fantasy ever written, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Hobbit does provide valuable background information on the later quest. The character development is top notch and the book is a very quick read. Tolkien's ingenuity in creating a time and place is surpassed by none. The one odd thing I noticed is that it appears that the Lord of the Rings was written for a more mature audience than the Hobbit. All that being said, I find myself re-reading the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings every two to three years with the same amount of enjoyment and a growing appreciation each time."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I am not a fantasy/sci-fi reader, and I did not overly enjoy Tolkien's extreme run-on sentences. I admit that I had to read more carefully. But aside from those issues...I Love This Book! Tolkien talks directly to the reader, interrupting himself every now and then to define a term, give a background fact, and sometimes to show the reader just how anxious he is to tell us the ending before we get there! Pictures are easily created. Puns are very intented. Characters are realistic in their personalities and traits. Any reader who gives the book a chapter's chance will become involved in Bilbo's adventure of a lifetime."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I recently re-read The Hobbit, a story I first read in High School. My children are of an age to read it, so this time I read it with a critical eye, rather than for the sheer joy of immersing myself in a story of adventure and fantasy.It is unfortunate that the Hobbit has apparently become required reading in some schools. Forcing young adults the read a fairy tale in these literal and cynical times may only dampen their enthusiasm for literature. This book was written to be read for enjoyment, not a grade.So read it and enjoy a tale that will take you far from the fast paced industrial world we live in, into the land of imagination and adventure. Read it aloud to your children, and you will find them very attentive.Now, on to the review.A significant obstacle to enjoying this story is Tolkein's British English, which carries a startling variety of idomatic phrases and terms not currently in use here in America. I have had to translate a lot of words and terms for my children when they have had trouble with understanding.The style is light hearted and conversational. You feel as though the story teller is speaking to you in a friendly voice. The frequent asides and blatant foreshadowing add a personal touch to the story that enhances, rather than detracts, from its accessability.The themes are fairly easy to discern, and particularly good for young audiences. Far from beng a whimsical fairy tale, there are simple messages here, even for the un-alerted reader. Such as:Heroes arise from unlikely sources. (This is certainly true in real life.)The sedentary life has little flavor-- get out and have an adventure.Self interest and greed are dangerous motivators.Trying your best can produce results for unexpected reasons.Ones actions can have unintended consequences for others. The devastation of Lake Town is a poignant illustration of this concept, often overlooked in today's self oriented culture. At a time where the lawsuit and strict liability grossly punish unintended outcomes, the conscience driven resolution in the Hobbit is a refreshing concept.Is this the best story ever written? Hardly. Is it an engaging and enjoyable adventure story? Absolutely!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I thoroughly appreciate the illustrations of how the Hobbit has been illustrated in other countries that are included in this edition. The introduction is first rate, though mysteriously it uses end notes while the rest of the book uses annotation in the margin. The notes that delve into the possible sources and influences on Tolkien's thought and work are mostly interesting and informative. The main negative I find is how many marginal notes are devoted to textual variants between the various editions. For example, in the section where the company meets the trolls, a note explains one version has \\"they dropped him\\" while another version has \\"he dropped him.\\" Although the textual variant notes are usually more extensive than this, they are an uninteresting disappointment to me. The level of detail is high, but at times, almost to the point of being pedantic. Still, if you love the work of Tolkien, you will find this version enjoyable as well."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"12 year old girl hereI personally hated this book. It's written in such hard language to understand. I would not recommend it. :("},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I loved itD d d d. Rd z z z z z z z z z z as z"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I recently read \\"The Hobbit\\" as well as the main \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, and I really enjoyed all four books. However, I have to note something. Before reading the series, I was under the impression that \\"The Hobbit\\" was an unnecessary, but related book mainly telling you more about hobbits. However, it does more than just tell you about hobbits, and, in my opinion, it is necessary to read \\"The Hobbit\\" before reading the main trilogy. There is a lot of content in it that will make the trilogy even better. For example, \\"The Hobbit\\" tells you how Bilbo happened to find the ring, it tells you a fair amount of useful \\"history\\", and it can help you make more sense out of much of what is mentioned in the trilogy, such as locations and such.This book could very well be read without reading the trilogy. However, I would definitely recommend reading all four books, because they are all very exciting, and each one builds up more and more interest as the story unfolds.As other reviewers have mentioned, the writing style could have been better.I only gave this book 4 stars mainly for that reason. The style isn't too bad, however, it can be a little annoying at times. Sometimes it sounds more like an uninvolved person commenting on the situation, other times it is like a storyteller getting distracted too much by a similar story or by history. That is one of the very few problems I found with this book.Overall, I am glad that I finally read these books, and I am especially glad that I was able to read \\"The Hobbit\\" before I read the main trilogy. I highly recommend all four books. They are all very exciting with constant surprises and twists in the plot to keep you interested. Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book really is a genius story, although, if yur someone like me you have to wonder, with the way Tolkien writes this story, how did he know when and how all this happened?Anyways, as some might have thought his style of writing, odd, I thought it entertaining, he kade it seem like he was telling you, you sitting there reading this loooong book, what's going on. I swear at some points I could here him telling it to me. It's just such a wonderful way to write.As for the ending, although odd, for those who haven't read it yet don't read this next part! I still wonder how such a magnificent dragon, as described in the book, is killed so easily!When I started reading the end finally) I couldn't put it down, so much happens in the last 20 pages, you have to wonder how he crammed all that story in there.Seeing as it took me forever to read, I liked how in some chapters he would take you infor the detailed begining of one of their many adventures, and then in the last 2 pages of the book would sumarize what happenened to the gruop in the end!I'm more into realistic fiction, but I have a few exceptions here and there, this is fantastic, if you have a lot of reading time on your hands, then this is a good book for you."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I didn't read any of Tolkien's books until the movies(awesome) came out and made me interested. So I started with The Hobbit. Amazing. The whole book feels like this big classic adventure and its fun to read. It is also very important in setting up The Lord of the Rings books. Gandalf has got to be one the best characters ever created along with Bilbo of course.There have been many people who have tried to imitate Tolkien's works(Christoper Paolini who wouldn't know originality if it broke his nose) is one example. And sadly no one has made fantasty equal to The Hobbit, Narnia is close but not quite as good. Because if someone did make a fantasty equal to The Hobbit we could have the joy of reading another book that captures your imagination and takes you to another world."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Although \\"The Hobbit\\" exists alone in the Middle-earth realm, it preludes (and is fairly crucial) as the foundation to the masterpiece story \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". The novel follows the comfortable hobbit Bilbo Baggins as he reluctantly leaves his secure home in the company of numerous dwarves and Gandalf, a wizard of good character. The author expertly combines delightful riddles, the singing of well-versed songs, and adolescent banter amid charming creatures, spooky monsters, and minor magic to craft the ideal tale for young readers.The continuous adventure may start with many characters, but Bilbo composes the storyline from a third person view and interjects his own pleasant personality. Other than one affair relating to Gandalf and a Necromancer, all events are resolved in a thorough yet amusing manner. \\"The Hobbit\\" helped define expectations for a reader and laid the groundwork for future fantasy novels with the introduction of different races including Dwarves, Elves, Goblins, Hobbits, and their relationships between each other and with Humankind.The collection I own has \\"The Hobbit\\" along with all books of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and contains inside the final novel a comprehensive appendices and index, the ultimate standard for any author wishing to compile a comprehensive series. Original artwork by the author highlights storyline events and sufficiently illustrates the path traveled by the adventurers. As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movie thereby leaving the story entirely to the imagination.I highly recommend the book collection to any fan of the fantasy genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"I visited an old friend I hadn't seen since the fifth grade, my first 'Hobbit' book. Although I like what they did with the movie, they couldn't have copied the depth of the novel onto the screen, it's something different. The movie will only wet your appetite, so read the book for the full Tolkien experience. I enjoyed visiting the characters again as an adult, re-visiting the Hobbit's wonderful world with a tear in my eye. As a youngster I didn't get the 'feel' of how J.R.R. Tolkien's feelings about war spiced the pages, but they rang in my ears reading it as an adult. Not only did his writing show the talent to entertain, there is great wisdom to read between the lines...Chrissy K.

This simplistic opening sentence has become a classic tagline, memorized not only by fantasy fanatics or escapist stoners, but by literate juveniles and adults nearly everywhere. Do we need another review about the Hobbit? No. Those who chose to read the Hobbit don't need to read a little review to read 'it'. But I will waste a few more seconds of my precious author time for this review:The Hobbit is a fantastic, minimal read that spans the imagination of a well developed mythical (linguistically, and characteristically) nation. It's a quick and lively trip across the wilderness of Middle Earth. An excellent adventure and treasure-hunting story, (think of The Elder Edda meeting Treasure Island.)This book is the archetype for all other commercial 'dungeons and dragons' fantasy that follows in floods. But rather then delivering the sedentary life message that most contemporary fantasy readers would like to hear, it delivers an entirely different message: GET OFF YOUR MEEK BUTT and START LIVING! START AN ADVENTURE! That's a message from a World War 1 veteran/author, not a hackneyed, cardboard-style, fantasy author who is today at your local mall convention.To many, (not just me,) The Hobbit is superior to the Lord of the Rings in that it is basic, it's wordplay and wit is constant, it has more humor. Though the LOTR's is an epos, an epic. The Hobbit is a lot more of a fairy tale...you read it when your young and it stays hidden - but not forgotten - in the back of your mind so as long as you live.In this postmodern age of cyber-hacks as fantasy acts, CGI modelsas 'imaginary' flesh and blood creatures, passive escapist adventures as real authentic adventures, The Hobbit is again a refreshing read....it should inspire one to see and hike mountains, to carry a walking stick instead of a laptop.Like Virgil, Tolkien's message is simple: FORTUNE FAVORS THE BRAVE....not the meek, not the docile, not the lazy.(AND YOU CAN QUOTE ME ON THAT)-Myles P."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, written by J.R.R. Tolkien, is a fantasy novel at its very best. This story introduces many extraordinary characters such as Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, Thorin Oakenshield, and Gollum; who continue to live in the imaginary world of the trilogy, The Lord of the Rings, a sequel to The Hobbit. The story emerges in the quiet, peaceful town of Bag End, where the unadventurous Bilbo Baggins lived. He had much enjoyed his comfortable lifestyle until the arrival of the dwarves followed by Gandalf, who persuaded him to embark on a great quest to acquire the treasure guarded by the dragon Smaug. Along the journey to the dragon, the travelers encountered many dilemmas including mountain trolls, the disturbances in the Misty Mountains (the leaving behind of Bilbo and the conflict with Gollum), evil wolves (Wargs), and spiders. The climax of the story occurs after all of this believe it or not. They finally arrive at Lonely Mountain and defeat Smaug. However, the adventure does not end here, the tired travelers still have to overcome one last obstacle. They must defend this newly acquired treasure from the viscous goblins and wargs to determine who got the treasure.The Hobbit is one of the most interesting and entertaining novels that I have ever taken the time to read. The author, J.R.R. Tolkien, is able to completely entrance the reader with his very descriptive details. Along with this, the plot of the story is incredible, making it seemingly impossible to put this novel down. If you are looking for a book that takes you on a quest through a new world and grabs your attention from the get go, then I highly suggest that you read The Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit, written by J.R.R. Tolkien is fantasy writing at its best. The story, a prelude to Tolkien's immediate classic trilogy, The Lord of the Rings sets up the enchanting world of Middle Earth filled with memorable characters like Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit and main character in this story, Gandalf the Grey, a wizard and mentor for Bilbo, and the unforgettable dwarf Thorin, the leader of the dwarves who embark on the quest with Bilbo.The story begins in a quiet, peaceful hobbit hole in Bag End, the home of Bilbo Baggins. That is, it is peaceful until Gandalf the Grey persuades Bilbo to set out on a quest with thirteen militant and lively dwarves in search of reclaiming their treasure from the dragon Smaug, and Bilbo is to be their chief \\"burglar.\\" On their adventure, they run into three hungry trolls, visit the great elf lord Elrond, in Rivendell, they become prisoner to a group of goblins who live within the caverns of the Misty Mountains until Gandalf saves the day, Bilbo meets the unforgettable Gollum, a hissing, whining creature who lives in a pool in the caverns and hunts fish and goblins who also possesses the magical, and long forgotten Ring of Power. When Bilbo escapes the clutches of Gollum, he rejoins the dwarves; they are chased by evil Wargs, monstrous wolves, and are saved by enormous eagles and a creature that can change shape from a man to a bear, known as Beorn. The company eventually enters Mirkwood and is left on their own when Gandalf leaves on important business. The adventure continues through Mirkwood and on toward Lake Town, at the base of the Lonely Mountain where therein lies Smaug, the dragon and Bilbo must test his newfound wits, strengths, and skills to attest not only the deadly dragon, but the ending battle that will determine who gets the treasures.This book is one of my favorite books of all time. Tolkien is a master at what he does, and the world in which he creates, with its dozens of magical creatures, entwined with invaluable lessons of friendship, loyalty, and bravery are just some of the reasons of why this book is a masterpiece, in every sense of the word. It will always leave you on the edge of your seat, wanting to know what happens next, whether its your first time, or your fifth time reading the book.The only fault with The Hobbit, in general, is the intricate detail that Tolkien goes into to describe places and people. Although this is helpful, allowing the reader to get a better perspective of what Tolkien sees in his mind, his descriptions can sometimes last for pages on end (at least, that's what it feels like). But other than that, the book, overall, is very well written and will be an instant favorite of anyone who enjoys adventure and fantasy, masterfully entwined into one ingenious piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Giving The Hobbit less than 5 stars is absurd. When one talks about Tolkien \\"dilly-dallying and such\\" one is referring to his complex style of writing. Quite frankly, Tokien is not \\"less,\\" he is \\"more.\\" He demands that one pay more attention, he gives one more information. If one wishes to say that more isn't always better, then fine. The rest of us don't expect them to understand. Let me put it this way: It is like Champagne. People don't dislike Champagne, they merely don't understand it. These idiot reviewers \\"Larry\\", \\"Curly\\" and \\"Moe\\" don't prefer the taste of Champagne to 7UP, they simply can't taste it. Is it their limited capacity for intelligence? Is it upbringing? It doesn't really matter what it is, all that matters is that they can't \\"taste\\" The Hobbit. But those of us who can, can- and we love the taste. After all, we have no choice. These are people who would rather eat Aunt Jemima pancakes with fake syrup than have hot crepes rolled with fine preserves. Really, do the opinions of these people actually count? It is understood by many that an opinion is only an opinion- how untrue this is! In the legal world an opinion is something that is ruled and weighed to be best, to be most true. There _is_ such a thing as a good opinion, even the best opinion. And opinion can be right and an opinion can be wrong. I daresay that giving The Hobbit 3 stars is wrong. And why do I dare? Because if someone told us that cow manure tasted better than ice cream they would be wrong. The bottom line is this: Mozart is better than The Beetles; Ferraris are better than raced out Subarus and Ice Cream does, in fact, taste better than manure. If, like this idiot, you are a simpleton who can can neither hear, taste nor see then don't bother to post your opinions to the rest of us. Instead, take my advice and cozy yourself up with something you can understand like Harry Potter and let yourself float away to the world of un-imagination. You will be much happier and won't have to deal with the headaches of trying to figure out what Tolkien is trying to say, nor will you have to deal with the frustrations of not being able to see in full color and dimensions the Dwarves and Elves and Wizards they way that the rest of us can. I almost pity you, but then, you wasted 60 seconds of my life with degenerate reviews so on second thought, get out of my gene pool and stop breathing my air. It's people like you that make the rest of our lives so two-dimensional by preventing more work like The Hobbit from ever being created with your lack of understanding and abundance of stupidity.P.S. The Hobbit is a great book, arguably the greatest, certainly the greatest in its own league. It was written by an adult and is absolutely suitable for adults. The fact that it may also be enjoyed and understood by children is only a further credit to Tolkien's genius. Don't let the altogether too commonly found ramblings that this is a book for children discourage you from reading it if you haven't already. While not everyone is capable of enjoying it, it is criminal not to at least expose everyone to this book for anyone who is capable of enjoying it who is denied the oppurtunity has been cheated of one of the finest intellectual pleasures of this past century. My advice to you is to read it slowly and thoroughly. It is an experience like nothing else that will never be quite as magical the second time around.P.P.S. If you don't know what The Hobbit is about, in short, it is about Adventure. A great Adventure full of Swords and Magic; of Dwarves and of Elves and of Wizards and Hobbits; Good, Evil; Trolls and Goblins; Suspense, Excitement, Comedy and Tragedy; Music, Riddles and Poetry. All of this presented in one of the most unique styles of writing ever encountered; a style of writing that paints every detail of Tolkien's fantastic world in your mind as if you were there. Not a single word is wasted and every element of the story is to be enjoyed. If any of these things sound even remotely fascinating then read this book- you won't be disappointed.P.P.P.S. Comments about the illustrated versions for those trying to decide between the two illustrated versions of The Hobbit done by Alan Lee and Michael Hague: I recommend the Michael Hague edition hands down. The illustrations seem to fit the book much more than Lee's. Lee's anything but poor, but Mague's are more merry, bright and rich. The characters appear heartier and the colors set a better mood. More simply put, when I look at Lee's illustrations I feel like I'm standing in the dining room of somebody's grandmother- wallpaper, china dolls, lace and all- they just seem old and dry. Hague's characters, the dragon especially, seem more believable- when I turn the page I don't get a feeling like what I'm looking at is out of place. Another difference with Hague is that I am confident that anybody would enjoy his illustrations, but with Lee I merely see why some people 'might prefer it.' Hague really does have that illustration feeling I expect to see in a book; Lee's look like they belong on a museum wall. Also, I feel that Hague took a more direct interpretation of the book while Lee seemed to illustrate as he liked to fit his own style without much less regard to the book. Still, before buying I suggest you sample the art on the internet just to be sure of your tastes. However, if you're uncertain then I am confident that you and especially your children will enjoy Hague."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"(paraphrased) You dont believe the propheses because you had a hand in making them?

I was considering that I should read this series of books, since it is one of those classic \\"good versus evil\\" things that are never boring, and always tons of fun to read. Since it came out as a movie as well, I decided that I cannot hold it up longer, and started the series.The hobbit, for some of you who don't know, came first in 1937, before the wars, and it became the fourth best-selling novel ever. After it showing a lot of success, Tolkien decided to write series of book afterwards, which eventually became the infamous lord of the rings trilogy. The book (now a major motion picture) itself focuses on adventure and travel, giving you wonder and satisfaction as you read through them.The story goes on like this: there is this hobbit who goes by the name of Bilbo Baggins, who like any other hobbits, like their comfortable homes and teatime at 4 \`o clock, keeps things tidy and scheduled, and never goes out on adventures. Well, never till now since Mr. Baggins was the first one to ever be out on a grand- scale adventure and return with a lot of success. He goes out on a great and a dangerous quest with 13 other dwarves and a magician to reclaim the great city of dale from Smaug, the dragon. In the end he manages to lead the dwarves safely to the destination, finish the quest in the end, and returns home, living happily ever after.There are classic adventure funs to be read from the story, about trusts and friendships, magic and discovery, and all sort of that great stuff, so read this book to begin the whole lord of the rings trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Reading it as an adult, I found that there is much more to the story than when I read it as a teenager!"},{"Title":"The Hobbit","review":"Awesome!
