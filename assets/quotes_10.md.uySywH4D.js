Though I found it more interesting than Lily's story, Lily was too stubborn, it still wasn't...great. It was a decent story with a decent plot, though I figured out the ending before the ending, it still wasn't a really good story. I suppose because I wasn't sure of Steven's affection for Emma. All he really showed was lust and a need to conquer. Even when he said that he loved her and he wanted to marry her, I just thought, \\"you do?\\" Also I had a difficult time believing that a woman like Emma with her strong ideas in what's proper would throw it all away so quick for him.Like so many have said before, there were too many love scenes. After a while I started skipping them. I want to continue the series, but I wouldn't buy this book."},{"Title":"Emma and the Outlaw","review":"Ok it starts out pretty good but it soon turns. The guy is awful! He's a complete jerk who loves to bend Emma to his will every chance he can. The first love scene he almost has her and that's only after a few days in the book! He doesn't even care that she's innocent or that he's wanted he keeps coming after her! She is so annoying,she bends to him at every turn never standing up for herself. There exactly 8 love scenes and bout 4 half ones were just start out and then it goes to the next scene. Can someone say over kill? Belive me I love love scenes but it just got boring with so many.

Kando of California State University, Sacramento has chronicle the changing definitions of leisure, specifically as it relates to work, in Leisure and Popular Culture in Transition. Recognizing the emerging fields of popular culture and leisure, Dr, Kando uses interdisciplinary methods as well as sociological ones to evaluate leisure's historical meaning in order to understand its modern meaning. First, Dr. Kando seeks the find the point of transition from the protestant work ethic (hard work, thrift, competitiveness) to a &quot;less individualistic and social or even bureaucratic ethic.&quot; (Kando, 12)Over the course of American industrialization and opportunities for work on all levels (from coal-mining to merchandizing), Dr. Kando observes &quot;the emergence of a new value system that continues to place a premium on work, emphasizes conspicuous consumption, but fails to put a high premium on leisure.&quot; (Kando, 12-13)This view takes Thorstein Veblen's notion that conspicuous consumption and leisure are not related at all. Why then, and for whom, does conspicuous consumption take place? Or has the need for conspicuous assumption come to signify something other than the Leisure Class?Appropriately, Dr. Kando moves to discuss various theories of and the history and meaning of the word &quot;leisure.&quot; He separates the term into two different meanings: the first is derived from the classical, Aristotelian school where leisure translates into the cultivation of self through spiritual freedom and meditation. The second, more contemporary definition of leisure is defined by recreation (sports, games, play, etc.). According to Dr. Kando, this school &quot;implicitly views leisure as if secondary importance to work. (Kando, 20).The belief that the present condition of leisure as secondary to work prompts Dr. Kando to call for changes back to the definition of Aristotle.Dr. Kando is idealistic in his argument, but as he himself has demonstrated with examples of the Protestant work ethic, it may be the United States has always defined leisure as secondary to work. At least, amongst those who worked. The new definition of work Dr, Kando asks for would be more appropriately defined as spirituality. And indeed, spirituality or the pursuit of some kind of spiritual affiliation has been historically the mark of status and leisure, this time as defined by the Leisure Class."},{"Title":"Words Heard in Silence","review":"Couldn't have said it better myself. I received this book with eager anticipation. But after the first 100 pages of hoping the action would pick up, it never did.After 200-pages I didn't have trouble putting it down, only picking it up.After 300-pages I began to skip over sections at a time, only to find more of the same \\"I love you so much darling\\"s and the ever popular \\"I'm not good enough for you, Darling\\"s, etc., etc.The only exciting incidents are not even given to the reader 1st hand and don't expect to get even an inkling of sex in this book. Toward the end, almost as an afterthought, at least we do get about 2-3 pages of an actual battle scene and then the war is over (of course it is).The whole book is just WAY too unbelievable and perfect.The hero does nothing for the whole book but bustle around his (also perfect)Union troops being a caring, fatherly type. PULEEEESSSEEE!!! (gagging sounds) The biggest crisis was their not being able to get good boots or having a fist fight!Of course, in the end they are married, have 3-children, a beautiful home and live happily ever after.Besides that, there's not one contraction in the entire book, which becomes irritating after the 1st few pages.Too bad, it had the looks of a strong story. This book should be re-titled \\"Yet Another Drivelly Domestication of Two Potentially Heroic and Exciting Women\\""},{"Title":"Words Heard in Silence","review":"I generally like historical novels and am seriously fond of lesbian fare. However the combination failed miserably here. With an historical novel, one is not supposed to have to suspend disbelief, and considerable suspension was required and repeatedly so. Being from the South, we're still living this history, and it makes us much more aware when grave inaccuracies float up. Though there were quite certainly disguised women who joined the military during the Civil War, there is no evidence that a single one of them ever rose to any level exceeding cannon fodder. That was just the first of many unbelievable details which the authors fail to sell to the reader.But the most disappointing aspect of this novel has to do with the changes it went through from its online version to the final print version. The relational aspects between the two main characters became a footnote to long, tiresome factual renderings of battles and historical points of note. The love scenes were perfunctory or non-existent, unlike the languid and sensual scenes in the proto-version which I find I much prefer.This is a marginally acceptable first attempt by two new writers, but it is my hope that their next offerings, particularly if in the historical novel genre, are infused with a considerabl increase in believability and liveliness."},{"Title":"Words Heard in Silence","review":"This book isn't really good enough for 4 stars, but it isn't as bad as 3. If I could give it a 3.5, I would.The idea behind this book is a good one and the general plot is well done. But there is too much extra stuff (the adopted kids and the endless accounts of repairs are just two).I kept reading because I wanted to finish the book, but I don't know if I will want to ever reread this one.If you like historical romance and can stand long, flowery passages, you will probably enjoy this book. If you like more straight-forward writing, don't bother."},{"Title":"Words Heard in Silence","review":"I am a huge fan of T. Novan's books and have read everything she has published.

Rebecca is impressed by this \\"gentleman\\" and is shocked to learn \\"he\\" is really a \\"she.\\" As their relationship develops, Charlie is not sure whether Rebecca has fallen in love with the man or the woman. With the support of the few people who know his secret, Charlie is able to come to terms with his new feelings and accept Rebecca's love for him.Because this book was loosely based on actual historical facts, I learned some things about the Civil War I had not known before. I even looked up some of the events and people in the book and found the book to be historically accurate. The fiction part of the story was just as good and I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to lose themself in the past."},{"Title":"Words Heard in Silence","review":"A well researched Historical novel, Words Heard in Silence is long, but doesn't feel long. It captures the flavor of the time beautifully. I fell in love with Colonel Redmond right along with Rebecca.Set near the end of the Civil War, this is more than just a wonderful love story about a Southern Lady and a Union Colonel. So much more. It is also the story of how these two profoundly lonely people deal with the reconstruction of not only the South, but of their lives as well. A truly moving and uplifting story."},{"Title":"Words Heard in Silence","review":"I love history mixed with romance.Colonel Redman's Union troops decide to camp on Rebecca Gaines land.

It takes a long time to read - 550 pages - but it is worth the effort and holds interest throughout. The historical setting is well written and the authors must have worked hard on the research. The story really puts life into those boring history lessons from school days, with lots of well written, original characters and descriptions of military life, battles etc. The love story between Charlie and Rebecca is very sweet and romantic, with Charlie's shyness and Rebecca's innocence both very appealing. And the description of the last battle is highly dramatic and is a good example of the foolishness of war but also of how courageous people can be for their comrades and friends. There are many humorous scenes also, showing the range of Rickard and Novan's writing skill. Some of the dialog is a bit slow moving but that may well be a part of the historical accuracy of this highly recommended book. If this is the first in a series of books with these characters, I look forward to the rest."},{"Title":"Words Heard in Silence","review":"I waited almost 2 years for this book to get to my price range and the wait was well worth it. The historical drama and detail was spot on as far as the period of time this drama unfolded. The writing was very good and the descriptions from the performance of battlefield surgery to life on a farm in war torn Virginia were excellent. Being a Civil War history buff, especially the south, made for very entertaining reading. This book in my opinion deserves every bit of a 10 on the scale of 1 to 10. A true enjoyment!"},{"Title":"Words Heard in Silence","review":"I loved this book. A historical novel, it is set in the US Civil War. As a love story, it is very believeable. Reading the preface you will see that there really were women who disguised themselves as men during the Civil War. (and probably many other times before we got into ID cards, physicals and such)It is obvious that quite a lot of research went into this story. You can't help but love the two main characters, as well as many of the supporting cast.It's not the epic size of GWTW, it is a fairly large book - but one you won't want to put down. While it has angst, it also has quite a bit of humor.It was a very enjoyable read, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Words Heard in Silence","review":"Great book. The lack of contractions and slang added to the Civil War era feel. The lack of graphic sex adds to it I think because for the time period it wouldn't put out there bluntly. Probably not spoken of at all. Charlie Redmond is the Jess Goldberg of Colonial America and one of the few characters to which I can truly relate. Great book, great job and it was worth the wait to purchase, even at $54.00 plus additional for expidited shipping...Just fantastic!"},{"Title":"Words Heard in Silence","review":"A great Novel of the Civil War from a different perspective.

I especially liked that the character words were so well written and also that their thoughts were revealed to the reader to give us a complete picture of their motivation.I loved the two leading characters and thought they acted very maturely with the hardships they had endured in their lives before and during the time the story takes place.

Indeed, it is, in my opinion, one of the best books ever written about any facet of show business.Vernacular dance in 20th century America wasn't represented or devised solely by a handful of the best remembered: Vernon & Irene Castle, Bill Robinson, Fred & Ginger, Eleanor Powell, Hal Le Roy, the Nicholas Brothers, Gene Kelly, Ann Miller, Donald O'Connor and Bob Fosse.From the age of variety saloons and minstrelsy through a century of vaudeville and nightclubs, there were hundreds of dancers, black and white, female and male, who contributed to the development of American vernacular (or jazz) dance. Hoofers invented, borrowed, stole and adapted rhythm steps, jumps, slides, contortions and even style from each other---and American dance became richer for their efforts.Marshall Stearns understood that. Instead of choosing to write about the best known dancers of his day, the ones blessed by luck, Stearns took on the nearly impossible task of interviewing every dancer of ability he could locate. Some like King Rastus Brown, Ginger Wiggins and Groundhog were remarkable talents known only by a very few--most of whom were other dancers who held them in high esteem. Others like John Bubbles, Ida Forsythe, James Barton, Pete Nugent, Eddie Rector, Alice Whitman, Willie Covan and Harlan Dixon were peerless dancers of their day but forgotten despite years of stardom. Mr. Stearns brought more than a hundred fine hoofers to tell their stories to readers and dance enthusiasts.Stearns wove those stories together without forcing themes and, within the warp and woof of his narrative, emerged bits of social history and showbiz lore, explanations of certain dance steps, claims and counter-claims as to origins and originality, faulty recollections and all but forgotten gems of clearly remembered facts.Many reputations emerged brightly restored in luster while others, perhaps more famous, proved less admired by professionals who had more discerning views than fans with less knowledge of dance.Whenever I need to check a fact about vernacular dance--jazz dance or tap--I turn first to Marshall Stearn's invaluable book.Frank Cullenfounder, American Vaudeville Museum publisher of \\"Vaudeville Times\\"author: \\"Vaudeville, Old & New: an Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America\\" (2006, Routledge Press)"},{"Title":"Jazz Dance: The Story of American Vernacular Dance","review":"I second everything Frank Cullen says about this book. I first read it over thirty years ago, acquiring my own copy some years later. Not only is it a great book on American show business,it makes great reading for anyone interested in all facets of New World music and dance culture. I frequently reccomend this book to fans of American music in general, be it jazz, blues, rock 'n' roll, country, Latin etc. etc. After reading the Stearns' wonderful book, one sees that, no matter how well-versed in the musical lore of the Americas one is, it is all a bit two-dimensional without the perspective offered by 'Jazz Dance'."},{"Title":"Jazz Dance: The Story of American Vernacular Dance","review":"As an lindy hop dancer and tap dancer I was very happy to read this book.

The book is full of useful information and makes me appreciate the social history, racial struggles, and artistic timeline of tap. Like others have said, it's not a how-to (it doesn't profess to be), so it'll be helpful to have a little background and know a few basics (or have access to YouTube!).

Otherwise, you'll just have to settle for a bunch of dance history and anecdotes strung together by the Stearns, who interviewed as many American jazz dancers as they could still find alive.It's fascinating stuff, though. The text does give some limited descriptions, and opening the book to a random page reveals both &quot; . . .Crawley danced while he played clarinet, juggling the pieces as he dismantled it&quot; and &quot;As performed by Little Egypt at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, where it first received national attention as the Hootchy-Kootchy, the Shake dance was not particularly rhythmic.&quot;As an actual history of American dance, for me this book lacks coherence. But I did learn about ways in which African dance influenced American, see the names of quite a lot of performers, steps, and performance venues, and learn to play the &quot;Buck Dancer's Lament&quot; on the piano. If you want something you can read a page of and then put down until later, this will fill the bill."},{"Title":"Swimming in Sky: A Novel","review":"This is a great book. Majors has a talent for dialogue and enabling the reader to know and feel for the characters. Everyone who has experienced a difficult time in life from the death of a loved one, friendships lost to just getting older will enjoy Majors' telling of this story. I especially liked that the main character's mother, who is struggling with post divorce issues, family and finances, and her boyfriend coping with alcohol abuse and cancer help Sayers through a tough summer by their examples of real life courage, humor, dignity and love. It's a moving story that I've enjoyed re-reading.

If you've read the other reviews, you know the details so I won't repeat (time, place, genre, etc.) This book simply made me think hard while I read, and along the way I was enjoying fine writing and 'turn of phrase' from Inman Majors. It's been too long since I've read a book that made me go real slow to catch the nuance and the deeper meanings. The vivid, descriptive language was enlightening, and charitably brief (&quot;paved hell&quot; to describe strip malls.)"},{"Title":"Swimming in Sky: A Novel","review":"To those unfortunate enough to have missed out on this; one of the truly good books to come out in years. I did 't know anyone still wrote this well! No offense to other modern authors, but Majors has it all over you. He never condescends to us, but includes us instead. His characters act as people do, not as people in novels do. By the same token, he seems to have a genuine affection for the people and places he writes about. Say is one of the best narrators and characters I've read.I don't just identify with him, I feel like I know him. He is blessed with keen perceptions but feels cursed by them. Adulthood is not particularly welcomed but is inevitable and he is scared. It is nearly impossible for a writer to portray the kind of youth that is no longer innocent but not yet wise. Majors was able to do this. Unlike his protaganist, he has harnessed his talents to produce a masterwork that should not be overlooked."},{"Title":"Swimming in Sky: A Novel","review":"Swimming in Sky reads like a beat generation novel - rhythmic and poetic, a wise-cracking underachievers trip through post-graduate malaise, his native South, and his soul. Through hero Jason Sayer, Majors reveals his talent for language and dead-pan observation. But this is a slackers anthem with substance - honest and wise, with a spiritual yearning that will make it a literary as well as cult classic."},{"Title":"Swimming in Sky: A Novel","review":"As a 38-year-old East Tennessee native, I found this novel's tone and feel perfectly encapsulate certain feelings of those of us who felt adrift in our mid-20's.

This book has a nice flow, with a gradual redemption plot that reads very plausible."},{"Title":"Swimming in Sky: A Novel","review":"Inman Major's book was a fairly accurate description of the last months of my father's life. \\"Sweet\\" was my father who lived and died in Knoxville, TN while living with the mother of a spoiled Vanderbilt graduate. (See author's bio.) Obviously turning fact unto fiction meant little to Majors, but he will never realize the hurt caused by his book. \\"Sweet\\" died before his time and is probably rolling over in his grave. Majors owes \\"Sweet's\\" family an apology for pretending his book is fiction."},{"Title":"Swimming in Sky: A Novel","review":"&quot;Swimming in Sky&quot; is one of those simple, yet complicated, works that can be read and appreciated on several levels. First, it's a great quick read that will unceasingly amuse and most likely stir up personal memories for anyone who has ever drowned in the inertia of not knowing what to do in life, who has suffered through too many fake family Christmases whether they result from divorce or overexpectations, who has wondered how to make a living from that &quot;good as gold BA,&quot; who as a parent cannot fathom how your child got so mixed up much less know how to help, who has ever been strung out on drugs or even just a little drunk, or who has opted to swim in sky instead of conform to suburban normality. The novel will be a special bonus to those familiar with Knoxville, TN, where life is a split-level house or those who have ever had the thrill of watching one of the Majors clan play or coach football in the South, where as we all know, football is a religion.On the first reading, you can't help but laugh at and with Jason, the 25-year-old unemployed Vandy graduate who just can't get his life going, no thanks to his druggy friends and despite the gentle urgings of his way more than tolerant family. Throughout the book after laughing out loud at Jason's irreverent, yet endearing, witticisms, the next scene will be so poignant and all too real that you have to just put the book down and enfold the characters in your heart in hopes of repairing their shatteredness.A second, more fastidious reading will yield a deep appreciation of and admiration for the descriptive craft of this debut novelist. The absence of quotation marks in the dialogue perfectly mirrors Jason's free-flowing lifestyle. The depth at which Jason's relationships with family members (especially the males) are teasingly unfolded bit by bit is masterful. The most powerful scenes are when the present becomes the future and past all at once such as when Jason remembers in his blood things that happened before he was born.A third depth at which the book can provide plenty for the reader as well as Jason to chew on is the spiritual level, rich with symbolism and religious references. Jason, who's not fully aware he is even on a spiritual journey, at times furtively turns to the Bible and prayer. After a bad acid trip on Good Friday, he is haunted with trying to figure out who is Judas and who is Jesus in his life and why will watering his friend's flowers heal him. He wrestles with the issues of free will vs fate, God's commission vs the gift of grace, why God allows handicaps and disease. He struggles with the mysterious symbolism of the cross, Peter the rock of the church vs Peter the bartender vs Peter his brother, a behemoth yard, Lazarus back from the dead, the Prince of Peace, the Samaritans and 666 sprayed painted in graffiti.The ending leaves plenty of room for a sequel - will Jason ever figure out what is the Golden Fleece he so desires? Will there be a Medea to capture his heart? We can only hope there is more to come from this most talented new author."},{"Title":"Swimming in Sky: A Novel","review":"Inman Majors, in this his debut novel, captures in Jason Sayer the voice of a generation. Sayer embodies the lethary and aimlessness that appear to characterize the 1970's and 1980's. Say, one of Jason's nicknames, &quot;says&quot; much about himself and those around him.Majors'descriptions of Knoxville, particularly West Knoxville, plant the reader in southern suburbia. I have really read no one in recent times who captures the culture and soul of surburban America as well as Majors.If you are a University of Tennesse graduate or have ever lived in Knoxville, you will find this book moving and entertaining. Majors includes all the familiar haunts: the Strip, Old Town, assorted bars, and of course the shadow of UT football. Readers will identify with Jason and his friends on forays in Knoxville and to Atlanta (the classic road trip).Majors deliberately omits the use of any quotation marks, at first an upsetting style to this reviewer, but the more I read, the more I identified the style with Jason's voice, and I began to swim in sky with him."},{"Title":"Swimming in Sky: A Novel","review":"The title of this review is taken from an aging Scott Fitzgerald, looking back to the worst years of his struggles with alcoholism and depression. Majors' novel very much deals with a dark night of the soul for 25 year old Jason &quot;Say&quot; Sayers, a Vanderbilt grad who is having a hard time getting his life together. Unable to progress in relationships (romantic and platonic), struggling at an almost subconscious level with the limits of faith and spirituality, failing to throw off the deep malaise brought on by an acid trip gone seriously wrong, living with his Mother and her alcoholic (though kind) boyfriend, this novel is a manifesto for everyone who has ever failed to live up to either his potential or his ambitions, for everyone who has seen the spreading paths of possibility as daunting instead of inspiring. On a more specific level, wry, observant, cynical Say's had a rough time these last couple of years, and he doesn't know who he can trust. He's beginning to suspect that his friends (even his oldest, best friends) don't want to support him; they want to drag him down with them. He's in the throes of a dark, tangible depression that literally comes on him like a shadow creature from some Lovecraftian dream. Maybe Beth, the old flame-that-never-was from high school, can pull him out of it, or maybe his brother can, or the memory of his kind grandfather, or even the example set by Tom in his own struggle with ennui and an unfair world. One way or another, it's worth strapping into the shotgun seat and enjoying the ride with this Knoxvillian hybrid of Salinger, Kerouac, and Cormac McCarthy."},{"Title":"Swimming in Sky: A Novel","review":"Swimming in Sky is one of the most powerful and endearing novels I have read, if not because of its vivid writing and convincing style, then because of the universal appeal of its main character, Jason Sayer. A highly likeable and witty 25-year-old, Sayer struggles through post-college unemployment on a compelling journey to find out who and what he is and where he fits in in this &quot;strip mall&quot; world. The first-person narrative is disarmingly honest and funny, and Majors brilliantly brings feelings of youthful anxiety and quiet optimism to life on paper. Majors is an extremely talented and gifted writer, and his debut novel is destined to be a classic."},{"Title":"Swimming in Sky: A Novel","review":"Inman Majors has endowed his narrator with extraordinary storytelling powers. As the name suggests, Jason Sayer knows how to testify. He guides us through the landscape of an emerging &quot;new Knoxville&quot; with searing wit and a devastating insight that carries the hope and understanding of true compassion.Say, as he's known by certain friends, is unsure what to do next. He's a Vandy grad, but only has a liberal arts degree to show for it. As the novel opens, he has informally moved in with his mother and her boyfriend, following a trip to Australia that failed to shed light on which path he ought to pursue. Further complicating this twenty-five year-old's identity quest is a recent bad acid trip that seems to have brought about the material realization of Sayer's own peculiar stock of nightmares. Having been reared with a family legacy of UT football heroism, he now feels the ubiquitous presence of a shadow following him around. Growing increasingly paranoid and suspcious in the company of the friends he grew up with, he's troubled by a comment one of them made about Judas. Paging through the Bible for spiritual guidance one moment, the next Sayer treads in fear of the very sky itself, worrying by turns that its birds are either messenger angels or Satan's avengers.To top it off, this childhood jock now has a bum knee and no health insurance. The knee serves as the physical manifestation of what separates Sayer from other &quot;slacker&quot; protagonists. Unlike the paralysis we often encounter in that character type, here we have a protagonist that for the most part has retained his abilities of locomotion. He's just a little gimpy, which signals how hard he must work to cross the road his spiritual journey requires.Through Sayer's thoroughly engaging voice, Majors leads us on an odyssey that provides a complex and stratified view of suburbia. It is not simply rendered as generic and bland, as it has been in other books, in less capable hands. Swimming Sky sharply delineates one type of subdivision from another, in a refreshing turn of attention to accuracy. Overall the sense of place Majors achieves is staggering, as he takes us to jock watering holes, alternative clubs and west Knoxville suburbia, just to name a few memorable locations.I could say more because this is really good stuff. But check it out and find out for yourself. Majors gets it right."},{"Title":"Swimming in Sky: A Novel","review":"Inman Majors' characters are caught in the peculiar place between suburbia, the Tennessee hills, and the dubious urbanity of Knoxville, Tennessee. Through the eyes of Jason Sayer, main character and narrator, they walk through the world with bewilderment, anger, and most importantly, senses of humor intact. In particular, Jason's (Say's) perspective on his sometimes nightmarish world is marked with a skewed, self-deprecating humor that renders him likable, intelligent, and trustworthy as a narrator. He is on a quest to come to terms with a universal inertia that many of us have felt, at different times of life, in different parts of the world. Major's achievement is that he's put us in a particular place by using vivid writing and great detail, from the description of the sluggish Tennessee River \\"running\\" through downtown Knoxville to the college punk bars of the 1980s to a nighmarish, drug-addled road trip to Atlanta. He creates a varied cast of characters (even the dog is great) that will stay with you long after you've finished the book. Strong characterization and sense of place, good pacing, strong narrative voice, compelling plot, \\"Swimming in Sky\\" is the complete package."},{"Title":"Swimming in Sky: A Novel","review":"Anyone who has lost a loved one before their time is liable to feel violated when another trespasses upon their grief. What I think those close to &quot;Sweet&quot; need to remember, however, is that the character in the novel is a fictionalization of the real-life &quot;Sweet,&quot; someone whom both the narrator and the author remember very fondly. The book is not about Sweet, it is about Jason Sayers, and in his own turbulent time, Sweet seemed to be more of a father figure to Jason than his own father.When reading, we sometimes mistake a flawed character for one that is unsympathetic. It is important to remember that those flaws are what makes the characters real, the flaws are why we love them. Obviously, the reviewer's father was very important to Majors, and when Majors fictionalized this time in his life, he needed to include Sweet. To depict Sweet as two-dimensionally perfect would be an injustice to both the reader and the man. If, indeed, you want to view this book as being about Sweet (which it is not), it is a fond memorial, not a scathing expose. I only hope that passing time and a careful re-reading will help you recognize that."},{"Title":"Swimming in Sky: A Novel","review":"When I opened this novel, it was almost midnight; I had intended to read only a few pages before I turned in for the evening.

It's difficult to describe exactly what it is that makes this novel so compelling, or its ending so moving.

These books have become very popular but I usually resist these plot-driven police procedurals. They tend to feature a horrendous crime and the whole book is about following the clues as the story unfolds to a satisfactory conclusion. This is true of this book too but I must say that there was something special about it that kept me reading and kept me fascinated. It was set in the Soviet Union and I was absolutely mesmerized by the details of a way of life that I have only heard rumors about. I felt it all as I read the book - the cold of the Russian winters, the intrinsic corruption, the taking for granted of the purges that sent thousands of people to Siberia, the acceptance of a lifestyle that includes drinking copious amounts of vodka to ease the hundreds of inconveniences and general dismay of everyday life.The story starts with the discovery of three unidentified bodies in Gorky Park in Moscow. It unravels slowly as Arlady Renko has to deal with the politics of the times and the monolithic character of the Soviet Union. There is the dissolution of Renkos marriage followed by a serious love affair with a young woman from Siberia who is loosely connected with the three murdered individuals We also meet a wealthy corrupt American in the fur trade as well as numerous civil servants, investigators, gangsters, and friends who all wind up brutally murdered. Arkady himself survives beatings and gunshots and internment in an institution where he is interrogated constantly. There is also a final section that takes place in New York City and I found myself indentifying with the time and the place in a city I know so well. Renko might be a caricature but I couldn't help but like him as he remains strong in the face of adversity and naturally lives through it all to become the hero of a very successful line of books that follow.In spite of my misgivings and my general impatience with the incredulous details of the plot, I couldn't put the book down and quickly discovered why a book like this is so popular. It's because the reader gets so caught up in the plot that it becomes a little vacation from the reality of the everyday life and lets a person indentify with the heroism of the lead character.I therefore have to highly recommend this book although I seriously doubt if I'll read any more in the series."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Fairly standard detective template. Alienated protagonist with his own value system that he adheres to without reward. Fine exegesis of the pre-collapse Soviet Union, and a seemingly realistic picture of life under communism for someone who is neither ideologue nor revolutionary. Kind of a converse of Hammett- even as Marlowe was disillusioned with capitalism but not ready to abandon it, Renko, at least in this opener, is the same with communism.There is less whodunit and more howhedunit with this book, and more mood than plot, but he has an interesting literary device or two. He has the story move along in leaps and then fills in the details after the move, kind of like a knight in chess. At first this was disconcerting, but after a time I began to appreciate it.To sum, five stars may be a bit high, but it was as good a detective novel as any I've read in a while, with a reasonably sympathetic character and with a lot of atmosphere.The review title, if anyone cares, is a weak Seinfeld reference- the bad guys in this novel are more or less international traders."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"This rather well-known novel is a detective whodunnit set in the old Soviet Union during the late cold war, and therein lies its fascination. The author really does his homework, and we get a glimpse of that society with many or most of its warts on full display. Here we see the old Soviet Union as what it was; a deeply flawed system under the control of a corrupt bureaucracy made up of, yes, corruptible human beings. We also get a glimpse of how Soviet citizens tended to perceive Americans and Westerners. This achievement is not a negligible one. Incidentally, in this novel Westerners are not portrayed in a particularly favorable light. In fact, the overall theme of this novel could reasonably be said to follow the old aphorism: \\"The problem with Communism is Communism. The problem with Capitalism is Capitalists.\\"As a whodunnit, this one is not bad. Detective Arkady Renko is a sympathetic character. The author's writing style is somewhat murky, but he overcomes this with a wry sense of humor and a gritty realism. If you are interested in the old Soviet Union, or just like an off-beat detective novel, do not pass this one up."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"This is, quite simply, the greatest novel of the last century.

In a land of subversion, and deceit, our hero is an earnest, truthful, and non malleable cop. The book captures the nuances of Soviet, and Russian humor.

I will certainly add him amongst my must reads: Harry Bosch, Lucas Davenport, Elvis Cole, and Jack Reacher."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"The first of Martin Cruz Smith's Arkady Renko series of novels. Renko is a detective in Moscow, and comes across what appears to be a serial killer. This killler removes the faces and hands of victims to prevent identification.This leads to a gripping hunt for the maniac, and Arkady uses the services of a forensic anthropologist to reconstruct a face to help him track down the killer."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Near the end of Chapter 11, Renko experiences a sharp pang of discomfort as the girl he has entangled in his investigation of three murders puts a cigarette out against the bark of a birch tree, &quot;as if the warm stab were being pressed into his heart. He believed her. The truth had gone from her into the tree and into him.&quot; This is the quality of writing that we get from Martin Cruz Smith. His facility with language balances with his storycraft to produce a compelling, dramatic espionage thriller that stands against the best work of Le Carre or Fredrick Forsyth."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Arkydy Renko, an honest hard working, conscientious, public investigator, fights his way through a maze of evil and hostile characters, the cunning, ruthless American entrepreneur, Osborne, his own corrupt boss, Yamskoi and major Preblida, the KGB man. He is after the ruthless killer of three young people, found in frozen Gorky Park, shot at point- blank- range, their faces and fingertips obliterated.. He is helped along the way by the brother of one of the slain men, a young American idealist. Curwell, a New York detective, fluent in Russian, joins hands reluctantly with Arkydy to revenge his brother's murder.Arkydy, by brilliant reasoning and with help from his love, Arina Ossinova, entangles the Sable fur trade, the labyrinth of KGB, and bureaucracy of FBI, tracks down the killer all the way to New York City. Here detective Curwell teams up with him to go after Osborne. But Osborne knows the score and book ends with an unforgettable scene where Arkydy fulfilling his task, limps back to Moscow. He tells Arina, his accomplice and love,who sells her very soul to come to America, to go disappear in America, where she belongs.The book sheds light on dark, Byzantine, bad old days of Soviet Union where every body spied on every body and KGB ruled supreme. I guess peoplelike Arkydy, the optimistic, very human chief investigator, turned the Soviet r&eacute;gime around and created another revolution seventy years after the brutal first, paving the way for democracy."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I found this book, hardback (first edition, second reprinting) in a charity shop for 49 pence (approx 75 cents US).

In the meantime, buy this book here."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I've read this book more times than I can count. It possesses an intriguing and complicated plot, extraordinarily well-developed and interesting characters, gives an amazing portrayal of Soviet Moscow, and is exciting and suspenseful. I highly recommend it. Main character Arkady Renko is both brilliant and cynical. He was interesting to read about, and was one of the reasons I liked the book so much. The book has many good elements-love, friendship, death, corruption, greed, suspense, and the violence that comes with the position of Chief Investigator of Moscow, which Renko holds. The KGB is heavily involved, it seems, and Arkady wonders if they are laying a trap for him. (His earlier attempt at arresting Major Pribluda of the KGB for the assassinations of the \\"Kliazma River\\" bodies and his thinly disguised comtempt for the Party and its machinations give them a motive for this action.) The plot has many twists and turns, and by the end of the book, the KGB, Moscow Militia, FBI, and an NYPD officer are all involved, in a complicated and satisfying plot stretching all the way around the world to the U.S. Two other books I have read and enjoyed are \\"The Monkey House\\" and \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\". I also enjoyed other books by John Le Carre (Gorky Park was every bit as good as \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" and as good as le Carre's astounding \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\", though Tinker Tailor was more difficult to understand and required more concentration on my part). In addition, I liked every book I have read by this author, Martin Cruz Smith--Polar Star, Red Square, Havana Bay (all which are in the Gorky Park series) Stallion Gate, and Rose. If you liked any of those books, I'm sure you will like Gorky Park."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Rereading after many years.

Inspector Renko doggedly continues his investigation despite these agencies' interference.Martin Cruz Smith has created strong characters. Arkady Renko, son of an Russian general, is the Chief Police Inspector of the Moscow Town Prosecutor's office -- a post everyone agrees is beneath him. Irina Asanova is a film wardrobe assistant who would do anything to leave the Soviet Union. J. D. Osborne is an American multimillionaire decorated by the Soviets for World War II bravery.

Unfortunately, the ending cheapened the rest of the book for me."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I often return to \\"Gorky Park.\\" I almost didn't go there at all. The film was not very good, although I liked Joanna Pakula. One day I read \\"Polar Star\\" (literally in one day, since I could not put it down) and I was hooked: I had to read \\"Gorky Park.\\" Almost ten years later, I think I've read it ten times. I can always spare a day or two for one of my favorite books.Welcome to the world of Investigator Arkady Renko, whose superiors use him, whose wife doesn't love him, whose country is like an insane asylum where the patients have the run of the place and sane people like Renko do the best they can. This is a great mystery novel, but the level of Smith's writing puts him far above the level of what we expect from \\"genre\\" novels. His characters became real people for whose fate I really cared. His plot is complicated but not overwhelmingly so. He does not trick the reader. And his detective, the militia investigator Arkady Renko, is one of the most memorable detectives in fiction: smart without being pedantic, intelligent, patriotic (yes, our Arkady truly loves his country), loyal to his friends and the woman he falls in love with. This is not the picture of a perfect man, but that of a basically good man. Renko is believable in his feelings and attitudes, and that is due to Smith's talent. Also thanks to the author we get an almost Dickensian description of Moscow and the inner workings of criminal investigations in the old Soviet Union. I felt I was in Moscow, and I finished reading the book truly caring for the characters in it, particularly Renko. Smith's novel is powerful, well-written, engaging, insightful, and a lesson in how talented writing can be applied to genre fiction for the benefit of everyone involved. \\"Gorky Park\\" and the other Renko novels are so far above genre, they make the rest look really bad, and they provide hope for genre novels in general: talent should not be divorced from entertainment. Excellent read."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"It was unfortunate I saw the Hollywood version of &quot;Gorky Park&quot; before reading the novel. The film does not do justice to the main character or the storyline. It cannot compare to the book! After reading &quot;Polar Star&quot; and Red Square&quot;, the second and third installments of the series, I picked up the original and loved it. More recently, &quot;Havana Bay&quot; was published, and later this year a long-awaited fifth novel, &quot;Wolves Eat Dogs&quot;, will be released. Arkady Renko, the protagonist of the series, is an honest, dedicated, hard-working Ukrainian cop. When he was Chief Homicide Inspector for the Moscow Prosecutor's Office, he took charge of a grisly murder case involving the international fur trade. Very quickly, he fell afoul of the KGB. That's how his troubles began, which pursue him throughout all four novels. I recommend this series highly. The settings are supurbly drawn -- from snowbound Moscow to an Arctic Sea fish processing ship, from a steam-filled banya to the steamy port of Havana. Wherever he goes, Arkady brings his cynical love-hate relationship with the Soviet system which often impedes his work. Like Columbo, he outsmarts the sly evil-doers while seemingly fumbling his way along the investigation. And he has more lives than the proverbial cat as his sleuthing lands him in the most lethal stews! Author Martin Cruz Smith has created one of the most likable protagonists in police fiction. Cleverly writing the character as just &quot;Arkady&quot; -- intimately using his first name -- helps endear him to the reader. We care for Arkady because of his moral strengths, his humility and compassion, and despite his weaknesses. Along the way, Arkady has fallen obsessively in love with the most unsuitable woman imaginable: an obnoxious, abrasive dissident who not only treats him like dirt and breaks his heart, but is the cause of his political woes. It is hard to lament in the least her later demise! But we sympathize with our hero's suffering and rejoice in his small rewards. Reward yourself by reading this exceptional series, beginning with &quot;Gorky Park&quot;!"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Martin Cruz Smith's \\"Gorky Park\\" is a literary thriller, and is more notable for Smith's unique style and his gift for capturing the bizarre Soviet world than it is its conventional plot and resolution.\\"Gorky Park\\" is ostensibly a police procedural, where maverick investigator Arkady Renko is the \\"one good cop\\" in a corrupt justice system investigating the murders of three young people in Moscow. Of course, this being a thriller, Renko's investigation takes him high up the food chain, where he gets a chance to expose high corruption, nefarious deeds by officials, and the hypocrisy of the world he lives in. And, of course, he falls in love with a gorgeous woman along the way.Two things set \\"Gorky Park\\" apart from conventional thrillers you see in every airport bookstore. The first has to be Smith's command of daily life in the Soviet Union. Published in 1981 before the collapse of the Soviet Union, \\"Gorky Park\\" sweeps along with the rhythm of daily life under communism, and it's a disjointing, jarring rhythm indeed. Smith combines an eye for detail with what must have been eye-numbing research to transport the reader to another world that is completely alien to Americans. The novel starts out in Moscow and ends in New York, and it's interesting that Smith is so able to capture the jarring differences between the two cities.Smith's style also elevates \\"Gorky Park.\\" Too many thrillers use language in purely functional terms, and dialogue is invariably direct and serves the purpose of clearly advancing plot or building character. In \\"Gorky Park,\\" Smith is much more subtle than your average author. Many passages and lines require re-reading to figure out what is actually being said -- not that Smith writes badly, it's just that most of \\"Gorky Park\\" is heavily laden with subtext, and Smith also has the patience to let \\"Gorky Park\\" unfold gradually. While this may slow the novel down somewhat, it also makes the story deeper and richer.\\"Gorky Park\\" is not a pleasant novel, or a \\"fun read.\\" Arkady Renko is not one of those cops who throws off pitch-perfect quips, and he is not a physical juggernaut prone to kicking butt and taking names. Rather, he is the perfect investigator for the Soviet system - dogged, intelligent, and deeply cynical. It's that cynicism that lets Renko see his fellow Soviets for who they are, and this insight makes him a great detective.I admire \\"Gorky Park\\" more than I like it, which is why I give the novel only four stars. Renko, it must be said, is a bit of a downer. The novel opens with the dissolution of Renko's marriage, and Renko spends most of the novel in a morose funk (and not necessarily due to the divorce). Renko is a man who has been almost entirely crushed by the Soviet system and also by his family, and all that is left in his is a spark of his former self. It is that spark, that undying, implacable fire inside Renko that makes him such a compelling character. Dour, fatalistic, cyncial, pessimistic, to be sure, but very compelling."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I read \\"Stalin's Ghost\\" as my first Renko novel, and decided to go back to the headwaters with \\"Gorky Park\\", not having any knowledge of the movie, either. It is clear why GP launched a series that lives today, from one side of the breakup of the Soviet Union to the other. The contrast between the two novels when read close together is substantial, given how different Russia is today from the Soviet era. However, in many other ways, it's the same old scene, ripe for observations light and dark about Russians, corruption, politics, vodka and the dreary nature of everyday life.With all the years in between, the Renko of the latter novel remains true to the Renko who debuted in Gorky Park. He is intelligent and a shrewd investigator underestimated by his enemies and rivals, he loves Russia while cynical about its flaws, he eschews the political games, he is persistent and dedicated to his craft while surrounded by corruption and slackers, and he appreciates attractive, mysterious women. He sounds like my kind of guy. I agree with another reviewer that Renko compares well with Harry Bosch of Michael Connelly's collection.The story itself has an excellent plot. The bad guys are not that hard to decipher, yet Smith keeps everything moving and sufficiently obscure. The identification of the dead threesome seemed rather easy, as did the quickness with which Renko hooked up with the young Irina. Osborne and some other supporting characters are finely drawn, and Smith also captures some essence of NY City for the eyes of a new foreign visitor.One advantage of the age of the novel and its setting: Renko succeeds more-or-less the old fashioned way. This is not CSI with fancy technology doing the work. Renko's brain was the main device. I must say, though, that the dwarf's reconstruction of the deceased's head did have a bit of 21st-century CSI touch about it.4.5 stars, rounded up"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Most mystery writers today produce books that are like cotton candy: they're light, fluffy, give you a quick sugar high, and are ultimately unsatisfying in the long run. Unfortunately, most of these writers produce a book a year-whether they have anything new to say or not. Once in a great while, a mystery writer comes along whose work is so broad in scope as to resemble great literature. Martin Cruz Smith belongs to this elite group, and Gorky Park is one of the best mysteries ever written.Arkady Renko is Chief Investigator of Homicide for the city of Moscow before the fall of communism. While he has a 100% success rate in investigating homicides, his personal life is less than stellar. Renko is called in when three faceless, fingerless bodies are discovered in the snow at Gorky Park during a spring thaw. He is able to take what little evidence there is, and starts putting together the pieces of this complicated puzzle. The closer he gets to the truth, the more evident it is that someone (maybe the KGB or even someone in his own office) does not want him to solve this crime.But what makes Gorky Park so fascinating is the Russian angle. Solving crimes and investigative techniques are a bit different than in the United States (they tend to use a lot of vodka, for one thing). Not only does Arkady have the party bureaucracy to contend with, but the KGB is also looking over his shoulder. It is often hard to tell who are the bad guys. We also get a glimpse of what it was like to live in Soviet Russia. Professionals like Renko didn't get very high salaries, and living conditions were often spartan.But where Cruz Smith really excels is in his characters. Renko is probably one of the most memorable characters in any mystery. He is a very likable, sympathetic man with a kind heart. His humble, self-deprecating manner belies a brilliant mind, which he needs to fight not just criminals, but also the Soviet system. But Renko also carries a lot of baggage, and it sometimes interferes with his job.Cruz Smith's plot will keep you up nights, reading to find out what happens. Gorky Park is also filled with ironic wit. Renko never tries to take himself too seriously, and we learn that humor is the best way to survive in the Soviet Union. When one character tells Renko that he wants to kill him, Renko responds \\"this is Russia. Get in line.\\" The exchange between Renko and an FBI agent about defection will have you in stitches.If Gorky Park isn't the best mystery written today, it's certainly close to the top of the list."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I arrived at this novel indirectly, after having read 'Havana Bay' and 'Polar Star';#'s 4 & 2 respectively in the Arkady Renko series. There is also the 1983 film-noir, starring William Hurt as the protagonist Arkady. Semi surprisingly the author, Martin Cruz Smith, an american, reveals considerable knowledge of cold war Moscow. Research which took him eight years to complete this book. 'Polar Star' and 'Havana Bay' make better narrative sense if read in chronological order I found to my slightly humourous dismay. Fans of Major/then Colonel Pribluda will be pleased to know his character appears in both sequels."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"After reading HAVANA BAY, I went upstream to GORKY PARK. Both novels are so very good, even though the thriller/mystery component is not that compelling; it doesn't have to be. Gorky Park is smart and cerebral, like Arkady Renko. Every page is rich with great characters, great dialogue, good writing style and pace. It's about life, police work, corruption, greed, political influence and survival in the former USSR and reminds me of the great James Ellroy novels. Martin Cruz Smith also compares with John Le Carr&eacute;. Five star plus for Gorky Park and on to Polar Star."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Martin Smith created a story with all the right essentials for a super suspense filled mystery. There is romance, companionship, death (brutal mine you; faces mutilated, fingerprints removed), corruption and violence, betrayal and it all takes place in Russia. Then you combine the story with an author that can write a tale that is fresh and spellbinding then you have super novel. In my opinion this is still one of the best mystery novels out on the market today."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Gorky Park, the opening book in a (to date) quartet of novels concerning a brilliant, socially disaffected detective from Moscow, is as much a tale of late Soviet life as it is a mystery and thriller. This novel begins after three bodies--two men and a woman, all of them young--are discovered in a melting snowbank outside one of Moscow's most popular theme parks. The bodies have been strategically mutilated so as to prevent identification and, despite any indications of a struggle, all three victims were shot at point blank range with a high powered handgun. From there, not only is identification made in a rather more swift fashion than the calculating killer imagined possible, but a complex plot involving government corruption, political dissidents, and the smuggling of one of the Soviet Union's most valued resources, is exposed. An edge of your seat drama, a sociological case study in dreary Soviet life, and a fine delving into the universal themes of human psychology, all set against the deadly, gripping cold of a Moscow winter. A really great book that starts off a really great series!"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I'm not sure why I never read Martin Cruz Smith's Gorky Park earlier, but after nearly 30 years, I finally got around to it. It's a very good literary thriller, elevated by Smith's insight into life behind the Iron Curtain. It is this insight and unique backdrop that raises this novel above its otherwise conventional crime story.Investigator Renko is trying to solve the murder of three young people in Gorky Park but conducting an investigation in the Soviet Union isn't easy when the investigation leads places the political machinery doesn't want him to go. There are political pressures and jurisdiction issues that hamper the investigation and aspects of his personal life (his loveless failing marriage, his legendary father who has fallen out of favour with the Party, and his apparent disregard for advancement in the Party) only complicate matters. Needless to say Renko's investigation will lead him to expose corruption of superiors.This is an intelligent novel. There are layers to the dialogue where not everyone says what they mean and motives and ulterior motives are played out in a kind of deadly chess game. This is not necessarily light reading. There is no clever banter and the pace may be slower than some people like. Renko is stubborn, cynical, and morose (not necessarily qualities that fans of wise-cracking, butt-kicking, square-jawed action heroes are looking for) but I appreciated his flaws. Renko is a fully realized three-dimensional character.Gorky Park is regarded as a benchmark in the crime fiction genre and its unique insight (particularly in its day) of Soviet culture is fascinating. The crime elements in the novel are pretty standard fair, but the writing, characters, and setting elevate it to a higher level. 4 stars."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I was once a Russian speaker and junior Kremlinologist, but the closest I got to Moscow was Belgrad. Yet when I read this book, I felt I was there. I felt I could smell the place. I asked an old Moscow hand if it were that authentic and she said yes."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Gorky Park has action and three-dimensional characters. It's colorful and yet it has all the shades of gray. Not knowing anything about Russia, I found its evocation irresistable. Arkady is a human star -- he has faults and is very human, yet he's a star that nobody can defeat, not the KGB, not the FBI, nor any of the other assorted Russian or American baddies he encounters. Well, he does have woman troubles...."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Arkady Renko is the Chief Investigator for homicides in the city of Moscow when three bodies are discovered frozen in the ice of Gorky Park. In an American city, the investigation might or might not be difficult, but in the Soviet Union it is practically impossible. Seemingly everywhere Renko turns, he is interfered with, attacked, or ignored. The book paints a partial portrait of Moscow life and the nature of being an investigator in Soviet Russia and it's not a pretty picture.The pace of Gorky Park was very uneven. The first third of the book is dry and slow moving. Then the story hits a turning point and is quite compelling until it builds to a climax where Renko has confronted the murderer as well as a death trap aimed at both him and his girlfriend. Sadly, after this climax the book limps on for another 100 pages before building to a second, much less satisfying ending. The novel would have benefited immensely if the author had cut the story at the obvious ending point, with perhaps one chapter to wrap things up.All in all, this book was something of a disappointment but it does have its merits. I would only recommend it if you have the stomach for a bleak read, because this is not light-hearted fare. It also is peppered with sociological commentary condemning both America and the Soviet Union as corrupt. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but it isn't everyone's idea of a detective story either."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Gorky Park is a must read for anyone who enjoys a good thriller. It's well written and everything comes together perfectly at the end. Once you start down this road, you won't want to stop here but continue to the other books in the series which are equally enjoyable."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Gorky Park made me do something I've never done before: Go out and read every Martin Cruz Smith book with Arkady Renko. Gorky Park is still the best, but they're all good because Renko has breathed life into such a compelling character. Smith just hooked me like I've never been hooked before. They're well written and I'd put him in the ranks of Hammett's Contintental Op, another lost figure who finds redemption in the mysteries he is paid to solve. If it helps, I'd rank them in this order: #1, Gorky Park. #2, Red Square, #3 a tie between Havana Bay and Polar Star. Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"this novel introduces Arkady Renko, a Russian police investigator surrounded by the lies of the Soviet system, yearning only for the truth.From what may be the finest opening line in popular fiction to an ending that is completely unexpected....everyone should read this book"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"This very engrossing book is both an interesting detective story and an interesting insight into Soviet life in Moscow at a certain time in the near past. By setting what would otherwise be a traditional murder mystery (with some traditionally current grotesque elements) in Moscow, Martin Cruz Smith is able to introduce a host of fresh elements into a tired genre. The Russian hero has a whole different set of personal and professional concerns than would his New York counterpart, and the characters and situations encountered are likewise different, strange and interesting because new to this type of fiction. Finally, the basic plot - the nature of the murder and the crime's solving - are totally dependent on the Moscow setting.Great stuff. A real original and highly recommended for anyone wanting something different from the same old stuff."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"This book is somewhere in between three and four stars. First of all, the book's main weaknesses, in my opinion: the main character Arkady Renko is calm, collected and principled almost to the point of being dull. While it was obviously the author's intention to make him straight-laced, it does not help the book much to have such an unrealistic character. Likewise, the love scenes with Irina Asanova seem very strained and unrealistic. But the plot is fairly good and should keep you reading (even if it is a bit of a disappointment in the end). The character problems are not such a big issue in Polar Star and the plot (actually, two plots) and setting are even cooler. If I was going to read one of these books again, it would definitely be Polar Star."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I've always been a great fan of detective, spy and Cold War novels. This book brings out the best of all 3 worlds, but unlike so many American Cold War novels, Smith looks at the three dead bodies in Gorky Park and beyond (and out of Moscow to New York City) through the eyes of the main character--detective Arkardy Renko, a cynical Ukrainian who works hard at his job with honesty and with conviction in Moscow--and not some unkillable CIA hero. The story is filled with intrigue, cunning plot twists and wonderfully-crafted characters."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"i never read modern paperback novels, much less thrillers, yet arkady renko is an absolute favorite of mine, a very humane breed (extremely hard to find nowadays). the book is very intelligent and even darkly funny. as for the reviewer who speaks about the joy and prosperity of his own society as compared to the evil empire, i think he should 1) grow up 2) recall osborne is an american and 3) walk (not drive) to the next housing project with a couple of illegal workers from mexico, and ask them about their rights to joy and prosperity. of course, now you can see i am an idealistic misanthrope (that's why i love renko), but don't let that keep you from reading the book."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I agree with everyone else. An incredible book. I have read it 4 or 5 times over the years. One of those books like True Grit, Shogun, The Black Marble, and Lonesome Dove I can always return to for enjoyment. And yes, Polar Star and Red Square are excellent too! Cruz does an excellent job on &quot;Rose&quot; also, a &quot;period&quot; book. Good writer."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"The start of this book with the triple murder where the victims faces and fingerprints have been removed made for a very interesting and unusual start. I was grabbed instantly and pulled into the crime at Gorky Park in Moscow. But from there, sadly to say, it was all down hill. I lost interest the more I read. Keeping track of all the Russian names and places was tedious, but would have been a non issue had there been a plot and story that was at least somewhat interesting. But it wasn't, it was just plain dull. I failed to see why this book is so highly thought of. If this is the best murder mystery in the genre, then I guess I will be skipping this genre."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Clever and moral Arkady Renko, a Moscow police detective, must solve a gruesome triple homicide in Gorky Park, Moscow's version of New York's Central Park. The mutilated victims have had their faces and fingerprints removed, making identification problematic.Arkady wends his way through a minefield of political intrigue unique to Soviet Russia. This is what makes the well-crafted tale so fresh to American readers. Smith does an excellent job of exposing Russian culture to us. The detective must solve the murder while simultaneously living up to his famous father's reputation, and living through the KGB's vendetta for past accusations of corruption.Sable furs, nasty Americans, pretty Russian women, and betrayal at every turn. This book has it all. One of the best in the genre. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I had really high hopes for this novel. I actually enjoyed the film, though it was flawed. The reviews were universally popular too. Yet I found the novel slow, disjointed and rarely involving.The initial mystery of the bodies in Gorky Park is quickly solved and forgotten. In fact, the story is really not a thriller at all. The film is much tighter and thrilling even though the rather tedious and unbelievable sable story is similar.After the initial Gorky Park killings the film meanders without direction as it develops into a romance. The romantic plot is okay though never convincing. It also ends abruptly and in a less than convincing manner given the previous chapters.The story really falls apart towards the end as Renko is holed up in a country house outside Moscow before going to the US.Overall there are some excellent passages in the book, but it didn't live up to my expectations."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Warning: SPOILERS!!!!My husband is a Russian immigrant-he grew up in Ekateringburg, a city in the Ural Mountains, and he was very impressed with how accurately everyday life in Russia is portrayed in this book. I asked him about the scene where Renko's friend is happy with his broken washing machine, and he said that was true to life-that a Russian in that time would be happy with any new appliance whether it worked or not, because it was so hard to actually get anything. I thought about my time in Russia, and walking for blocks to buy milk, and then more blocks to buy cereal, and the American cop's comment about how there was no fresh meat in the stores. It's true-there wasn't much fresh food. All the little details of Russian life rang true.Aside from my own personal experience, this was a fascinating mystery. It's not so much a who-done-it as a why-would-they-have-done-it. The story revolves around Russian sables-an animal so rare it's hard to find pictures on the Internet, that produces fur so valuable it's literally worth its weight in gold. In these days of political correctness, when fur is frowned upon, it's a truly unique look at a world where a coat can cost one hundred thousand dollars and a man will skin murder victims just to acquire a few animals. There's also some pretty ferocious commentary on how our government works, and it doesn't seem like there's much to choose between the United States and Soviet Russia when it comes to high finance. This is the book that introduced me to Arkady Renko and his love-hate relationship with Russia, and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a different kind of detective story."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"This is hands down his best book. You cannot beat this through out any of his other books. I am a Martin Cruz Smith fan as I have read most of his books and I still continue to re-read this book."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"An intricate and profoundly sad murder mystery that rises above genre conventions to be a literate story and great character study as well as a fascinatingly detailed look at the repressive Brezhnev years in the Soviet Union.Arkady Renko is a thirtyish, down-trodden investigator who is burdened with a triple-homicide that no one seems to want him to solve: three murder victims, missing their faces and fingerprints, are dumped in the middle of the popular Gorky Park in Moscow. Renko, while enduring the dissolution of his marriage to a selfish woman, tries to prove an international link so that the KGB will take the case off his hands.By the time he actually can prove this, he wants to solve the case and has fallen in love with mysterious Irina, a dissident who seems implicated somehow. Unforgettable."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I first read this while the cold war was still going. It is a fascinating insight into Russian culture and Arkady Renko is a marvelous character.

He believed her. The truth had gone from her into the tree and into him.&quot; This is the quality of writing that we get from Martin Cruz Smith. His facility with language balances with his storycraft to produce a compelling, dramatic espionage thriller that stands against the best work of Le Carre or Fredrick Forsyth."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"It's Arkady Renko at odds with power, corruption and intrigue. Martin Cruz Smith hit the nail on the head with this story. Not just your typical spy-crime thriller, Gorky Park delves into the heart and mind of what it meant to be a Russian approaching the era of new capitolism.Renko, investigating a grisly triple murder in the heart of Moscow's famous Gorky Park, is certain he has stumbled into the work of the KGB. He is the prototypical man of principle awash in a compromising world, where the rules change daily, power and influence corrupt on both sides of the Atlantic, and pargons of virtue pose a threat to all.I guarantee that you will love this book and quickly continue on with the following three sequels."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"This is one terrific book.

I figured it would a Detective novel with ranks locations & name Russified & was pleased to find that is was a detective novel but it felt Russian. The novel was beautifully written & filled with character that had entire personalities & motivations. Gorky park was an odd in the sense that throughout the novel I came to sympathise with some characters but never completely. The Soviet factor was too strong. I could smell the cheap tobacco & taste the Vodka but not hear the rumble of the Soviet Moskovich as it slowly made its way to Gorky."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I have rarely wanted to award more than 5 stars for a book, but if any work of art merits such acclaim, then \\"Gorky Park\\" certainly does. Please read this book to learn what excellent writing is all about: realistic and tragically heroic characters; minute details about the Soviet Union, its people, philosophies, dry humor and ways of coping; a plot that unravels like a Russian matryoshka doll; and excitement up to the very last pages.This is my first Martin Cruz Smith Arkady Renko novel - I hope to read them all.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"A detailed, well-written murder mystery set in Russia less than a decade before the fall of the Soviet Union. Murder investigator Arkady Renko is called upon to solve the murder of three faceless victims found in Gorky Park, and along the way he battles people trying to stop the case from being solved, a wife looking for divorce, a bewitching Siberian girl, an American policeman looking for a murderer, and an American salesman somehow involved in the three deaths. Cruz Smith did a good job in describing the Russian people, and he depicts an interesting picture of the Soviet Union that is reminiscent of Orwell's \\"1984\\".Two small issues I had with the story was that I didn't fully understand the prosecutor's reasonings for the conspiracy that unraveled, and I thought the love relationship between Arkady and Irina was rather shallow. Still the story is enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"The cassettes were in good condition, which is a real help for me and my old car. The story is fascinating for a couple different reasons. It's a mystery/thriller starting out with lots of gore in the park and continues with lots of plot twists and turns. Secondy, it's set in the last days of the old Soviet Union. I've only been to the USSR once, but the corruption nad double-tripple-quadrupale standard the story describes coincides with my limited knowledge of what it was really like. I sometimes had a problem keeping up with the plot twists and the names."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Martin Cruz Smith's GORKY PARK is the height of pulp fiction during the early 1980s. It combines page turning with a detailed look at Russia's disfunctional society in the 70s. Smith has the ability to describe the ugliness, decadence, and despeartion of a country and a people that has lost all hope. Where there is no eschatology, the harshness of life strips all brightness from life, even the blood as Smith describes it, appears colorless. Arkady Renko fights through that meaningless. Meaning to him is solving the crime, even if that means the loss of all personal privilege."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Sometimes when one picks up a book of this genre the cliches and nuances become almost nauseating; \\"Gorky Park,\\" however, graciously avoids these labels. Russian-themed and well-researched without having to remind the reader every few lines that the author knows one or two words/phrases in Russian. I highly recommend this work. Yes, it is a fluff read, but it is on the more intellectually stimulating side of that category!"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I love to read almost anything pertaining to Russia. This book was fantastic! I have visited Moscow and places and activities mentioned were quite accurate. Especially the KGB running the tour buses and hidden microphones/cameras in hotel rooms and other places frequented by visitors. Get it....Read it....now!"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Arkady Renko is an investigator for the militia in Moscow during d&eacute;tente when three bodies are found in the snow in Gorky Park. He knows their murders were not the usual crimes of passion because their fingertips and their faces have been removed. There are two men, both shot through the heart and the head, and a woman with a bullet through her heart. His investigation reveals no missing persons, and Arkady is certain the KGB will step in and take over the case when he finds reason to suspect one of their agents. When he is kept on the case, Arkady finds himself going from merely making a show of investigating to putting everything on the line to solve it while he uncovers a web of greed and murder at the heart of a Russian national treasure.This is basically a police procedural, a noir story with the typical down-on-his-luck cop with a stalled career and a failing marriage. What sets it apart is Russia. Winston Churchill's quote about Russia being a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma is brought to life very well on these pages. Without passing judgment, the book acerbically shows the ironies of life in communist Russia, run by an apparent people-eating machine always hungry for new victims, and often turning on itself. Arkady Renko himself believes in socialist principles but is not a Party man, refusing to suck up to the powers that be in order to climb the ladder. The story takes an interesting turn when he teams up with an American cop, and the book keeps going for awhile after the actual mystery is solved, showing more insights into the Russian political machine.Though the author's style of plunging into a scene with no introduction took a little getting used to, the book grabbed my interest fairly quickly, and it wasn't long before I was ignoring the rest of my life so I could read. Visiting Moscow in the \`80s also brought on a lot of nostalgia, as the threat of the USSR was always looming back then. The mystery was pretty first-rate, too. I will definitely read this author again."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Arkady Renko is introduced in this book as a Moscow investigator. There is a bizarre triple murder in Moscow.

He is heading through dangerous territory in his investigation, confronting the KGB, FBI and other authorities to find the truth."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Not bad for a police procedural.

As he probes deeper, he bumps into the KGB, a wealthy American fur trader, and a high-level conspiracy dating back to World War II. Cruz Smith spent eight years writing the text, and it shows. The eye for detail, the Moscow street scenes, the historical research and the multi-layered characters all feel first-hand and urgent. That &quot;Gorky Park&quot; is a cut above other espionage/thriller novels made it a best-seller when it came out and a decent film with William Hurt."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Many writers today find a successful formula and stick to it... over and over. The only thing the same from Martin Cruz Smith's works are their high level of excitement, interesting characters and plot development. Gorky Park is Smith's BEST work to date. What he does best is gives the reader an insiders' view of a society totally different than what the audience is used to. And introduces his characters to his readers as if we had been their friends (or enemies) for years.Whether it be Los Alamos during the development of Man's deadliest weapon in Stallion Gate, Cuba in Havana Bay, Japan in December 4th: A Novel, or Moscow in Gorky Park, with his characters on the verge of an exciting adventure for the reader to be a part of.I enjoy Smith's books. Gorky Park is THE mystery novel I judge all other mysteries and mystery writers by. Some mysteries I consume like potato chips or pretzels. Very, VERY few do I savor each page as I did Gorky Park!John Row"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"When GORKY PARK was published in 1981, the Soviet Union was still going on strong. Now with the passage of time the USSR is nothing but a distant memory and the former republics are fighting hard to keep their independence. Reading Martin Cruz Smith's novel now gives a unique perspective to life in this foreign land.We are introduced to Russian Homicide Detective Arkady Renko who is investigating a triple homicide in Gorky Park. All of the victims were shot and they were intentionally disfigured in order to prevent identification. The only clue left on the scene were a pair of ice skates worn by one of the victims that belonged to actress Irina Asanova. Renko must deal with petty bureaucrats, crooked politicians, the KGB as well as his own personal problems with his own wife.Irina knows more than she is telling the detective. Renko is smitten with her and he is not confident about his feelings. The other major player in this novel is an American furrier named John Osbourne. This businessman has strong connections with Soviet officials and it is believed that he is also a KGB informant. Several Russian officials are protecting him but Renko is not to be dissuaded. He will do what he needs to do in order to get to the bottom of this mystery.Cruz's work is very powerful and strong in character development. Each one of the three major characters has a story to tell and the author does a great job in developing each one. It is a story of heartbreak and broken dreams and definitely one of the best novels ever written about Russia."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"This is the book that got me started on MCS...and he has yet to disappoint...Renko is a hero we can admire...often down for the count but never out! ...unwilling to compromise his basic human decency while wryly observing the strictures,foibles and brutality of soviet society"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"A key problem with genre fiction is its demands for pacing, fast action, and formulaic convention often hamper an author's attempt at distinctive writing. Many successful genre writers solve this issue by writing as blandly as possible. \\"Gorky Park\\" shows that genre writing can be as great as an author is willing to make it.Like any good police procedural, the story opens at the scene of the crime, the park of the title, in the heart of then-Soviet Moscow, circa 1977. Three bodies lie uncovered by melting snow, their faces and fingers sheared off. Police detective Arkady Renko takes the case fully conscious these are probably \\"enemies of the state\\" executed by the KGB, and that he will be pulled from the case as soon as he threatens any progress. Just to get the early reprieve, he works the case hard. Then two things strange happen. First, his boss tells him to keep at his investigation and never mind the KGB. Second, he begins to really care about solving it.When \\"Gorky Park\\" came out in 1981, it was a huge bestseller and critical fave. Much of this I think had to do with the novelty of the setting, the Soviet Union. Author Martin Cruz Smith fills his pages with a Mother Russia so bleak and real you can feel the cheap vodka curdling your guts, and this offered a unique peak at America's chief globo-political adversary at the time.The first time I read \\"Gorky Park\\", I was still in high school. Reading it as a genre detective story, I found it downbeat and hard to follow. Picking it up again was a triumph for hope over experience. I was blown away by the result.Smith's descriptive mastery of place and character was even better than I remembered. But more powerful still for me was how good this book really was, both as a sophisticated fiction of deep and convoluted feelings and as a really clever mystery thriller that, for a minimum of reader effort, engages you on so many levels.There's Renko himself, whose ambiguous feelings regarding the order he protects allows Smith not only to explore heady philosophical questions but keep you guessing as to what is going to hit him next. There are wide conspiracies, shifting enemies, and corruptions big and small. There's the enigma of a woman at the heart of the case whose prefers being told lies \\"if the truth is you'll never escape\\".And then there's John Osborne, Renko's apparent opposite number as the story develops, an American who seems comfortable straddling the worlds of capitalism and communism. \\"If money could grow bones and flesh it would be Osborne,\\" Smith writes. \\"It would wear the same cashmere suit; it would part its silver hair the same way; it would have the same lean mask with its expression of superior amusement.\\"There's even humor to be found here, though it took me a second reading to find it as it is written in the same snow-gray manner as the rest of the book. The matter of Renko's wife is a kind of heavy comic underscoring of the central storyline, especially as she pushes her heartless \\"Young Pioneer\\" manner against him as an act of State devotion. Everything about the Soviet Union seems to conspire against Renko, which makes his sense of lingering attachment to country more compelling.I'm not the least attached or nostalgic for the USSR, even in Beatles songs. But \\"Gorky Park\\" pushes past my biases and makes me care about one man's ability to hold that faith, not to mention keep turning pages through some of the hardest-to-remember proper nouns I've come across since Dostoyevsky. Its setting may be gone with the times, but the pull of \\"Gorky Park\\" is timeless."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"A friend highly recommended this book to me, which is perhaps why I was a little disappointed, as I had very high hopes when picking up this book. While I did end up enjoying the story when I put the book down, it was not a favorite of mine, nor did it compel me to pick up any more of Smith's books.The reading was slow going for me for at least half of the book. While, I normally throughly enjoy investigative, suspenseful type stories, this one didn't grab onto me quickly. However, about halfway through it seemed to pick up, or perhaps I became accustom to the writing style or Arkady character. Simply put, the plot kept me reading, because I did begin to care enough to see what would happen at the end. I was glad that I did, I did start to enjoy the characters and story a bit more, and I was happy with the ending. In addition, the book does not lack mystery and suspense.Overall, not a bad read, but not an author that I'd pick up again. Just not my type, I don't think."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Martin Cruz Smith is a former journalist and magazine editor. \\"Gorky Park\\" is his first novel to feature Arkady Renko, was first published in 1981 and is largely set in the Moscow before the collapse of the USSR. Renko, the hero, works as the Chief Homicide Investigator for Moscow's militia - unlike the KGB, who deal with matters if 'State interest', the militia are more or less the standard police force. Renko, therefore, deals with the 'everyday' murders. Displaying one unfortunate trait for a homicide investigator, however, he has a distinct aversion to corpses - though he has a 100% success rate in clearing cases. Unhappily married and somewhat cynical, he's not quite as active a Party member as his wife would like him to be - something that has also had a negative effect on his career. He also appears to be something of a disappointment to his father, a very famous retired General. Renko's boss, Prosecutor Iamskoy, seems to have a certain amount of affection for him though - the Prosecutor actually won an appeal for a worker wrongly convicted of murder thanks to Renko's work.The book opens in Gorky Park, first park of the Revolution and favoured above all others. Three corpses have been found buried in the snow and, as a result, have been very well preserved. This means that, initially, the time of death can only be estimated as sometime that winter. All three victims - three men and a woman - were all shot through the heart, with the two men also having been shot through the head. The killer, clearly an expert marksman, also has access to a weapon Muscovites cannot typically lay their hands on. No papers could be found on the bodies, which have also been mutilated - the fingerprints and flesh on the faces has been removed, making a quick identification unlikely. One early lead, however, comes from the ice-skates the victims were wearing...One of the other detectives assigned to the case, Pasha Pavlovich, had worked with Renko previously. Then, three corpses were found at the Kliazma River in remarkably similar circumstances to the Gorky Park killings. The pair immediately suspect the same individual is responsible in this case. However, as the chief suspect at the Kliazma River was a KGB Major called Pribluda, the pair promptly lost that case to the KGB. As Pribluda - who'd actually taken over the Kliazma River case - makes an early appearance at the scene in Gorky Park and interferes with the corpses, Arkady and Pasha expect the KGB to again quickly snatch this case from them. (Pribluda will, of course, be kept right up-to-date : a third detective assigned to the case, Fet, is a known KGB informant). In fact, as the cases progresses, even Renko thinks it looks more and more like a KGB case...though he suspects they would have little desire to \`solve' it.Overall, a very good book and well worth reading - for me, it would comfortably rest in the top tier of the murder-mystery genre. Renko is a very likeable character and, probably because of his \`flaws', is very easy to relate with. Recommended."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Now that's what I call a novel.Gorky Park has the plot and trappings of a modern thriller, but the ennui and character depth of a classic. That Smith has been able to bring these two styles of writing into perfect harmony speaks of his status as a modern master.Gorky Park follows a murder investigation conducted by Arkady Renko, a Moscow homicide investigator whose unremarkable exterior hides a steel core of resolve that drives him to the point of ruin, again and again.Arkady is the soul mate of Hieronymous Bosch, the LAPD homicide investigator who is featured in the popular Michael Connely series. Fans of either author should automatically pick up the other; each series has the same appeal of a bone-weary old-school investigator who will stop at nothing to close his case, even if it means career (or actual) suicide.Arkady is a fascinating character, full of sadness and mystery. Smith has many strengths, and number one on the list is imbuing his characters with a depth and realism that make us care about them intensely. Number two is evoking the peculiar atmosphere of Russian nationalism, at a time when even the diehard communists are starting to look over their shoulder at the advancing wave of global capitalism. Smith's third strength is dialogue; every sentence that Arkady utters is an iceberg, with volumes of hidden meaning submerged beneath the words.These elements are sometimes portrayed bleakly, but there is also a sense of joy in these books. We admire Arkady, and laugh along with him at a world that doesn't always make sense. He is kind of like a nationalistic superhero, with a fierce Russian pride that extends to the Russian people, but not to the government. There is real pleasure to be had in watching Arkady do his job, his way.The plot is a somewhat standard modern thriller, with a series of murders linked to a wealthy American fur trader. Anyone who likes crime procedure novels will enjoy seeing Arkady blend old school techniques with the sometimes woefully inadequate modern equipment at his disposal.If you enjoy modern novels, but always feel a little guilty when reading them, I urge you to pick up this book. The pleasures are all there, but this book also has something to say about the human spirit, and you will be the better for having read it."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"i never read modern novels, much less thrillers, yet arkady renko is an absolute favourite of mine, very humane breed (extremely hard to find nowadays). the book is very intelligent and even darkly funny. as for the reviewer who speaks about the joy and prosperity of his own society as compared to the evil empire, i think he should 1)grow up 2)recall osborn is an american and 3)walk (not drive) to the next housing project with a couple of illegal workers from central america, and ask them about their rights to joy and prosperity. of course, now you can see i am an idealistic misanthrope (that's why i love renko), but don't let that keep you from reading the book."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I'm an old fan of Arkady Renko and just went back and read it again. Since I am not a sophisticated reviewer, as are so many here, I will simply say that Smith really has a handle on the Russia of recent years and does a smooth job of telling a story. He makes you feel you are almost there. Good relaxing reading. Have read ALL of M.C.Smiths work and most of it is very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Gorky Park leads the reader through an engaging encounter with characters that fascinate and a culture that is surprising, exotic and drawn with admirable craftsmanship. Martin Cruz Smith clearly respects the Russian people and consistently treats the culture with love and irony. It is always a pleasure to regard the worlds Martin Cruz Smith creates and the intelligence and core decency of his unique hero Arkady Renko.Smith is a worthy peer of the most literate and imaginative authors in the detective/investigator genre. You'll not go wrong spending time with Smith and Renko."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Having visited Gorky Park in 1996 I was interested in the novel set there.

I did like it enough that I read the next two in the series, and I have to say that I adore the main character, Arkady Renko. He's just a wonderfully wry and complex protaganist. I also find it amazing how the author is able to portray life in Russia during different time periods. I do highly recommend these books--but if you find yourself slogging through Gorky Park a bit, keep going!"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Three corpses are found in Gorky Park, a murder investigation begins and we are introduced to Arkady Renko. It gets engagingly slow as you are further introduced to a beautifully imagined world that the author never visited. Halfway into the novel if the author decided to dump the plot and write Renko's biography, you'd still be likely to have read on. The Bonus is that the plot never disappoints."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I understand how this book must have caused one heck of a stir when it was first released. Sure, it talks about the rot that permeated the USSR, but what it really does is provide a window into one of the most closed societies in recent history via an authentic and strangely sympathetic character. Arkady Renko is a survivor and his story isn't the most pleasant one, but he refused to play the games swirling around him and concentrated on the murders that opened the book, making him the kind of stand-up person that's compelling to read about regardless of his being Soviet or not. I can't wait to find the other books in this series."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I find it extremely hard to spend time reading badly-written work; that is why I read so few thrillers. I can't remember any more why I picked op Gorky Park. It wasn't the film - I saw that later (it is good - and a fair reflection of parts of the book). My original paperback copy has hundreds of underlined passages - the writing is brilliant; understated, subtle and very satisfying. It's on my shelf with other novels of the same quality. Like Marquez.Start with the first sentence, \\"All nights should be so dark, all winters so warm, all headlights so dazzling.\\"Here are some random short selections (there are wonderful longer passages too), \\". . . the academician suffered from a resemblance to Khrushchev.\\"; \\"Rubles are paper, see, and vodka is cash.\\"; \\". . . trees emerged into the dawn as wary as deer.\\" \\"The washwoman's head mimicked the rotation of her hand.\\" \\"[They] watched [him] with great curiosity, as if he might drink with his nose.\\"And I haven't even included my favourite (top of p. 120; Pan paperback; 1982).

Most of the students in my group choosed not to read this book, because of its reputation which was rather ambivalent. I decided not to give it up before I had given it a try, and I do not regret a moment... I have to admit that my frustration (but indeed my admiration too) grew during the reading. The theme is a complexe one, but the author has taken his therorethical fundation seriously. As a book most theoretically influenced by Michel Foucault and Friedrich Nietzsche, takes theese two philosophers out of the abstract theroretical discourse and add to it the empirically based reality of Northern Ireland. The manner in which this has been done is elequant; the mixing between the oral histories told by the informants together with the analytical parts in between.

Basically, we say \\"Read the Book of Mormon, pray over what you have read, and then be honest with the answer you receive.\\" (Book of Mormon, p. 529-530; Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson, p. 61-62) And this is how it should be. Truth should be so easy that a child should understand it; and when you bring in lawyers and doctors and philosophers and whatnot to \\"help\\" and \\"clarify,\\" you are in trouble.This debate between Elder B. H. Roberts (the presidency of the Quorum of Seventy Apostles, i.e. a general world leader) with the Rev. Van der Donckt is therefore unusual, and this singularity is what makes this book fascinating reading.Chapter One is a straightforward elaboration of what the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes about God the Eternal Father, his Son Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost. Chapter two contains a reply from the Rev. Van der Donckt to Elder Robert's teachings. The rejoinder not only constitutes a Catholic reply, but also serves as a response embracing the quote-unquote \\"traditional Christianity,\\" inasmuch as both Protestants and Catholics (generally) subscribe to the same creeds-Nicean and Athanasian.Chapter Three is Elder Robert's rejoinder to the Rev. Van der Donckt reply, and it is in this rejoinder you see the strength of the Church of Jesus Christ's position. For example, the creeds hold that God is unchanging, but Elder Robert's points out that Christ is God, and the Reverend's position is that God is unchanging. But Christ started out as spirit, was then born (incarnated), then was crucified, and then resurrected. So he gained, lost, and regains this body, and isn't that a change?

Smith, Brigham Young and LDS apostle Orson Pratt, plus a chapter comparing religious traditions vis-&agrave;-vis Jesus Christ.The Prophet Joseph Smith said, \\"By proving contraries, truth is manifest.\\" (History of the Church 6:428) This debate proves that, and this book would be useful for review and pondering for Saints and the curious anywhere.The type is readable, being a facsimile edition of the original book. They did a good copy of the text, and kept the same pagination so you can compare with earlier editions.

Chaos ensues with hollerin', fussin' and cussin' when Possum's knockin' disrupts Granny's knittin', Ma's cookin', Pa's fixin', Dawg's a twitchin' and a scratchin' and Pappy's whittlin'. When the whole family stops their activities and quietly opens the door to see who is knocking, wily Possum sneaks off. The Southern dialect brings this knee-slapping, rhythmic, chanting story to life. George Booth's creative illustrations of the family, their pets and the top-hatted Possum add more facets to this tale with his hilarious visual gags. This funny, quirky story will quickly become a favorite of the whole family. Nancy Van Laan's toe-tapping tale with its rich vernacular is often incorporated into primary classroom instruction in music for its rhythm and also in Language Arts instruction as an example in dialects. Possum Come a-Knockin' is a 1990 Parents' Choice Award Winner.BIBLIO: 1992, A Dragonfly Book Published by Alfred A.

Possum come a-knockin' at the door.\\" This possum. By simply knockin' manages to send the whole house into uproar.This is a great book to read out loud because the words have a natural rhythm and the story sounds much better read out loud because of it. The story flows wonderfully; it has to the way it was written.The illustrations are also very good. They do an excellent job of capturing the emotions- the devilish smile on the possum's face, the frustration of the narrator, and the bewilderment of the rest of the family.For all its many wonderful characteristics, the way this book reads is what makes it so special and unique.Loggie-log-log-log"},{"Title":"Possum Come A-Knockin' (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I do not read poetry to my children.

Some of it we really would love to have framed.The images are suitable for anyone to look at, with only a few being tantalizing or vaguely... scintillating.

This book by Prose and Simic explores the spectrum of possibilities in this wide range of meanings. This is, though, photographic ART. Those who think that art should be readily pleasurable, appreciated, or liked may find themselves challenged by this format. If you feel that art should be challenging, you may find this book appealing. On viewing it one may be stimulated by novel and sometimes not necessarily pleasurable thoughts. This seems to contradict the implication in the title that there is something necessarily \`titillating&quot; here. (Certainly the concept seems to stretch more common notion what is exciting, nasty and fun). For that I would deduct two stars."},{"Title":"The Valkyrie Operation","review":"Author Wensley Clarkson does a commendable job in uncovering the tragic murder of a British agent who got too close to the ruthless world of international arms dealers. The book goes behind the news stories, and provides a keen insight to what really goes on in the world of espionage and counter-intelligence. It's also a who-done-it mystery that keeps the reader guessing until the very end. Clarkson's work is enhanced by its focus on the human tragedy of two loving parents forced to deal with the loss of an only child, and their stuggle to see justice done. Anyone with an interest in this subject area will love it. &quot;The Valkyrie Operation&quot; is an absolute must-read for British citizens who want a taste of how the secret-side of their government operates."},{"Title":"The Valkyrie Operation","review":"This book is NOT about the German Valkyrie operation, but about international arms deals of the 1980's that culminated in 1990 in Chile.

That's all well and good - were it not for the book's title. Tis NOT a book about poetry (as the editor acknowledges on page 1). Nor is its scope well described as &quot;Renaissance&quot; [ In fact its collection &quot;was intended to clafiry why the conventional image of the 'Renaissance' in England has LOST ITS EXPLANATORY VALUE for many scholars&quot; (also on page 1) (emphasis added).]The ten papers ARE important reading in literary criticism, including Alpers, Greenblatt, Patricia Parker, Nancy Vickers, Ferguson, and Richard Halpern - valuable for a student's study and repeated reference. But more extensive collections are available for much less money than Longman wants.In fact, I would regard the best value in this present volume's form to be the one original piece - the 20-page introduction by Malcolmson - whose summary of the chapters is a fine aid to the literary student. Observing the clarity of her writing and the even-handedness of her summaries, I would hope she will participate in a future full-volume survey of the field by some publisher.Other than for the fine introduction, I suggest you get the book (inexpensive used copies seem readily available) only if this PARTICULAR reprint collection meets your needs:CONTENTS:PART I: The Bower of Bliss: Formalism, New Historicism, Feminism.1.

However, my much anticipated copy of Richter 858 arrived in the mail today, and to say that it didn't disappoint is an understatement. I had initially been a little wary about getting it. It comes with an aluminum slipcase and poetry and an audio CD with music composed by the brilliant Bill Frisell, and while some might find this sort of presentation lush, I, being somewhat of a purist, was afraid these inclusions would be nothing more than bells and whistles-basically a lot of noise to give voice to a suite of paintings that, according to any good Kantian, should be able to stand on its own. Boy was I wrong. People who know me know that I don't like fuss, but even the worry about scratching the aluminum slipcase, or maneuvering the book's awkward size and bulk, or the guilt for not using gloves to turn these impeccably produced pages, couldn't dampen the sheer transport I felt as I drunk in art and text and Bill's passionate and daring compositions with equal abandon. I've been reluctant to embrace anything multimedia, but Richter 858 may have just pushed me into the 21st century."},{"Title":"Richter 858","review":"You don't have to be an afficionado of contemporary poetry, or an art lover, to appreciate the many delights housed within the aluminum slip case of this work. But if you happen to be either, or both, this book is a must.The &quot;book&quot; has, in this case, evolved well beyond the concept of an art tome. The joining of music, poetry and lovingly accurate reproductions under one cover makes the circumnavigation of this opus is a particularly rich eexperience. Which is not to say that listening to the music , or dipping into one poem, is not an entirely satisfying moment by itself.Be prepared, however: this gesamtwerk is big, and will not fit into an ordinary bookcase! The paintings being reproduced to scale has dictated the extra large format, but the extraordinarily accurate pictorial results are worth the extra weight."},{"Title":"Richter 858","review":"I've only recently become acquainted with the range of Gerhard Richter's work, but the series of eight abstract paintings which are being celebrated here are enough to justify his reputation for me, and the sheer richness and resolution of their presentation in this book is of a standard I've never come across anywhere. Elegant, sensuous and gorgeous, this is more than a \`typical' art book in manners large and small; includes insightful essays by writers like Dave Hickey, poetry, and a CD by Bill Frisell with a string trio that's a lot more quirky and edgy than his recent stuff, in a good way (no banjos). The book's editor, David Breskin, has done an amazing job - the aluminum slipcase is a pretty sharp touch, too."},{"Title":"Richter 858","review":"This is a gorgeous book by a man who in the future will be credited with debunking all the art critics who since the 1950s have been shouting to themselves that Realism is dead, or the ones that still shout &quot;painting is dead.&quot; Gerhard Richter breaks all the rules of &quot;being an artist.&quot; He has worked in a variety of styles, refusing to produce a &quot;style&quot; as often artists are supposed to do. In his ealy photorealistic -paintings Richter copied ordinary, found images onto canvas, but gave them an indistinct appearance. Again, by working directly from photographs, he manages to debunk all the criticism that such techniques often bring. This subversive realism is now more evident than ever, in these later, almost fuzzy works that still manage to knock the visual senses as if shouting: &quot;Long Live Painting - Long Live Realism!&quot;"},{"Title":"Secrets of Solo Racing","review":"The author briefly and concisely covers every aspect of racing in general and solo in particular: the friction circle, correct line in turns, late apexes weight distribution and suspension compression in turns, acceleration and braking, optimizing the slip angle, left foot braking, trail braking, heel-and-toe with double declutch, and so on.How to prepare yourself and your car for solo racing, as well as the basic rules, are covered here.Hand position on the steering wheel here is explained better than in most books on competition driving. The author has devoted 9 pages to it, and exposed the \\"Shifty-Hand\\" and \\"Zaccone\\" methods.The author writes that on higher-speed slaloms (series of pylons set in a line), you may need to be lifting the throttle or tapping brakes bit to get the car to do what you want it to do. I fully agree with the author. Someone can argue that constant throttle application is better to not upset the car. Throttle lift during slaloms is tricky to coordinate and will require practice to become expert. When you've found the limit with constant throttle application and cannot go faster, the throttle lift will give some additional mphs. For example, for a straight line of pylons at the distance of 25m (82 ft) the maximum speed of a FWD stock 1500 kg (3306 lb) car with constant throttle application is about 65 km/h (40 mph) and is around 80 km/h (49 mph) when using throttle lift. That's a big difference. When the car is at its speed limit, with constant throttle application, the front wheels tend to scrub, the car tends to understeer. With throttle lift, the rear wheels are sliding all the way around the slalom, but the grip of the front wheels are perfect, they always point to the direction of travel, that is what we need, the car overseers here, but it is OK.Another important advise that the author gave is to hit the apexes. \\"Even if you are sure that the car will not go to the apex, turn in and hit the apex\\".This is a very good book. It has a glossary, a bibliography and an index.I would also recommend \\"The Front-Wheel Driving High Performance Advantage\\" by Jack Doo, Carroll Shelby in addition to this book."},{"Title":"Secrets of Solo Racing","review":"I have just begun autocrossing this year. A fellow autcrosser reccemended this book. I was very pleased with the information. There are many diagrams to explain concepts and ideas. I was able to drop 1 second off my time in under a month. The only thing that I didn't like was that I drive a FWD vehicle. There was a very limited amount of information on these vehicles. But the few things that where there were very helpful. I applied the phyics to my driving, just not the chassis set-up advice. Otherwise a great book."},{"Title":"Secrets of Solo Racing","review":"First, let me say that I am an accomplished race car driver, with several national championship road racing wins. My own driving style is smooth and efficient, with no wasted motion, and an emphasis on looking and thinking ahead.Hank Watts' &quot;Secrets of Solo Racing&quot; is the first book that I've ever seen that teaches the style of driving that has made me a successful racer. Like the driving style, the prose is smooth and efficient, with no wasted words. It is simple and clear, and best of all, it can make you a better driver.

This book should be required reading for anyone who wants to drive fast."},{"Title":"Secrets of Solo Racing","review":"I've been competing in time trial events for about a year now, and bought this book to improve my driving. I found the information on how to drive faster extremely useful, and several ideas were introduced to me that I had not thought of before. The chapter on evaluating the course as a whole was also very useful and taught me how to evaluate a track - to know which sections are the most crucial. The discussion of suspension and car setup is good, but another reference will probably be needed for the serious chassis tuner.I gave the book 4 stars because there are several chapters devoted to the process of autocrossing and time trialing (e.g. signing in, scutineering, etc) which I found less useful as it is something one picks up at your very first event anyway."},{"Title":"Secrets of Solo Racing","review":"Although the book deals with both autocross and time trails, my experience is solely with autocrossing. For a beginner in this sport (like myself), I find it useful to re-read this book regularly. Initially, I focused on just getting around the course.

Definitely a valuable resource, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Secrets of Solo Racing","review":"Great book, I just wish they would have had a diagram of a full course and how to run it.

I cannot imagine a motorsports library for a 'driver' that does not have this book. The focus on safety and preparation is particularly notable, and important. It may have been written more than 20 years ago, but as the laws of physics have not changed, neither has the value of the perspectives and insights in this book diminished. Once you have learned what is presented in this book you will be well positioned to enjoy high performance driving, competitive autocross or time trials, or move into wheel to wheel racing events should that be your desire."},{"Title":"Secrets of Solo Racing","review":"I wish I would have read this book before my first Autocross. Would have saved me a lot of confusion at the beginning of the season. Not only does the writer define and examine solo driving skills but he also gives great insight to the operational procedures at the course.

He told me that this is the best book he's ever read on the sport and that it provides extremely practical and useful advice.There are not many books for autocross racers on the market but the valuable tips in this book make up for that. I would say that if someone who is already successful on the amateur autocross racing circuit feels the book is helpful, it is a good buy(and trust me, this guy is not easily impressed!)."},{"Title":"Secrets of Solo Racing","review":"When I first started out autocrossing and doing high performance driving events (HPDEs), I read this book and found the driving techniques discussed to be very helpful and written in a manner I could understand. Even after obtaining additional experience, I found myself going back to this resource and picking-up new things. While the book I've written \\"Go Ahead - Take the Wheel\\" discusses the steps necessary to start autocrossing, HPDEs, and wheel-to-wheel racing, this book does a great job of explaining the other side: driving techniques.

Frankly if you have much autocross experience at all I wouldn't bother with this one. If you're just starting out, you may get something out it if, but not much.Try the Speed Secrets books first.Also I found the book to be very difficult to read, for many reasons:- The author has a very choppy writing style, and I found myself having to re-read many passages to properly understand the meaning.- Production quality / design is horrible. Many of the diagrams are worthless, with arrows pointing at the wrong things. Diagrams should be used to clarify words, not make it more confusing. The quality of the diagrams and are are poor--most are low resolution, and were drawn by an amatuer in Microsoft Paint- I found the author skipped around a bit, and the book lacked a sense of flow- Typeface is very difficult to read. You wouldn't think it would be that important, but I realize now one of the reasons I really dislike this book: the choice of typeface. I'm not sure what font they used, but it is a very slow and ungraceful.

No organization, stick figure drawings, stuffed full of \\"job descriptions\\" for working at an autocross with no usefulness except upping the page count. The \\"modifications\\" section is worthless.He talks of \\"weight transfer\\" when he really means inertia loading. He attributes cornering forces to the mythical \\"centrifugal force\\" and talks of your body being forced outward, when it's the car accelerating towards the center of the circle.The first chapter of Skip Barber's \\"Faster\\" has more useful information than this entire book.Oh yes, no \\"secrets\\" are revealed."},{"Title":"CAP'N FATSO","review":"\\"FANS OF ADMIRAL GALLERY'S UNIQUE BRAND OF SEA YARNS WILL LOVE IT.\\" -- Herman Wouk\\"Vintage Gallery humor!

In Capn' Fatso, Dan Gallery shows us a classic but outrageously funny example of this when a small group of American sailors led by a salty old Boatswain's Mate get cut off from their normal duties by accident. Every veteran of any branch of service, man or woman, will be able to relate to this light hearted tale of American military life since it brings to memory experiences and people each of us have known in our own lives.

Through mischance, he and his landing craft are left behind when his Carrier Task Force get sailing orders. Fully provisioned, Fatso and his crew of like-minded free spirits take their own version of a Mediterranian Cruise (after first disguising their craft so that nothing can come home to roost). This is a fine example of Gallery's light-hearted touch at the helm for all who have enjoyed his sea-stories before or for someone who has never read him before!"},{"Title":"CAP'N FATSO","review":"This is a very well written story set in the US Navy of the 1960's. There are fascinating insights into the operation of the Navy -- how aircraft carriers work, how navies are supplied, how spying missions are flown, how American and Russian navies get along on the high seas.But at a deeper level, it's a story about how the US Navy can be a family to its sailors. The main plot is the hell that Cap'n Fatso can raise, when his fleet abandons him and sails for Vietnam. Intertwined with it is a story about how Cap'n Fatso mentors young sailors, protecting them from harm -- he even sets up a casino, serving beer, so that young marines won't be corrupted by landside attractions.I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"CAP'N FATSO","review":"\\"FANS OF ADMIRAL GALLERY'S UNIQUE BRAND OF SEA YARNS WILL LOVE IT.\\" -- Herman Wouk\\"Vintage Gallery humor!

Beautiful piece of history for any history buff or Kennedy fan."},{"Title":"Milton the Early Riser","review":"Having taken the world by storm with their mightily successful \\"Leo the Late Bloomer\\" author Robert Kraus and that dynamic illustrating duo of Jose and Ariane Aruego decided to give the world of picture books another go. As with \\"Leo\\", the title character in \\"Milton the Early Riser\\" has a problem. It's not a huge problem, nor a particularly tragic one, but it bugs him just the same. Milton (an adorable panda cub) has woken up early and there is no one else up and nothing at all to do. To amuse himself Milton attempts to watch television (only the color bars are on), to jump up and down, to dance and do tricks, and finally to sing. It's the singing that wrecks the most damage to the other drowsy animals in Milton's neighborhood. An unexpected repercussion of Milton's little song is that the very mountains and trees themselves shake and tremble and a huge whirlwind blows the other sleeping animals hither and yon. Patiently, Milton puts everyone back in their proper place, tiring himself in the process. When his parents wake up Milton is fast asleep, a small smile on his face.The Aruegos are especially talented at making you feel sorry for their picture book creations. Though Milton is never put through any particularly dire straights, you feel really sorry for him when he plods about, alone and lonely. Fortunately, he's a bit of a card. By amusing himself with funny body positions and clever balancing tricks he also amuses the child reader. The book is infused with the regular fabulous colors and creations one has come to expect from this artistic duo. Not only beautiful, but also funny. Milton is particularly amusing when he thinks up original ways of schlepping animals from place to place to place.The story's good too. I should probably mention that. But I love the Aruegos and for me they're the whole reason to pick up this book. It's a sweet story, sure. But it's also a fabulous book to flip through. Lovely looking. Lovely reading."},{"Title":"Milton the Early Riser","review":"It's the best book I ever saw. The colors are very bright. I especially liked when the animals were camoflauged.

Serious design flaws.Anyway, this set is a (probably brief) catalog of man's inhumanity to man. There is some mention of genocides and crimes against humanity in pre-modern times, but most of the horror takes place in the 20th century & later, where modern weapons make killing easier and more efficient - where perpetrators take pictures & make films of themselves committing atrocities.

By 'concise' I mean up to the point that satisfies a non-specialist reader without burdening too much details. This book serves the purposes of a specialist reader and an outsider as well with good bibliography. However the philological problem may not have been introduced at the beginning, on the contrary the section on &quot;Readers' Homer&quot; may have been the choice for the first section. However that may be the author's choice as he is an experienced professor. The classroom experience must have been the reason for this.

I may update later, but it has already proved itself incredibly useful."},{"Title":"Homer (Blackwell Introductions to the Classical World)","review":"I've taught the Iliad a number of times, and Powell's is easily the most readable, concise, and informative introduction to Homer that I've come across.Powell knows what's important to a basic understanding of how the Iliad and Odyssey were created, why we think so, what Homer can tell us about history (mainly that of his own time), and why many modern readers find the two poems tough sledding (Homer actively avoids suspense, for example). Powell gets right to the point every time.He also summarizes both epics in ways that make the sometimes elusive themes stand out clearly. Anyone reading either poem will benefit immensely from this book.In fact, if you've *never* read Homer, you might want to read Powell's \\"Homer\\" just because it's likely to whet your appetite for both the Iliad and the Odyssey.

I really enjoyed reading of their escapades together.Kain, the stepson of the vicious Adam Clayhill, meets Vanessa and her Aunt Ellie, and cousin Henry. The threesome are determined to travel to Junction City, and meet the brother of Ellie's dead husband (whom she was only married about a month to before his death) in order to locate kinfolk for her son, Henry. With no travel sense the trio are sure for some major problems, if not to lose their lives. Kain sees no other choice then to escort them to Junction City himself... although he's already discovered his strong attraction to the red-headed, Vanessa.Ellie's son, Henry, is a simple-minded man and one of the main reasons the trio was taking this trip were because her fear of who would take care of him after she was gone, and not wanting to burden Vanessa with his care if she ever marries. She hoped they would find some kin, that would ease this fear for her. Ellie and Henry were not prepared for what they actually did find in Junction City. It seems there is no limit to the lives Adam Clayhill has destroyed... but you'll be pleased at the outcome of this story.The double wedding that takes place in Junction City, will reunite the wonderful characters from the previous two books of this trilogy. You'll discover what has been occuring in the lives of Logan and Rosalee Horn, Cooper and Lorna Parnell, Arnie and Syliva Henderson, and many more. This reunion is perfect for the last of the trilogy... and what happens to the two villians, Adam and Della Clayhill, will give you satisfaction as well.Along the way, you'll love the variety of characters from the two Texan brothers - Jeb and Clay, to John Wisner, and Mary Ben - the love of Henry Hill!"},{"Title":"Wind of Promise","review":"This was the very first romance novel that was given to me 10 years ago when I was just 15 and I still treasure the images of the characters and the book itself.

After the second time, our wonderful hero explained to her the danger to others that her actions were creating and I thought - ahh, now she will stop. However, she did it a third time so I turned off the Kindle and won't finish the rest of the book.Also, our hero fell in love with her much too easy and early when she was still being shrewish, unkind and they hadn't had any true conversation."},{"Title":"La Seconde Revolution Tranquille: Democratiser La Democratie","review":"Cet essai ne plaira pas &agrave; la majorit&eacute;, silencieuse ou bavarde.

A sociologist arrives to research rural life and turns the little town upside down, starting with the weekly newspaper and its owner. It is basically a comedy so things end up better than when they started; but there isn't a lot of meat on this bone. Too much local color dialect is thrown in for show, and that takes away from the story. If I had been his editor I would have encouraged him to trim this 300 page book way, way, way down to a longish short story. It is full of quirky characters and is a fun read. The best of the characters (and the reason why this book gets 3 stars from me) is the town's garbage collector, Rory Napoleon. He falls off the wagon in a big way and it is incredibly funny. I took this book with me on vacation and I would recommend it to others who are going away and want a light read."},{"Title":"Golden Dreams","review":"The heroine of this story is Lucy Hubbard,who took over as Sheriff of Nowhere California (a former gold boomtown) after her father's death. The hero, Luke McKenna, arrives back in town after serveral years away,hoping to find gold on his old claim. Luke is asked to help Lucy rid the town of some rowdy outlaws and later they end up sharing work digging for gold. Soon they find that they are very attracted to each other as they spend time together. Nice romance with a different twist,both characters are likeable and the romance between the two very sweet."},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"I am a working mom (soon to make whatever sacrifices I must to retire, as I read more and more studies that children don't do as well when the primary caretaker is someone other than a parent) who has used this method of child spacing with great success. I nurse my daughter on demand when I am at home and at night (no getting up for late night feedings, just flip over and go back to sleep!), and pump once during the day at work and so far my periods haven't returned. My daughter is 22 months old and I haven't had a period since 1997! For anyone who is working and wants to use this method, I would recommend combining it with fertility awareness - you can check ccli.org for more info on that - just to make sure, because obviously the chances of fertility returning are greater when you're not with your child day in and day out. The knowledge that constant mother-baby togetherness causes this natural child spacing leads me to greater belief that mothers and baby are biologically designer to be together at all times, and logic tells me (as studies confirm) that if I try to do otherwise, harm comes to both of us. [...]Update: Jan 2006 - I had 27 months of infertility after each of my first two children and am in month 14 after my third. My gynecologist said I have all but eliminated any chance of breast, ovarian, or endometrial cancer (because I've had only 6 cycles in 8 years) by adopting this time-tested lifestyle.A woman who follows the standards of natural mothering closely (especially nursing while sleeping) typically receives 20-30 months of postpartum infertility. A more modern-style nurser averages 14 months, decreasing with more separation, limited comfort nursing, and longer nursing intervals."},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"I read this book in 1978 when I was pregnant with my 3rd child. It changed my life and the life of my children. Sheila helped me find my instinctual mothering abilities that had been lost to many boomers whose own mothers had adopted the post war/ozzie and harriet 50's version of parenting... and that didn't include attachment parenting or breastfeeding!I was 8 months pregnant when I read this book and it was like a whole new world of parenting options opened up to me. I hadn't had any idea that it was possible to let a baby sleep with you. I didn't know that baby swings were just a substitute for mom and that cribs and cradles were too. I had always, always been taught that picking up a crying child was allowing them to manipulate you. And Sheila's book took those societal blinders off my eyes and off my heart.That baby is 24 years old today. And a mommy of her own 15 month old. What is &quot;normal&quot; to her, breastfeeding in bed, sleeping with her child and always answering her needs, is still looked upon with astonishment by others. Her intinctual mothering skills were right at the forefront and ready to do their thing when our little granbaby was born. Her momma already knew how to breastfeed her. Any medical persons involved in their lives have been amazed at what a confident and skilled parent my daughter is at her own tender age and with her first born.Sheila Kippley's book changed my life and my children's. I never realized it was so life changing until I saw my grandaugter and how her mother has learned how to be a mother from me and I learned from this tiny book.THANK YOU SHEILA!"},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"I read this book by Sheila Kippley, who is co-founder with her husband, John, of the Couple to Couple League, after we had our fourth child and had just discovered NFP. Mrs. Kippley teaches &quot;ecological breastfeeding&quot; as a means of spacing pregnancies as well as a form of parenting. I had nursed all my babies, but had also supplemented with juices, pacifiers and early (at 4 mos.) solid foods. Now, with this new approach, I began practicing total nursing, baby sleeping and nursing in bed with us at night (the family bed), attachment parenting, no supplemental bottles or pacifiers, and delayed solids. I found that the baby was happier and so was I. No more getting up for night feedings then trying to get the baby back in a crib without waking her. No more toddlers addicted to pacifiers. And the &quot;fringe benefit&quot; of this parenting style was a comfortable spacing of pregnancies. My first totally breast-fed baby was almost three years old before my periods returned! Our reliance on God's Providence in relation to our family size grows with each child, thanks to NFP, the Couple to Couple League and Mrs. Kippley's book. We have put our lives in His hands, knowing that He is the one who opens and shuts the womb and that He gives us the intellect and the will to make decisions about our fertility, but He has the final say."},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"I borrowed this book from the Library based on the recommendation of a friend when my daughter was a few months old. I quickly purchased my own copy from amazon.com after reading it. It is an amazing book - it really did change the way I parented my daughter [for the better] and it also really REALLY worked for child spacing purposes. I was fascinated with the information in this book [which I'd never read or even heard of elsewhere] and it was fun and easy to read. I also really REALLY enjoyed being without periods for more than a year too. :) I think any breastfeeding mom would really benefit from reading this book!"},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"Mothers who are reluctant to risk using hormonal methods of birth control while breastfeeding no longer have to rely on less-effective barrier methods or &quot;chance.&quot; With this book, nursing mothers now have the ability to space births as effectively as the Pill, Depo-Provera, Norplant, and the IUD-- without any of the harmful side effects.Mrs. Kippley not only explains what natural mothering is and how it spaces babies, but spells out, step by step, how to maximize your own natural breastfeeding infertility.It only makes sense that what is &quot;good for mother is good for baby.&quot; This book goes far beyond simply &quot;breasfeeding as birth control.&quot; You won't just read it once-- it's a book you'll refer back to many times for information and support. This book should be read by every nursing mom!!"},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"This book tells new mothers what many doctors don't know. Yes, breastfeeding CAN space children. The World Health Organization promotes it as such! Since the beginning of time, women all over the world have used breastfeeding to both nurture babies and space them about two years apart. However, in modern American culture the way we often breastfeed does NOT work to space children. This book explains why not, and how to get back to nature. I have used this book, and am still without periods with a near-7 month old baby. I recommend it.

This book gave me the courage to follow my natural insticts and let my child decide when to be weaned. This book gave reasons why continued breastfeeding is beneficial to older children as well as younger and also helped me see that I am a good mother. This book is an excellent tool for any breastfeeding mother who cherishes the bonding time breastfeeding provides.After reading this book I was told I would need to wean my child to have a medical procedure. The book gave my the courage to say no. Later it was realized that the certain medical procedure would have been unneccessay. I am so grateful I took the time to read this book, I know it can give you the courage to continue also."},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"This book was exactly what I was looking for! At last a book that regards babies and children as gifts and positive additions to our lives, rather than inconveniences to 'get through' as fast as possible. I intuitively knew that strict schedules and letting the baby &quot;cry it out&quot; didn't seem natural or normal. Sheila Kippley's book confirmed these things for me, and with well-researched reference material!The info on ecological breastfeeding is invaluable, and way different than the supposedly &quot;helpful&quot; info in popular parenting books and magazines. My son is happy, healthy, intelligent and vibrant thanks to the info I received from this book. Baby #2 is due in weeks, and will enjoy all the same benefits!"},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"If I could recommend just one book to the expectant mother undecided about breastfeeding this would be the one. It gives information that I've never read or heard anywhere else, all of it sourced from experts most people would recognize such as Dr. Dickley Grant-Read and Dr. John Bowlby.Everyone knows breastfeeding is best for baby but that in itself might not be enough to persuade some women. Adding in the fact that proper breastfeeding can keep the mother from having her period for over a year and keep her infertile naturally might just be the extra nudge she needs to nurse her baby."},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"This book should be read by every nursing mom! It covers problems you must face with nursing and with lack of support in today's society for breastfeeding. It gives the very much needed &quot;shot in the arm&quot; for nursing mothers. A definite keeper."},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"This book discuses what is called natural mothering. Through natural mothering one can save there child from many ailments. Tooth decay, thumb sucking and tounge thrusting, and even SIDS.This book sites studies where co-sleeping, a fundemental part of exculsive breastfeeding, cuts the number of SIDS significantly. Part of the reason for this is that the baby sleeps on his back and side during night feedings. Also, the baby is able to mimic the mother's breathing pattern, thus reminding him to breath. This book is a must read. Every expectant mother, with her first or her last child, should read this book."},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"I thought this book was just okay. I felt like she just kept saying the same thing over and over again. That keeping the baby close to mom is the best way to care for baby and by breastfeeding on demand you can expect a delay in the return of ovulation. I was disappointed that there really was no assistance given for mom's who go back to work. I would like to know statistics on how pumping and breastfeeding affect the return of fertility, but her point was to never give baby a bottle. I'm past the 3 month phase and have been back to work about 4 weeks with still no return. But it really comes down to the fact that everyone's body's are different so just because it works that way for one person doesn't mean it will be the same for another."},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"This book talks about such a lovely -- and loving -- way to raise babies.

Before I read this I was searching on here looking for books about marriage & family since I had recently married. I came along this book, ordered it & fell in love. Everything you ever wanted to know about mothering is summed up here. From reading this book I gained an awareness of my body & the confidence to give it my best shot (at mothering/birthing/breastfeeding). Breastfeeding IS VERY possible & it's how God, in His infinite knowledge, made us able to be fruitful & carry on our seed. To know now that my son is alive today because of the Grace of God & my milk is amazing to me. Praise GOD for this book!! It really, really changed my whole outlook on life, mothering, being a family & the priorities that are truly important in life. I was able to contact the author of the book & am now a member of a yahoo group that she is part of & she is a genuinely warm & loving person with the Love of God in her heart. This book really changed my life. After this I began reading the Natural Family Planning manual that both husband & wife Kippley wrote together(along with another author). My husband got interested in NFP as well & we took classes through our local Catholic Parish (we are Assembly of God/Baptist.) The classes were wonderful (we were the only married couple & non-Catholic there). Then between our 1st & 2nd classes we became pregnant. We had been trying for 8 months previous to the classes & with the knowledge we learned in one class we were able to pinpoint our most fertile days & God made it happen. My husband says God wanted us to go to the classes & our pregnancy at the time it happened was our sign it was God's will. I imagine there are a lot of people who are not Christian or don't believe in God's will but this review is directed towards those who do believe. This book was the first step in God leading my husband & I towards HIM, together! Overall I highly recommend this book for soon to be mothers, baby shower gifts, new moms who WANT to breastfeed & new husbands who want to cherish their wives the way Christ does the church. A+++ 10 STARS & 2 BIG thumbs up!! Well done Sheila Kippley!--Just my thoughts-- Mama Jones--"},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"I read this book during my first tri-mester and it changed my life. I never thought I would nurse my child for more than one year but now I plan on nursing my son until he weans himself. I also never thought I would co-sleep but once we started I FINALLY started getting the rest I needed! He is currently 8 months-old and my fertility still hasn't returned. Such a great book!!!"},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"Upon getting married, I had recently decided that artificial contraception was against God's will, but was not sold on the idea of natural family planning either. Even if you're not there yet, but looking for a natural way to space children, this book is a must for you. It is timeless and cross-cultural wisdom that somewhere along the way got lost in our modern culture. The method would be difficult, if not impossible, to practice while being a working mom, but read it anyway! You may give a second thought to going back to work. There are 7 steps to practice that make ecological breastfeeding different than just exclusive breastfeeding if you are looking for a fool-proof method of delaying the return of fertility. That being said, I regularly practiced 4-5 steps and had 8 months with no periods after baby #1 and 12 months after baby #2 (when I weaned him). We did not do co-sleeping or nap together. That being said, every woman-baby pair is different, so all 7 steps are recommended, if you can do them. Much information in this book I had never heard anywhere, and it was extrememly eye-opening."},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"If you're not going to be around your baby nearly 24/7, don't bother buying this book. I just got it in the mail three days ago and have already read half of it, because for me it's something I'll really be able to do if I want. The \\"family bed\\" idea seems a little far out for our society, but the author does a good job of explaining its value. Also, I now understand why people I've talked to personally who mentioned they or someone they knew \\"exclusively\\" breastfed, but still became pregnant almost immediately. It's because \\"exclusive\\" breastfeeding isn't the same as what the author prescribes and calls \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding. Some of the ideas presented seem strange and even opposite of what you may have heard. For me, they were things that I happened to have an inkling about, because I had done a college research paper/presentation that focused on some of the variances in other cultures relating to touch. I also happened to learn how they actually potty-train infants and with considerable ease -if you're with the baby 24/7 that is. I don't know if this books talks about that at all, though I doubt it. Anyways, like I said, if you can be around the baby practically always then this will work. And unlike what you may think, it doesn't produce an unhealthy attachment but rather allows the baby to mature all the better because he doesn't lack a sense of security. Which was something highly notable I saw when I'd done my research paper. The biggest challenge that I foresee (for myself) is the attention cynics will naively give it, and not being able to fit back into my collection of bras and stuff -yeah, it's silly, but there's nothing else I can think to complain of. Too bad Victoria's Secret doesn't cater to those who are nursing, right? :D"},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"Good book and very informative, but I found alot of references were based on religion which may put some people off. i.e. use this book to help space out your children, however accept any pregnancy as a miracle from God..etc... I also felt it guilted me a little that I would be de-bonding from my child by going back to work! However, if you move away from that and read the facts of the book - demand feeding, co-sleeping etc, it is very informative and has been useful. I'm still glad I bought it."},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"This is useful a book for stay at home moms or those who can nurse their baby on demand.

(Contrary to what I have been told by others.) I am pregnant with #2, and my children will be almost 2 years apart. This is ideal for us, and we spaced our children using the information in this book. I also recommend &quot;Taking Charge of Your Fertility.&quot; If you want a natural approach, read this book.

To me, this type of mothering is easier than the alternatives, and healthier for all of us!"},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"I found this book through the Couple to Couple League, of which my husband and I are members. We obviously believe what they stand for, so I was interested to read this book by the founder. Before our son was born I planned to breastfeed him. However, I didn't really think my son would use me as a pacifier and I didn't think I would be this \\"attached\\" to him, however, because of his \\"high needs\\" temprament, he pretty much demanded everything she advocated in the book: frequent breastfeeding (for both nutrition and pacification), co-sleeping, napping with baby, etc. Early in my sons life, I felt as though I was \\"tied down\\" to him and was resentful of the enormous amount of attention he required. It was only after reading this book that I felt confident in the choices I was making as a parent. I was reassured that I was doing the very best for my son. By doing what was recommended in the book, I have achieved postpardum amnorrhea for 8 months and counting. The real life readers experiences in the book really validated what I was doing. I whole heartedly recommend this book to anyone who wants to do the very best for their baby, and achieve natural child spacing as a result."},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"This book changed my life. And not only my life, but the lives of hundreds of other mothers and children too! I came across this edition ten years ago in my public library, when I was a 30-year-old attorney, pregnant with my first baby. Like many women of my generation - maybe most - I had no thoughts of becoming a stay-at-home mother, no thoughts of taking a baby into my bed, no thoughts of breastfeeding a child past a certain age. To the extent I thought about it at all, I surely believed that breastfeeding could not possibly space babies. I found this book almost totally by chance, while researching natural family planning (for medical but not religious reasons), and I picked it up after I became pregnant, mainly because I was curious and I just wanted to know the best way to care for a baby that would make sure it didn't cry too much!What I found was the introduction to a new way of life - a natural way, a loving way, a healthy way for myself and my baby and my family. I found a description of mothering and breastfeeding the way nature intended it, of the mother's body as a habitat for her baby, and of an ecological relationship between mother and child, relying on both and contributing to the health and happiness of each. I found clear and accurate scientific information about lactation and fertility, much of which I had never seen anywhere else. (And as a mature woman with several years of marriage behind me, I wondered WHY I had never heard these facts before!) But more than this, I found sage advice about how to enjoy my baby and find fulfillment in motherhood itself from a smart, experienced writer who seemed, even at a distance in time and space, to care about me personally, as a woman and a mother. Sure, I learned all about the kind of breastfeeding that spaces babies - and as a result I enjoyed lengthy periods of amenorrhea between each of my three children. But even more, I learned the joy of mothering through breastfeeding. I learned how much easier mothering is when we work with nature rather than against.Since that first discovery, I have proudly acquired and read every edition of Sheila Kippley's book, Breastfeeding and Natural Child Spacing: How Ecological Breastfeeding Spaces Babies, as well as her other books and articles. I have recommended it to my friends and promoted it in mothers' groups and at conferences. I have referred to it time and again, as I made the natural mothering lifestyle my own. With each new edition, clearer, evidence-based standards (the Seven Standards of Ecological Breastfeeding) have evolved to assist mothers in maximizing the natural child spacing effect of breastfeeding. More importantly, with every revision of this book, ever more scientific and medical evidence has been available to support what Sheila Kippley had been saying all along!Now even though the new editions of Breastfeeding and Natural Child Spacing: How Ecological Breastfeeding Spaces Babies have much to offer the modern mom, this classic 2nd edition, originally published by Harper and Row and rightly referred to as the \\"classic\\", retains pride of place in my own heart. It has a freshness of style and a remarkable relevance to present cultural conditions. I find myself nodding as I read, thinking how much has changed since Mrs. Kippley wrote this book, and yet how much more has stayed the same. The practices and principles advocated here are as current as ever.In the 21st Century, the ecology of natural mothering has a hip and trendy new nickname: \\"eco-breastfeeding\\". Far from being a mere trend, however, the ecology itself - a human ecology - has never been more important to women, children, families, even to human society itself. Before there was \\"attachment parenting\\"...before the \\"organic revolution\\"...before anyone could measure his own \\"carbon footprint,\\" there was Sheila Kippley, promoting ecological breastfeeding, the only truly natural form of baby care there is. May this newly-reissued Classic edition reach many mothers, change many lives and preserve the wisdom inherent in this natural lifestyle for many generations to come."},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"There are so many myths out there about breastfeeding and fertility, and I find myself referring to this one quite a bit to clear it all up. I probably read this book with the opposite frame of mind of most of its readers. On a personal level, I've used it to learn more about trying to conceive while breastfeeding. Others who want to space children will learn great information. It's a shame that women in our society don't understand their bodies. This book sure helps."},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"Breastfeeding and Natural Child Spacing provides new mothers with accurate information concerning the child spacing advantage of breastfeeding, but more importantly, it gives them confidence in their abilities to care for their children with love and gentleness."},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"The Lord led me to the book, \\"Breastfeeding and Natural Child Spacing\\" at a La Leche League meeting, shortly after the birth of our first child.I was a bit stunned and at the same time mesmerized upon seeing the title in the group's lending library. I remember the excitement I felt and the anticipation in hoping the book was about what I thought it was. I was not dissappointed.The book made reference to a term I don't recall ever hearing before, the term, \\"Natural Mothering.\\" I found the author's guidance in learning the art of Organic Mothering an answer to prayer as I had been for sometime grappling with the morality of contraception and seeking direction regarding the path the Lord would have our family travel.Mrs. Kippley's writings are practical in spelling out what a woman needs to do to naturally space her babies an average of two years apart, backed up by scientific research and true, life experience.The book is also laced with sound advice and encouragement pertinent to good mothering skills. The book mothered me which was a Godsend in not having a real life mother to impart these truths, as is the case with so many women today.Mrs. Kippley's motherly admonitions bring us back to our senses, helping us to recover the art and heart of mothering, seemingly lost in America over the past few decades.Be ready and willing to delight in staying home and keeping your baby close as Natural Mothering is attatchment parenting in it's purest form. Break free from the fear of conception and relax knowing that if you're nursing your child in the loving way Mrs. Kippley lays out, you have chose the best path. You may even be surprised to find that you might have to wean away from the practice of Natural Mothering a bit yo conceive.There is nothing new under the sun.

It would seem to me that Sheila Kippley is due honor for her research on this ever so unknown to the masses topic. The Lord lead me to this book. Breastfeeding and Natural Child Spacing was a precious revelation for me as I realized our maker knew exactly what He was doing when He designed us. We are fearfully and wonderfully made. Psalms 139:14 How sad, that our world has become so anti-Christ that it literally took a revelation for me to discover that I don't HAVE to use ANY pills or contraceptive devices and that in truth these are contrary to God. Upon discovering the knowledge in Mrs. Kippley's Breastfeeding and Natural Child Spacing, we have two children spaced at a lovely time of 22 months apart and hoping for another that would be even further apart as my youngest is already 15 months. The only control over birth since our first child has been just living life the way God intended. (having children and nursing them) I thank God for inspiring this book and letting me find it when we really needed to. I feel great healthwise and am looking forward to having babies until my childbearing season in life ends, using only breastfeeding as the means for natural child spacing. Thank you Mrs. Kippley.

(The other is Nursing Your Baby by Karen Pryor.) Now in my fifties, I think the final stats are in: I have nursed seven babies for more than fifteen years of my adult life.This book isn't just about child spacing. I read it when I needed a new attitude about nursing at night, and there's a chapter about that. It helped me understand much more about the physiology of breast feeding.I titled this review a new/old look at breastfeeding because I think that mothers today are rethinking the \\"new and improved\\" methods of mothering and finding that this is one of the areas in which the old paths are best."},{"Title":"Breastfeeding and natural child spacing: How \\"ecological\\" breastfeeding spaces babies","review":"This book should be very popular today, with all the hype on organics, purity, and getting what is natural. This book gives clear instructions on how to go about natural family planning in the simplest, most natural way. Sheila Kippley is a woman who is proud to be a woman. She does not seek equality with men by trying to live like one, abandoning her children in the process. She knows that equality is not \\"sameness\\", but that the dignity of a woman elevates the entire society. What is more dignified than a good, selfless mother? What is more womanly? What is more powerful over the next generation?If you are interested in finding the support and courage it takes to become a truly good and selfless mother, this is the book for you. Another book by Sheila that really fired me up with encouragement and peace was Breastfeeding and Catholic Motherhood; God's Plan for You and Your Baby.

I have not understood all of the words she has used, but the book is written in such a way that it is not difficult to figure out what is meant.If you are unable to be near your child all the time (for example, if your occupation prohibits it), or if you give into social pressures easily, this book is probably not for you, but if you want nothing less than the best for your baby / child (and yourself) this is a good book for you to add to your collection."},{"Title":"Nelson Mandela Speaks: Forging a Democratic, Nonracial South Africa","review":"To many the apartheid regime equiped with nuclear weapons, a fierce police force, and all the financial and political suppoort Washington, London, Israel, and the other imperial powers could provide seemed invincible in its war against the peoples of Southern AFrica and its own Black majority.

Mr. Soister wrote the definitive book on Universal horror films from the 1930's a year ago, now he publishes the definitive biography of one of filmdon's acting giants, Claude Rains. A book on this wonderful actor was way overdue. Soister proves it was well worth the wait! Each of Rains' films is recounted in detail, with Soister's well informed opinion on each film, and Mr. Rains' performance. If you are a fan of Claude Rains, or Hollywood's Golden Era, THIS is a must book for you! He may have been short in physical stature, but Claude Rains was a towering giant when it came to talent, style, and film presence.

Since then, I have purchased as many Claude Rains performances as I could. Here was a man who overcame a childhood of abject poverty, little education and two forms of speech impediments. He became a performer of such intensity it is difficult to notice anyone else in the scene. Although his height, or lack of it, usually kept him from getting the girl, Miss Davis admitted that he reeked of sex appeal. What Elvis evoked with a wiggle, Claude was able to do with that left eyebrow and that voice. Naturally, after seeing some performances, I definitely wanted to find out all I could about Mr. Rains and \\"An Actor's Voice\\" did not disappoint.

A well-written, engaging bio. that opens with the strife of the Streltzy uprising when he was a young boy. Political machinations are explained in a simple manner throughout the book, and they are never tedious. Peter is portrayed as a man with passion for his country, his people, and his own ideas. Although the text is sympathetic towards Peter as a person, it neither idolizes or villifies him for his radical accomplishments. His was a fascinating life.THIS BOOK IS THE KIND OF BOOK THAT INTERESTS A CHILD AND SHOULD BE REPRINTED !!! Original illustrations by Louis Slobodkin are b/w stylized line drawings. They may look a little out of date to the modern reader, but could be colorized and refreshed. However, those who love children's literature love Slobodkin's drawings.My copy is 310 pages and was printed in 1943 by The Vanguard Press. There is a lot of \\"white space\\" (now yellowed) around the edges of each page, making the amount of text very manageable. Grades 4-10, with an emphasis on grades 5-8.

So here is my background if that will help others make up their minds - I consider myself intermediate to advanced exerciser in the category of people who workout to stay in shape and keep fit (i.e not in the athlete category). I do regular cardio and weight training - either style on any day for at least an hour, four to six times a week. I did a bit of stability ball work after looking at exercises in M&F; magazine and loved it. I bought this book and \\"Get on the Ball\\" to learn more.Before this book there were stability ball exercises from mags that I could do. And those I simply could not. And I had no idea why. This book teaches you the technique of gaining control on the ball first. And then takes you through Beginner, Intermediate, Advnaced exercises for different body parts. So I can now do exercises I could not earlier.There are many excellent photographs. Each exercise is demonstrated - sometimes including photographs of bad form. I do a tricky exercise in front of a mirror the first few times to make sure I am in the right form - so I find this a very useful feature.There is a section for mums-to-be. And one for Senior Citizens that my mum intends to get started on.Four and not Five stars because:a. The book does not recommend the number of reps and sets you should do of each exercise.b. While there is information about the purpose of each exercise by and large,(example shoulder flexibility, increased muscle tone in the butt) this is not consistent. Perhaps the author assumes the reader will know. I like having this spelt out clearly."},{"Title":"Swiss Ball","review":"I recently purchased a stability ball, and I wanted a book which would provide a general introduction to exercises on the ball. For the most part, this book met my needs. It begins with some good preliminary information on ball work, equipment, safety issues, and alignment. The first exercise chapter features some excellent stretches with the ball designed to be used during either the warm-up or cool-down portion of your workout.The following chapters are each broken into color-coded sections on basic, intermediate, and advanced exercises. Although I liked this format, I was disappointed to see that the intermediate and advanced exercises often required the use of additional equipment--dumbbells, ankle weights, stability cushions, etc. Each chapter also focuses on a particular area of the body, including core (back work), abdominals, spinal mobility and strength, upper body, and lower body; specialized populations--senior citizens and pregnant women--are featured in the final two chapters.I found the exercises to be clear, with easy-to-follow, concise instructions and helpful photo illustrations. The upper body chapter contained a particularly nice variety of exercises, most of which required only dumbbells as extra equipment. Overall, this book provides a nice reference for those new to stability ball work."},{"Title":"Swiss Ball","review":"My husband had borrowed this book from the library, but felt it so useful that I bought it for him."},{"Title":"Swiss Ball","review":"Good basic ball for lot's of different exercises.

The book consists of targeted exercise sections:Core Stability, Abdominals, Spine, Upper limbs, Lower Limbs then there's sections for Seniors and Pre/Post natal.The Abdominal section and the Lower Limbs are my favorites. The exercises presented are effective and over time(when you get your balance) they are easy and even fun at times.

Hailed as the &quot;greatest poem of the 20th century&quot;, a masterpiece which &quot;captured the disillusionment of a generation&quot;; indeed, as the &quot;justification&quot; of Ezra Pound's modernist &quot;experiment&quot;, yet referred to by Eliot, himself, as &quot;just a piece of rythmical grumbling&quot;, the Waste Land is sure to spark off in any reader a burning desire to know more than Eliot's powerful words can ever themselves explain.Written primarily during a &quot;rest cure&quot; on &quot;Margate Sands&quot; (&quot;I can connect Nothing with Nothing&quot;) and Laussanne, Switzerland; following what Eliot's London doctor diagnosed as a &quot;nervous breakdown&quot;, but which the poet refferred to in his letters as an &quot;aboulie&quot;, or state of &quot;emotional derangement&quot;; it is little wonder that the poem is not an easy one to come to grips with. In the years following it's publication, countless readers and critics, following the &quot;clues&quot; left by the poet in his now infamous &quot;Notes&quot;, have charged off in pursuit of answers and meanings in places they shall never be found. Eliot later explained to his friend, Pound, on whom the poet had bestowed the task (or honour, in this critic's opinion) of editing his original manuscript - that his &quot;Notes&quot; had done little more than lead his readers on a wild goosechase after holy grails and other crazy things which had little bearing on the poem itself. The fact that Pound, the editor, chose, and was permitted by the author, to slash out over half of the original Waste Land fragments in an operation which he described as the &quot;Caesarian Operation&quot; speaks volumes for itself. For it was in this operation that Pound's theories on Vortisism and Imagisme, and Eliot's own theories on poetic &quot;impersonality&quot; and committment to the &quot;Great Tradition&quot; were fused. The result - the final masterwork, the &quot;cult&quot; poem we know today. In the manuscript publication, the missing pieces to Eliot's inticate puzzle are at last to be found .If you are an Eliot fan, or have any interest whatsoever in the Modernist movement, or the inner workings of a creative genius' mind - this book is an absolute MUST !"},{"Title":"The Waste Land: A Facsimile and Transcript of the Original Drafts Including the Annotations of Ezra Pound","review":"'The Waste Land' is widely viewed as the twentieth century's most important English language poem, so it's no surprise that 'The Waste Land' manuscripts are some of the most fussed-about pieces of artistic construction in modern times. The poem is a short but dizzying string of images that needs every bit of clarification available.'The Waste Land' manuscripts, which consist of fifty-four leaves, three hotel receipts, and a mailing label, were sold by T. S. Eliot to John Quinn, a New York attorney who served as his agent, in 1923. Quinn died the following year and Eliot's manuscripts were inherited by Julia Quinn Anderson, his sister. Mrs. Anderson died in 1934, after which the manuscripts were put in storage. Her daughter, Mary Anderson Conroy, recovered them and made a final sale in 1958 to the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library, where they currently reside. Eliot never knew about the sale and his estate was not informed until 1968, upon publication of a Quinn biography by Professor B. L. Reid.'The Waste Land: A Facsimile and Transcript' is largely a collaboration between Valerie Eliot, T. S. Eliot's second wife, and poet Ezra Pound, who is credited with massaging 'The Waste Land' into its published form. Using the original manuscripts, correspondence, and research on literary workings of the poem, Mrs. Eliot and Mr. Pound have done much to elucidate where The Waste Land's ideas originally came from and how its manuscripts created issues over the poem's 'official' appearance.The book, first published as a large-size hardcover by Harcourt Brace & Company in 1971, gives itself little fanfare and dives right into the poem's lengthy history. Pound chimes in with a short preface that acknowledges Mrs. Eliot's devotion, followed by a twenty-page introduction that charts the events in Eliot's personal and creative lives from 1915 to 1924. Mrs. Eliot bases the introduction primarily on letters written between Eliot, his family, Pound, and Quinn. It is soundly arranged, listing every step towards making 'The Waste Land' a published item.The manuscript's fifty-four leaves are offered in facsimile, with each page transcripted to its right. The transcriptions reflect any changes or notations made by Eliot, Pound, and Eliot's first wife, Vivienne, who provided feedback intermittently. Pound's corrections are transcripted in red ink, Vivienne Eliot's in black ink with dotted lines. The leaves are arranged in sections corresponding to those of the final poem. Remarkable is how much verse was left on the cutting floor: 'The Burial of the Dead' stems from a long narrative poem, the infamous 'He Do the Police in Different Voices.' Its entire first part, a trite urban episode, went completely unused. The tiny section 'Death by Water' originated from a narrative of sea fishers, running over four hand-written pages.To clarify ambiguous information such as titles, literary references, and Pound's codified markings, Mrs. Eliot has supplied editorial notes that are located after the facsimiles. The book's remaining pages contain 'The Waste Land' as published by Boni and Liveright in 1922, including Eliot's after-the-fact notes that were used as a critical reference for years, but which Eliot later called 'bogus scholarship.' These notes were originally written by Eliot to point out various sources, but he later expanded them needlessly to fill blank pages resulting from the poem's appearance as a book.Mrs. Eliot's volume is highly informative and well-organized. It does much to elucidate the poem's inner workings and we learn a great deal about Eliot personally, something that he largely considered taboo. We see clearly how the poem took shape, with much-needed help from Pound and Vivienne Eliot. There are no longer any mysteries about how Eliot could piece together such contradictory material; whatever material did not reach publication gives added meaning to what the public eventually saw.How literary sources relate to the poem is a different story, however. 'The Waste Land: A Facsimile and Transcript' does nothing to clarify what the poem actually means and, to be fair, Mrs. Eliot did not set out to do this. If a reader wants to find out the significance of Hindu Upanishads or what 'Tristan and Isolde' is about, there are plenty of good references, such as the Norton Critical Edition. 'A Facsimile and Transcipt' bases itself on the writing process, not on literary interpretation.While a moot point, it's unfortunate that Vivienne Eliot was never consulted about the poem. The first Mrs. Eliot spent her remaining years in a sanatorium (she died in 1947), having been committed for mental problems. A great deal of knowledge about the poem died with her, especially since 'The Waste Land' is discreetly autobiographical. Despite her intimate knowledge of the writer, Valerie Eliot has assembled this book while at a sizeable distance from the poem's origins.Regardless, 'The Waste Land' is a stunning collage of imagery whose deeper meanings were carried by T. S. Eliot to his grave and, if his beliefs are true, to the world beyond. Certain mysteries surrounding this poem will never be clarified; but this facsimile edition at least offers some hope of uncovering whatever meanings the poem contains. It is essential reading for admirers of Eliot's poetry and a wealth of information for scholars, who should already know about it by now."},{"Title":"The Waste Land: A Facsimile and Transcript of the Original Drafts Including the Annotations of Ezra Pound","review":"For any scholar or serious student of modernism, Valerie Eliot's facsimile edition is a must. The content enables us to reconsider notions of \\"high modernism,\\" Eliot's seemingly dry approach to life and literature (if anyone trusts such satirical jabs as 'The Sweeniad'), and the relationship between Pound and Eliot--even as it occurs in Pound's own pen on Eliot's manuscript. The several additional voices included in Eliot's original vision, particularly in his intended first stanza of what was to be titled, \\"He do the Police in Different Voices: Part I,\\" gives contemporary audiences a new take on Eliot's sense of humor and full conception of the modern consciousness.Not only does the edition provide the original manuscript on the left page (both typed and handwritten), but also a surprisingly useful retyped version on the facing page to make clear what has been written in the margins by Eliot, Pound, or any other editorial hand. These facing-page clarifications are color-coded to clarify who has done the editing (i.e., red for Pound).If you are fascinated by historical documents, serious about Modernism and the relationships therein, or simply a fan of what has been called the landmark poem of the literary period that arguably still defines our lives today, the Waste Land Facsimile Edition is indispensable."},{"Title":"The Waste Land: A Facsimile and Transcript of the Original Drafts Including the Annotations of Ezra Pound","review":"This book is especially relevant to poets that have been writing for long enough to understand the supreme importance of form and diction (also grammar: idiosyncratic, colloquial, or even proper). What you see in the book is a few things that have been taken out, then pretty soon a text that is nearly identical to the one in print (not to undermine the importance of subtleties). Like I said, limited relevance, but I know of no other books that offer so much of process (collaborative at that). Notable is the original title: \\"He do the police in different voices\\" which I happen to like, and is suitable aside from the disparity between Eliot's verse for the ultra-literate and it's origin in street language (technically it is from a Dickens book). I am to the point that I believe the best poems are such because of notable phrasing, subtle rhythmic patterns, music & arresting imagery. Also, as is so blatantly pointed out by example here in The Wasteland, literary allusion is also of strong impact, though nearly by definition is a process of exclusion. A poet must believe in the poem and must write with intent, but that does not mean that the intent or meaning of the poet is left behind in the poem. This is true of the greatest poets, and I think part of what makes them great is focusing on the physicality of the poem, which is what, without a doubt, will be left behind. As for this poem, it is very abstruse to begin with, and this book only makes it's process slightly more transparent. One thing Eliot had to learn was to keep a safe distance from his poetry. This is evident in the little 'checks' of Pound, i.e. the insistence of Pound on the word demotic as opposed to abominable. Here, it can be noted, one type of judgment is replaced for another, demotic perhaps a bit safer. Recall the stanza in Prufrock that starts something like 'No, I am not King Hamlet...\\" Always thought it was out of place. I think Pound helped Eliot to contain his awkwardness. He became, after a mere 30 pages (?) of poetry (Prufrock, W. L., Ash Wednesday, Hollow Men, etc.) a huge literary presence. All I can say of any relevance is that when you read this, it becomes evident that Eliot had to train his ear for the transcription of what was to become his unmistakable, though I admit, evolving verse. There were things coming out that he had to quiet. And by the time he wrote Four Quartets, he really didn't think much of the Wasteland at all. This is the fate of writers.

It's a Norton Critical Edition entitled Ben Jonson and the Cavalier Poets, released in 1974 that has a great selection. This book, however, is merely a reprint of an edition printed in 1899. Nowhere in the Amazon description of the book does it mention this, which I find downright scandalous. Scholars take their books seriously, and if the edition in question is a reprint, especially a reprint of a 100 year old book that is most certianly outdated, it should be noted somewhere on the page.

This is not always the case, but it often happens in both books and movies, and it definitely occurs here. \\"Dark Moon\\" is the second part of \\"The Firebringer\\" trilogy, which began with the fascinating \\"Birth of the Firebringer\\" and ending with the explosive \\"Son of Summer Stars\\". But smack dab in the middle is \\"Dark Moon\\", and though it is far from being a bad book, it is unfavourably compared to the volumes either side of it.In the preceding novel we are introduced to the young Prince Alijan, whose name means \`dark moon', and who is the subject of a prophecy that describes the one who will eventually win back the Hallow Hills for the unicorns. Taken over by the poisonous wyverns, the unicorns were driven into exile and long to return to their ancestral home - especially since they now contend with gryphons, pans and renegade unicorns. Identified as the prophesied \`Firebringer', the chosen one of the goddess Alma, Alijan is slowly making changes within his herd - introducing them to new customs and cultures, creating peace between enemies and laying to rest some of the snobbery and superstition that plagues his people (much to the disgust of his conservative father Korr).But all that is put on hold when Jan and the rest of the youths in the tribe travel to the shore to engage in mating rituals. It is there he is finally united with his beloved Tek, though it is for only a short while. A vicious gryphon attack cuts him off from the rest of his fellows, and he is swept off to sea. Presumed dead by his grieving friends, the unicorns travel home where Tek's union with Jan is met only with disgust by Korr. Considering them judged by Alma, Korr instigates a new regime for the coming winter that endangers the life of the entire tribe. Finding herself in foal, Tek escapes to her mother, the mystic Jah-Lila who lives as a renegade upon the plain.Meanwhile, Jan finds himself washed up on a foreign shore with no memory of who he is or how he got there. Falling in with \\"two-leggers\\", Jan is conveyed to their great city where he is enraptured by their mastery of fire. Yet there are sinister goings-on within the city, which Jan becomes aware of when he is introduced to the hornless horses of the \\"two-leggers\\", who exist completely under human rule. Escape is necessary, which also holds the hope of regaining his lost memories...The problem with \\"Dark Moon\\" is that it relies a bit too much on clich&eacute;d fantasy techniques: a mad king, a prodigal son, an amnesia plot device, and a corrupt human society - we've seen all this before. Pierce is on surer (and more interesting) ground when she deals with Tek's relationship with her mother, the mysterious backstory to Korr's past, and the different definition she makes of \`hero' in relation to Jan, who is more an information-gatherer and society-changer than a warrior or war-hero. This is captured perfectly in the final chapters of the novel, when Jan is faced with the gryphon responsible for his separation from the herd and faces a crucial choice of life or death.As usual Jah-Lila makes an intoxicating narrator, and despite its discrepancies \\"Dark Moon\\" is an essential part of the trilogy. Perhaps I've been too hard on it (as the editorial reviews certainly are), as it is an intriguing and well-written book on its own terms...but you have much more to look forward to in \\"Son of Summer Stars\\"."},{"Title":"Dark Moon (Firebringer Trilogy)","review":"I loved this book as well as the other 2 in this trilogy!

Meredith Ann Pierce has a unique style in the english language that makes her work an absolute must for any white-fantasy lover"},{"Title":"Dark Moon (Firebringer Trilogy)","review":"This second book in the Firebringer Trilogy logically expands the story, but it does not quite have the same kick as the first; perhaps the added length takes away from the impact. The humans (\\"two-foots\\") are handled in a superlative way so that they don't upset the animal-POV slant of the series. In general, this novel makes for a good example of how to write the middle chapter of a trilogy.In this second installment, Jan, appointed prince of the unicorns in the previous book (_Birth of the Firebringer_), is captured by humans who believe he may be an incarnation of their god and taken to their city across the sea. Meanwhile, Jan's father Korr starts to turn the unicorn herd into a tyranny and directs his hatred at Jan's mate, Tek, now heavy with foal.Pierce moves the story along the plot-lines introduced in the first volume, adds new horizons, answers some questions, brings up others. Admirable all around, especially Pierce's message of tolerance between traditional enemies, but the novelty has rubbed off a little. Thankfully, the last volume, _Son of the Summer Stars_ brings the trilogy to a smashing finish when the unicorns again confront the wyverns."},{"Title":"Dark Moon (Firebringer Trilogy)","review":"I absolutely loved this book! No one could try to match what Meredith Ann Pierce has done! I was infuriated by &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; review of this book. They obviously don't understand a good book when they see one. Jan is no &quot;blend of Prometheus and King Arthur&quot; as Kirkus Reviews says. Jan is a warrior, in a world of his own! This book gripped me from the beginning, when Jan was swept out to sea, till the end, when he reclaimed his place. Please read this book if you can find it. It is one book no one can miss."},{"Title":"Dark Moon (Firebringer Trilogy)","review":"This is a good book as a sort of upgrade for My Little Pony fans. If you ever wondered what would happen to a unicorn in a human town, here you go. Ms. Pierce also brings in (hooray!) narwhals, who belong in any unicorn novel. I'd like to know more about speeding up gestation of foals, but hey, I guess unicorns are different. Just as I'll never get to taste the flowers of the milkwood tree. Pooh. I like the story. A previous reviewer complained that the unicorn turning his horn and hooves to sparkmakers was a lame superpower; not so in a primative society.I like this series, and have returned to it again and again. This is the second time I've bought this book; that is after I read it in a library copy. I'm also very pleased with the covers. They are very beautiful and painterly, I am sorry I could not find the artist's name anywhere.

Amazon really came thru for me!"},{"Title":"Dark Moon (Firebringer Trilogy)","review":"First of all, as second in the series, I'd like to congratulate Miss Pierce on making a sequel that new readers can follow without too much trouble. Sure, there are some scenes that may fly by a new fan's head, but even those are quickly understandable.I like how the plot was handled in this one, the continuous back and forth between Jan and Tek. That made the story much more interesting as a whole, and left a feeling of suspense at some points.This time there is the introduction of some new characters and the return of some old, and for the most part each accomplished what they were meant to do and the focus remained where it has always been; Jan, and this time around, Tek. I love well rounded casts where each character is equally as important, but in this case the focus on just a handful is completely fine (although some may disappointed in the gradual drop of Jan's friend Dagg's role in the story, and with some others)There were plenty of twists and turns to keep the story exciting(even though some were unfortunately predictable), and the hints of what's to come as well as some of the horrors and wonders that unfolded in this volume kept me hooked. The characters are great (although could be better), and the promise of an amazing finish to the trilogy has me eagerly awaiting the next book.Great job, Miss Pierce. I'm all ready for the third!"},{"Title":"Dark Moon (Firebringer Trilogy)","review":"-A stunning sequel to the brilliant \\"Birth of the Firebringer\\"...

Ms. Pierce shows unicorns how they should be- not the white fuzzy pony things sadly potrayed in books like 'The Unicorns of Balinor, but real unicorns. Firece, wild, free. In this, the middle book of the trilogy, Aljan is lost at sea and washed up upon a strange land full of strange two-legged creatures... Korr starts to go mad, in in the vicious winter that grips the vale of the unicorns- many are lost.This is a fantastic novel on its own, and a wonderful second book for a trilogy.

I'd read The Birth of the Firebringer years ago and had been looking for the second and third book in the trilogy ever since. I have to say I was greatly disappointed in this second part of the trilogy. Aljan is dragged out to sea and winds up in the land of the two-foots without memory of who he is, knowing only that he must find the secret of fire. A good concept, but poorly pulled off. Pierce loses the sense of magic and adventure that was such a big part of the first novel. It's also much darker than the first and third. You don't really feel like it fits at all with the other books. The only places it ties in are the beginning and end. It feels more like an interruption than a continuation of the original story line."},{"Title":"Dark Moon (Firebringer Trilogy)","review":"I didn't like the parts when the book talked about Jan and the two-footed sorcerers.

Over time, different publishers reproduced this series of books in their own matching style. That is to say, the content remained the same but the covers varied - with some editions being clearly numbered 1-20. In 1978, Volume 21 was added and this was a complete expos&eacute; of his famous research ship \`Calypso' (currently being restored in France!). Finding a matching set of the first 20 volumes is difficult enough and a matching set of all 21 is almost impossible.That said, full matching sets of either 20 or 21 books are occasionally offered for sale but they are soon snapped up. My own 21 volumes were purchased here and there and do not match at all. Nevertheless, I would much rather own a complete unmatched set than not have these books readily to hand because they are full of information which is as relevant today as it ever was.The volumes are: 1. Oasis in Space, 2. The Act of Life, 3. Quest for Food, 4. Window in the Sea, 5. The Art of Motion, 6, Attack and Defence, 7. Invisible Messages, 8. Instinct and Intelligence, 9. Pharaohs of the Sea, 10. Mammals in the Sea, 11. Provinces of the Sea, 12. Man Re-Enters Sea, 13. A Sea of Legends, 14. Adventure of Life, 15. Outer and Inner Space, 16. The Whitecaps, 17. Riches of the Sea, 18. Challenges of the Sea, 19. The Sea in Danger, 20. Guide to the Sea and Index and, of course, 21. Calypso.Each book is approx. 145 pages and by purchasing individual volumes at the best possible price, it is comparatively easy to collect a full unmatched set.Many years later, the content was condensed into a single book called \`The Ocean World' although this is slightly different.Whereas some information may be out-of-date, the reality of the underlying message in each volume remains as relevant today as it was when first written and I fully recommend this series of books.Altogether, well worth the effort of obtaining a full set of 21!NM"},{"Title":"The science of a new life","review":"Published in 1869, The Science of a New Life carries a powerful message for today's sex saturated culture.

In its effort to present data in a succint list like format, it has lost the subtleties necessarry to assist physicians in training in making informed decisions.

On the Wards as an acting intern (MS4) or as an intern (pgy-1), I need something like Ferri. During my internship, I used this book and another handbook called \\"Critical Care Medicine: Current Clinical Strategies\\" and found that I had all the reference material I ever needed in my labcoat.I agree that the size is slightly awkard for a pocketbook.

Rather, it is a reasonably comprehensiive, easily accessible, and up-to-date guide for day to day decision making on the wards. It does not replace Harrison's, and it won't make you a brilliant physician, but for quick reminders of everyday resident level problems, it's hard to beat.

I was introduced to this book by my intern 2 years ago when I was a student during the first week of my gen med rotation. It was great then, and it is great now. I hate carrying stuff in my white coat, especially books of this size. But I refer to it constantly during the day. In rounds, in the ED while working up a patient, while reviewing a patient's labs. Numerous times each day. I have two students with me now, and I've convinced them after one week that they should buy this book. It's that good.Details, ie, what it offers.DDX, there is a DDX section in the front for common presenting symptoms. This is perhaps the books only weakness. It is too scant. Many common symptoms aren't included. The differentials offered are adequate, but the section could be expanded.Systems Based Chapters. CV, Pulm, GI, ID,Neuro, Renal etc. The stuff you see everday on the wards is reviewed very well, with signs, symptoms, diagnostic workup and treatment. These chapters are not everything you need to know. I do more reading at night on specific ailments my patients are presenting with. But in the ED when you are accepting a thyroid storm, CVA, GIB, whatever, its there and it will get you through the admission and the evening until morning rounds with the attending.Another great feature is the section that helps to interpret many labs you may order. Elevated, normal or low anything, and it provides a great differential. It can make you look smart on rounds.Finally, there is a short formulary in the back, which I never refer to since I have both pharmacopaeia (spelling?) and epocrates.This book is great for med students and transitional interns. Prelims and categoricals probably can pass on this. I'd say the next step is the little red book put out by Stanford (Standford Internal Medicine pocket guide? Not sure of the name.)

By the time he's finished, traditional, speculative philosophies are dead, buried and left without a headstone. (That these &quot;undead&quot; philosophies continue stalk the land, well, that's another story...)According to Reichenbach - and his logic is impeccable - while the rationalist philosophers painted their mystical canvases, the parallel development of science, and scientific method handed the empiricists the tools they needed to produce the first grounded philosophic view. The search for certainty had the classic philosophers barking up the wrong tree. And meanwhile, the exploration of the microscopic world, coupled with the creation of a new mathematical tool - statistics - bootstrapped the scientific community into a model of the universe that was not causal, but probabilistic.And what of ethics? Just as there are no absolute answers to the physical world, Reichenbach leaves the moral bucket empty as well. Your ethics, he argues, are ultimately what you choose to posit for yourself.There is much more, lurking in this dense and difficult book. Published in 1951 - two years prior to his death - this is a tour-de-force of a man who was a contemporary of Einstein, and a participant in the famed &quot;Weiner Kreiss&quot; (Vienna Circle) which included such mighty minds as Kurt Godel. (See my review of D. Hofstadter's &quot;Godel, Escher, Bach...&quot;) Reichenbach was one hot potato, armed with superior weaponry, and ready to take on the world.The tragedy of this pursuit of consistency, which is the trademark of the scientific view, is that it probably will never come to guide society at large. Empty as it is, it is unacceptable to the majorities, whom Reichenbach was certainly not writing to, and who have no working concept of the scientific method. Most people do not want to hear that there are no ultimate answers.One very big problem I see with this philosophy lies not with its truthfulness, but in its usefulness. We humans have a tough situation all around. We have a state of awareness which far exceeds that of our animal brethren, but we are bound with all the other animal traits, including mortality. Therefore, since we became aware of our frailties, we have consistently sought a coping mechanism. The rationalist view offered some hope - be it a blatant lie - but scientific philosophy, alas, does not. In truth, it runs counter to any coping mechanism one might choose to create. It is certainly not a philosophy for the weak and sick. This is the largest difficulty I see with its acceptance. As correct as Reichenbach may be, how can we stomach sending our children into a world where there's no intrinsic good or bad? How can we prepare them? The search for an easy answer may be wrong - but it's easy! And like water, humanity will likely take the easy path. There are many sweeter smelling flowers out there. Why choose this one? The author could have spent some effort making this philosophy more appealing to the masses, but he chose not to.So is it just for scientists after all? The implications of scientists, blindly searching for more empty knowledge, as pawns of the capitalists, guided by a philosophy of blind greed, creating new and better tools and toys for the rest of us, yields a rather uncomfortable image in my mind of the future of the human race. But, after all, it truly doesn't matter what we do. And even though the truth is sometimes a bit scary, I do like the concept of creating my own vision and values.Now it's true that humans created both traditional and scientific philosophy, and however different their origins may have been, they are both here to stay. Are there any implications for the future of society in general? After reading this book, I would have to say: &quot;Probably&quot;.Very interesting book, but not for everyone."},{"Title":"The Rise of Scientific Philosophy","review":"I am only half way through this AMAZING book, and the revelations are incredible. The first third is a history of philosophy and epistemology up until Kant, and shows you what true science is all about. This is a manifest for clear thought, if I've ever seen one, and I have... Carl Sagan's &quot;The Demon-Haunted World&quot;. This book explains everything with reason and rationale, he has not yet gone into the metaphysic to explain anything. He doesn't expect the reader to go to another source, he explains it all in the book, says who he got it from, even what book. If you ever wanted to know what the scientific philosophy truly was you have to read this. It is not just about its rise, but explains WHAT it is, with that very important geneological information about how it came about. If you are religious, watch out. It will really shake your world, and you will understand why the highest percentage of agnostics is found in the intellectual, scientific fields that required the intellectual philosophic framework of science in order to be comprehended completely. EVERY SCIENCE STUDENT SHOULD READ THIS!

He claims that \\"everyone's guy is the best\\". Certainly this can be true for many authors as well.This is not the case here because I am not enamored with his other works. But in the Rise of Scientific Philosophy, Reichenbach brings you through questions and observations which need addressing. He begins his assault on poor Philosophy on page three, and continues through the book. He separates out the poetic philosophers, from the more tough minded philosophers that actually say something.I don't think that I am exaggerating when I write: I don't believe someone can truly say they have some philosophical background without having read and digested the work contained with in Reichenbach's book.But, it is not an easy read, and will take time. But the time taken is very much worth it.Note: I must confess that I bought my copy of the book fully a year before actually reading it."},{"Title":"The Rise of Scientific Philosophy","review":"I read Reichenbach's Rise of Scientific Philosophy when I was a freshman in college, forty years ago. I have read many books over the years, but to this day I would say that this is the most influential book of my life. I started college as an ordinary Christian protestant. A philosophy course taught me about critical thinking. Then I started reading Reichenbach over Christmas vacation and I found it so fascinating that I couldn't put it down. I underlined a lot of passages. I added lots of exclamation points!!! By the time I was finished I was no longer a Christian. I was an atheist. Reichenbach makes it clear that you don't have to have religion to be a good, moral person. For a while I was a militant atheist, but I soon matured out of that. Still wanting something to belong to, I was a Humanist with a capital H for awhile. Then I joined an ultra-liberal Unitarian church that didn't require people to believe any doctrine, but which discussed all sorts of philosophical and religious views and emphasized the importance of freedom of speech and religion. Now, after much reading in psychology, anthropology and philisophy, I continue to be fascinated by the need for religion as a universal human characteristic. Nobody can deny the power of religious beliefs to affect human emotions and behavior, for both good and evil. But some people are capable of deeper, more critical thinking about religion. Some people have the strength to exist and thrive without a God, but with love for people, for human rights, and for the natural world. This book is for those people. ..."},{"Title":"The Rise of Scientific Philosophy","review":"It should be pointed out at the outset that while the author of the present classic book was a logical positivist, the author of the present review is not. Indeed, I think that basically all the central claims of the logical positivists were false. However, this important book goes far beyond the central claims of the logical positivist movement and I very much like the spirit in which it was written. Reichenbach tries to show how philosophy can (and ought to) benefit from modern science and, I think, how modern science can benefit from a philosophy that does away with certain outdated ways of thinking. He draws an important distinction between what he calls \\"speculative philosophy\\", on the one hand, and \\"scientific philosophy\\", on the other hand. The former is identified with the old and associated with building philosophical systems, while the latter is concerned with refining the questions (by logical analysis). Also, the speculative philosophy is associated with rationalism, while scientific philosophy is associated with empiricism. The errors of speculative philosophy are traced back to a heavy reliance of analogies and \\"picture language\\" in the place of real explanations and to a misguided search for absolute certainty.Reichenbach is one of those rare individuals that have deep insights into both philosophy and modern science. His insight into mathematics, geometry, logic and physics is impressive. Philosophy cannot remain unchanged after breakthroughs of the Darwinian theory of evolution, Einstein's theory of relativity and the big bang theory, etc. Philosophers need to take note of scientific results that have relevance for philosophic questions and, I believe, scientists need to take note of philosophy. But meeting halfway, as it were, is impossible if the philosopher insists on doing philosophy like Plato and Aristotle did philosophy. One very important thing that Reichenbach takes up is how totally untenable it is to retain a teleological worldview in the face of modern science and how much damage to understanding anthropomorphic ideas has had and sadly continues to have to this day.I think it is fair to say that this book is dated now, but where is a similar book written in this spirit today by someone who is as well read in both philosophy and science as Reichenbach was? Besides, it is very much in line with the attitude of the writer of the book that progress would be made after its publication. He would not consider this book to be a final statement on the topic, but a step in the right direction. I'm certain that progress has been made in almost all the areas on which the book touches, but one area on which I can say with confidence that this is the case is ethics. The chapter on \\"the nature ethics\\" is frustrating for me to read being a moral philosopher myself. Reichenbach thinks that much can be learned by doing a logical analysis of moral language and that if we do so we discover that non-cognitivism is the only way to go. This approach is severely outdated today. He does however discuss the relation of the individual to the group, but without going very deep.In the spirit of the arguments found inside, I think this book should be seen, not as a final statement, but as a statement of the best philosophy at the time of its publication.Fritz- Anton FritzsonLund University,Sweden"},{"Title":"The Rise of Scientific Philosophy","review":"A popular positivist classic, Reichenbach's \\"The Rise of Scientific Philosophy\\" is typical in it's simplistic overconfidence shared with an even \\"greater\\" classic, A.J.Ayer's \\"Language Truth and Logic\\". Both are essential reading to help understand the popular science positivism still embraced and promoted by scientists such as Hawking and Dawkins.Positivism, Logical Positivism or otherwise, contends that scientific knowledge is the only 'true' or genuine knowledge. Facts are scientific; values are subjective preferences (e.g.I like justice; I don't like injustice.)But what of these scientific facts?To positivists, common sense facts such as \\"I was born and I shall die\\" are no more than probable hypotheses. Hypotheses are, until confirmed, mere opinions. And the confirmation is merely provisional since science is endlessly progressive, so all confirmed hypotheses remained subject to revision or refutation ad infinitum.Further, \\"probability statements express relative frequencies of repeated events...They are derived from frequencies observed in the past and include the assumption the same frequencies will hold in the future(p.236). \\"But this assumption has no rational basis. It is not based on any evident necessity; it is a mere assumption. (Leo Strauss; The Origins of Political Science, p.134, Interpretation, Winter 1996, Vol.23,No.2)\\"So, the cognitive status of all scientific facts is that of a non-necessary hypothetical assumption.This is not knowledge; this is just opinion."},{"Title":"The Rise of Scientific Philosophy","review":"As a philosophy professor for three decades, I have taught this wretched book several times in survey courses in 20th century philosophy. It has gone through numerous printings, and so has seemed to capture the respect of a good number of Anglo-American professors. However, Reichenbach's reading of the history of philosophy is wrong on every count; it is no wonder that Einstein, whose student he once was, ridicules Reichenbach in \\"Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist.\\" Although I endeavored to keep my view out of lectures, my undergraduates were able to point to Reichenbach's superficiality and his errors at every turn.So, one might ask--what is its attraction? For people who would like to avoid the considerable labor of studying the great thinkers of the past with seriousness, this book gives them an easy excuse not to. The book is a pathetic exercise in uninformed and biased revisionism."},{"Title":"Kathy Peterson's Great Outdoor Decorating Makeovers: Easy, Elegant Transformations On a Limited Budget","review":"If you aren't using your outdoor space much, it may be time for a makeover. This book takes rather blah patios and turns them into inviting outdoor living spaces. The best part is the price, as the author tries to keep each project under $250.She is helped by the fact that most had decent furniture to start with, so her job was adding some cushions, plants and accessories for a polished look.Probably the main message of the book is to pull your outdoor living space together with a unifying color scheme. Paint any furniture that doesn't match or is shabby. No need to shop for new items, just bring things from inside the house outside.She breaks each project down into steps, showing how the changes meet the homeowners needs. I deducted one star since the book doesn't give actual how-to on the projects (sewing, painting).It is useful to get ideas on grouping your furniture and using color for an attractive outdoor area (pool area, porch, balcony, patio, sunroom, courtyard, etc.)I liked the idea of painting lines on concrete for a faux tile look.

I live in the Southwest where outdoor living is a year 'round experience, and bought the book in hopes of developing a nice outdoor entertaining area.

She gives a wide variety of sample palettes for the \\"color novice.\\" She also teaches the reader about repurposing indoor decorative items to create an attractive outdoor living space. This is good news for those of us who have limited dollars and/or storage space -- it is much more practical to move indoor lamps, vases, cushions, etc. outside for a party and then take them back indoors to use day to day, than it is to purchase, maintain and also find storage for duplicate items to be used exclusively for outdoor entertaining.

It now seems outdated."},{"Title":"Agnosticism and Christianity and Other Essays (Great Mind Series)","review":"The topic of Agnosticism consumes a relatively minor part of this book. It is interesting to read Huxley's exposition on Darwin's theory of evolution and how he makes the case for why it is more plausible than any other theory. While some of what he says would require modification in light of modern evolutionary thought, most of his arguments (using data from anthropology, archaeology, biology, embryology, genetics, geology, etc.) are still valid. Other essays include discussions on epistemology especially with regard to supernaturalism and claims of miracles. Only in the last several pages does Huxley elaborate on the origin and meaning of Agnosticism. In fact, he seems almost reluctant to descend into the discussion. He indulges the reader nevertheless and does a stupendous job of stating the case. A pleasant read on a rainy day."},{"Title":"Agnosticism and Christianity and Other Essays (Great Mind Series)","review":"The chapters in this book mainly come from Huxley's much larger &quot;Science and the Christian Tradition&quot;. If you can get a hold of this book I highly recommend reading it; it takes the reader much farther than &quot;Agnosticism and Christianity&quot;. If you cannot find the larger, then read this book. Huxley very matter of factly lays out why the bible cannot be taken as an authoritative source on its own."},{"Title":"Agnosticism and Christianity and Other Essays (Great Mind Series)","review":"There are a few gems of agnostic wisdom in this book, which concisely state Huxley's case for affirming his agnostic views - that he is without full or final proof or substantiation of the Bible, or of Jesus. For this, the book needs to be read and commended. One could only wish, however, that Huxley spared the ponderously ornate style of English prose that was the habit of the day. This is a good read, but not always an easy read, and certainly if it has engaging moments it also has its tedious ones as well. If Huxley too easily dismisses or reduces religious faith to matter of proof, he at least wisely points out that we must distinguish what faith and facts are."},{"Title":"Agnosticism and Christianity and Other Essays (Great Mind Series)","review":"One of the paradoxes in the life of Thomas Henry Huxley was his ability to demand that science and reason must be uppermost in ordering and bettering the lot of man yet at the same time he could leave an opening for faith and hope, the same qualities that he bashed in the hands of others.In \\"The Method of Scientific Investigation,\\" Huxley outlines with infinite precision the requirements for scientists to present a hypothesis and then establish a series of interlocking steps the totality of which prove that the hypothesis is sound. He attacks the misconception that men of science are somehow detached from the lot of common man in their respective thought processes. While the learned scientist uses fancy terms like inductive and deductive reasoning, which the layman may term common sense, both engage in basically the same acts of reasoning. Further, while the layman may draw an inference from a limited pool of evidence whereas the scientist requires a much larger sample size, there is no inherent incongruity between the two.Early in his career, Huxley tended to focus on the value of the physical sciences. The notion of a more subliminal sense of man in harmony with nature had not yet been central in his thought. In \\"On the Physical Basis of Life,\\" Huxley reduces all living matter on earth to its constituent parts of protoplasm. Regardless of species, all life shared a common link. Even here, however, Huxley was beginning to generate the controversy that would later rise to a vicious crescendo. There were many who objected to being linked to a lowly crustacean. Even otherwise learned men of science had a difficult time assimilating such an ego-shattering notion.The concept of a paradoxical melding of science to faith appears initially in \\"A Liberal Education.\\" Here, Huxley insists that brute nature is the best teacher for all areas of life. Regardless of the discipline involved, Nature teaches faster and more effectively than a phalanx of human professors might. Punishment and reward are meted out with devastating finality and with no verbal comment. When Huxley writes that it is possible to mitigate the harshness of the lessons that a brute Nature might impose, the result would be one who has become one with that Nature. Huxley is skimpy on the details of this transformation possibly because he was thinking of a theoretical paradigm that had no counterpart in reality. Further, to produce a man who is the product of a Darwinian weeding out of those who can pass Nature's unbending rules of conduct from those who cannot might also produce an automaton that is no less than robot-like in its world view. Huxley had been hammered numerous times on this very point by those who wished to discredit his position on the supremacy of reason so it is likely that he would toss in a deliberately ill-defined bone of contention to produce a nineteenth century Renaissance man that all could look to with approval.Huxley's mixture of science and humanity is seen again in \\"Science and Culture.\\" The contrast between the two is stark. Huxley praises the virtues of the Josiah Mason School of Science as the very breeding ground for the qualities needed to assure the continuing pre-eminence of England at a time when it might have been forgivable to see the sun set on the Union Jack. This Huxley was determined to prevent. His opposition was less the theological barbs of the Church of England than the entrenched Latinate culture of the post-Renaissance. Even in Huxley's day, much of England's learned elite he saw as mired in the obsolete erudition of the Roman focus on art and literature. To be erudite was to know more of Cicero than Archimedes. If England were to remain competitive as a world power, Cicero would have to take a back seat to the Greek mathematician. Yet, as in \\"A Liberal Education,\\" Huxley could not irrevocably extirpate the entire continuum of classic education of the liberal arts. He closes with the paradoxical comment that somewhere in science there must be a place for liberals like Cicero.Thus, for Huxley, the notion of a paradox remains just that. It was truly impossible for him to rationalize to any degree of convincing certitude that though reason and pure logic must be in the ascendant, there could yet be a place in science, in industry, and in life for those with a literary bent. He did not resolve this dilemma but his insistence on the power of science to better the common lot of man rings as true today as in his time."},{"Title":"Agnosticism and Christianity and Other Essays (Great Mind Series)","review":"Huxley is one of my favorite authors. I haven't read this book but I have read Science and Christian Tradition from which most of these essays are derived. Stephen J. Gould said of Huxley, \\"Great and passionate writing does not only appear in novels. As a prose stylist, a few nineteenth-century scientists [Playfair, Lyell, and Huxley in particular] rank with the finest Victorian fiction writers.\\" I couldn't agree more."},{"Title":"The Corner Stone","review":"The review given by Loretta is rife with mistakes. Walter Hinz neither claimed to be a channel through whom spirits communicated nor claimed to have any psychic ability whatsoever. Hinz makes it CLEAR in his book what the sources are for the contents of his book. The content is derived from three waves of Christian spiritism: (1) 1890s in Munich in a circle among whom were the scientists Carl du Prel and Bernhard Forsboom--the instructing spirit was known as Emanuel and manifested through automatic writing, later collected and published as Buch Emanuel by Hinz and Forsboom; (2) Johannes Greber's Communication with the Spirit World; and (3) the teachings given through the Swiss medium Beatrice Brunner who for decades was a medium for the spirits Josef, Lene, and Linus; Brunner and her circle followed the instructions laid down in the Greber book during the late 1940s (1948?) and the circle grew over the years into a community, Geistige Loge Zurich, that published monthly journals of the transcripts of Brunner's tape recorded and video taped trance lectures given by the spirits, Geistige Welt (published also in English as The Spiritual World). As Hinz states as to the source of the contents of his book, \\"In the remaing chapters I shall be drawing solely on the Emmanuel Book, on Greber's book, and--mostly--on the teachings received by the Spiritual Lodge of Zurich\\" (p. 36). Hinz received his Doctrate from the University of Leipzig and became the Director of the Institute for Persian Studies at the illustrious University of Gottingen until his retirement in 1975. His interests in spirits and the spirit world grew from lectures he attended given by Hans Driesch on parapsychology. The book, The Cornerstone, is a very enlightening book that loosens the shackles of old Christian traditions without, however, loosing the true essence of Christianity. Hinz begins with accounts of the experiences of humans who have died and departed into spirit, their descriptions of being physically \\"dead\\" but really \\"alive\\" as a spirit in the spirit world; reincarnation as a fundamental teaching of Christianity that was lost early on; God's creation and Plan of Salvation; and spiritism as the earliest form of Christian religious experience (1 Corinthians 12-14). There is nothing non-Christian about communicating with the spirit world; see The Shepherd of Hermas, Mandate 11, The Didache 11, Montanism, and 1 Corinthians 12 and 14. Hinz's book offers relief to the inquisitive mind who is uncertain about life after death and who is uncertain about the way in which Christianity is presented today. His book serves as a road map to the hereafter; a road map that many people desparately need. The reviewer Loretta has apparently not read carefully enough. With such carelessness on her part, one wonders if her recommendations for White Eagle are worth while."},{"Title":"The Corner Stone","review":"It is an excellent book and I have recommended it to several people who have bought it meanwhile who really enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"The Corner Stone","review":"Walter Hinz was a self styled mystic who went into trance and channelled spirits who gave this account. Walter had no way of knowing who was telling the stories he has published and swallowed this load of lies like there was no to-morrow!

If you are looking for some true spiritual teaching get into White Eagle and see and read the difference in the messages, the way the stories are told and the simple beauty and lovingness with which White Eagle speaks. There is a world of difference between the teachings of WHite Eagle and the teaching of the spirits which Walter Hinz channelled. Sadly, Mr. Hinz was fooled and published a ridiclous and stupid interpretation of the beginning of God's world and the story of evolution.

Chantal Sicile-Kira's goal is to save parents \\"countless hours of precious time and heartache\\" by sharing what she has learned navigating through the various systems. She has an autistic child of her own and she knows the ropes having spent \\"tens of thousands of hours\\" learning about autism and the treatments and interventions available, and how the various support and governmental groups and organizations work.She begins by debunking myths about autism while providing a little history including some sharp commentary about Bruno Bettelheim, the psychotherapist who thought that autism was caused by \\"refrigerator mothers\\" of cold affect who pushed their children into emotional isolation. She emphasizes that autism is a \\"spectrum disorder\\" that is becoming more and more prevalent without a clear etiology.She follows this with a chapter explaining what ASDs are and \\"How to Know If a Person Has One.\\" She addresses herself to parents who have absolutely no experience with autism, parents who have no idea what to do or how to feel. In Chapter 3 she looks into the causes and attempts to explain why people with ASDs act the way they do. Then she guides parents to what to expect and what to do after a diagnosis of autism. In Chapter 5 she comments on treatments, therapies, and interventions.What Sicile-Kira does so well is to make the reader understand and appreciate what it is like to be a parent of an autistic child, what family life can be like with siblings, what the educational prospects are, how one fits into the community and what the future may hold. Autism spectrum disorders are becoming better and better understood all the time, and there is even a school of thought that suggests that, in their milder forms, to look for a \\"cure\\" may be a misdirection because many autistics have a unique and valuable way of viewing the world and living life.This is a personal book, but it is also a professional book. There is an appendix giving \\"Parent Ratings of Behavioral Effects of Biomedical Interventions\\": which drugs have or have not been effective, how non-drug supplements have or have not helped, and the effect of special diets. There is a section on \\"Resources,\\" including ASD-Specific Organizations, general organizations, governmental agencies, books; and there's a bibliography.If you want an introduction to autism and the world of autism from a parental and a professional point of view, this is an excellent place to start."},{"Title":"Autism Spectrum Disorders: The Complete Guide to Understanding Autism, Asperger's Syndrome, Pervasive Developmental Disorder, and Other ASDs","review":"I am a graduate student doing research on autism, and this book provided a fantastic amount of information.

So in a panic I went looking for resources to fill the gaps in knowledge I had about this disorder. I found this book and jumped right into Chapter 4, and I've been hooked from there. It's an easy read full of great ideas about what to do now and how to move forward.My only critic are the story box's that get placed in the middle of a sentence and run on for a page or 2, it throws off my reading groove, I want to keep reading though now I have to search for where it picks up again.So if your child has this disorder or you know a child that does, READ THIS BOOK. If you suspect that your child may have this problem, get this book and get them screened.

This is the first resource I have gotten on the subject. It has helped to find other resources (Autism-Digest, ASA, etc.). Chapter 2 helped to explain my problem to me. I especially enjoyed chapter 9 since I am an adult now and have to make the best of it. I do disagree with her on page 311 where she encourages \\"it takes a village to raise children\\". No it does not! It takes the parents to raise children! Grandparents, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, friends, and churches can help the parents, but it is the parent's responsibility for their children--no one else! I also disgree on page 162 where she encourages letting teenage boys masturbate by scheduling a time for it every day. Teenage boys need to be taught to resist lusting and wait for marriage. SOme of things I liked in chapter 9 dealing with adulthood were: 1. page 290 where she encourages us to use whatever talents you have to impress people in order to get a job (I happen to be known as the \\"singing mailman\\" at the private Bible college that I work at--the facutly and students like it), 2. on pages 305-6, she talks about being married to someone with ASD (I am not married and not able to drive a car, but I am reminded about women often by people here--I do know it will not easy because I am \\"different\\"), and on page 283, she mentioned that families and friends not the government should be helping us! I agree! Most people in America think it is the government's job to do everything for them! I am not against the government giving tax breaks for people looking after disabled people, but I do not need them to force someone to hire me, or make them like me!

I enjoyed the well written story and was surprised by the woman's journey into a life with purpose. Will read more of this series of books."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"First let me say I am am avid western book reader and author myself. I regard Zane Grey's Call of the Canyon as one of the most powerful romance books ever written. I know many people who regard this and Rider's of the Purple Sage, to be Zane Grey's best books, and amoung the best adventure fiction books ever. Each year visitors by the thousands do their best to retrace the footsteps of these eastern lovers who had Gone West. It is a tale that never seems to go out of fashion, and indeed seems to fulfill some great need in each reader lucky enough to hear the Call of the Canyon."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect from Call of the Canyon. I've download a lot of free titles to my Kindle, assuming that most are going to be terrible. This was a pleasant surprise! Not knowing much about the author or the period in which this book was written, I eventually determined that it was likely to be written around the same time period of the story. The biggest give-away to me was the at-times lengthy social commentary, which I could have done with less of. Not that I agree nor disagree with the sentiments shared by the author, the way it was handled felt a little out of place.I will also add that I found myself skimming the lengthy descriptions of Arizona, mostly because I've never been and some of the imagery was a little hard for me to visualize. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and I definitely feel like that applies here.Overall, it was a great love story (which I admit I am a sucker for) that was hard for me to put down, and at the end, I wished it would continue. Because of that, I've already downloaded a handful of other works by Zane Grey to read."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"The story set in the 1920s New York and Arizona is a wonderful romance. The descriptions of the canyons and desert make me want to pack up the car and head out for an extended vacation in Arizona right away. The descriptions are indeed moving.The downside of the novel for me is just a little bit too much \\"philosophy\\" out of the post WW1 era. Grey harps a little to much on his ideal American Woman, American Family, the contrast between the idle rich in New York and the working folks out on the range in The West. There is way too much writing on the plight of W.W.I vets when they returned to America. But in spite of a lot of pages devoted to teaching Grey's message there is a wonderful romantic story to be enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"I am 73 years old and always loved to read.

Thank you Kindle.The Call of the Canyon"},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"If one understands the time between WWI and WWII and the excesses of the 1920's this book is excellent! Remember this book was written in 1934 at the height of the great depression! Yet it reflects on the era of the 1920's. While some of the values that Grey espouses in the book seem out of date and old fashioned, I think his themes are timeless.The book also provides beautiful descriptions of the Arizona desert and rural life in the western U.S. The story line is quite good and Grey deals effectively with love, conflict, jealousy, and what makes our struggles worthwhile. Enjoy this classic!"},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"This is my first Zane Grey book I've ever read. I was expecting an old-fashioned Western with cowboys, six shooters, \\"purty\\" school marms and villians in black hats. This book isn't about that at all.What it is is part condemnation of America's shoddy treatment of its returning soldiers after World War I, and part condemnation of the modern women of the times.Zane Grey, using the voices of his fictional characters, rants against \\"modern feminine unrest\\" (AKA feminism), the immoral dress of the flapper (Heavens, her ankles are showing!) and says the women are, and I quote, \\"idle, luxrious, selfish, pleasure-craving, lazy, useless, work-and-children shirking, absolutely no good.\\"In one memorable scene, Grey has his heroine Carly preaching about the evils of such things as motion pictures, automobiles, jazz, birth control and plucking eyebrows. Oddly, Grey seems to be obsessed with a low birth rate in the nation and refers several times in the book to the fact that women aren't having babies like they should. It makes me curious as to what exactly was going on in the early 1920's.So while this book wasn't what I was expecting it to be, it turned out to be an interesting take on what post-World War I America appeared to be to one man."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"While on vacation in AZ and after my tour of the Grand Canyon this past September (our guide recommended to read \\"Call of the Canyon\\" by Zane Grey.) I decided to purchase the kindle version after the tour (started reading while in AZ) and actually got it for nothing, so it was even better. I really enjoy the way Zane Grey writes. In my mind I can visualize the scenery as I did when I drove through Oak Creek Canyon. It was absolutely beautiful and breath taking! I have to admit that USA does have the best mountains in the world. I'm from NY but not Manhattan and I could almost compare myself to the character of Carley Burch. She travelled to AZ by train, myself by plane (4 flights to different airports!). Following her true love after her many situations and indecisions, she finally makes her last attempt to return to Glenn. As they say, true love conquers all. Right now I am reading another one of his books called \\"Greatest Hits of Grey\\". I also have 2 others which I can not wait to read! After reading \\"Call of the Canyon\\" it keeps my memories fresh of my visit to Sedona and travelling through Oak Creek Canyon!!! I've become a fan of Zane Grey!!"},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"The Call of the Canyon is another of Zane Grey's \\"war novels\\" which is to say, it deals with the subject of the mistreatment of returning veterans from the first world war. But it is also the coming of age of a modern \\"sophisticated\\" woman who learns the real meaning of love, and what it means to love someone. The story has several scenes which take place in New York City as well as at Oak Creek Canyon in Arizona. For pure romance, this book can not be beat. Carly Birch is one of Zane Grey's finest female characters, and again I will say he often wrote from the woman's point of view which is why the vast majority of his work was published in the leading \\"women's\\" magazines of the day, and his readership was more than half women. So, ladies, please don't dismiss Zane Grey as a \\"western\\" writer; he was so much more than that."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"I just love this book, so far I've only read it 3 times, but it is certainly one of my very favorites. Zane Gray describes with exacting detail the wondrous beauty of the west, with the the struggles of a romantic relationship between a wounded returning WW1 veteran and his girl friend, who just happens to be a headstrong New Yorker used to having things her way.The story is timeless and exciting and I highly recommend it if you enjoy the west, love and a turn of the century American adventure."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"I'm a long-time Zane Grey fan and thought I'd read all his Westerns, but apparently I'd missed this one. While I agree with the other reviewers about his compelling descriptions of the West and its beauty, overall I found the story both boring and didactic. Missing were the memorable characters of many other of his books; missing also was the kind of action that makes it hard to put my Kindle down. I'm afraid that I can give it only two stars."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"I must beg to differ with the other reviewers. I found this book to becompetently written and full of beautiful images of the landscape of themagnificent American West, but the love story, the social commentary,the cardboard characters, and the rigid, intolerant, and sometimesabsurd ideas left me cold.Glenn Kilbourne returns from the First World War in Europe and goes westto recover his health. His old New York City fiancee, Carly Burch, goesto visit him in hopes of luring him back to New York. But Glenn haschanged. He's become a man of the west, a farmer and hog raiser, amanual laborer, an outdoorsman, a man among men. Carly tried mightilyto prove her worthiness by riding horses and sharing his life, butultimately returns to New York. Once there, she sees the shallowness ofher city life and finally goes west again.Grey's idea of manhood and womanhood are about as stereotyped and malechauvinist as one can get. I can't cite page numbers here because Iread the book as a Gutenberg download on a PDA, but I've got the exactquotes. Let's listen to a few of them:Glenn to Carly speaking about Carly's female friends:...\\"The best of you girls regard marriage as an escape,instead of responsibility. You don't marry to get yourshoulders square against the old wheel of Americanprogress -- to help some man make good -- to bring atroop of healthy American kids into the world. Youbare your shoulders to the gaze of the multitude andlike it best if you are strung with pearls.\\"...Perhaps you didn't realize that the American soldiers who went to Francein 1918 were fighting to keep the Germans from violating the women ofNew York and Wisconsin.Glenn's injured friend Rust from Wisconsin, speaking to Carly:...\\"You see, we soldiers all had feelings. And in onething we all felt alike. That was we were going tofight for our home and our women. I should say womenfirst. No matter what we read or heard about standingby our allies, fighting for liberty of civilization,the truth was we all felt the same, even if we neverbreathed.... Glenn fought for you. I fought forNell.... We were not going to let the Huns treat you asthey treated French and Belgian girls.\\"...Perhaps there are some women in the U.S. who don't feel a need to marryor raise children. Maybe they even like to dance or listen to jazz!And to think that instead of raising good American kids, they're lettingforeigners come in and pollute our race. For shame says Zane Grey....\\"Nothing wrong with jazz -- where the lights go out inthe dance hall and the dancers jiggle and toddle andwiggle in a frenzy? Nothing wrong in a country wherethe greatest college cannot report birth of one childto each graduate in ten years? Nothing wrong with racesuicide and the incoming horde of foreigners?\\"...I know that this was written in an earlier period, but even in the1920's there were people in the U.S. who struggled for women's rightsand who did not see \\"the incoming horde of foreigners\\" as bringing aboutAmerican \\"race suicide\\". And while many disagreed about why we shouldor should not fight in the war, I should think that everybody with anyunderstanding of current events in the 1920's understood that World WarI had nothing to do with protecting the women of America from Germanrapists.Grey was a throwback to a primitive mentality, anti-urban, anti-foreign,anti-female, anti-intellectual. The \\"love story\\", such as it was, wasnothing but a story of a woman's complete submission to a man. Therewas zero accommodation of the man to the woman. It was 100% the otherway around.I couldn't take either the ideas or the love story seriously. I'll giveit two stars for its beautiful depiction of the west and for it'scompetent writing. But I think that even that may be generous."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"This book is real good, but there is some places where he does tend to over write. He talks a bit too much on mormons."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"As a teen I read every Zane Grey book I could get my hands on. Now in my 70's I enjoyed it as much as then.

The storyline is a love story, but the author dwells more on his views and tries to usealot of words to explain the surroundings. The physical dimensions of thebook was too large & bulky. Again, if your interest is in love stories, thenyou might enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"It is 1919 and Carley Burch is a young orphaned woman who lives a socialite's life of ease and pleasure in her New York City family home with her aunt Mary. Her fianc&eacute; Glenn Kilbourne has come home an injured, sick, and broken man after fighting in France during World War I, so he has gone West to Arizona, near Flagstaff, that he might recover his health. However, Glenn's letters to Carley are becoming increasingly puzzling, so she makes a surprise visit to see him. While there she stays in the lodge run by his neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Hutter and their daughter Flo, who seems to be sweet on Glenn, and meets their hired men, Charley and Lee, the latter of whom had been Flo's boyfriend. She also meets the rude, crude Raze Huff, a sheep dipper who has eyes for her.Glenn has become a hog farmer and realizes that he can never return to his former shallow life. Carley, while she loves the West, thinks that she can never be the wife of a simple hog farmer, so she breaks their engagement and returns to New York. However, even though she throws herself back into her socialite's life, she finds it empty and unsatisfying. Finally, she decides that she must return to Arizona and marry Glenn. When she arrives, Glenn and the Hutters are away to buy hogs. She even purchases land near Glenn's farm which he had earlier expressed a desire to obtain so that he might expand his operations, and has a house built on it. So what will she do when she hears a rumor that during her absence Glenn has married Flo? Zane Grey was one of the favorite authors of my father, who enjoyed Westerns. Not all of Grey's books were bang-bang, shoot-\`em-up cowboy stories of the Old West, like his most famous one, Riders of the Purple Sage (1912).The Call of the Canyon is a more contemporary, romantic tale, yet it still is characterized by a love of the West that shines through in his so many of Grey[s other novels. It is filled with beautiful, lengthy descriptions of the Arizona countryside and a passion for the West and its scenery. I found it an enjoyable book. Carley's ultimate conclusions about the emptiness of her life in response to her friends' pleas are just as relevant today as they were in her time. This excellent story opposes drinking, smoking, immodesty and strongly opposes idleness, selfishness, and living for high society, and it strongly advocates man as bread winner and woman as homemaker, wife, and mother. But it is marred by a few profanities. There are also several references to dancing and one reference to the Grand Canyon's existence for \\"millions of years,\\" but many instances of gratitude to God for blessings and beauty are found. I recommend it for teens and adults."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"This is primarily Grey's diatribe and condemnation of the lack of support of returning WWI combat veterans. A historical note: Those vets received no benefits and more than 200,000 U.S. soldiers suffered physical or mental injuries during The Great War, but in 1919 only 217 had completed rehabilitation programs. That sad chapter has similarities with the Walter Reed Hospital scandal over substandard treatment of U.S. troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan.Bless Grey for taking up the cause back in the day, it must not have been very popular to do so at the time, but it got weary hearing one of the primary characters wax on and on about that issue. In addition, I had a real problem with the ending...suffice to say it would not have played out that way. He wrote better books."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"Less western, more what makes a woman tick.

Most are free also!"},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"Let's start with the price: You can't beat free!Now on to the book itself:From a technical standpoint, the formatting is pretty clean as far as free e-books go. No weird typographical issues and no maps or pictures to worry about.I'll assume that if you're reading reviews you might actually want to read the book, so I'll try not to include any spoilers, but some brief plot summary: It's the story of a wealthy young Eastern socialite whose fiance has returned from the first World War a changed man, physically and mentally. He goes West to find his health and himself, with the idea that he'll return when all is well. They correspond until she eventually heads West to find and woo him, in the process realizing that she too has changed. Their fate together remains in doubt until the end.The author includes some wonderful descriptive passages about the Oak Creek Canyon/Sedona/Flagstaff area of Arizona in the early decades of the 20th century, which I very much enjoyed, having lived in that area, but also sprinkles the second half of the tale with what can only be described as diatribes about the loose morals of the time: revealing feminine attire, which he blames for enticing rape; jazz music (the horror!); automobiles (with back seats!); along with birth control (race suicide!) socialism and the influx of foreigners."},{"Title":"The Call of the Canyon","review":"I downloaded this on a whim after reading the previous reviews, and it turned out to be a good find from the public domain. It is both an engrossing love story and a social commentary that is surprisingly in line with our own times. At times, the characters could be talking about the early 21st century and not the early 20th century. I loved Carley's journey towards authentic womanhood even more than the beautiful descriptions of the West. The story grabbed me completely and I found myself rapidly skimming large sections just to get to the end. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Football stars of 1967","review":"The players profiled areLance AlworthDick BassBobby BellBill BrownWillie DavisBob HayesSonny JurgensonAlex KarrasLeroy KellyDon MeredithJoe NamathJim NanceDan ReevesGeorge SaimesGale SayersSteve SpurrierBart StarrOtis TaylorJohhny UnitasLarry WilsonI enjoyed this book because it's old and it gives info on many Hall Of Famers."},{"Title":"Born free","review":"This has been one of my favorite stories, so I recently purchased it in the hardcover binding from Econo clad Books.

Well, I made the mistake of watching it one night on cable and couldn't stop crying. No joke. I was still crying the next day. It upset me. So I got the book &quot;Born Free,&quot; and read it in just two or three days. I felt better after reading the book, because in the movie, Elsa, the lion, being left alone to fend for herself in the wild seemed very cruel to me. I got angry at Joy Adamson. The book shows that Elsa wasn't just thrown out into the wild all of a sudden. It was more gradual. I still felt sorry for Elsa though. I think Elsa should have been sent to the zoo (in Holland I think) with her sisters. She died way too young. Joy was very selfish in keeping Elsa and then forcing her to learn how to live in the wild when she had been so domesticated and pampered as a house pet. She really wasn't thinking of Elsa, only of herself."},{"Title":"Born free","review":"An excellent, well-written book! Elsa will truly capture your heart. I loved learning about the African land and the challenges of the Adamson's journeys. The pictures throughout the book are great. This book really grabbed my attention and my emotions. Joy Adamson did an excellent job of telling this story. She makes the reader feel like you are there. You will become attached to Elsa--She is amazing and remains forever loyal to the Adamsons. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Born free","review":"Born Free is an intriguing story of a European couple finding and raising three lion cubs. After a brief period, the must send two to a zoo in Holland, but the story continues with the life of the smallest cub named Elsa. The habits(good and bad)of Elsa were nicely written and sometimes very amusing, especially her tendency to play with elephants. During this book, Elsa goes from cub to lioness and the story tells you everything that happens in between. It was very interesting to learn what comes instinctively to a lion, and what is generally taught by a mother. The latter portion of the book is mostly devoted to trying to release Elsa to the wild/teaching her how to survive on her own. This gets a tad repetitive in places, but even then it is saved by exciting moments and fascinating wildlife.The couple who raised Elsa also took many photos that are shown in this book. The pictures are beautiful, sometimes humorous, and always very interesting. I would recommend this book to any cat-lover over age 12."},{"Title":"Born free","review":"It only took me a week to read through this biography. My son has quickly adopted to calling it \\"the lion book\\". It was a fairly neutral tale, when I was expecting ridiculous animal love (treating them as humans to dress and flaunt) or ridiculous animal rights (they sent Elsa's sisters to a well-kept zoo, showing they see the worth in them). It was a wonderful tale of their life with Elsa the lioness, and their attempts not to hinder her in the wild, but to teach her to live freely in it. A really enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Born free","review":"I heard of the Adamsons - Joy (the author) and George (her husband) - when I read the book A Lion Called Christian, in which they had helped rehabilitate Christian back into the wild. However, their work with lions had been going on for a while before Christian, so I was very excited to read Born Free and see how Joy and George got started.And it all began with Elsa. Born Free is the account and adventure of Elsa the lioness's life, and the difficult task Elsa provided for her human parents, Joy and George Adamson. Raised by the Adamsons since she was a baby, she treated them as her lion pride, and they treated her as their child, however never forgot the fact that she was a wild lion. Her life with them flew by as she grew from a cub into a full-size, and eventually a wild, lioness.Besides the story itself, my favorite part of the book was how it was written. Joy Adamson has written quite a few books - all of which I hope to read - and her written language reads like she is having a face-to-face conversation with the reader. Her writing flows, and it feels as if you are experiencing Elsa's life with the Adamsons. Joy is a professional painter and photographer, and her beautiful pictures of Elsa, Africa, and the unlikely family's adventures are scattered throughout the pages, which makes it an even more intriguing read. The ending of the book is comprised of letters which George sent from Africa to Joy when she was finishing the book in England, and this aspect gives an even more personal touch to the readers.I'm a sucker for animal stories - especially if they are true - so Born Free was one of those books that touched my heart and stayed in my mind for a while after I read it. I was sad when they had to eventually try and release Elsa back into the wild because come on, who doesn't want a lioness as a pet?!

I must have read the book twenty times, and it has had a lifelong impact on me.Joy Adamson captures not only Elsa's story, but the Adamson's love of Africa, the people,the animals, the land itself. Through Born Free I learned of the complex personalities and emotions that animals have, just as we do. I learned that there are many ways to live your life - a job, a family and a suburb are not the only options.Through the difficulty the Adamson's had in finding a suitable wild home for Elsa, that I learned that the world is under tremendous pressure from human expansion, and became conscious of our responsiblity to ensure survival for creatures who cannot speak to defend themselves against our incursions.Born Free is sometimes treated as a children's book - as though that were some reflection of diminished quality. But the ideas and values I absorbed as a girl from Joy and George Adamson, from Elsa and her cubs, were complex and important -- they have been with me my whole life.And I would bet that dozens of notable careers in wildlife preservation, ecological studies, veterinary medicine and zoology, were inspired by a visit to the movies one afternoon to see the story of Elsa, or by a dogeared library copy of Born Free with it's bright yellow jacket.This is a wonderful, captivating book, which can be read for simple enjoyment. But I also hope that it touches people as deeply it touched me, and engenders some interest and concern -- if not active help -- for the tremendous difficulties the people and wildlife of Africa are facing today."},{"Title":"Born free","review":"Animals have always been a favorite topic of mine, but as a young person who just happened to find a copy of this book some 39 years ago, with the cover torn off, I consider it one of the great discoveries of my life. It was summertime, and I was headed to the 7th grade. I wasn't much of a reader until that momentous day. The story of Elsa and the Adamsons totally transported me to another place, and many wondrous adventures in Africa. Due much to this book, I now am a voracious reader. The story is heartwarming, and is the reason I insisted my 7th grade son read it for his current book report.Whether you're 9 or 99, Elsa's antics and her loving bond with Joy and George will capture your heart. I guarantee it. And with Africa's Lion population dwindling to probably less than 30,000 today, I can't think of a more timely book, in honour of conserving their remaining habitat. Especially when one considers that Africa had over 100,000 Lions when I first read it."},{"Title":"Born free","review":"This is a wonderful story that crosses all generations. It is a story of triumph and discovery of a species. I would recommend everyone read all of her animal story books. She has contributed a great deal to knowledge of these animals and conservation of wildlife."},{"Title":"Born free","review":"&quot;Born Free&quot; is about an orphaned lion cub, named Elsa. Elsa grows up with a game warden, his wife, and thier safari crew in northern Kenya, Africa. Joy Adamson,the game warden's wife, mainly raises Elsa herself. The book describes thier strong bond and crazy adventures throughout Elsa's life.This book is very enjoyable to read, and the pictures are a delight to look at. It is exciting to read about Elsa interacting with the other wild animals and then going home at night to a totally different world. This book was extremely hard to put down, and I would recomend it to all animal lovers."},{"Title":"Born free","review":"My first introduction to the Born Free books when I was a child learning to read in school. And what a great introduction to reading it was. The story of Elsa and the Adamsons who saved her life as a cub along with her sisters and raised her brought me into a world of wanting to be there with all the animals and see Africa. This seemed to be treated more as a children's book in my time than an adult book. The idea of the book was to teach people the importance of environmental conservation awareness. The first book, tells Elsa's early life from a cub raised by Joy and George Adamson and their pet rock hyrax, Pati. Joy is Elsa's surrogate mom and with great pains to teach Elsa the skills to survive in the wild. With lots of work Joy did it with success that Elsa was capable of living in the wild again. They released her near her birthplace and hoping Elsa would find and connect with her pride-in which she did. There is the tragedy not long afterward I had read this amazing story that Elsa had died in the Kenya bush of disease. Something of life that I learned early in my life that it was reality in the wilds of Africa or anywhere for that matter. But the cycle of life lives on in Elsa's pride. Still another grim incident ended the lives of Joy and George Adamson. Both were found murdered.Joy Adamson has left behind a legacy of these fascinating books that moves us to treat our world with respect and have a better understanding between human-animal relationship. Joy Adamson before her death had also written, 'Living Free: Elsa and her Cubs' and 'Forever Free: Elsa's Pride.' Her family extended even further across the grasslands of Africa as she tells about them in her other books, 'The Spotted Sphinx' (about Pippa the Cheetah), 'Pippa's Challenge,' 'Pippa: The Cheetah and her Cubs,' 'Queen of Shaba: The Story of an African Leopard,' and 'Friends of the Forest.' Joy Adamson's book 'Peoples of Kenya' reflects upon the life of the Kenyan people, her concern for the people welfare there and their struggles to make an existence in a harsh, beautiful land. If you want to know more about Joy Adamson read her autobiography, 'The Searching Spirit.'"},{"Title":"Born free","review":"\\"Roooaarrr!\\" The ferocious lioness roared like thunder as the tiny bullet pierced through its thick golden hair. After the lioness fell to the rocky ground, a soft, almost scared, whimper rose from the deadly awkward silence. The lioness had had a cub. What should Joy Adamson do? Leave the cub on it's own where it could die easily in one night alone? Joy Ademson, the author of this book, Born Free, opened up a new wild door in my reading. She opened up a door into a room filled with real life problems, adventures, and emotions. This wasn't like any other book I'd read before. It was as if I was there, raising the tiny cub myself. I extremely loved this book. You'll read it in a flash, I did, and I'm not even a good reader. If you are an animal freak, you'll enjoy the little adventures this book fills in your head.

My mom gave this book to me and told me that I would love it. She was right. The Adamsons raised this lion cub named Elsa as a pet and then had to release her later into the wild. They tell what they had to do with her before they could release her. Elsa is so heartwarming and the pictures in the book are neat. The relationship that the Adamsons had with Elsa was unbelievable. I would find it hard to believe that someone would NOT like this book. I would recommend it to anyone, any age.

Component Pascal is a superset of Oberon-2. Compared to Oberon-2, as usual for \\"Wirth programming languages line\\" (Algol -> Pascal -> Modula-2 -> Oberon -> Oberon-2) it provides several clarifications and improvements.Using such powerful but simple programming language the author of this book reached the aim of introducing the computing fundamentals (languages & grammars, algorithms & data structures, OOP & OOAD, UML & design patterns, frameworks & GUI, ...) on just 600 pages! And if You think that 600 pages is a bit too much then look at the similar C++ book:C++ How to Program (6th Edition). 1500 pages! And after such comparison the epigraph to the Deitel's book preface sounds a little bit ironic: \\"The chief merit of language is clearness ...\\" (Galen). Ancient philosopher was of course right, but C++ doesn't refer to such languages at all."},{"Title":"I Am Freedom's Child","review":"As a child, my sister bought this book in hardback from the thrift store.

It is a good book, but some plot twists go unanswered. The climax is satisfying, not the best, but statisfying.Judith Kelman is a good writer of suspense fiction, this novel is not one of her best.

The end was a big disappointment. There was lack of plot development, lack of character development, and most of it was just unbelievable."},{"Title":"After the Fall","review":"I was grabbed by the premise of the book but quickly found myself irritated with Kelman's writing. She unnecessarily develops characters who make only passing appearances with graphic detail; her characters are bizarrely extreme and not-so-believable; and she uses excessive turns of phrases and heavy vocabulary as if she were showing off her handle on the English language. Kelman lacks subtelty where a lot would go a long way. It took me almost four months to finish this book (reading several others in between), and I wish I would have just let it go, but I kept hoping that this book would redeem itself.

The mother is a doctor; the father is more of a house husband, and they have a preadolescent daughter, too....the same cast of characters as in &quot;After the Fall&quot;!

It seemed like cinderella in comparison. The plot and the character development in this book was very shallow and stereotypical, as was the entire police investigation (the Stamford PD looked like a bunch of fools). I found it hard to believe anyway that the crime committed would get so much media/police attention. After all, there was no murder or mysterious circumstances etc..... This book had potential, as evidenced by the many sub-plots the author started to develop. However, thats as far as the author went. As soon as the story started to get interesting (what most readers would regard as &quot;page turner&quot; material), the author went back to the hum drum story line of 90% of the book. This book was more about character's thoughts than development. I got through this book by reading mostly only the conversational parts."},{"Title":"After the Fall","review":"This book was ridiculous.

I do reccommend this book though."},{"Title":"After the Fall","review":"With each of her novels, Judith Kelman has exhibited the rare skill of making the reader truly relate to - and loyally care about - her characters. With After the Fall, she has hit an all-time high in this respect.The Magills represent a relatively successful, all-American clan, struggling with &quot;normal&quot; dysfunctionalities to which we can all relate. For this reason, the tumultuous turn their lives take in the face of young Danny's legal battles will inevitably have a strong effect on any reader. I could honestly feel the tremendous anxiety that each of the characters was experiencing as the story unfolded.This book is an absolute must read for anyone who loves seeing a tale unravel through the hearts of the characters.

Also - the mental image of the sister sitting on her brother's lap with him kissing her and seeing him with a huge erection sticking out of his underwear - this is passed off as 'normal' by the mom?!

What follows is a beautifully crafted psychological study of a family's unraveling and their attempts to re-weave the fabric of their existence in the face of almost overwhelming odds. Kelman has created some unforgetable characters, both likable and despicable. One of the most memorable is Dr. Chow, a pearls-of-wisdom spouting forensic genius.

The first few pages really had me hooked and the book moved along quickly near the end. I also thought some of the dialogue and character's thoughts were pretty funny. But the author really dropped the ball on outcome of Lisa and her father. I really thought he should have been punished for the sick things he'd been involved with and certainly for abusing his daughter ! I also was very suprised Jess, the mother showed so little concern when she learned her son had basically molested their daughter when they were younger. Also, her denial that her husband had treated her roughly, practically raped her that one night, surprised me, too.I expected at least a shocker or two to be revealed about her husband and/or son..something that would almost surely threaten to tear the family apart as the summary of the book hinted at, but that didn't happen.

No hospital, no doctor, no ice.

It's a cruel blow to the reader to simply abandon Lisa to her father without attempting some closure and justice.

I hoped he would be held accountable when his sister said he had touched her inappropriately when she was little. I was highly disappointed he turned out to be mostly innocent of the charge.

FREEDOM OR DEATH!\\" So this Cd begins with the booming voice of pioneering (and underrated) freedom fighter Robert Williams from his legendary radio show \\"Radio Free Dixie\\" sometime in the 60s.For those who have not read RFW's books \\"Negroes With Guns\\" (1962)-this book influenced Huey Newton of the Black Panther movement- or \\"Listen Brother\\" (1968) or Tim Tyson's excellent bio \\"Radio Free Dixie\\" (1999), this is an excllent introduction to Martin Luther King's archrival and Malcolm X's comrade-in -arms (literally), the forgotten freedom fighter of Monroe, NC who took up guns aganst the KKK-Robert Franklin Williams (1925-1996).The Cd consists of some documenatry narration stringing together Williams' tale with an extended interview with his widow Mrs. mabel Williams and actual excerpts form Williams's speeches, interviews, and radio shows. It would be nice of there was a cd of a complete episode of \\"radio free dixie,\\" but what we have here is a good introduction for the uninitiated.RFW's speeches may be too hot to handle for most listeners today (especially what he says about \\"the torch\\"), but it must be approached with an open mind. Like Nelson Mandela's \\"Spear of the Nation\\" in S/A in prior to his imprisonment, RFW made it clear that he was not speaking about initiating foolhardy and random acts of violence, but strictly within the bounds of self-defense. He did not engage in the gasbag rhetoric of charlatans that passes for black nationalism today that is designed for television cameras and brings cheers to bitter people. RFW was literally fighting for his life in many cases against the Klan and other racist groups and his actions backed up his words.But enough of that-get this cd and read the above mentioned books and find out what your history teacher didn't tell you in high school. Also, there is a film documentary on RFW entitled \\"Negroes With Guns.\\" Hoepfully, a DVD of that will soon be publicly available."},{"Title":"Robert F. Williams: Self Respect, Self Defense & Self Determination (AK Press Audio)","review":"This was an invigorating, inspiring, and informative documentary. Crucial to a proper understanding of this country's hidden history."},{"Title":"No place to linger: Saga of a wartime Atlantic kiwi","review":"\\"No Place to Linger\\" is the story of a New Zealand naval reserve officer serving on, and commanding, Corvettes in the Battle of the Atlantic. It is very much a personal history, and a very well-written one at that. Written and published in the mid-1980s, many years after the events took place, based on his diaries from the time as well as naval records. The author was 28 years old in 1940 when he left behind his fiancee of two weeks and sailed for the UK to join the Royal Navy. He served as First Lieutenant on the Flower Class Corvette HMS Lavender, based out of Freetown, in West Africa (the convoy capital of the South Atlantic). In January 1942 he became Commanding Officer of HMS Crocus, the ship that later played the part of HMS Compass Rose in the film of Nicholas Monsarrats famous novel,The Cruel Sea (Classics of War). He saw a great deal of action in Crocus until their ways parted in July 1943. Especially memorable were the rescue of the survivors from the sinking of the Empress of Canada and the sad saga of Convoy SL 125, where sixteen ships and nearly 1,000 lives were lost.One of the highlights of the book is the night in October 1942 when Crocus and U-boat 333 battled for survival off Freetown. John Holm and his ship damaged their enemy so badly that U-333 was thought to have been destroyed. But U-333 survived, and 10 years later Holm met the U-boat commander, Korvettenkapitan Peter Erich Cremer (readU-boat Commander). All in all, the book is action-packed, exciting and interesting. The Battle of the Atlantic is now over half a century in the past, but it is in books like these, the personal recollections of the men of our grandfathers (and now our great-grandfathers) era, that the memories of the bravery, the courage, the dangers, hardships and tragedies that they faced on behalf of us all lives on.The author, John Holm, was a New Zealander who spent nearly his whole life at sea. He was born in Wellington, New Zealand in 1912, and went to sea as a deckhand at the age of 17. He crewed in the topsail schooner Huia for the forst 3.5 years (his diaries of this time formed the basis for Cliff Hawkins book,Log of the Huia : New Edition with Photographs and Account of Her Loss : A Record of the Schooner 1894-1951. Working his way up, he served in various ships in different parts of the world until 1940, when he joined the Royal New Zealand Navy as a temporary Sun-Lieutenant, RNZNVR, and then sailed for Britain almost immediately. After 3 weeks training he was promoted to Lieutenant, RNR, following which he served on Atlantic Convoy escorts during the war, primarily on the Flower Class Corvettes Lavender (as First Lieutenant) and Crocus (as Commanding Officer). He was awarded the DSC in 1943 and promoted to Lieutenant Commander. From 1945 until his retirement in 1972, he worked in the shipping company his father founded, the Holm Shipping Company, becoming managing director in 1952. (for more on the Holm Shipping Company, readFair winds and rough seas: The story of the Holm Shipping Company(a good part of which was again based on the diaries of John Holm). Following his retirement, John Holm lived in Seatoun, Wellington.The book itself was published in 1985 by Holmwork Publishers, Wellington, NZ, which I suspect makes it a self-published book. 220 Pages, 38 b&w; photos (all of them interesting, some naval, some personal) and a good collection of maps and diagrams."},{"Title":"Social Work and the Courts: A Casebook","review":"This is a vital reference book for all social workers.As our society becomes more litigious, it is important for social workers to consider the legal ramifications of their work.

It's a survey of what's known about the oceans, from their formation (the current thinking is that the water came from comets) and oceanography, what the engine is that keeps continental drift going (gravity), why jellyfish and so many other sea creatures are transparent (because underwater, there's no reason to waste resources on features like pigment) on and on and on, a wealth of information explained and described perfectly lucidly. He has a gift for writing very well, explaining technical information to the non-technical layman (I was a history major) as well as John McPhee ever could. It turns out that we have mapped the surface of Venus more accurately than the ocean floor.So much of what I thought I knew about the ocean is wrong. Remember those relief maps you see, which show the continental shelf dropping off like the grand canyon into the abyss? Turns out that's not accurate, the continental shelf actually slopes at a very gentle rate, not as steep as the mountain passes the Tour de France racers climb. The maps exaggerate the slopes by a factor of ten, emphasizing the presence of the features over their accuracy.There is so much information in here that I was feeling, as I approached the end of the book, that I should go back through and read it again, for all the stuff I missed.The story isn't told in the first person plural, like a textbook, but rather is related through the stories of the scientists who made the discoveries. For instance, much of our current understanding of how continental drift works was done by a scientist heating a pan of paraffin in his kitchen. Because it's focuses on the stories of the scientists, it's a story as much about the development of science as about strict oceanography, how the limits of knowledge shift as our ability to ask questions and interpret the answers changes.I could go on and on and on, but I won't. This is a wonderful, fascinating book about a very important topic. Read it."},{"Title":"The Restless Sea: Exploring the World Beneath the Waves","review":"Did you know that we could end 17% of the excess carbon dioxide that we generate every year to the bottom of the ocean? And do it by fertilizing the plankton with iron spread from a freighter? And that this has actually been tested by marine scientists? If not, read The Restless Sea and learn this plus dozens of other fun facts to know and tell. Kunzig is a kind writer. If a scientist has no personality, he writes about the science. If a scientist happens to be a truly warped human being, we get a paragraph or two about the warpage before Kunzig dives back into the science. If you hate James Gleick's endlessly tedious books (e.g., Chaos), you'll be refreshed by Kunzig's work."},{"Title":"The Restless Sea: Exploring the World Beneath the Waves","review":"Although written by a talented journalist rather than an oceanographer (probably a reading plus anyway), it proficiently introduces the reader to recent discoveries in oceanography and to the personalities responsible for the research. Most texts on the field are somewhat more pedantic. Mr. Kunzig's approach is one of personalizing the subject by introducing the reader to the people behind the it. He gives the reader a greater feeling for the excitement and enthusiasm that such individuals bring to their field of study. I would recommend it to anyone with at least some knowledge of oceanography who is interested in knowing more of the individuals who have contributed to it."},{"Title":"The Restless Sea: Exploring the World Beneath the Waves","review":"At a time when some scientists fear they are running out of mysteries to explore, this book shows that right here on earth we have a potentially inexhaustible source of marvels and mysteries: the sea. Whether he is pondering the life cycle of plankton or peering at deep-sea vents or tracking the flow of ocean currents, Kunzig always holds my interest. This is science writing at its finiest, passionate, lyrical, vigorously reported. Kunzig does for oceanography what John McPhee did for geology. I loved this book!"},{"Title":"The Restless Sea: Exploring the World Beneath the Waves","review":"The best-written account of what scientists currently know about the ocean since Rachel Carson published her first bestseller, The Sea Around Us, almost 50 years ago. Among other things, it makes you wonder why we're spending so much time, money, and effort exploring the far reaches of outer space when there are so many wonders to be discovered much closer to home--in the 2/3 of our own planet that we're just beginning to fathom."},{"Title":"The Restless Sea: Exploring the World Beneath the Waves","review":"People have always been drawn to the sea, and Robert Kunzig's amazing book lets us all in on some of the reasons: the sea is alive with secrets and energy and strange creatures, just waiting to be discovered. Kunzig chronicles the many attempts to peer beneath the waves and reveal these secrets, and shows the overwhelming impact the ocean has had on our planet's history and is still having today. Crisply written and compellingly laid out, his story is one that shows us, rather than simply telling us, the power that the oceans have over our planet."},{"Title":"The Restless Sea: Exploring the World Beneath the Waves","review":"This well-written book attempts to show how little we know about the huge volume of our planet that lies beneath the surface layer of the ocean. Much of what we thought we knew has turned out to be wrong, and much of what we HAVE learned was discovered astonishingly recently---within the last generation in many cases. Also, Kunzig never lets you forget that the fascinating information we've gathered about undersea currents, say, or biological diversity at great depths, even ocean floor topology, is still sketchy and provisional. Rather than depressing, this is an exciting prospect, an adventure that is still in the early stages (and likely to remain so for some time, since undersea research gets hardly any funding). The only truly depressing part of the book, for me, is the account in chapter eight of the collapse (through overfishing) of the cod population off the coasts of New England and Newfoundland. In any case, Kunzig has the McPhee talent for highlighting the personalities of the scientists involved, but never loses sight of the underlying scientific issues. Also, I like how he begins, appropriately, with the water molecule and how the Earth got all it's water in the first place, then ends the book with how the planet may evenually lose it's water, billions of years hence. Nice symmetry there."},{"Title":"The Restless Sea: Exploring the World Beneath the Waves","review":"I loved this book. Mr. Kunzig took quite a lot of technical information and made it accessible to the average ocean lover. It made me look much closer when I go out cod fishing, especially at the odd jellies that I never noticed before floating around the boat. I would recommend this book for anyone interested in the seas."},{"Title":"The Restless Sea: Exploring the World Beneath the Waves","review":"Finely written, but the book is not for the casual reader.

It is both a guide to bulding home, and at the same time a guide to the toxins in our home furnishing and ways to minimize our exposure.

For instance, many new carpets give off toxic fumes for the first month of installation. After reading that, I realized why I had a chronic sore throat right after we insalled our new carpet.It gives alternative materials to look for when buying bedding, shelving, wood stains, and other products.

It also lists which plants are best to purify the air.This is a must-have for people who are going to build their own home, and very helpful for people who are refurnishing their home or apartment. Many suggestions do seem centered on elaborate renovations, but even within those suggestions there is information about things such as wall-paints, furnature, and house-hold ventilation.

Entries broken down by area (e.g., Verdun, Mesopotamia, German East Africa), includes both political and military events, though the former is by far in the minority (and arguably too light in this area). Several illustrations and photographs throughout, which I don't think add much, but are welcome, as they are not the usual US-British-French-German-centric fare of pictorial histories. Several &quot;topics&quot; are covered on pages scattered throughout discussing certain major themes (e.g. infantry tactics) or innovations (e.g., tanks, aircraft). Mostly very general, but brief and concise; helpful to the general reader--and a reminder to the well-versed of the period-- to understand the war machinery of the conflict.My only gripe is that the maps are mostly useless, as the events detailed in the almanac occur at a much smaller scale than those included. A companion atlas or appendix with detailed maps would help a great deal towards following the events, especially in more remote locals, such as Africa and Middle East."},{"Title":"Almanac of World War I","review":"Emphasis is on the military chronology, not the political or social history of the event that &quot;created&quot; the twentieth century.

The chronology is filled with pictures -- many rarely printed and of some interest -- and generally useless sidebars that only barely scratch the surface of their topics.

We use a \\"recipe\\" given to us by a fellow skateboarder and have deviated from it very little, and when we have, it's usually been with less than desirable results. But partly because of boredom and partly because of the failure of one of our latest boards, we both decided we needed a better grounding in the basics and principles of composite construction, rather than just mindlessly following someone else's instructions.We've both looked at many other books and websites in the past few years, and while we've gleaned some helpful tips and techniques, most were either too technical or too specifically focused on a different application, e.g., boat building or aircraft building.So it was a great relief to discover this book via a mention in one of those other books (I think it was in \\"The Fibreglass Manual\\" by Keith Noakes). My local library had a copy of an older edition, and within the first few pages I knew it was exactly what I was looking for: an explanation of the basic principles and techniques of composite construction.The first eight chapters proved especially useful, describing and explaining the varieties and properties of fibers, fabrics, core materials (foam and honeycomb), resin systems, molding and laminating techniques, etc. There were various examples to further explain the principles in practical terms. And although the examples were aircraft-related, they were basic enough that I was able to understand them despite having no real aviation background or training.The last half of the book deals with designing composite structures, calculating loads and stresses and strength/load testing. I was hoping to get as much out of those topics as I had from the first eight chapters. But here the principles and examples became much more specifically aviation-oriented and were of much less practical use to me. Granted, a skateboard's design and function are significantly different from an airplane wing or fuselage, and the two structures face different primary loads and stresses, but still I was hoping for a little broader view.So I'm giving \\"Composite Basics\\" a four-star rating rather than five, because I found the second half somewhat less useful than the first. Perhaps that's a little unfair, as it's not \\"Composite Skateboard Construction,\\" but I do feel it's somewhat justified, if only to point out the latter half of the book's lean toward aviation-related examples. It probably is still \\"basics,\\" but only for those who specifically have an interest or background in aviation. Would-be boat builders, for example, may find the second-half info of limited usefulness as well.That said, I would still recommend \\"Composite Basics\\" to anyone who's looking to get into designing and building composite structures. I consider it by far the best introductory book I've come across--a good introduction, written in plain language, with an excellent balance of factual information (e.g., on fiber and fabric types and properties), principles and practical examples. Its list of suppliers is reasonably current, even though the seventh edition is four years old. I also enjoyed the author's droll/deadpan humor at various points throughout the text and in the glossary and appendices e.g., \\"Clean surface--Something MUCH cleaner than you would expect.\\" See also the entry for \\"Hydroclave.\\" :-)"},{"Title":"Tippu","review":"I learned that not all people are mean, and that they do not hurt other people.

Each of the four keys are well explained with supporting examples of how the problems affected people and how they overcame them. Finally, the book discusses life passages and their effect on libido, and how couples can use the new dynamics to create a deeper bond and reignite sexual desire.Bottom line: The book has been very helpful in understanding women's libido problems and providing methods to overcome them."},{"Title":"Reclaiming Desire: 4 Keys to Finding Your Lost Libido","review":"I'm glad this book showed up on an Amazon.com search for \\"seniors in love.\\"I found and ordered SEASONED ROMANCE, THE LOST LOVE CHRONICLES, THE RETURN OF DESIRE and this gem, RECLAIMING DESIRE.Each one, in its own unique way, pointed me back to the fact that it is never too late to find both true love and wonderful sex, including for seniors.The subtitle of this book, FOUR KEYS TO FINDING YOUR LOST LIBIDO, says it best! And I can tell you from experience that it is true. The libido wasn't lost; it was just in need of being reclaimed.Thank goodness for writers like the Powells, Dr. Nancy Kalish, Gina Oden, and RECLAIMING DESIRE's wonderful Drs. Andrew Goldstein and Marianne Brandon, for each extraordinary author has pointed the way toward filling life with romance (and hopefully lots of years of spicy, seasoned senior sex)!(Plus the fantasy-causing front cover of this book is worth the price of the book, right?)"},{"Title":"Reclaiming Desire: 4 Keys to Finding Your Lost Libido","review":"Very informative!

I would recommend for woman who need to understand how their body works."},{"Title":"Reclaiming Desire: 4 Keys to Finding Your Lost Libido","review":"I bought this book based on the Amazon reviews and I'm glad I did. This book is for everyone; I am most certainly not the average victim of low libido - I'm 24 years old, no children, and in a committed loving relationship. It cleared up so many things for me; so much so that my therapist is buying it to recommend to his other patients. I have since recommended it to all of my girlfriends, even the ones who feel they have no libido problems. Besides getting me to feel more open discussing some of the problems that were weighing heavily on me, I learned some simple relaxation tips to keep me 'in the moment' and focused on the experience, not the grocery list that I used to make in my mind. I could go on and on, but just trust me. It's worth buying."},{"Title":"Reclaiming Desire: 4 Keys to Finding Your Lost Libido","review":"Reclaiming Desire is a must read for any woman who finds that her sex drive is not what it should be or what she wants it to be, and is willing to take steps to fix it. According to the authors there is no \\"quick fix\\" for low libido. Instead, the authors lay out a comprehensive plan for improving sex drive that makes sense and actially works! Their plan starts out with a self test that helps you identify why your sex drive is decreased. Then they explain how to fix it. For example, some women may find that they need to take hormones like testosterone or dopamine, while other women may need help with emotional or relationship problems. They also give a lot of useful information about some popular aphrodisiacs like ginko and ginseng, and talk about sexual desire at different stages of life (after giving birth, menopause, etc). There are lots of useful bullet points that summarize each chapter. One of the best parts of this book are the stories from actual patients that were treated by the authors. All in all this is good reading and lots of help for those of us whose sex drive is not what it once was."},{"Title":"Reclaiming Desire: 4 Keys to Finding Your Lost Libido","review":"Reclaiming Desire is a gift to women who have lost their libido. Doctors Goldstein and Brandon have created a beautifully-written, comprehensive, empowering and compassionate book, and one I recommend wholeheartedly to my patients. It deals with women's low sexual desire in unusual depth, and in a remarkably balanced way---encompassing the physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual aspects of womens' sexuality.If you still love your partner and your relationship and you still want to bond, but your sex drive has vanished, this is the best book you could ever read.Reclaiming Desire is the thinking woman's antidote to helplessness. It gives you the guidemap to pinpoint what is wrong, the courage to take responsibility for your part, the voice of a wise, ingenious, loving guide to cheer you on, and all the strategies you will need to change your libido. The chapter on the \\"Miracle of Motherhood\\" is a masterpiece. It should be required reading for all parents-to-be, and the professionals who take care of them.This is a fabulous book and a first-rate contribution to the literature on women and sexuality.Aline Zoldbrod Ph.D.AASECT Certified Sex Therapist and Diplomate in Sex Therapy,Psychologist and Couples TherapistAuthor, Sex Smart: How Your Childhood Shaped Your Sexual Life and What To Do About It, and co-author, Sex Talk: Uncensored Exercises for Exploring What Really Turns You On."},{"Title":"Reclaiming Desire: 4 Keys to Finding Your Lost Libido","review":"Dr. Goldstein changed my life and probably saved my marriage. This is not an overstatement.After having two children in a relatively short span of time, my husband and I found less time for each other and, when we had time, I was utterly exhausted and disinterested. The advice that Dr. Goldstein and his partner offer in their practice, and what they tell you in this book, will definitely help you understand the root causes of some of these issues. Sometimes things are more complicated than they seem at first. But more importantly, this book will give you some concrete action items to help you make positive changes.I was lucky in that my \\"issues\\" were among the most common out there and are very treatable. But that didn't make it any easier for me to cope with. I am fortunate to have found Dr. Goldstein and have been a patient of his. I have personally found Dr. Goldstein to be pragmatic and honest in his dealings with his patients. I appreciate that about him. His advice is straight-forward without being clinical or harsh. Above all, this is useful stuff that anyone can benefit from.Talking about sex is sometimes awkward but Drs. Goldstein and Brandon talk to you like a real person in this book. Most importantly they give you real answers."},{"Title":"Reclaiming Desire: 4 Keys to Finding Your Lost Libido","review":"Written for women, &quot;Reclaiming Desire&quot; explores why sexual desire fades and what can be done to bring it back. Authors Andrew Goldstein, M.D. and Marianne Brandon, Ph.D., the founders of the Sexual Wellness Center in Annapolis, Maryland, claim that there are four keys to reclaiming this desire. These keys are good physical health, being emotional resilient, being intellectually fulfilled, and having spiritual contentment.We all go through various life changes, any one of which can affect the libido. The authors look at many of these changes and how they affect your sex drive as well as what can be done to reduce or eliminate that effect. Each of their four keys is examined in detail including not only how things like hormones, depression, anxiety, stress, menopause and other factors affect your drive but also exploring how to lessen those effects. They do a good job of exposing various myths and misconceptions as well as detailing what works and what does not. With today's focus on natural health options they even include information on how exercise and other natural options can be used.Throughout the book two messages are clear - you are not alone and there is hope. &quot;Reclaiming Desire&quot; is highly recommended to any woman suffering from a declining libido who wants to reclaim that portion of their relationship as part of their life."},{"Title":"Reclaiming Desire: 4 Keys to Finding Your Lost Libido","review":"Drs. Goldstein and Brandon are geniuses. Their work changed my marriage. My wife and I both read this book and came away with an understanding that is hard to put into words.

They will help us all understand a little more about ourselves."},{"Title":"Reclaiming Desire: 4 Keys to Finding Your Lost Libido","review":"I have only made it through the first few chapters, but this book has already helped. I'm a recenlty married 26 year old, but because I have Hashimoto's Disease (low thyroid) I was stuggling with a low libido. My husband was trying to be very understanding, but it was difficult being that we have only been married a little over a year. This book helped me stop feeling so stressed out, and reminded me I needed to take time for myself. Once I started paying attention to myself and my own needs, I found my problems with low libido start to dissapear. I recommend this book for anyone stuggling with low libido. You aren't alone, and this book offers much needed support to help you get your libido back where it should be."},{"Title":"Reclaiming Desire: 4 Keys to Finding Your Lost Libido","review":"Let's see, exercise more, eat right, love yourself, learn to meditate, read soft porn, tell your partner what you want. I think that sums it up. Oh yeah, if something is causing physical pain, figure out some new positions or buy a tube of K-Y.I bought this book used and except for the quiz (which had been filled out twice), the book was brand new; no turned down pages, no cracks in the binding, no evidence that the previous owners gave it more than a glance. When I got to the part about bubble baths and sexy underwear I knew this wasn't for me. The authors touch on a lot of things, but don't really offer much help. Overweight? Lose some. Bad body image? Touch yourself more.Nothing here I couldn't get out of Cosmopolitan and at least that offers some entertainment value."},{"Title":"Reclaiming Desire: 4 Keys to Finding Your Lost Libido","review":"Reclaiming Desire issues an invitation to women with low libido to recover a vital part of their essence and to rediscover themselves and their partners in the process.

And I disliked the \\"she's better off without him\\" philosophy even though most of the husbands ranged from distant to positively sleazy. But it was a pleasant change to read Southern fiction with mostly likable characters, and the story itself held my attention. I noticed some minor plot holes; among others, it looked like Smith originally aimed at a different outcome for the narrator's marriage and didn't rewrite the earlier foreshadowing references - again, a minor quibble, and the book remains worth reading."},{"Title":"The Red Hat Club","review":"Great audio book.

Pure and simple."},{"Title":"The Red Hat Club","review":"If you go into this book expecting it to be nothing more than a fun read and break from the day to day PC junk then you will get exactly what you want out of it. If you go in wanting to overanalyze and pick apart a book then you will have some of the reviews before this.As for it seeming to follow the current fad of the Red Hat Society... HELLOOOOOOOOOOO the name of the book IS The Red Hat Club. Kind of self explanatory there wouldn't you think?Also, Ms. Smith is very into her fans and will email you back if you wish to let her know how you feel about the book.

References to locations and landmarks, like Piedmont Ave, The Varsity and AJC. I questioned the use of the Jenny Jones Red Hat reference as been there done that. I sort of even resisted, trying to be aloof and objective, certainly not wanting to be swayed by all the things I had in common with the protag, Georgia; same age, similar life questions and experiences. I wanted to be cool and sophisticated and not invest anything in the other characters, Teeny, Linda, Diane and SuSu either because I prefer to believe that modern Southern women are not stereotypical airheads.My ploy didn't work. I was putty in Haywood's hands by the end of chapter two. From then on, I just relaxed and enjoyed it and before it was over I found I was not only invested in the women of the Red Hat Club, I felt as though I could have fit right into their tight circle and would if they'd invite me.I read for many reasons, pleasure, stimulation, information. But sometimes it's good to curl up on a rainy (North Georgia) Sunday and read an easy, lighthearted tale that tugs at your own memories of misspent youth and lost dreams. Sometimes that's all I need. But if I can turn the last page feeling I know the characters and wishing to read more about them, the author has done her job and what more can you ask of a work of fiction?I was and she did."},{"Title":"The Red Hat Club","review":"THE RED HAT CLUB is an amazing book that takes you through the lives of five women (who met in high school) and how they stick together through marriage troubles, kids, abusive husbands, cheating men, going-nowhere jobs, and middle age. They belong to a group called THE RED HAT CLUB where they where purple suits and red hats and meet for lunch once a month (this club is a real thing across America). I love the way the women band together to bring justice to a cheating husband, and how another has to face the one man she still fantasizes about (not her husband!) after all these years. It's just such a treat to read a book about the bonds of female friendship. Get this book and get one for your best friend, too!"},{"Title":"The Red Hat Club","review":"An inspiring story about 5 women who have been friends forever. The story takes place in Atlanta, GA, where the ladies meet monthly for a day spent eating, drinking, talking, and reminiscing. The characters have spent a lifetime sharing happiness, tragedy, failure, and success and the book has time flashes of when the women were very young and just getting started in Life. There is a wonderful surprise ending. I highly recommend this book and I enjoyed reading it very much. I can't wait for the sequel."},{"Title":"The Red Hat Club","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. I was rooting for, and amazed by, the friendships that withstood decades of misunderstand, or was that understanding? A beautifully written novel that gets to the core of female friendships. I would highly recommend it to all women who have been married. Do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"Title":"The Red Hat Club","review":"Don't take this book seriously. Enjoy it for what it is -a funny, improbable story that celebrates friendship and made me laugh out loud at the situations and characters the author created. This is the story of 5 Southern women who have been friends since high school and are now over 50. They have all had their difficult times but have had each other for support. It's surprise ending and over the top story line make it perfect for when you want to lighten up. Yes, it isn't perfect. I had trouble keeping the 5 friends separate at first but that doesn't really matter. If you want a perfectly crafted book, find one of the classics but if you just are wanting a good, funny read , pick up this book. I gave it a 5 star rating because of the joy it brought me and everyone I gave it to. Laughter rates 5 stars in my book every time. I am also a huge fan of the Anne George Southern Sisters books. I was terribly saddened at her passing.The Red Hat Club is even more unbelievable and funnier. I was glad to find something to raise this Northern woman's spirits. I am now nearly finished the sequel which I think is even funnier than the first."},{"Title":"The Red Hat Club","review":"When she plotted this read about a very tight knit group of five, a team since high school when they were Mademoiselles, I do believe this savvy Atlanta native, Haywood Smith, just tapped into the current fad among baby boomer dames, the Red Hat Society.There is none of the open, all accepting concept here. This is exclusive, initiated society, bred from the high school clique, and the need to have an exclusive circle of friends above marriage, family and greater causes.\\"The Red Hat Club\\" is a gossipy chic book with fantasies of the passion-filled, aged hot babes, all wives and mothers, who maintain a record of comfort in the presence of one another.Talk about a long history of girls' night out!!!Their loyalty across the irritating quirks of one another is admirable, shades of \\"Ya-Ya Sisterhood\\".Their success at sharing the wealth of the rich Jewish member is fanciful to the nth degree. A bit like the novel \\"The Last Girls\\", but these Southern dames are closely linked to their high school, not college, youth, and therein lies the romance and improbability.Yes, this is fun for those who long for things as they might have been. But great literature? Hardly!If you choose it, as I did (from the sales shelf of SAM's before attending the organizational meeting of a Red Hat Society branch), be forewarned. This might be a temporary escape, just for the fun of it. But the truth is, not all Southern women need a club of women to find self-fulfillment.You might wish to save your money to buy a red hat to wear, and just let someone pass this tome to you as a loaner."},{"Title":"The Red Hat Club","review":"I picked this up at my local used book store, just because of the cover and it sounded interesting. glad i did. it turned out to be funny and hardwarming. i could relate to these ladies(even being a little younger!)and found my self wishing i had such a group of wonderful, funny and just plain great ladies in my life. that's ok, I bought the sequel and laughted and enjoyed just as much. i just wish there were more books."},{"Title":"The Red Hat Club","review":"I just loved this book and the characters.

It's perfect for a weekend of lazy reading (it doesn't even take that long to read by the way!) ~~ and it's just fun. So what if it is about a current trend ~~ women friendship? And so what if some of it is predictable? It doesn't matter ~~ it is just a fun book to read!This book is about Georgia, SuSu, Teeny, Diane, and Linda ~~ five women who became friends once they were teenagers ~~ they went through everything together, college, weddings, pregnancies, toddlerhood, and so on. However, this book focuses on their mid-life crisis. It starts with Diane discovering that her husband is cheating on her and bought a condo with his mistress. SuSu is your sassy character, Teeny is the mysterious and quiet friend who isn't all that she appears to be. Linda is happily married to her husband for all these years and is gloriously rich. Georgia secretly pines for her first boyfriend from high school who had disappeared suddenly in her youth. She thinks she's bored with her marriage to stable John, a professor at Tech. And these are their stories. Funny, sassy, and just hilarious in some places. It's a story of revenge and finding a way to get even as well. It is a story of friendships in the south ~~ and about women growing older together. It is just pure fun.I wish I had discovered Haywood Smith earlier ~~ she is a fun author to read. She has an ability to say things that you secretly wish you could say and get away with. This is a perfect book to read while you're in the slumps ~~ somehow these women's problems may make your problems not too bad after all. It is pure escapism ~~ and sometimes, we read to escape.3-12-05"},{"Title":"The Red Hat Club","review":"What took me so long to pick this book up? \\"Warning\\" by Jenny Joseph (the poem that inspired the Red Hat Society and this book) is an old favorite. I am glad I finally grabbed this from the library. I loved it. As the ending neared, I worried it was wrapping up too perfectly, but then I thought, \\"Who cares?\\" This is fiction. This is my ESCAPE from real life. I need a fair tale ending every once in a while. Don't you? Who cares if no real person in my circle has the kind of money these ladies do? Who cares if I will never hobnob with the upper crust of Atlanta? These women rock my socks. I think, if I met them, they'd like me. Their conversations are laugh out loud funny, and their friendship is solid. When I am in my 50s, I hope to be them.Actually, I want to be a Red Hat Lady now, but I can't. Not officially. You have to be at least 50. Prior to that, you are a Pink Hat Lady, and I just don't know about that. I want to be a RED Hat Lady. So I may just be one all on my own.

It felt like deja-vu all over again."},{"Title":"The Red Hat Club","review":"What fun! Anyone who's been jilted (or knows someone who has) can take vicarious delight in the antics of the members of this Red Hat Club. Friends since high school over thirty years ago, these five Atlanta women are coming into that second rebellious age: They will wear purple (like the poem), will no longer play the nicey-nice little wife, and might even utter \\"the f word\\" -- all on the road to personal empowerment. The tone is light and funny, but there is enough of a serious bent to provide food for thought. The emotions and relationships bring home a truth: Many of us need the support of gal pals to be brave enough to be ourselves.I got a big kick out of the group's Twelve Sacred Traditions -- and the fact that they were referred to by number. Few of us have such explicit rules of friendship, but oh, how many times would like you like to say to blabbermouth friend, \\"Tradition 4, honey! No telling!\\" or a nosy one, \\"Tradition 5: Mind your own business!\\"? In addition to the discussion questions in the back of the book, reading groups might like to ponder these rules: What written or unwritten rules of friendship do we have and would we adopt these same twelve?"},{"Title":"The Red Hat Club","review":"A great &quot;feel good&quot; book for all women."},{"Title":"The Red Hat Club","review":"The Red Hat Club by Haywood Smith is a 5 star book.

I did appreciate the aspirations of acceptance between women and the central theme that you never really know someone; hidden strengths (and weaknesses) lie within us all. There may be a small crowd that can enjoy this book who hasn't gone through an ugly divorce, wished they could relive the past or can relate to mostly one-dimensional, cardboard cutouts resembling real characters, but I found it a push to prod myself through a good portion of this book."},{"Title":"The Red Hat Club","review":"The characters in this book seem more like children than grown women. they govern their friendships with child like rules and have cutsy little names like Su Su. and Brad just an awlful book.

The Mademoiselles evolve into &quot;Red Hats&quot; in this delightful and entertaining book. I couldn't put it down. I laughed aloud at the authors witty descriptions and wiped away my own bittersweet &quot;memories&quot; as they flooded down my cheeks. I'm eager to read QUEEN BEE OF MIMOSA BRANCH, also by Haywood Smith and her new book that will be out in 2004, LADIES OF THE LAKE."},{"Title":"The Red Hat Club","review":"If you saw the movie First Wives Club when it came out in the mid 90's, there is very little reason to read The Red Hat Club. The themes are similar and Olivia Goldsmith did a much better job with First Wives than Haywood Smith has done with Red Hat. First Wives featured three divorced women who band together to wreak revenge on their husbands who left them for younger women. Red Hat features five married women, friends since high school, who band together to support each other through cheating husbands and other personal and marital mishaps.The fact that the five ladies of Red Hat get \\"dolled up\\" once a month in purple outfits and red hats and \\"do lunch\\" is an obvious ploy meant to boost book sales. Since the REAL Red Hat Society has hundreds of thousands of members, Smith evidently sought to capitalize on this fact and most likely assumed that she would have a built in audience eager to spend their hard earned dollars on this bit of fluff.I suppose the message the book was supposed to convey is that by making positive choices in their lives and supporting each other rather than tearing each other down, all women.....regardless of their age can lead stimulating, challenging and exciting lives. Unfortunately for Ms. Smith, other writers like Anita Diamant and Margaret Atwood have already sailed those waters and produced more clever, interesting and complicated characters whose stories are worth the reader's investment of time and money.Recommendation: Life is short....eat dessert first! Oh yes, and skip The Red Hat Club!"},{"Title":"The Red Hat Club","review":"When I first saw this book, it really didn't catch my eye until I read it for my book club, I am so happy that it was recommend by them.

It was just what I'm looking for to counteract the depressing realities of life. I recommend it to all women who could use a laugh and a lift."},{"Title":"The Red Hat Club","review":"Although the premise for this story has been done before, Smith sets this book apart from others by the sheer longevity of the character's frienships.Georgia, SuSu, Teeny, Diane, and Linda are closer than sisters and true to each other. When one hurts they all hurt. When one celebrates, they all celebrate.Joining forces and getting background info on Diane's husband to blackmail him and his bank is the main gist of the story. How they do it and how they use the info mean only ballsy Southern women at their best and their bitchiest.Everything wraps up a little too neatly for me after the decades of suffering these women have gone through, but it's a fun, distracting read for a slow summer day."},{"Title":"The Red Hat Club","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up this book.

Being part of a club where one could identify another club member because they are wearing a certain item of clothes while in public, fascinates me. But then I started reading the book. I found the characters non-believable. The rules of the club, do overs and make overs were just too restrictive. Life is not about squashing dialogue with your friends because you are too uncomfortable or too polite to say what is on your mind. The scene about catching Harold in the act truly stretched my imagination. The amounts of money thrown around boggled my mind. And the ending? It reminded me of the last episode of Seventh Heaven."},{"Title":"The Red Hat Club","review":"Ths book had me in stiches and I couldn't put it down.

SuSu is always late. Teeny is frail, vulnerable, and abused by her husband. Linda is happily married. Diane thought she was too, until she found unmistakable evidence of Harold's philandering. All five ladies have been friends since high school, sorority sisters, a lifelong support group. Now in their fifties they meet monthly wearing red hats to exchange jokes, gossip and emotional support. Over the years they have developed a marvelous system of \\"Sacred Traditions\\" to help them through the rough spots of communication.Most of the plot revolves around the girls helping Diane to \\"get\\" her erring husband, which she does, and ah--revenge is good. There are many subplots, and the Red Hats continually learn new and surprising facets of each other. The plot elements have been done before. What makes this book special is the picture of lifelong friendship and loyalty--among five very flawed women--and through all kinds of difficult circumstances, which the author is able to portray.Author Haywood Smith does a great job making the improbable believable. The story rolls quickly along and is an enjoyable \\"fun\\" read. I recommend it. Reviewed by Louis N.

While I am far from 50 and am just learning about the red hat society, I thought this book was a very light hearted read. The characters were funny in their own way and the story line was a riot.

She showed more levelheadedness than I expected.Personally I think it is a very rare thing to have such a close-knit group of female friends, so it was a little voyeuristic to sort of surrealy be a part of one for the time it took to read this book."},{"Title":"The Red Hat Club","review":"I love to read while I drive.... and this book kept me happily stuck on the Interstate for hours.

The only thing witty and worth reading in it is Jenny Joseph's wonderful poem \\"Warning, \\"which is printed after the title page. Once you've read Joseph's poem, which by the way is available free of charge on the Internet, the book steadily goes down hill. The writing style is unimaginative, full of jarring, forced, poorly thought out-similes. The plot--getting even with unfaithful husbands--was better done by Olivia Goldsmith in her book,\\"The First Wives Club,\\"later made into a movie of the same name starring Diane Keaton, Bette Midler, and Goldie Hawn. The characters, four 50-something Atlanta, Georgia matrons reek with references to places in Atlanta which mean nothing to anyone, not even a fellow 50-something Atlantan, who is not a part of their social strata.

Who keeps track of such nonsense? The characters might have had substance, but the constant back tracking to the days of yore (teendom) led to days of yawn by yours truly.

The book is beautiful with lots of great pictures. The colored cover looks exactly like the dust jacket as opposed to some plain cardboard paper used in most hardbound books. The quality of the paper is also amazing.However, this book is more than just a pretty cookbook you put on your coffee table. It's full of great and inspiring recipes. It has inspired me to eat healthy and use more fresh in-season produce in my cooking instead of serving my family something frozen or canned. Some recipes call for ingredients that are only available in upscale supermarkets (truffle oil, some gourmet cheeses, prociutto, pancetta, creme fraiche). But don't let that turn you off. I have learned to use things that I have never used in my cooking before and it's been a fun adventure. So far, I have tried 8 recipes and they all turned out wonderfully.

Apart from the fact it's supposed to be largely vegetarian and yet has chicken and pork recipes, it also has Maggi sauces and various non-Asian items.

If you haven't read this book, and you are into politics, it is a must read for everyone!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The term Big Brother is almost a cliche today, but I imagine most folks who use it have never read the book that made the name so infamous. For Orwell's purposes, Big Brother was the personification of \\"the Inner Party\\" or just \\"the Party,\\" that 1-2% group of elitists who ruled over the fictionalized country called Oceania [a.k.a., the UK, US and all other English-speaking countries].It's ironic that Orwell was so pessimistic throughout this book since he was himself a socialist. His idea of socialism, however, was not so malicious, even though just as powerful. Like most idealists, he had hoped socialism would bring about an end to elitism, where the law of the jungle would be managed by a brotherhood of man [Humanism, the religion of the New World Order]. By the late 1930's though, the soviet experiment was proving that true socialism was an impossibility for inevitably ruthless individuals always rise to the top, ulimately producing an oligarchy [rule by a few].I see in the figure Big Brother another evil that Orwell would never have suggested, being an atheist/humanist. Big Brother is the god of this world, the prince of darkness, the devil -- Satan. The issue that allows me to make this connection is knowledge. Note throughout 1984 that Big Brother's goal is to control minds by controlling knowledge. The \\"Proles\\" [85% of the people] were severely limited by their education, an education supplied [rationed] by the state. Sound familiar? Do you ever wonder why public schools are failing? Do you suppose it's possible they're actually succeeding in their intended purpose? Of course, a more forceful control was required of \\"Outer Party\\" members, that 10-14% given just enough education and training to perform complex tasks required by the state. Thus, the neccessity for the Thought Police [sort of like the PC pundits of today, only with official government power to cure thought criminals like pro-lifers, gun owners, Christian fundamentalists, etc.].Then too is the application of \\"Newspeak,\\" that effort by Big Brother to control the minds of everyone by limiting vocabulary. Although a limited vocabulary doesn't limit one's ability to actually think, it does limit one's ability to articulate what he or she is thinking, so that eventually the thought vaporizes. Knowledge is built on knowledge. Prevent a core knowledge from developing and you can essentially control how people think about certain issues. Unborn babies aren't babies; they become fetuses. Sexual deviants becomes gay. And enemies of the state become anyone refusing to accept the absolute authority of the state.Where does Satan fit in with this analogy with Big Brother? Was it not Satan who beguiled us regarding knowledge by asking, \\"Yea, hath God said?\\" He has always tried to control our knowledge of good and evil, even to the point of quoting Scripture to the Lord Jesus in an attempt to trick the very Son of God into doubting Himself, if not the Father. Shortly after the 66 books making up the Bible were established as canon, papal decree forbid the lay Christian from possessing a copy of the Bible. Why? More recently, modern bibles have been edited for political correctness and reflect the belief system of the Gnostics who were thriving in Alexandria, Egypt in the 4th Century. Gnostics denied the deity of Christ and absolute moral values, claiming only that which is spiritual matters, so what men and women do in or with their bodies does not. Thus the roots of moral relativism.All those who attempt to control knowledge, academic and biblical, are doing the bidding of Big Brother. Those who fall for it are little more than simple \\"outer party\\" members, foolish \\"proles\\" or scornful \\"inner party\\" members. Think about it.Other books similar to this one include the following: Animal Farm, The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America, New Age Bible Versions, The Underground History of American Education, Educating for the New World Order and Legally STUPiD: Why Johnny doesn't have to read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Truly, a more bleaker look at the future you could never find.No one can advocate revolution, if the words to express revolution don't exist.A fascinating concept on the part of Mr Orwell.This is the only book I couldn't stop thinking about months after I'd read it,and now with CCTV cameras just about on every street corner, in every city of the world,makes this story more relevant now then when first published.If there's a bit of Winston Smith in us all, then there's probably a bit of the O'Brien character too.Fascinating and terrifying in equal measure.Down with Big Brother?.... not likely.This is most deservedly, a Classic.(First published 1949.)"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell did two supremely difficult things in this book: he wrote a brilliant polemic (unless you're a Communist, you'll know that polemics don't get any better). And he wrote a dark, unforgettable story in a perfectly crafted style. Ignore the polemic and you still have one of our best novels.Orwell gives us so many brilliant insights. I'll mention my favorite. Orwell saw that totalitarians will always hate beauty and try to drive it out of ordinary life. Why? Because beauty reminds people of what freedom feels like! This theme runs through 1984.Want to see Orwellian in action? Letting a far-left thinker like Erich Fromm write an essay for this book. Fromm manages to turn things upside down so that what Orwell is REALLY writing about is conformity in American corporations. Totalitarian twaddle."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Some books you read you enjoy and forget and then there are books that stick with you for the rest of your life. I can honestly say this is probably one of the most important books written in human history. One of the reasons is that it is an almost recognizably real dystopian world eerily close to the one we live in. This book is a stark warning of what we could become; what unchecked government erosion of liberty can eventually lead to.If you read this, you'll read the news in a different way.In the end, you'll love Big Brother."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell's _1984_ has become such a part of everyday language, a re-reading was in order. I was amazed at how well his frightening vision of the future has withstood the test of time, and how easily one can read the present (whether the ealy 21st century or the mid-20th century) into his story. Truly, human nature has not changed (nor is it likely to.)Eric Blair, nee George Orwell, was a socialist and idealist whose hopes of a better world were dashed with the arrival of a Stalinist system in central Europe. His disaffection with this was the impetus for his book. It remains relavent today as governments contiune to attempt to manipulate and control their populations. (This has always been the case throughout history - a major difference now, of course, is the sophistication and technology at government's disposal - Orwell recognized this.)While Orwell's vision of the future has not come to pass (nor is it likely to), _1984_ remains one of the greatest books of the last century and is certainly worth a read - or a re-read as the case may be. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's bleak book is one of the top selling books of all time, currently selling over 750,000 copies every year. This volume is probably because many schools have the book as required reading, but it still shows just how important and powerful this book is in modern times.Written back in 1948, the book was primarily a warning against the communism of Soviet Russia and what that style of government could do to society. Many of the phrases and images in the book have become part of our culture. We expect people to understand what \\"Big Brother\\" means when we refer to it. We talk about the \\"thought police\\". If only to be able to understand modern conversation and references, this is a book to have familiarity with, just as having at least a passing knowledge of events in the Bible will help you understand references in culture to 40 days and 40 nights of floods, gathering animals up two by two, and so on.But aside from its position as a \\"foundation of certain phrases in society\\", how does the book stand as an actual story? As with most fables, it is very heavy handed. There are few shades of grey in this book. The government is Evil. Evil, Evil, Evil. They delight in being evil. The people are completely helpless and know this. They march around in their dingy lives, watching as things get progressively worse, and knowing they cannot do anything to change it. Their life is going to suck, and then they are going to die. Even if they break the rules to grab momentary happiness, they know that this is doomed. They will be found out eventually.It is impressive that a writer in the late 40s was able to come up with some of the technology that he did, the pervasive ability of the government to watch and scan everybody. The ability for a power (government, media, educational institutions) to mold the human mind subtly had already been shown over the centuries in a variety of situations, so that was less of a stretch. Go to any corporation, any university, and you'll find indoctrination being done at many levels, usually for \\"good cause\\". Building school spirit by uniting against a classic foe is all in fun - but that ability to build up hate so easily gives one pause.On the other hand, Orwell missed out on the power of massive computer networks. With the advent of TV and the Internet, viewers have the luxury of multiple information sources. This is something unprecedented in our history. Back in medieval days, you only knew what your local priest told you as far as news went. Most people could not read, and few traveled. Even in South Africa before apartheid was abolished they refused to bring in TVs, for fear that the population would be able to learn about life outside their own lands. That isolation is almost impossible in modern times. With a computer, you can gain access to news sources from around the world - both commercial and personal. You can hear, from people in Sudan, what life is like there. Even in countries like China where they attempt to control access to certain sites, there is always a way out, to find out from different sources what is going on.The book is still of course a cautionary tale, a warning of allowing any particular power to go too far. It is a look into the way human emotions can be manipulated, and how a society can be pressed down. However, it's important to remember this is a fable, a deliberate \\"Bleak! Despair! Death!\\" overly cynical view of things. In reality, we have seen *many* societies who were pressed down, and who successfully rebelled. Mankind is far more resiliant than portrayed here.SPOILER ALERTA key scene in the book involves the lead character's \\"betrayal\\" of his loved one. First he is tortured for months and months, something which makes little sense in any realistic viewing of these events. It is actually brought up by the character as being silly, and a throw-away answer is given. If the government actually spent this much time and effort feeding and torturing every single person who committed a crime, there would be no workers left. It is a plot device to ratchet up the tension in the story. The tension reaches its climax with a specific torture - the character is going to have a cage of rats attached to his head. This is, of course, his Worst Fear. To evade it, he asks that the box be put on his girlfriend instead. At this great betrayal, his heart is shattered.That this was some incredible failing that should have shattered his spirit does not make sense. Every human body has limits of emotional and physical pain. As much as we might value pride, honor, loyalty, love, or whatever else we hold dear, there will always be a point at which we will break. Knights who trained from birth to live a life of honor could be forced to confess if tortured for long enough. That is why things like cyanide pills exist in spy novels.Still, even though those parts of the story always nag at me when I read it, I do find the general lessons the book tries to convey to be quite important ones, and for that reason I definitely count this as a book that every adult should have read at least once."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 overview/reviewIn the beginning of 1984, Winston, you might think, is a normal Outer Party member, but when you get to the second chapter, it becomes clear that he is against Big Brother, the hero of the totalitarian state he lives in.An obscure friend of his, Syme, lectures him on newspeak at cafeteria's, his \\"Girlfriend\\", Julia, appears before as another Outer Party member, slipping a note into Winston's pocket in the bathroom, reading, \\"I love you\\". Confirming the fact that Julia does not want to kill Winston, but the exact opposite. O'Brien, the friend of Winston, though also his torturer in the Ministry of love, (Miniluv) incorporates him into a secret society, \\"The Brotherhood.\\" O'Brien gives Winston a quick glance, in turn beginning their friendship. Eventually Julia and Winston are found out by the Thought Police and both are brought to the Ministry of Love for torture, after which, Winston finds himself in a caf&eacute;. Winston is brainwashed into thinking certain ideas, ending with Winston himself succumbing to the thought police.

Oceania is in constant war, and indicates that it is destroying itself, for the sake of the war, perhaps for propaganda. Newspeak is the language of Oceania, and a propaganda language as well, the three slogans that the party has, \\"Ignorance is Strength,\\" \\"War is Peace,\\" and \\"Freedom is Slavery.\\" Are quite untrue, but the Proles choose not to worry about it, while party members use \\"Doublethink\\" mostly.Suggesting this is a good book is unworthy, this is an AWESOME book, so you should read it, get depressed."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is a dark and melancholy novel depicting the life of the average intellectual in a totalitarian world. The decription is striklingly deep and realistic. People who have lived in authoritarian countries would connect a lot with this book. Orwell, with great skill, creates a world where there is no hope, love, or comprehension. The reader is bound to connect with the characters and indulge in the events. After reading this book you will perceive life and history in a different way."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A preliminary:The site says that this is written by Erich Fromm and George Orwell. NOT TRUE. George Orwell wrote every word himself, and years later Fromm wrote a forgettable afterword. Do not give Fromm more credit than that.I own three copies of this book. I'm currently reading it for the second time and it's better than I remember. This book made me want to write, to teach, to forever immerse myself in the world of literature. It is the most superbly written novel of all time. After this, I devoured all of Orwell's books, to similar (but less) enjoyment. This is truly a book that changed my life. I recommend it to anyone who is capable of reading. Read it again if you've done so before. Put down \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"Farenheit 451\\" which cannot come close to the level of greatness achieved in this volume. Read this book. Read this book. Read this book. You will be much better for it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"First off, this book is incredible. At 13 years old, I didn't understand every aspect of it, but in a whole, everything made perfect, clear sense.I'm very interested in socialist governments(no, I don't like communist views; I'm a die-hard patriot at 13!), and I consider myself well-informed on up-to-date politics and such. And so, upon reading this book which was recommended to me by one of my teachers, I was horrified at the resemblances that Oceania and the direction our government is headed shared. The foresight of Orwell was shocking, and he kept the book very interesting.But a good portion of the middle was....awkward. Like, mature-content awkward (most teachers gave me girl-are-you-crazy? looks when they saw I was reading it. Later, I realized why). I almost didn't finish the book, but knowing its importance to my knowledge, I finished it. I definitely do not recommend it to anyone my age....-shudders-But its imperative that we as Americans read it. Remembering the mistakes of the past (and, in this case, the future) is imperative to keeping our nation a democracy. If we heed most of Orwell's warnings, we will be better equipped to save the future, and in doing so saving the past."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Someone's watching. The government has you entrenched in a conspiracy so deep, where a national tragedy gave leadership the opportunity to seize all of your rights in the name of your personal protection. No, this isn't the Patriot Act- it's \\"1984,\\" a dystopian Science Fiction novel by George Orwell, the author of \\"Animal Farm.\\" Written in 1949, \\"1984\\" hardly seems as dated as its title might imply. Really, nothing could be farther from the truth. The world set up by Orwell, over seen by Big Brother and his invisible band of Thought Police, has people political prisoners within their own country. Winston, a worker in the Record Department of one of the three ministries (The Ministry of Truth, or Minitrue), finds his mind resisting the world he's given, not completely accepting the \\"news\\" he's given, as well as doubting his contentment. He enters into a relationship, finds himself contacted by an underground resistance, and comes to discover some of the more dangerous traits of the Party. Orwell's \\"1984\\" is an extremely well written political masterpiece, which traces societal trends in an innovative and pessimistic sort of way.From the beginning, Orwell introduces new touches of technology made from innovations in his time. Things such as telescreens (basically televisions with the capability to communicate with and spy on members of the outer party) and speakwrites (a microphone that transcribes dictations) give a modern sense to the novel, while keeping it somewhat futuristic, even in modern times. No extravagant inventions like space ships or teleporters are touched on, so there isn't a feeling of inaccuracy or over-optimism that seems to be common in more ambitious science fiction media. Honestly, I found myself wishing that something such as a speakwrite existed for homework assignments, or even writing this very review; however, I didn't get that overwhelming sense of \\"Yeah right, nothing like THAT existed in 1984\\" from the position of being here in 2007.Orwell brings out the political message of the novel most obviously by using the supposed revolutionary Goldstein's book. The chapters from Goldstein's book are inserted into 1984 as Winston reads them. Although these excerpts read something like stereo instructions or college dissertations, it really affirms the politics behind Orwell's writing. The three political bodies, or countries, in this novel consist of Oceania, Eurasia and East Asia. Oceania includes the United Kingdom, Eurasia includes the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and East Asia includes China and Japan. The fact that Orwell had the foresight to predict a lot of specific traits of world politics (such as the takeover of one party regimes in China) and the escalation of current world politics (such as the arms race and the containment policy against the Soviet Union) absolutely floored me. There were times when I was reading through sections of Goldstein's history where I simply had to put it down, because some of the events supposedly taking place in the fifties and sixties I had just learned about in my history class as taking place around then. That in and of itself is not only brilliant, but very powerful; just knowing that the book predicted some of the things that happened gives more credibility to the more radical things Orwell predicted. That's what's so strong about \\"1984;\\" there's this sense of \\"It could happen.\\"SPOILER WARNINGS!Another strength of the novel was the relationship between Winston and Julia. Although I personally didn't like Julia - (she struck me as a very odd sort of a rebel who didn't even seem to know what she wanted) - her character was perfect for the novel. Her quirky unpredictability and her complete disregard for authority showed how even the most seemingly active Party members harbored deep reservations about the life they were living. Also, her somewhat shallow and lukewarm interest in politics was a good portrayal of the way people would begin to act after living under an oppressively totalitarian regime. It was admittedly strange to me how Winston was impressed by how many men Julia had managed to sleep with, but their relationship was still believable. Both of them had the fundamental desire to rebel against the system, and they channeled that towards sex. Fortunately, I couldn't personally relate to that, but it did represent a form of rebellion on Orwell's part against people who want to turn sex into a utility and take all of the pleasure out of it.The ending, however, was the most potent part of the novel. When Julia and Winston are caught and tortured, and Orwell describes the nightmarish ordeal Winston is put through, the reader really comes to understand how Winston develops. Throughout the entire novel, Winston's progression from a nervous rebel, to a carefree rebel, to a penitent traitor was perfectly delineated by Orwell. After Winston suffers through his torture and decries everything- his distaste for Big Brother, his suspicion of changing information, his mental rejection of double speak- he becomes just another guy. Another drone under Big Brother, a man who loves and follows Big Brother and works for Big Brother. At first, I admit I was disappointed. I kind of hoped for some sort of upset, a little sense of rebellion or even a feeling that something might have changed because of what Winston did. That lack of closure in that sense, however, was actually really good for the book though. It just shows how hopeless, how drone-like, how terrible an existence under a complete ruler can be, and how there really isn't any hope of the dystopian society changing after it has come in full swing. It really drove home that people should actively keep their most basic rights, and never let them slip away.\\"1984\\" was one of the most contemporary feeling books I have ever read that was written before the 80's. It's well written, engaging, exciting and interesting, and provides intellectual fodder as well as personal enjoyment. There is suspense, love, and introspective thought, and the entire novel is building up towards the big twists on the end. Personally, I think \\"1984\\" is one of the best of its kind, and was a better political metaphor than Alduous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" or even Orwell's own \\"Animal Farm.\\" However, you'll never be able to look at your government the same again- Big Brother is watching you."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"You've probably already read the other reviews on this site, so i'll just concentrate on my opinion on the relevance of this book in our contemporary society1984 is a stark warning against totalitarianism. Written in 1948, Orwell's depiction of a government-controlled society seemed absurd when published, contrasting the imnumerable amount of people that've said how real it seems now than it did then in western societyOne interesting factor is the geography of the planet. We are told very little and all we're told is that there're three 'super-states', Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia. Oceania is constantly at war with a vague and distant enemy, and is always switching between being allies and enemies with Eurasia and Eastasia. Comparing it to today, just what is this 'war on terrorism, and how threatened do you really feel about it (disregarding media opinion)?. America and Britian, both independantly throughout the years and in allegiance with each other recently, are constantly at war with an enemy. WWI, WWII, Cold war, Korean war, Vietnam war, Falklands War, Gulf war I and more recently Gulf war II. Societal opinions + perceptions are influenced by media, but who are we at war with? The \\"War on Terror\\" clearly highlights the fact that there is no tangible enemy anymore. Explained more clearly in Goldstein's passage in the book, we are constantly at war because it keeps us united, and stops us fighting one another, stops us fighting the government.Another interesting factor in book is the issue of government surveillance. 'Telescreen' in homes, Cameras everywhere you walk, Microphones even in the countryside to detect rebellious behaviour. Although key issues stated in the book aren't as extreme, the power the government now has to keep tabs on people and spy on them has reached limits it has never reached before. The 'Party' explain that this surveillance is for the benefit of the people (note: animal farm) and they constantly reassure the citizens, or 'comrades', that life was worst off before they came along. Similarly, our governments are constantly re-assuring us how much better our lives are because of them. I.D cards are being proposed under the pretence that they will 'eliminate terrorism and benefit fraud', which are something the people are 'persuaded they want' because they media tells them they do.The third, conclusively and i think most importantly, is the way this book challenges the fact we (society in 1948) take our freedom for granted. One passage in the book which sticks out in my mind specifically is when the main charactor walks through a lower-class area, and is terrified that the police patrols might stop him and ask him questions; 'what are you doing in this part of town? is this your usual way home'? etc. Similarly, if someone was walking down the street at 2am in a dangerous part of town for no particular reason, it would be deemed socially strange, thus encouraging this person not to do so, and do what everyone else does. If someone dresses in clothes that you do not usually see, he/she would be regarded as a weirdo, a social outcast\\".My point is, how free do we really think we are as a society these days? How easily are we opinionated by the media?Our society is edging closer and closer to the reality that is 1984, and i recommend that you read it, it will change the way you perceive news articles, and you'll question all these erosions of civil liberties that have been happening.By the way, Orwell didn't intend for this vision to be reality in the year 1984. He wrote it in 1948, so he just switched the last 2 letters around."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"As gripping and wrenching now as it was on my first reading in 1972. For old film buffs there is a black and white production with Richard Burton and Fred Hurt. Also excellent. A modern dystopian tale available on Amazon, &quot;Transfer&quot;, by Jerry Furland, portrays a new tyranny not unlike Orwell's in it's ubiquity. &quot;Transfer&quot; is stunninglyfrsh and topical. Like Orwell, Furland's impact is a mirror of the reader, hated or loved, but never hohum. Check it out. But hit Animal Farm before you leave Orwell:)"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's book 1984, published in 1949, was an excellent book. I thought it was amazing that he used such imagination to come up with all aspects of this book. The fact that he wrote this book in the 40's and projected what life might be like in 1984 was very interesting. It makes you think. We think of 1984 as a punk era that is well in our past, Orwell thought of 1984 as the future, the far off future. Just as we thought that the year 2000 was going to be filled with flying cars and people living on the moon and mars, he thought of 1984 in a very different way than it turned out. Or did he. He didn't have any way to perceive all of the technological advances we would make, but he did make some very good guesses. He talks about a machine that is in every room and on every street corner. This machine is called a \\"Telescreen.\\" This machine watches and listens to every word and every movement you make. The local government watches this and will arrest you if you are caught going against the government. Saying anything bad will get you in jail. In the year 1984, according to Orwell, the world has been split up into three superstates Eastasia, Eurasia, and Oceania. Oceania is were Winston Smith (the main character) lives. All of these superstates are run the same. They have a very strong central government that controls everything. These three states are constantly at war with each other and they have all created their own languages. The government in Oceania is called \\"Big Brother.\\" This is where the phrase \\"Big brother is watching you\\" came from. In these states no one is free and everyone is an enemy. People are raised on false beliefs that the government has told them. The goverment would even take it to the extreme and collect all the newspapers and rewrite them and burn the old ones if the papers stated beleifs that the goverment doesn't have anymore. That is what Winston Smith did. He was a a rewriter of documents. The government of Oceania was one based totally upon mind manipulation. They used a term that they called \\"Doublethink\\" this was the power of holding two contradictory ideas in someones head and having them fully accept both. Big Brother raised all the people to be loyal to their government and be the government's slaves. The people saw this as being the way of things so they went along with it, having every second of their lives planned out and watched. Even people's children were more loyal to the government than their parents. Their was a scene in the book were a kid turned his parents in for speaking slander against the government. Even the language was cleansed and regulated. The government created a language called \\"Newspeak.\\" \\"Newspeak\\" contained only words that were cleansed in thought. For example the word bad would be translated to \\"ungood.\\" All in all, this book talks about the government and all the ways it is composed. But it does have a story line as well. The storyline is about Winston and this girl he meets named Julia. They both have the same strong feelings against the government and they often meet in very crowded places where it would be hard for them to be caught talking. They finally decide to join an underground group against the government. They meet with this guy O'Brien who claims to be in charge. The story starts to unfold after that meeting. This was very good book. It was very deep and intense. I loved hearing all about the Totalitarian ideas the government practiced. Plus it was cool to hear what a man in the 40's perceived 1984 to be like. In a way he was right, we are constantly monitored by satellites and surveillance camera's. GPS systems and even cell phones. \\"Big Brother\\" does exist just in a different way than Orwell perceived him. But we also do have our freedom to think and speak. These are two things that the citizens of Orwell's 1984 did not have. But keep this in mind \\"Big Brother\\" could be watching you right now."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Simply one of the greatest novels ever put to print. It is sometimes shocking, sometimes moving, sometimes sad; but this is one of the strongest warnings about the future that we are possibly headed towards.I admit I enjoyed it much more now that I am reading it for pleasure and not school."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book, while written in 1945, is still relevant today as we develop a new vision of our society. The players in our political system mimic the situation that was to be projected to 1984. The proposed outcome in the book appears to be coming to fruition today. Excellent book, but discomfitting commentary on today's \\"progressives\\"."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This excellent book is about life which was deprived of all meaning, whose primary goal was a constantly increasing productivity motivated by an ingeniously designed social system that advocated \\"love and peace.\\"I was born in the Soviet Republic of Ukraine. I recall the anxiety that tormented my family during the preceding months that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. I was seven and lived in my own universe, but I was sort of aware that the Soviet Empire was seeing its last days. Karl Marx must have been doing somersaults in his grave.I don't remember much about living under communism - except that daily life was \\"by the book\\" - but I've talked plenty about it to my parents and grandparents. When Stalin went six feet under, it became a bit more tolerable, but it remained totalitarianism nonetheless. Orwell did an exceptional job at depicting the essential aspects of that kind of state, more precisely Soviet regime. The detail that he told is fascinating; as if Stalin or Beria had let him in on the juicy stuff. Some of it he exaggerated, some he understated, but fundamentally he was accurate. Also, it is imperative that the reader keeps in mind that it was published in 1949. A vast majority of people in Russia and Europe were isolated from this kind of knowledge - the government made sure of that through an intricate system of secret police - so this book was a revelation. Of course we now know that, aside from the fictitious names, he essentially portrayed reality. The indoctrination that is described in the book still lingered when I attended school in Ukraine in the \`80s. Soviet propaganda machine was thorough indeed.The history of totalitarian states is complex and enormous amount of time and literature has been dedicated to it. This book, however, is a good substitute if one cannot wrestle with a lengthy 700-page tome. It won't make you a political scholar, but it'll educate you on what Soviet Russia was. It's written in a lucid manner; however, one has to read it as nonfiction to truly appreciate the author's vision. George Orwell is a genius and his \\"1984\\" will be read for a long time."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is the best science fiction story I have ever read. George Orwell constantly had me on the edge of my seat never knowing whether the Thought Police would catch Winston expressing his opinion. I really liked the way Orwell writes this book as if 1984 was such a distant future. It makes me think if our forms of government worldwide are getting to that point. This novel really made me think about how corrupt our government is and how they can do just about anything they want as in the story. Orwell also constantly uses great description. This line in particular I really enjoyed, \\"Outside, even through the shut window pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no color in anything except the posters that were plastered everywhere.\\" I loved the way Orwell gave this description of London, it makes me see such a colorless world with no sign of any emotion. There were certain aspects that had me confused however. Orwell's use of huge vocabulary had me confused at times and I would read many paragraphs over to get the full understanding. However it is good for yound readers such as myself to learn many new words. Orwell gave his knowledge about how our government today, isn't that far off as in the government in the story to millions of readers. This novel made me better understand on how things are setup in our society and how we as people need to understand that the government's power is a problem.I highly recommend this novel to everyone. - RA, EASTLAKE"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read this book to kill some time at work, and I have to say that the time I \\"killed\\" was some of the best time I ever spent with any work of fiction.

You'll come out of the assignment with a new favorite novel, and thoughts and ideas that will challange and haunt you for weeks, if not years to come."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"What is most impressive about 1984 is not the quality of writing or the appeal of the storyline, though both are excellent. What is most impressive about 1984 is that so many of the concepts discussed, either implicitly or explicity are still applicable and relevant in today's modern politics. Doublethink as a concept is not far off from the lies today's politicians ask you to believe as they continue to become embroiled in one controversial moral or ethical crisis after another. One has to wonder, after reading this book, if we are not in fact on our way to catastrophe ourselves in the 21st century. Though the threat is not perhaps militant in nature, it is still real nonetheless in the form of moral decay. This book is emminently comparable to Huxley's Brave New World and if you enjoyed one, you'll enjoy the other."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Yeah right. That is what we would all like to think in our safe, secure little world. When written, no one would pubish this astounding fantastic reality. Mr. Orwell had to wait several years and suffer many dissapointments for anyone to accept and believe in his story. Today, what once seemed 'science-fiction' is an all too true and fast becoming reality. This book will make you question your reality, understand accpetance, empathize with institutionalism and wonder at how individualistic you really are - despite your noblee attempts!Although, at first intimidating, Orwell's style and nature soon becomes free and clear, and though it drags on at some parts; You won't stop reading untill you are done. What seems hard to comprehend and language a few chapters to get used to.. you too will soon think in terms of newspeak and realize how easily it can happen to you too!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"From cover to cover 1984 captivates the reader with its insightful, intriguing, and disturbing look at human nature. Winston, the hero of the novel, lives in a totalitarian government that has control over every aspect of his life. The government has made privacy obsolete and love a sin; therefore, making life for many people unlivable.But with the slogan \\"Big Brother Is Watching You\\" reigning over every wall and building, many people are far to afraid to speak out against this so called \\"perfect\\" government, in fears of loosing their life. Winston however, feels that as long as he is living under the rule on INGSOC (the official name of the government) he might as well be dead. So he looses his fears and slowly takes action against INGSOC. He falls in love and for the first time in his life he is truly happy. But everything that he is doing is against the law. The government views love as something that is dangerous to the party; therefore it must be destroyed. Ultimately the government turns out to be far more complex and powerful than anyone imagined.I am assuming that many people are reading this before they have actually read 1984. I will not reveal more because I do not want to ruin the plot for you. AlI can say is that it has a surprise ending that you would have never expected.1984 was written by George Orwell in 1949, yet its theme and ideas still holds true in many ways to today's world. That is one, out of many reasons, as to why 1984 will forever be a classic. Set in 1984, Orwell's depiction, of what was then considered the future, is both horrific and in some ways accurate to the governments of today.There is great deal of symbolism in this novel. I believe that Orwell's intention, as Goldings had been in Lord of the Flies, was to reveal the evil that drives people and to show how that evil is apparent even in today's modern societies. Orwell worded this book so eloquently that it is easy for almost anyone to pick up the symbolism.1984 was so eye opening for me, that after I read it I walked morbidly around the house just thinking about what ultimately happened to Winston. This book pulls everyone in because it has all the elements - drama, action, suspense, and romance. I only recommend this book to people that are at least in 6 grade. The reading isn't challenging, it is just the actual concepts about the goal of governments and human spirit that might be confusing. If you are the type of person that likes to get absorbed in a book, not just have a quick read, then this is the book for you. If you enjoy books such as Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, or The Giver, then 1984 will undoubtedly become a favorite."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"More chilling now than when I first read it over 25 years ago. Not necessarily because of increased understanding but because of increased intrusion by the state. I am nagged by the realization that had Orwell lived longer, his work would have been closer to current events than fiction."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell describes a Negative Utopia, one which Big Brother watches your every move, any inkling of dislike towards the party can get you killed, and even confessions of one's own children can send you to labor camps.The first half paints a scary picture as one man tries to cope with everyday life in this suffocating hell. There are telescreens constantly watching you, people totally dedicated to revising the past to suit the Party, spies out to snitch on you. The main character, through his mundane everyday ordeal, breaks the mold and does something dangerous - buys and writes into a diary. The overall feeling is a common but classic one - one man tries to break out of a confining society. He describes the mood of the world that any man can relate to, being an individual in a world where individuality is not welcome.The second half is the weaker half. It turns from a subtle message to an openly overt message. Instead of the concentrating on one man's perspective, Orwell bombards the reader with mock history and rhetoric, and a last minute confession by the Party itself. That last minute confessions reminds me of how in any badly written movie, the villain suddenly explains his motives and his actions to the hero before he's about to kill him. And like those movies, the motivation is overblown and totally unreal.This book was enjoyable, and the writing was smooth and fluid. The lack of dialogue and action sort of took away from the enjoyment, but not too much. I would recommend this book, but I still think Animal Farm is far superior."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I feel 1984 is a great book. One of the best books I have ever read. A constant mind game that toyed with my senses. I loved the book start to finish, except for the excerpt from Emanuel Goldstein's book. I felt the passage was long winded and demeaned the excitement of the book dramatically. 1984 is a great book for people interested in politics, world domination, and totalitarian &quot;negative utopias.&quot; Winston, the main character, is a wonderful figurehead for the hoplessness of freedom in the INGSOC reality. I personally loved this book, and I think many others will find it equally enjoyable and satisfying. 1984 was a fairly graphic book, not as graphic as others, but graphic still. Some parts of the novel were silly, others very serious, it is a roller coaster of emotions, events, and politics. Julia, a great supporting character who really moved the story along and forced Winston to take chances, without which the story would not be possible. INGSOC is a lot like the Russian communists and the German Nazis in their beliefs, but not in their actions. INGSOC plays a sinister role as a world super power that stomps out competition, except for its fellow super powers. In this colossal struggle of power and espionage, one thing stands true...Love, but in the end even that dies."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The book 1984 by George Orwell was in a way funny. It was somewhat odd and mysterious, but it was funny. It was funny because of how George Orwell viewed the future. He described secret organizations. I believe that this book was very good literature, but it gave a weird outlook on the year 1984. As an example George Orwell writes,&quot;Winston feared for his life that the thought police would track him down if he dared keep writing in the diary.&quot; Even so for a person who loves reading about what could have been and the odd ways history could have happened, this George Orwell classic is all for you, and I recommend it. For those that prefer a more realistic novel, like me, aim for another author and book of your choice."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is one of the most depressing books I've ever read, but it does present an excellent discussion about conspiracy and power.

The most striking feature of this book is that for some countries this type of totalitarian state is not to far into the future, which left a small, but apparent truth with me. Orwell was not trying to show what life in 1984 would be, but as a projection and exaggeration of tendencies and changes over the years. It would be a shame to miss out on this book no matter what."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A book well written but over-praised.

For added shock I recommend reading it before (or after) reading Ma Bo's book entitled Blood Red Sunset about what communist life was like for one man during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. The similarities between fact and fiction, especially with such seemingly outlandish fiction, are very interesting."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Attempt to conjure up the idea of a society where the government is always watching, like a spy. You brush your teeth, you go to work, you eat, you talk to your spouse, you water your plants ...and they are watching. Not only is every activity monitored, but also your deepest inner thoughts are screened, picked and prodded through for the smallest indication of rebellious thoughts. Telescreens constantly feed propaganda from the government into unsuspecting minds. War is just a normal incidence. A neighbor or even a friend might turn you in to the thought police at any moment. The government is in total and complete control. You can trust no one. George Orwell created this enslaved world in the book, 1984 and put an ordinary middle class man, named Wilson, in the position of the protagonist.Wilson, an average member of this controlling society, begins to have an itch for rebellion as the novel, 1984 commences. He has an underlying craving for freedom, of thought and expression. He has a job that includes activities considered inappropriate by most of today's standards. Basically, Wilson edits history to fit the beliefs and preaching of Big Brother for the populace. Wilson finds a forbidden love. He searches for a sympathizer, someone who shares his same beliefs and values. But above all, he searches for clues about the past and the truth. Suspense, Deceit, and Passion are foremost components in this novel.For many students and adults alike the thickness as well as the font size of the novel sends them running. Others find the genre that the paperback is placed in - Science Fiction - to be discouraging. And many of those who do actually start reading are quickly bored. Some, who are required to read it, hurriedly skim the pages and discontinue comprehending and processing the book.The story doesn't begin to pick up steam until about thirty pages into it. However these first pages are essential to have a complete understanding of the book. After that, Orwell adds depth and dimension to the plot that is unlike many stories. Orwell also adroitly applies high-level vocabulary and sentence structure to his tale. 1984 is exciting and gripping with a distinctive and unforeseen ending. It is a chilling tale of what could happen to the human race in the midst of the race for technology and an unattainable utopia. Encrusted with many essential and important themes, every student should read it, so they can reflect on their individual lives and prevent possible future atrocities from coming to fruition.This novel is well worth anyone's time and thought. It is not just your average run-of-the-mill science fiction story that will captivate only the Trekkies among us. 1984 is thought provoking as well as emotionally stimulating. This narrative, written more than half a century ago, still applies today. It ends in a unique and unpredictable way."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Of all of George Orwell's works, \\"1984\\" must rank as his most famous, most known and most read book - and with good reason too. It depicts a society under the iron grip of a totalitarian terror state, where the Thought Police are in control, and the population is held under the mystical will of \\"Big Brother\\", the unseen leader of the ruling party. Orwell's protagonist, Winston Smith, is incredibly unique in the sense that he enacts a rebellion, and demonstrates a small vestige of free thought that one believes has been completely eradicated by the Party.As a lower-level propagandist in the Ministry of Truth, Winston is a participant in the very system that he believes himself to be rebelling against. His duties include disposing of unwanted, or potentially dangerous historical facts, and the alteration of past newspaper articles to suit the line of he Party. This can range from the amount of chocolate in the week's ration, to the wartime enemies of the state. Nothing in Winston's world, is what it seems. Orwell's masterful prose takes the reader through the progessive stages of Winston's \\"rebellion\\", from his writing of \\"Down with Big Brother\\" in his secretive diary, to his love affair with Julia, a co-worker at the Ministry of Truth - and a notorious philanderer (this however, is pleasing to Winston!)Orwell makes excellent use of the contrasting themes of hope and despair to weave a complex tapestry of Oceania's political system. As it turns out, Winston's perceived success is a mere illusion, as he finds himself unable to trust any of his fellow citizens (the Thought Police are personified in a humble, ageing shopkeeper, who reveals himself upon having gained Winston's trust). The tragedy of Orwell's novel is that whatever hope is created by Winston's rebellious actions (such as his dissent in his diary, his affair with Julia, his enquiries about the past times) is countered by the overwhelming revelation that the omnipotence of the Party is unsurpassed. The reader could even conclude that Winston was lead from the nose by the very system he believed he was challenging.The novel ends on a grim note, with Winston experiencing frightful torture in the chambers of the Ministry of Love, and reconditioned as yet another mindless, thoughtless and conforming pawn in the never-ending game played by the Party upon it's own people.Orwell's tragic novel also had political relevance in reality. Written in 1948 (hence the title), Orwell was in fact writing a searing indictment of a totalitarian system that is the identical twin of that depicted in these pages - Stalinist Russia (Big Brother's description is a mirror image of Stalin). Stalin's reign of state-sanctioned terror, brutality and thuggery lasted from 1929 until his death in 1953, and during the Second World War (when the Soviet Union was the ally of Great Britain and the USA against Nazi Germany), Orwell was one of the few British political commentators who had the courage and will power to reveal the true nature of their so-called \\"ally\\". Through reading Orwell's masterpiece, one can draw a solid conclusion as to how life was in Stalin's terror state 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.Orwell's most endearing work is testimony to the value of human liberty and why we should never let it be wrested from us."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book demands many readings; every time you do so you will gain something you missed (mainly because you will, hopefully, mature between each reading and thus gain heightened awareness of the subtleties of the novel). I disagree with another reviewer who said this could never happen; anyone with a cursory knowledge of Nazi Germany or Communist Russia can tell you it almost did happen. In Germany children denounced their parents to the Gestapo; in Russia there were purges of all political opponents. In both countries, there was history revision to suit the government. Hitler attempted to create a perfect society chillingly like 1984's Oceania, with all unattractive or deviant elements eliminated or pushed aside (like the proles). Also, anyone who has read The Brothers Karamazov can see the strong influence of \\"The Grand Inquisitor\\" in this book.The book is terrifying not so much in its view of the future but in its climax, when the Party proves itself capable of destroying all human feeling and individuality. Winston believes he will die hating Big Brother, and thus be free, but in the end he is killed with only love in his heart for the Party and B.B.; there can be no freedom. The story shows Winston as the last of his kind, the last with memory of the past and hatred for the Party combined. In the end both are eradicated; the Party controls everything. It has the power to say 2+2=5, and can prove it so; it can repeal the laws of nature and no one can perceive it otherwise. Winston Smith knew how to die free, but the Party destroyed even the desire to do so. It did not kill him until it knew he was \\"cured\\" and loved Big Brother. No one can be free; only the Party can exist in people's minds.Horrifying, and absolutely necessary. This is the most important book ever written."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The best anti-utopian book imaginable!And yes, there are many and a lot of them take themselves too seriously and are quite pompous. 1984 also takes itself seriously but it has a right to. It is so well written that gravity is the only appropriate sentiment in a very dark world.Most people have heard of Big Brother and the Thought Police and the hype over and over again. Is 1984 really that good? Yes!The most moving scene for me was at the end, when a character succumbs under torture to betray someone (hope I'm not giving too much away - after all torture and betrayal are compulsory ingredients in an anti-utopia anyhoo) and the empathy portrayed in the book was so strong that I got depressed because I felt like it was ME that just betrayed everyone I care for.A wonderful book, a must read especially since it can be done in a day (and should definitely take no more than 2!). Unlike the anarchists and conspiracy theorists who reckon 1984 is especially relevant &quot;in today's global climate&quot;, I say it's a book for all time."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's 1984 is a book about control in the reality of his world to the connection it has to ours; it's fascinating and shocking how Orwell was able to see a world such as the one in his book. The book is a prediction and shadow of our world today. Ever since Orwell published his book, it has been like a bible to people everywhere. This book is fascinating not because of the feeling put into it, but because of how it shows and gives the reader a sense of how humanity is and can become like the world in Orwell's book.The only freedom shown in the world of 1984 is the self-thought of what the word actually means. Winston Smith is the man who experiences this and leads us through this horrible world. He doubts the righteousness of the totalitarian government (Big Brother) that rules Oceania, (one of three superstates in the world of 1984). The book starts with Winston and then shows how Big Brother (the government) is unreal. The government made its own language, is at constant war with the other two superstates, and watches its citizens at all times. As Winston's rebellion develops, we see how Big Brother is not as unreal as we think, he seems real, and to all the citizens he is real, this is what helps control Oceania the belief of Big Brother.Oceania, Eastasia, and Eurasia are the three battling superstates. All want control, have the same kind of government, and are at constant war to obtain what they want. The process used to get absolute power is one used by past, present, and future dictators, like Stalin, Mussolini and Hitler. Big Brother manipulates its citizens psychologically into suitable ways of thinking. Instead of only using propaganda techniques, Big Brother also uses something called Newspeak and telescreens. Newspeak is the official language of Oceania, and it is used to control the citizens' unorthodox thinking. Winston works at the base of Newspeak; he changes words, news, stories, and information for the government. The telescreens monitor each citizen and stop them of their privacy, revolt, or un-orderly behavior.Winston meets a girl named Julia who also feels the same as Winston does about Big Brother. They become lovers and their relationship leads them to what gives the reader the true sense of what the book is truly about. The backbone of Big Brother (the government) is revealed. When Orwell shows what really is Big Brother, gives the reader the true sense of the masterpiece of George Orwell's book.The manipulative technique used by Big Brother to control their citizens is unrecognizable; it is all about mind control. The secret for Big Brother's success is doublethink, the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously and fully accepting both. Big Brother is supposedly a person, the head leader of the government in the book 1984, but he doesn't exist. The government controls people by creating a false leader with a system of mind control.The book shows us how a government can become powerful and how it is possible in our world today. The thought of the possibility actually happening is frightening because our world now can become the world of greed for control, violence, mystery, and slavery that is shown in the book 1984. That is what makes this book so good; it truly pulls us into the reading because the reality in the book and our life, is paralleled by the possibility that can exist."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Cynical, pessimistic, and utterly untrusting of the motives of anyone in a position of power. It's all you need to decipher any political speech, posturing or campaign."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Read this book. No matter what your political affiliations, this classic will open your eyes to the dangers of conformity and control. In Orwell's chilling vision, only opinions and views approved by the State are permitted. Is the world we live in today so very different? Yes and no. No, we are not arrested for listening to the Dixie Chicks. Nor are we jailed for reading Ann Coulter. Yes, there are those in positions of influence (on both sides of the political spectrum) who would probably like to make a few such arrests. Just kidding ... maybe.This book is brilliantly written, the characters well-developed and compelling, the setting frighteningly real. The central thrust of this novel is the idea that being able to tell the truth is essentially being free to comment upon the world as you understand it. We all have different points of view, none of which represents the sum total of reality. Orwell creates a world where the ruling powers dictate the perception of reality to the masses. Reading this book will help to train you to identify this practice in the modern world and, hopefully, also train you to resist."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Being a ninth-grader, I looked over the required reading list for high-school and saw that later, incoming juniors had to read 1984. I don't know about you, but I looked at the book and in my opinion it looked quite bulky. I figured I should start reading it now and in two years I might finish it. Surprisingly, though, the book read awfully quickly. Parts of the book are so terrifyingly captivating that I was drawn in, and at points I just found myself reading faster and faster. The reason for this is: not only does Orwell use stunningly descriptive language combined with expert storytelling, the message is clear and profound: A government can only be as perfect as the people running it and living under it, and we should not try to make people perfect. By purging man of evil, we also destroy his good, and drain all humanity from him. Orwell gives future peoples a choice: a perfect society in which people are mindless drones, or a society in which we are human and do our best.In the story, we see a society in which people cannot step one toe out of line, or they are swept away to the Ministry of Love, a vividly and horrifically described torture chamber where one is mutilated physically, mentally and emotionally until one corrects his way of thinking to match that of the Party, an all-powerful upper-class which can very well proclaim that 2+2=5.After reading \\"Animal Farm,\\" I expected \\"1984\\" to be a satire on government of the day. I found it hard to believe that the two books were written by the same author. \\"1984\\" is much, much deeper and warns us that a greater power than the government of our day may soon arise to steal away our humanity. Since we are supposed to be the future, I suggest that any high school students read this book (hey, it's probably going to be required reading sooner or later, right?)Orwell takes the reader from the depths of fear to the height of romantic literature to a spark of hope and then back to fear again in a highly powerful novel, and a good read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In the book 1984, George Orwell depicts a dystopia, a world that went wrong, a world of manipulation and control which uses its people against themselves like pawns. It provides stimulating themes of dehumanization, isolation, repression, loneliness, social class disparity and abuse of power. Orwell has mixed these themes and has blended them into a classic image of a dystopian world. 1984 was meant as a warning against totalitarian tendencies rather than a prophetic work. These various fears and uncertainties disclosed in 1984 can be perceived as a reflection of today's society.Although 1984 was written in 1948 and published in 1949, Orwell was successful in portraying the world's totalitarian society-which exists today. He was able to prophesize about what the world is going to turn out like. As the year 1984 has passed, many think of Orwell as a skeptic or just a mere critic, while the case is quite different. George Orwell's predictions have been proved to be quite accurate. 1984 is the first book which gives us an accurate insight on today's world. This thought-provoking book encourages the reader to believe that this stereotype society of today is actually under control of governments which are hiding things from the local public. By giving examples, 1984 shows how these governments and \\"big fish\\" can use innocent people as puppets for their own use and tools for their own machinery.Some of the dark shadows portrayed in 1984, like subjugation, social class discrepancy and abuse of power can be eye-openers. One of the worst realities/fears disclosed in 1984 is invasion of privacy and oppression by the government. These factors count as the crux of 1984 and the message Orwell wants to convey to his readers. Invasion of privacy by the government is revealed at every stage, as the chapters of 1984 unfold. Evidence such as \\"Big Brother is Watching You\\" and the monitoring of actions by the telescreen and the police patrol system, which keeps track of people and check over what people are doing, clearly shows that there is no privacy in the dystopian world exposed in 1984. This invasion of privacy of the people of Oceania, keeps them from living their life like normal people and this is how Orwell convinces readers to avoid any path that might lead toward such societal degradation.Orwell's main goals in 1984 are to depict the frightening techniques a totalitarian government (in which a single ruling class possesses absolute power) might use to control its subjects, and to illustrate the extent of the control that the government is able to exert. This totalitarian society shown in 1984 is indirectly related to the invasion of privacy which is further connected with the oppression by the government. This domination of the government in Orwell's dystopia can be seen in various instances, like the unsanitary and squalor conditions of Airstrip One, which indirectly makes it possible for the government to suppress the locals. Another technique of repression is that of how they tell incorrect numbers of increase or decrease in ration production etc. By carrying these type of activities, the government is not only hypnotizing the citizens of Oceania but the government is also making them realize that they are helpful and concerned about the welfare of their society, which makes the ignorant people of Oceania (proles) happy and satisfied with their helpless lives, and most of them do not even understand that the Party is oppressing them.Of course, the world that Orwell envisioned in 1984 did not materialize. Yet 1984 remains an important novel, for the alarm it sounds against the abusive nature of authoritarian governments, but even more so for it's in depth analysis of the psychology of power and the ways that manipulations of language and history can be used as mechanisms of control. Examples such as how America is trying to take over all the resources of the world and how it is trying to tap phone calls and keep an eye of what is going on all over the country are all examples of invasion of privacy and the initial process of the formation of a totalitarian society. If a person focuses on today's world, he will surely be able to visualize a world which has not come under authoritarian rule today, but a world which will definitely materialize in Orwell's words, tomorrow. Though the world did not fall under authoritarian control as Orwell feared it might, 1984 has not become dated; it remains an invaluable book, warning against a world that could come into existence and a world that has not completely escaped from the dystopian dangers that Orwell once described.1984 has definitely found its place in the world of literature. It is a book that awakens those people who are victims of autocratic governments. It awakens people from their robotic lifestyles. 1984 gives a chance to all its readers to grasp the realities of totalitarian regimes and how innocent people are hypnotized and used as automations. 1984 is unquestionably a worthwhile read. It is simply mind grasping, thought provoking and mesmerizing. This is what makes George Orwell a genius of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I was shell-shocked when I read \\"Queenie\\"'s review. How can you live life not knowing that THE BOOK IS FICTIONAL!!!! It was a metaphor for what the Soviet Union would be like in the 20th century. Notice I said \\"would be like\\" because it was written decades before 1984. I cannot belive something so simple has to be spelled out like this, but there you have it. I thought it was a fantastic book. Depressing, but a must-read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In this book everyone is watched by Big Brother. History is written and re-written on a daily basis to fit the government's propaganda needs. Words are slowly taken away as the government seeks to stifle creativity and speech. Children are indoctrinated from very early on and every one is a member of some pro-government committee.One man seeks to defy the government by thinking for himself thereby committing \\"thought-crimes\\". He also keeps a journal and seeks out a lover.This book is too hard to adequately explain. It is well written and is a must read for everyone. Whether you are liberal or conservative, democrat or republican I am sure you have heard quotes used from this book attacking either side of the fence. From the Patriot act to Hillary Care opponents have vocally cited this book to justify their fears. I suggest you read it for yourself and draw your own conclusions as to which more closely portrays Big Brother. My feeling is that they all portray this book very well in one way or another."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I first read 1984 as a teen; and it's imagery and parameters of political analysis have stayed with me, and grown ever since. It is one of the most important works of the 20th century.Orwell crafted a brilliant picture of how a totalitarian oligarchy can exist and thrive. There isn't a single element in the book that cannot be found in the history of the world of the past 50 years; in all nations, all places, all times, all peoples.We have all seen how doublethink works; and, if we were really honest, we've experienced it in our own lives and performed it - doubtless to perfection. Human beings have a genius for lying to themselves and believing every word of it.There are two flaws in the book. One is that Orwell's vison tackled only half of the danger facing us. True, in, for example, present day USA under the domination of the Bush-led Neocon Regime, we see many of the Orwellian principles in action. But I belive that Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" lent eloquent imagery to the other half of the equation. Combine a balance of the Orwellian (oligarcy established and sustained by brutality, torture, brainwashing, and oppression) and Huxlian elements (oligarcy established and sustained by diversion through drug abuse, sexual amorality, and mind-numbing entertainment) and you will have a picture of the world in which we live.The other is that he completly ignored the element of economics and how manipulation of, and indeed, application of the Orwellian and Huxlian principles upon, economics and finance are essential to the establishment of a world dictatorship. The reader is advised to examine the workings and infrastructure of, for example, the IMF, the World Bank, and the SWIFT network.And make no mistake, we do live there. Human beings are ceasing to be human. I could write for hours listing evidence of this: and so could you.Having said that, I believe this book to possess a valuable weapon against tyrrany and dehumanization for all people. The whole of humanity is richer for having such a warning in place. Perhaps someone will listen."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"For a fascinating read, pick your favorite (yeah, right) business theory book about corporate culture and read it side-by-side with Orwell's masterpiece. The shifting truths, shameless propaganda and mindless work that drones like Winston Smith are subjected to illustrate the dark underside of corporate America that have resulted in the scandals of the early 21st centruy, including the likes of Enron, Tyco and others.Hell, if they served gin at work, the similarities would be complete for many workers.While Orwell is a pessimist, and sees nothing but a bottomless abyss, the careful reader can see glimmers of hope in the tired institutions of freedom of speech, and the press.Orwell's 1984 is as fascinating to read in the 21st century as it was when I read it for the first time in 1984."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"If you haven't read this book, get it.

I finshed reading it for the first time about amonth ago, and it really, truly caused me to actually think. Few books nowadays even can claim that. Orwell was a true visionary when he wrote this book. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a socialist, it just wouldn't surprise me if within the next 300 years it ends up like what Orwell said."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Possibly the worst thing to say about this overwhelming book is that it is...science fiction. It is promoted as such in the schools where the kids \\"have\\" to read it because it is a \\"classic\\" (we all know what that means, and if you dont then consider how many books you remember from that time and consider what effect they would have on you had you read them 10 or 15 years later).Orwell constructs and describes a nightmarish totalitarian dictatorship where the system controls literally everything. And that includes your thoughts. If you deviate you will be \\"corrected\\".It's a society where the past has been wiped out because the system controls all forms of information. It is impossible to know what has happened before and one is forced to accept the constant lies from the government at face value while going through intense brainwashing of other forms as well.Winston (the main character) is a man who still has traces of the past in his brain, in other words he commits the ultimate crime (thoughtcrime) as he questions the official version of things. As he desperately looks for signs from others hoping that they feel the same way he enters an underground conspiracy that aims to overthrow Big Brother (the invisible but everpresent power that represents a faceless system). And just as a flame of hope lights up inside him the nightmare transforms into an endless journey to hell.There is no point of giving away the plot because it happens to be one of great twists as Winston finds out in the most scary way imaginable the sheer controlling power that Big Brother enjoys over everyone.There are so many myths about 1984. One is that the book implies the horrors of communism (stalinism to be exact). While it is true that Orwell was inspired by the \\"feats\\" of Big Daddy (that would be Joseph Stalin) to write his book he was equally inspired by the unspeakable crimes of the Nazi dictatorship in Germany as well. Orwell does not imply any one specific form of dictatorship but he simply tries to see forward, he tries to warn and predict the forms that the dictatorships of the future will have and he puts no political color on it. The dictatorship he describes could happen in a society near you, no matter where you live and no matter how safe you think your \\"democracy\\" might seem to you.Allthough (and especially) the last part of the book is the most intimidating and overbearing one, i found that what actually scared me the most was how accurate the author is in what he sees for the future. Remember he wrote this way over half a century ago. And what does he see?He foresees thought control. Check. In case you think you arent thought-controlled then the system is functioning perfectly thank you. He foresees the manipulation of history in order to make the system more powerful. Check again. It used to happen in a smaller degree now it happens in a scientific degree. Take for example the \\"People's history of the United States\\" by Howard Zinn, read it, and compare what you read with what you \\"learned\\" in school, and you will see my point. And that's just one of the 1000s of examples that could be brought up.He foresees a a dictatorship where people do not realise they live in a dictatorship (and the few who do are \\"put away\\"). Well, guess what, check again. Regardless of where you live chances are you do not realise how the system controls you, and not only that, but chances are again, you call this a democracy because that is what you are told (brainwashed) to call it.And on and on and on..All this is just paving the way for the Orwellian nightmare.Some have said that life itself proved that Orwell was just a hardcore pessimist as the \\"future\\" didnt prove to be that horrible. Wrong. The genius of George Orwell has actually seen the process through which what he describes WILL happen. It is in fact happening right now. There are many who see it and sense it but many times more who dont.There is no point to be silly and promote this stunning future-diagnosis of a book as a \\"classic\\" or to suggest to you that you \\"must\\" read it or all that.Things are very simple. If you care about yourself before all else then do read it. If there is still hope for you then this book will change you. If this book has no effect on you then you do not understand the problem to begin with. But that's a good thing. Because in that case you will never have to see some future \\"Room 101\\". What is \\"Room 101\\"? It's a place in Orwell's \\"future nightmare\\" that very few have been in but everybody knows that that's where you are corrected from bad thoughts.But go on. Treat yourself to some bad thoughts. Such rooms dont exist anyway."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A stunning book, that's really all I can say. Just make sure you read the chapter on the language, which is usually the last part of the book, first.

The amount of relevance this book has today is overwhelming, considering modern government propaganda techniques and the double edged sword of technology. This story serves as a warning to all who trust the government, especially in regards to privacy issues.Winston Smith, while not the ideal romantic protagonist, is still compelling in his own right with his inspiring (and finally tragic) fight against Big Brother. The struggle that takes place between Winston and the government in 1984 is psychologically thrilling and intense, and it is still difficult for me to put the book down each time I read it. I am particularly drawn to the character of O'Brien, who represents to me the culmination of a path that all seasoned politicians and government officials travel down.The year 1984 has come and past, but an extreme statist government similar to the one portrayed in the novel still may haunt us in the future."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Having grown up in the former Soviet Union, as soon as I started reading the book, I could tell immediately where Orwell drew his inspiration, as well as most details of peoples' existence. Reading the book was like re-visiting my childhood, as well as refreshing my mother's and grandmother's stories of the soviet life in the 1950's, all the brainwashings, terrible living conditions, propaganda, people disappearing in the middle of the night, etc. Basically, Orwell took soviet reality of that era, and then took it a few notches up, and then twisted it some. Art imitates life, so to speak. I'm not sure why everyone credits Orwell's imagination, then. Either way, the book is extremely boring, the plot is almost non-existent, nothing is really going on, the [unlikely] love affair took half-the book to unfold, and it wasn't even worth it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I never read Orwell in school for some reason and I am glad I waited. I can't believe this was written in the late 40's. O'Brien's descriptions of seeking power for power's sake and the mutability of truth and history have never been more applicable to current events. Reading this book now, you really start to feel like this must be on Karl Rove's desk."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Unlike a lot of people who were told to read this in High School, I didn't learn of it until a few brief years ago. I'd heard of it, but didn't really \\"get\\" why so many people were blown away by it. Then I read it and have since made it a point to get my hands on everything this man had ever written! George Orwell was no doubt a genius, visionary, prophet and a definite priceless gift to all of humanity. 1984 written in the late 1940's, (I see 1949 in my book, but I don't want to nail down a date as there have been reprints), someone else here has stated 1948 which if so, is still incredibly beyond remarkable because what he describes is something that sounds so much like the world we currently live in today, and the potential for it to be this world which he describes? Well, unfortunately the means are in fact all present now. We can be observed pretty much around the clock from when we leave our homes until we arrive. With what can be done with cell phones, GPS etc but I won't go into what should already be quite obvious to all. The fact of the matter is he foretold with pin point accuracy just how things could be and the frightening thing is many of these things are in my opinion in affect. New Speak, Thought Police, War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength, Big Brother and countless other things he writes about ring with such an eery realness one has to wonder if he time traveled into our present day and perhaps slightly beyond and then returned to his time to write about it to truly warn us what was at stake. I won't tell the story, as George does that exceptionally well to the point where you feel as if you are seeing this \\"World\\" he paints through the eyes of the main character \\"Winston\\".So much so that even though it was written years ago, it reads as if in many cases it could have been written today, or yesterday. Like Gene Rodenbury's Star Trek, George Orwell's 1984 is definitely light years ahead of its time. I don't think this book can be recommended highly enough to those who have not yet read it. Nor do five stars even remotely come close to giving this Master Piece it's due credit.

Orwell's novel manages to affect you long after you've read it - possibly even haunt you. It's a bleak novel (some might say downright depressing) - but it's also powerful and uncompromising.Over 50 years have passed since 1984 was published (the year itself came and went over 20 years ago) yet this novel is still relevant today. 1984 is a remarkably ambitious work; unflinching and perceptive. Orwell isn't just telling a story though; he is using this novel as a soap box to warn us all of the dangers of totalitarian governments.1984 is a novel about big ideas; about the machinery of totalitarian governments and how people can be manipulated and controlled by those in power. I did find however that the characters weren't as developed as I would have liked, as if Orwell felt they were a secondary consideration. As a result, I found the novel lacked a personal quality that I think would have made it all the more compelling. Winston Smith is not an especially sympathetic character (or for that matter, all that memorable a character). What is memorable about 1984 is the world Orwell creates - a world of contradiction, oppression, and betrayal.This is not a book that will bring a smile to your face. Its message is delivered with a heavy hand but 1984 will make you think. If it doesn't make you paranoid, it should at least make you cynical."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell writes a wonderfully disturbing story about totalitarianism. The characters were interesting and the story is a little creepy, but it is a fascinating read. And Orwell has a wonderful grasp of language. On the downside, the middle does drag on because it's more of a political treatise or arguement instead of a story."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Even read now--many years after 1984--some of the revaltions of this book hold scarily true. Big Brother vs personal freedom--a scary topic."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Yes, technology can be the new hand maiden to Totalitarian government. Or we can choose to be free. To speak out. To allow different viewpoints. We can choose NOT to shout down others when they speak. Thomas Jefferson knew that \\"the price of freedom is eternal vigilance\\" and so did the author of \\"1984\\".We can choose to read our history books and great novels. This is a great novel about a possible dystopia. Eric Blair was a great British journalist and the story he tells here rings more true than ever before."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"1984\\" is one of the defining works of fiction from the 20th Century. Written by George Orwell (the pen name of Eric Arthur Blair) in 1949, it has become the work referenced in other literature, film, and music for a future government which controls all of its citizens, and uses them to maintain its own position of power. Of course, it was not the first novel to present this idea, but it is perhaps one that presents the future that is the most bleak and without hope.Other authors have created sterile futures built on technological advancements that have drained humanity from its citizens. Instead, Orwell's future has technology held in check or even regressing, while political power and control are the forces that imprison humanity in his future. It is easy to read fascism and communism into the government of \`Big Brother', but one can see elements from \\"1984\\" in any type of government, they simply are more obvious in a totalitarian one.This novel has been recognized many times by readers. In 1952 it ranked 17th on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll, and in 1956 it tied for 9th on the same poll. In 1975 it tied for 41st on the Locus Poll for All-Time novels, in 1975 it was 34th on the Locus Poll for All-Time SF Novels, and in 1998 it was 21st on the Locus Poll for SF Novels from before 1990. The most fitting recognition though, must be the Prometheus Hall of Fame award which it won in 1984."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is a story about Winston Smith, a member of the totalitarian communist party of the country Oceania. 1984 was written by George Orwell describing the consequences of a communist government taking hold. Winston Smith works at a government office that publishes propaganda and changes historical records on a daily basis. It operates under the idea that \\"Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past\\". This is central to the government and revolves around the realization that history is only made of human memory and records, because it can not be made of matter. In 1984, records are constantly destroyed and rewritten, to the point that no one is actually sure that it is 1984. In order to control human memory, citizens are taught to deny past memories consciously while simultaneously denying that they are denying anything. Winston goes on to rebel and then suffers a fait similar to that of those determined \\"counter-revolutionary\\" by the Russian socialists. In the end, Winston experience an almost religious change to becoming a devoted follower of the Party.I found 1984 entertaining and challenging, but it not the most exciting or gripping read. Compared to similar books like A Brave New World and Orwell's own Animal Farm, 1984 fell short. The general pessimistic darkness became boring and trite instead of disturbing because there was never a hint of contrast. Oppressive despair as the general mood is fine, but obsessively mulling it over and over is worse than beating the reader over the head with it.I think that 1984 was centered around an idea rather than an emotion, set of characters or plot, and because of this I think that many elements of the story, dominantly the characters, suffered. Instead of the actions being caused by what the characters personalities were, the characters were designed around the actions. The only traits shown were the ones that were necessary to make the actions reasonable. Because of this, even the most important characters were often extremely developed in on area and flat and dull in another. On the other hand, a nice touch was that throughout the story, Winston mentally accepts that he will be caught, but when it actually happens, he is emotionally unprepared. I thought that this made him more realistic and human.As stated before, 1984 prizes an idea above all else, and Orwell seems willing to sacrifice anything and everything to nock it into the reader's head. Newspeak, the language of Oceania, is a good idea to show another aspect of this atrocious government that Orwell wants to illustrate, but did nothing for the plot or the characters. It was supposed to enhance the sense of absolute orthodoxy, but in the end it just seemed bothersome and distracting.While 1984 is a great intellectual triumph, it lacks in everything but mental capacities. It was stilted, stiff and insipid compared to Orwell's other stories."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Wow. I couldnt, and still cant, believe how amazing this book was. It is truly a masterpiece. Of course, what i think is a masterpiece might not end up being one for you.I realized during my read of this book that i felt really attached to it because of my own personal experiences...my own university background (political studies). To me, this book is a searing critique of the modern human condition...of modern society. When i read through these pages i found an author that was describing what was going on around us: people living in an unthinking comfort, people almost consciously avoiding the obvious truth about society...people failing to open up their eyes.It really focuses your attention on how society can just turn its cheek to homelessness, poverty, consumer culture, capitalism. We are all taking part in the process of doublethink.I took all of this away from the book...you might not. It might even mean something different to you. This review is for myself, for others that see what i see, and for those who are willing to see what i see. Otherwise, you will have to read the book through your own lenses and decide for yourself whether this is a classic. But for like-minded people, you will understand how powerful this book is from page one.The only reason why it did not get 5 stars is because of the ending. I really felt it wasnt the right way to end this book. It just didnt seem to flow with the rest of the pages. I am a little disappointed that Orwell decided to finish this amazing novel with such a drawn-out, tired ending."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Too often people summarily dismiss anything with the word 'classic' on the outside of it as something that is either too deep to understand or too tame to be interesting. 1984 defies the second mold and blows away the first, roaring off its pages as an untamable black-hearted novel about society.That's where the ability to define the novel stops. Undoubtedly, when the reader finishes 1984, the last four words are going to draw a line for them; that line will be the one that demarcates whether the reader is a socialist (that the power of production in society lies in the hands of the state) or a capitalist (that the power of production in society should lie in individuals). The brief bio at the beginning of the novel states that Orwell himself was a socialist...this is a strange thing to have to hear because you get the feeling that the novel is not pulling for that side, nor the other.Because that is the strange greatness that is this novel- it pulls for nothing, gives no easy answers, and least of all holds back on the literary punch that it delivers. Some novels put forth a question then attempt to answer it (Dostoevsky's 'The Idiot' is one such attempt) and they are great for their own pattern. 1984 is of the other milieu, giving us only a large, unanswered question which is bound to divide us as much as it helps us to see the problems which we all face.I've not talked much about the plot of the book, nor the characters to this point. To this I must simply say: why should I? The plot and characters, the whole course of the book...they are all contained in what I've already said. This is not a book, it is a problem, a deep philosophical/sociological one which cannot be pinned down. The novel uses its characters and their situations to stake out the nature of its presentation, and then leaves the reader to wade through it on their own once it is finished. It is a disturbance in the mind, one that is significant more so today than ever before- What is the nature of government and its intrusion into life (the NSA situation)? What controls should be placed on the individual (abortion, censorship, euthanasia)? What form should punishment take (torture in the US run detention camps)?By the time you finish the book, you're going to be thinking about these questions and several more. Hopefully you will want to find answers, though doing so is no easy task; these are intentionally hard questions, aimed at all strata of society, ones that will stick with you the older you get, facing you every time you look at your pay stub and think about where your effort goes.And again, the cultural significance of this novel cannot be understated. It has already pervaded our daily lives in such a way that we might take for granted; from the lyrics in songs (who controls the past now, controls the future), to the shows on television (Big Brother), one cannot help but to see 1984 all around us, so ingrained into our lives that we might overlook the impact it has made.Bottom line: this is required reading in many schools for a reason. Every person should be made to read this book.-LP"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell wrote this novel in 1948 (reversing the last two digits for the title) as a foreshadowing of what the world will be in 1984 if totalitarian regimes are not kept in check. Orwell had written some other essays and books on similar lines, warning against the dangers of oligarchy, but 1984 is especially gloomy and frightening. Perhaps, as pointed out by some other reviewers, his illness at the time of writing had something to do with it.The new regime in Orwell's 1984 controls a part of the world called Oceania, and is not only at constant war with the two other powers - Eurasia and Eastasia (both with doctrines indistinguishable from Oceania) - but also exercises complete control over its individuals through four ministries: the ministry of truth, the ministry of peace, the ministry of plenty, and the ministry of love which are in reality responsible respectively for lies, war, starvation, and torture. For the party, the individuals do not exist, only the party - with its nominal head: the Big Brother - exists. History is altered on a regular basis to suit the current policies of the party one of whose slogans is: \\"Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.\\" The official language of the party is Newspeak whose vocabulary keeps on decreasing every year with the aim that fewer the number are words are, the easier it is to manipulate the minds of individuals.Fortunately, the dystopian society predicted by Orwell has not become a reality, but for the people living in 1940s and 50s, something like this must have seemed a frightening possibility in wake of German Nazism and Russian Communism. But, at the same time, Orwell's warning is still relevant to all the dogma and doctrines that call for the complete and total submission of individuals to some higher authority, and also to the advancement of technology, which if misused, can become powerful tools in the hands of a few to control the freedom of others."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's classic novel, 1984, is set in a grim world where life is stripped down to its basis. Winston Smith, the main charachter, is just one of many Outer Party members, those who live under the support of the government, but also live under many government restrictions. The government controls everything, and Big Brother sits at the top of a totalitarian society. In the mind of Winston, Big Brother watches all. Winston differs from many of the Outer Party in the fact that he remembers the past. He can recall that years earlier, Oceania, the massive third of the world formed by the Americas, Australasia, and Airstrip One(Great Britain), was at war with Eastasia, another massive sect of the globe. Yet, in the year 1984, Oceania wars with Eurasia, and has always warred with Eurasia. The Government, enforced by the Thought Police, controls even the past. Any history is changed in accordance with current events. If Oceania is at war with Eurasia, it has always been at war with Eurasia. Any evidence that suggests otherwise is destroyed at once.Winston slowly becomes aware of the wrongdoings of the Party, and seeks out ways to defy it. He first purchases a diary and begins writing in it, which, although not directly forbidden, is an act of thoughtcrime. He even subconsciously writes pages of the phrase \\"DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER\\". As his awareness progresses, he takes increasing risks. He returns to the store where he purchased the diary, and buys a piecce of coral encased in glass. This makes him feel connected to the beauty of the past. The largest of these risks is his secret love affair with another Party member. He is later contacted by a man by the name of O'Brian, and inner party member. Winston and his lover meet with this cryptic figure and discuss a secret rebellion called the Brotherhood. Winston and Julia immediately join in the hope of bringing the Party to its knees.All in all, this book expresses Orwells deep fear of what the world is becoming. In this grim novel, war is constant, and neverending. I would imagine that is what the outcome of World War II would seem like. It also expresses the fear of a totalitarian rule that strips life down to its bare essentials. The Party tries to make this seem like a benefit for the entire society, but in reality, all the Party wants is the power to stay in power. It is almost a grim prediction of the rise of communism. The government, in essence, is almost similar to that of the Soviet Union. This everlasting war can easily be compared to the Cold War. This nearly prophetic view of the future presents an interesting view of society, and therefore is a must read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book really bedazzled me when I read it in High School.The media is controlled, the history is rewritten, and the enemies/allies are meant to look like it has always been the same (even though it changes). Anything of a NATURAL human nature is pushed aside, especially love. This is a cold world, that sounds almost purely sci-fi.Unfortunately, some of it is happening now, with the media being controlled by the Pentagon (yes it is really happening now, with this war and all). All in the name of fighting the \\"other side\\"- aka terrorists!Anyhow, I keep blabbing, its an awesome book, especially if you read it now, and then wonder what is really happening!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Oceania, with the British Isles, the America's and other lands, and London as its capital is a totalitarian state. Winston Smith works on changing past newspapers and other documents to make them doctrinally consistent with the short term needs of the party running Oceania, INGSOC. Thus documents are changed to make it seem that Oceania has always been at war with one of the two other nations of the world, Eurasia and in an alliance with EastAsia, the other nation; similarly is the construction when Oceania goes to war with EastaAsia. Similarly documents will be changed that have some INGSOC official uttering an inaccurate prediction about economic performance so that the official will have originally made an accurate prediction.. Documents are changed to eliminate mention of former favored party members after they fall out of favor and are sent to a forced labor camp or are \\"vaporized.\\" Winston and other bureaucrats throw doctrinally inaccurate documents into the \\"memory hole\\", a chute, attached to his cubicle where they are sent down to the inner recesses of the government building to be burned.Party members have in their homes and offices \\"telescreens\\" where they receive propaganda, are led in mandatory morning exercises but through which are also watched by officials for suspicious facial expressions, or any activity that might indicate independence of mind or feelings of love, enthusiasm or any other human emotion that are not directed at Big Brother, the possibly non-existent ruler of Oceania. People who exhibit such tendencies towards \\"thought crimes\\" are immediately arrested, executed or released back into society brainwashed and then rearrested and shot or sometimes sent to a forced labor camp.INGSOC indoctrination ensures that its party members will not be able to not think logically and instead be completely subordinated to their emotions, which are completely engrossed in worshipping Big Brother. \\"Doublethink\\" is what is called the ability of the INGSOC party member to somewhat recognize the logical fallacies and outright falsehoods the party propagates as truth. At the same time such fallacies and falsehoods are accepted as the truth because one's emotions are trained to accept the party's pronouncements as truth whatever common sense says. Thus, it is easy to accept that two plus two equals five when logic says two plus two equals four. Or to not see anything wrong in the Ministry of Torture being officially called \\"The Ministry of Love,\\" The ministry of truth management/propaganda, etc, where Winston works, as \\"The Ministry of Truth, and so on. Or to have the party denounce the original ideals of socialism while declaring itself to be a repository of socialist purity. Logic seems to be only tolerated when examining the crimes of official enemies of Oceania.The bigger one's vocabulary is, of course, the more one can utilize it to articulate opposition to the party; so INGSOC wants to keep Newspeak-the language it is developing--and the remaining use of \\"Oldspeak\\"-old standard English-- as small as possible. In Newspeak there is no bad to good. Instead bad is called \\"ungood,\\" \\"very good\\" in oldspeak is called \\"doubleplusgood.\\" INGSOC indoctrination and throwing old documents and dictionaries down the \\"memory hole\\" has made \\"freedom\\" have no political connotations but only is defined as in the sentence \\"She was now free from the illness.\\" Most documents before 1960 are sent down the memory hole or like the Declaration of Independence, altered to express doctrines of INGSOC.Orwell is not just talking about Stalinism in this book. He sort of touches on elements of our own society. The bottom eighty five percent of Oceanic society, the non-party members are called \\"Proles\\", for Proletarian. The Proles are far less constrained by party discipline than INGSOC members produces for them and encourages them to consume dumb popular songs, pornography, trashy novels, play lotteries.. They are encouraged to jingoist frenzies where they attack foreigners and watch parades where they can jeer at foreign POW's and so on. All this distracts them from organizing to seize economic and political justice for themselves. They are still economically enslaved as they were under capitalism.The sort of Trotsky of the story, Goldstein, notes that Oceania's rulers want to keep throwing resources into war-making so as not to have to divert them to making an equitable standard of living for the masses. Erich Fromm notes in his 1961 Afterward notes a few examples of how we in the U.S. practice \\"doublethink.\\" He gives the example of the person who works for Corporation A and defends its products and everything about it as perfect regardless of what one's common sense might say. However the person will attack his employer's rival corporation B, trying logically to look for flaws in the latter's products and so on. Then the person might switch to employment in corporation B., thus switching loyalty to the latter, and attack the flaws of Corporation A., its former employer. Fromm also notes how American propagandists described U.S. allies as part of the Free World even though it contained viscous Latin American military dictatorships, apartheid South Africa, Salazar's Portugal, Franco's Spain, and so on.As a piece of literature, this book is excellent. The structure, the parts of the story, are well put together and flow together well. Winston's struggle to maintain his intelligence and impendence is very realistic and well told. I liked the views of life among the Proles as seen by Winston. How Winston and Julia make contact and their first meeting where they end up fornicating are all a little unreal.. But despite this the Winston-Julia love story is very charming, full of real feeling. Winston's experiences in the last part of the book are described vividly, if being slightly incredible."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read 1984 in high school, probably around 1987 or so. I had wanted to read 1984 for several years, because in the actual year of 1984 (I was 13 at the time), there was a lot of media coverage about how Orwell's &quot;prediction&quot; had not come true. (This of course is a coy oversimplification of the book.)It was very strange to me at the time; I found their repeated, incessant insistence that 1984 was pure fiction suspicious. I could not help but think: Why the hell are these people so defensive?When I read 1984 it did not strike me as particularly &quot;true,&quot; metaphorically or otherwise. I was young and had less than five years of political study. While I could see parallels between our society and Orwell's, those parallels seemed few.However, over the last 20 years, 1984 has seemed more and more truthful. A lot of my perception of this book's truthfulness stems not simply from politics, but from watching how people behave. From high school &quot;cliques&quot; to office politics to the motions of the biggest political players today, Orwell depicted how people act. He depicted the way people twist the truth and abuse power, the way they manipulate words and ideas in order to portray guilt, or innocence. And he depicted just how horribly people in large groups are capable of being. Just because he used exaggerated, fantastic metaphors does not change the simple essence of human behaviors in his stories.1984 is not a book about Communists, Capitalists or any other political system. It was not even written, at the time, to be a book about &quot;the future.&quot; 1984 is a book about people. Not &quot;Capitalist People&quot; or &quot;Socialist People.&quot; All people, and human nature, and the corruption and darkness and manipulation all people are capable of. It is specifically about how people behave in industrial / post industrial / media saturated / disinformation age culture. It is about how people - of any political party, whether democrat, republican, socialist or libertarian - manipulate facts, words, ideas, and ultimately, each other. It is, in this sense, the best kind of book. Because what 1984 is about was true when it was written, has been true since, and apparently will be true for decades to come. It is not just true in the United States, or China, or Russia. It's true everywhere. In this sense the story remains a relevant and important read.If you reduce the book to nothing more than a fable about YOUR political enemies and how bad THEIR system is, you are precisely the sort of manipulator - or dupe - that Orwell wrote about. And if you deny that your culture, your political party, or your agenda is part of this process, you blind yourself precisely as Orwell's characters did.And in doing so, you emphasize Orwell's points very well."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The 20th Century has brought forth dystopia, and a plethora of dystopia literature. Some of the books, such as The Giver, are very good. Others, like Fahrenheit 451, are excellent. Of them, two are genius - A Brave New World (Huxley) - A Clockwork Orange (Burgess) - and one is supreme: 1984 (Orwell).1984 is comprehensive. Not in explaining the machinery and origin of the nightmare state, but in the experience of the individual within. Huxley is much more scientifically aware than Orwell, and his replacement of the party structure with a caste structure is profound and dark. Burgess, better than both these, understands the dependence of creativity upon destruction and destruction upon creativity, within the individual and the state. Neither Orwell nor Huxley offers their hero the alternative of \`coming alive' through violence, which Alex so beautifully illustrates.Also, I believe Burgess, of the three, to be the best storyteller. His prose is high art; musical, rhythmic, and perfect in its strangeness and familiarity. Huxley's book is somewhat like a puzzle with 8 big pieces, which fit exactly and predictably. His strength is not the flow of his story, but the brilliance of his images. Orwell is much too engrossed in his political message to be purely an artist. He is, of course, an artist, but firstly he is a political theorist.Still, it may seem unfair to compare these three; they are written for different purposes and theorize from different experience. This is indubitably true. But it is also true for us to want to organize, sort, and place books into a logical whole. And placement, for most of us, is related to importance.These three books are of the 20 most beautiful written in English in the last century - it is only my opinion that 1984 is the best. The knowledge and medium of 1984 is diverse. In part it is a theory on the meaning of history - it offers definitions of impersonal experience - it is an account of the individual, his will, passion, and perspective - it is about love and sex and their relation to the state - it is an attack upon intellectuals - it is about the nature of fear and courage - but, first of all, it is literature, written as a story...because it belongs to the individual, the private reader, not to academics or institutions."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"You can't always read a book merely because it's a &quot;classic&quot; and expect it to be &quot;that good.&quot; Yet 1984 IS &quot;that good.&quot; The first half of the book is a bit slow and stagnant, yet the end section of this book is absolutely frightening and marvelous. What happens to Julia and Winston is so incredibly sad that I cried. Yes, this is just a book. Yet, when you think in a broader perspective... if you rise above the &quot;plot&quot; and think of Orwell's message, you can't help but be in awe. Think about it, Orwell's three principles in the book:WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTHHow relevant is that to today?! When you answer that question, you realize WHY this is novel, written in 1949, is a &quot;future&quot; novel...yet you realize how the eerie future Orwell presents in his novel relates to modern times.A must-read...but don't just read it.

It's a shame I didn't get the more expensive hardcover because I plan to keep this book and read it as many times as I possibly can in my life time. It's a brilliantly written satire of what our world would be like without the free will that some people take for granted. This book was so good that I would say that there should be a law that everyone read this, but that would kind of contradict what the book is about. I'm pretty confident that after you've finished, you'll be glad you bought this book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Just finished 1984 by George Orwell. Truly, this is the best novel in the entire dystopian genre. Orwell eschews the lighthearted writing style of Aldous Huxley for an atmosphere suffused with fear and paranoia. In terms of creativity, 1984 is one of the most refreshing books I've ever read: the ideas of Newspeak and doublethink, the use of the past as a means of controlling the present; all are amazing ideas that should ring true today. Orwell's thoughts on \\"continuous warfare\\" should be especially cogent in light of the current \\"war on terror\\".The best part of the book is Winston's stay at the Ministry of Love.The only problem with this book is that it puts its ideas before its plot. An example: at a critical juncture in the exposition, when Winston & Julia have started working for the mysterious Brotherhood, Winston sits down and reads a book for about 25-30 pages. The ideas conveyed in the book are fascinating, to be sure, but it brings the narrative to a dead halt."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"My name is Sean and I chose this book as a lit circle book in Mrs. Matau's class at Walla Walla High School.

In Orwell's fictional world, communism rules the people in all aspects. People are not allowed to form their own ideas and even think for themselves. The story is raw and does not try to sugar up anything but rather show the horrors of living in this negative utopia. While reading this novel Orwell makes it very clear what he is trying to say. He is warning the world never to fall into hands of a communist state. This book should be read by all because it is an easy read and shows how novels can be instrumental in exposing the truth about important global issues."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read this book last year, in 8th grade, and it was one of the hardest books I have ever had to read.

I am going to read this book again someday when I am a little older and will understand it a bit better because I did think it was good.

He was truly a visionary, how he predicted this coming.Good bye civil liberties!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This 1949 classic has lost none of its punch. With his descriptive depiction of the future, Orwell really puts the fear into the reader's heart. With his description of a totalitarian socialist regime, Orwell's masterpiece stimulates a fear that is reminiscent and matched only by The Red Scare of the late 1950s.The most amazing feature of this book is that it still holds relevance today. With America's War on Terrorism, the Bush Administration has started restricting American's basic civil liberties, such as a right to trial. This action almost seems to be a precursor to the restricted socialist atmosphere described so well by Orwell. Still if this book has one message, it is that the individual mind is stronger than any government and that humanity and freewill are things to cherish, not taken for granted. This book is a crystal ball into our country's future and deserves to be read. The founders of our Constitution would be appalled at the current state of the USA and what the Bush cabal is doing to it/us.The ideas in this book are ones that are as appropriate now as when Orwell first wrote them. In this time (2001), we have our &quot;Two Minutes Hate&quot; with Osama bin Laden. Newspeak, the language created by the ruling party in 1984, is amazingly detailed and seems feasible in light of our dyslexic Bushisms.It is based on the English language, and its vocabulary grows smaller instead of larger every year. An appendix, included in the book, enumerates some of the terminology and syntax of the language, and explains how the language is designed to control the thoughts of those who utilize it. To bad it can't be updated with all the words our low IQ president has created.Many of the principles that Orwell writes about (e.g., thought control) are done in a quite blatant way in the book. In the real world of the 20th/21st century they're done, only much more subtly. That way, we don't know they being perpetrated on us. But with the Patriot Act, the boldness is destroying our Constitution.Here's how 1984 applies to current events:WAR IS PEACEThe new &quot;War on Terrorism&quot; is being sold as a guarantor or our safety. While this war is being waged, we're to accept permanent war as a fact of life. As the unavoidable slaughter of innocents unfolds overseas, we are told to go back to &quot;living our lives.&quot;FREEDOM IS SLAVERY&quot;Freedom itself was attacked,&quot; Bush said. He's right, though here's the twist: Americans are losing many of their most cherished freedoms in a frenzy of paranoid legislation. The government wants to tap our phones, read our email and seize our credit card records without court order. Further, it wants authority to detain and deport immigrants without cause or trial. To save freedom, we have to destroy it.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTHAmerica's &quot;new war&quot; against terrorism will be fought with unprecedented secrecy, including press restrictions not seen for years, the Pentagon has advised.When you read this book, you'll be better able to see the signs around you. The world portrayed by Orwell is \`HERE AND NOW.\\"If you think it's all a conspiracy... then check out these books also: I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program \`insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects' which NASA tried to ban, and always read the Amazon reviews."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Mr. Orwell's book is, rightfully, a must-read classic. The daily grind of existing in such an oppressive state piles onto the reader. There is not one iota of levity in this entire work. Mr. Orwell's book is not simply a condemnation of communism, but a trenchant example of the concentration of power and the willingness of those overseers to do whatever it takes to stay in control. Democracy is not immune to this sort of heavy-handedness. The people in power attempt to subjugate the populace by controlling or falsifying information and using torture or at least the threat of force for political purposes. This is also about stripping individuals of their humanity. Mr. Orwell's book is a cautionary tale about the dark side of the human condition. A wonderful learning tool."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 by George Orwell deals with a future society where the government (known as the Party) controls people with doublethink, the ability to accept anything \\"Big Brother\\" tells them is true. The Party has changed history to suit them well, saying that they are out to help people, even though they really are just taking over people. In this negative Utopia, humans are arrested by the Thought Police for thoughtcrime, or in other words turning against the Party and Big Brother. There are little telescreens in each room that spy on the civilians, making sure they are not committing thoughtcrimes. Young children are raised to be Thought Policemen and are trained to arrest anyone, even their own parents. People accused of thougtcrimes may be subject to cruel and unusual punishment. Thus, in this novel Orwell makes the point that humans will give up freedom in order to avoid pain, that our own nervous system and our comfort is more important to us than our freedom.The main characters in 1984 are Winston and Julia, both of whom rebel against the Party. 1984 follows Winston who believes that he is the only person who constantly commits thoughtcrime. His neighbors, the Parsons, have two children who are part of the Thought Police. Winston is constantly reminded that Big Brother is always watching him and that he lives in a totalitarian state. He believes that he can rebel without being caught. A dark-haired girl is mentioned in the story. Winston finds that she also rebelling against the government. They fall in love and vow to be at each other's side and fight the evil Party. Although Julia is rebelling against the Party, unlike Winston she is not concerned with future generations, Julia only concerned about her and Winston.I liked George Orwell's warning that the government and popular media can take over us and can give us false messages that corrupt our minds. It seems a fair warning but it also seems to be discredited with the fact that it is now over twenty years past 1984, and Orwell's ideas seem a little outdated. This is not to say that we could never be taken over by the government, but it seems a little strange reading about a future that has allegedly happened in the past. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in George Orwell's ideals."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I've heard alot of things about this book, mostly what friends that have read the book have told me. I was looking to compare it to the blind ideaology of human nature. I found alot of what I was looking for in the human psyche but I was quite disappointed with the book as a literary piece. The using of very colorful expressions of the english language but anti-climactic left me feeling ripped-off. The cliftnotes would've done just as well."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Something like that could never happen in my country I'm happy in communist China"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I did not really enjoy this book, it was way to far feched.

The book itself is uninterestring and the text is plain like water. Some parts of the book are ok but the rest is lame. The things it talks about can be related to the events that are going on today and events that have happened. It shows how totalitarianism works and how it feels to always be watched. So in some sense it is educational but I would certainly not choose this book to read if i wasn't forced like in this situation. All of my friends that read this book said the same thing, \\"Boring!\\" Students that are into more action and adventure will not enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book's reputation as a classic reveals less about the book than it does about the shallowness and mediocrity of many book critics. It is crude, heavy-handed, superficial propaganda."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"At first I did like the book. Then it just started to suck right around the time when Winston was getting sexually involved with his girl friend. I hated the book so much that I forgot her name. The first hundred or so pages i liked, then it just got really boring. So II highly reccomend that you DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. And please for the love of God don't read that &quot;Brave New World&quot; book by Hoxley. It is twice as worse as 1984. To put it bluntly, DON'T READ ANY GEORGE ORWELL. Your just waisting your time."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Unlike Mr Orwell apparently, I can actually remember 1984 and believe you me some of his recollections of the era are well off the mark. There were no such things as Memory Holes, was no such country as Eurasia and Big Brother did not hit our screens until 1999. I also find it staggering that there was no mention of Rubiks Cubes or the film Spies Like Us. On the other hand I did approve of some of the stricter measures bought in to promote sensible behaviour in the office which were advocated in this book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book had a good warning about futur totalitarian government but it was way too wordy. I had too much description and was really boring at the beginging that it took me a while to get through it.

The fall of Communism has erased nearly every trace of relevance this book may once have had. Its warnings of the evils of totalitarianism were overly alarmist by even Cold War standards and are even more so today. The absence of strong, 3-D characters makes even a man vs. society theme seem sorely lacking in depth . The only redeeming quality of this book may lie in providing future readers with an McCarthyist view of the evils of communism from the standpoint of a conservative 50s faux intellectual. If you're looking for a deeper, better-written, and tremendously more entertaining book, try Orwell's Animal Farm. Even walking, talking farm animals seem realistic compared to 1984."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is a boring polemic that provides absolutely no insight into actually existing models of state repression. In any case, everybody's moved over to the American model, so Orwell's scrawlings would do well to stick around on their crusty little island."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Okay all this book was about was random sex, the destruction of human nature, and the ending of all morales. However I must admit that Orwell had a prphetic sense when it camr to the idea of being watched constantly by the government. This book lacked a decent plot as well. THS BOOK SHOULD NOT BE READ UNLESS YOU LOVE THE DESTRCTION OF THE WONDERFUL HUMAN NATURE GOD CREATED."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"To me this novel is unmistakingly about religious doctrine, not just totalitarian governments and the terrors associated with revolution. The way people are told to believe in the Party (Christianity) even though they have the intelligence to reason that it is totally illogical. I can see no difference between someone who has faith and someone who is prepared to use doublethink to mentally condition themselves. Both require the user to operate at two levels - to apply scientific fact for instance to construct televisions and rocket engines, and then to be able to switch into illogical rambling and decide that they believe an obscure doctrine that has no basis in fact.That is why Orwells ideas cannot be dismissed as &quot;far-fetched&quot; and irrelevant. If the faithful ever gain the whip hand of society we may well see ourselves being repressed into acceptance of ignorance and the worship of Big Brother (God). What is it they tell us as children? That God is omnipotent and can see everything? Does that sound similar? The telescreens and microphones are simply an extensions of God\`s apparent omnipotence and the Thought Police the modern dy equivalent of the Spanish Inquistion.I found it very ironic that one reader claims that his desert island books would be 1984 and the Bible. The former is a book that warns against society discarding intelligent thought and reason, the latter is a book that through the ages has caused that to occur.Everyone should read this book if they can. There are many levels of comparison other than that of religion of course, but it is here that I see the most relevance to contempoary society."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I am a second year high school English teacher and I just read this book for the first time because I loved Animal Farm and I am now trying to figure out a way to talk my district into including it in the curriculum.I am not a very political person (I don't even vote), but this is a very interesting read about a society that never existed, but is coming very close to emerging: a society in which someone is ALWAYS watching (think reality TV mixed with Bush's phone taps).If you have never read this book, do yourself a favor and pick it up."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"As a summer reading assignment, I was assigned this book to read and appreciated Orwell's sense of imagination. I reccomend this novel to anyone who is interested in the world of make believe. People who appreciate descriptive writing will certainly enjoy reading this novel. However, this novel will probably not appeal to people who enjoy novels that tell stories. I found the novel extremely boring because it is all about Orwell's vision of an unstable society, it does not give the reader the desire to read on."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Personally, I enjoy novels in which I can relax. 1984 let me do anything but that. Not only is the book overly detailed, but quite borring. Unless it's assigned, I wouldn't suggest it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Tooooo Late to write a review, maybe tomarow... read this book a year ago and just wanted to rate it...5 stars of course"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I don't mind being 0 for 8 or even 0 for 1000 on this one but I'm wondering what reviewers disagree with. (OR ARE ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS FROM THE DESK OF big brother? Now that would make sense.) Help me out here, guys! Am I missing something? Or are there really that many people that can read Orwell and totally miss what HE is saying. I'm just the messenger of the messenger! Get it?Okay, so again, here's my take on Orwell. Reviewers, please point out where I am wrong if you think my review UNhelpful. Thank you.Orwell's classic 1984 is, very simply, true. Many believe that it was a prediction of what our world would be like in 1984 (it was written in 1951). It was not a prediction but rather an analogy to the world of Orwell's time. He was ALREADY LIVING IN 1984.Most people cannot (or will not) see that our world is already controlled by BIG BROTHER. It is sad, scary but true. In 1984 Orwell shows the governments of the world scaring their own population. Well, America does the same thing! So does any country that wishes to extract huge taxes from its population to support \\"needed\\" war machines. Now that the Soviet \\"threat\\" is gone, America needed a new one. Enter: TERRORISM.But if the reader cares to do a bit of research he or she will find that American militarists have been suggesting that the American military and CIA conduct terror against ITS OWN POPULATION for many years now. During the Cuban \\"threat\\" the pentagon asked Kennedy to allow it to blow up an American ship killing Americans! He declined.Are we SURE who was responsible for 9/11? No one has taken credit for it. Why? All terror groups IMMEDIATELY TAKE CREDIT FOR THIER WORK when they pull something off. Why wouldn't the Taliban or Al Quaida jump at the chance of taking credit for the greatest example of terrorism in America? The only LOGICAL explanation is because they didn't do it!I'm not saying that American militarists did it. Maybe it was a country that stood to gain from having America go after those \\"crazy Moslems.\\" Israel? How about Israel and America? Who knows? But there is no EVIDENCE of who actually did it and more important WHY.You can sit back and take the easy explanation spoon fed to you from corporate owned media with its own agenda. Or you can read and understand 1984 and start thinking beyond the \\"obvious.\\" If you want to read a book that picks up where 1984 leaves off try HOW TO SAVE AMERICA AND THE WORLD. Yes, I wrote it but that is no reason not to read it. Everyone advertises his or her own books. I simply offer it because, like Orwell, I want people to know what is really going on and why.Read between the lines when you read American \\"news.\\" Better yet listen to news broadcasts from other counties. It's not a matter of writing outright lies as much as OMITTING details and SKEWING various parts of stories.Orwell gives you the tools to begin to think for yourself. If it's too much work or too scary, then just put your faith in your president. He would never lie to you, would he? Like his Daddy said, just \\"read my lips.\\" Oh, that's right. What he was referring to turned out to be a lie and he DID RAISE TAXES after all! Oh, well. At least you can trust Orwell.Joseph Francione [author of HOW TO SAVE AMERICA AND THE WORLD]"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is a very well written book, I just had trouble understanding it. The begining wasn't too bad, but the more I read the less I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read the book 1984 by George Orwell for my book report in school. This is a book targeted for an older audience than an eighth grader. Its main theme, I believe, is that we cannot let our government have too much power. The government is controlling the peoples' lives with a fist as tight as possible. If we allowed them to do this, we will fall into dispair. All in all, I didn't care for this book all too much. It was all kind of above my head. It used &quot;Newspeak,&quot; past experiences, and things that just didn't make any sense to to me. I understand that most people really enjoyed this book. Maybe when I get older I will uderstand it more."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"&quot;1984&quot; has to be one the best albums ever, and definitely one of my favorite records. The production by Ted Templeton is excellent, and David Lee Roth's vocals are probably the finest to ever be put on vinyl. The highlight of the record is, in my opinion, the hit single &quot;Jump.&quot; Once again, Eddie Van Halen's guitar work is the best in the business. Five stars, check it out!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I thought George Orwell's 1984 was an &quot;ok&quot; book. I thought the book was just a little too far fetched for me. His prediction of 1984 was just so negative I found it really hard to get into it. It was difficult to read simply from lack of interest. I Think that this book may do wonders for other people though, it's just not really my style. For the most part I've always heard good things about this novel from other people. So just because I didn't think the book was that fantastic, don't let that stop you. I would advise you to read this book to see if Orwell's depiction of this strange negative utopia is for you."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Having just read 1984 for the first time in 2005, I can see how people might discredit it now. However, I find many parallels for today's world. All readers should read this book as a lesson for what happens when governments run unchecked by the people."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Firstly this is a fantastic book and a fantastic read. At times brilliantly lurid and erotic and at other times completely bleek and depressing. At all times it is however engaging to the point of being one of those cant-put-down type books.Secondly this book is just as important as Hayek's Road to Serfdom. Although Hayek's treatise rightly or wrongly (and I would tend towards the latter) skewed economic thinking towards the economic rationalist line so favoured by the Friedmanites, it was 1984 that put the fear of god into people who care little for economics. It has helped shape the world that we live in today.As a side note, the final part of Simon Schama's History of Britain is a look at The Two Winstons. Namely Churchill and Orwell through the main character of this book. It is an excellent exploration of the two men and really gives an idea about who they were and what they really stood for."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell's 1984, changed the way I look at life. It has made me leary of all fanatics, particularly relgious fanatics. The society of Oceania closely resembles many ultra-Right wing organizations. They demand total conformity from all of their members. Big Brother parallels the Judeo-Christian God in that he demands total loyalty. The Party cannot lie. If they say that 2+2=5 then it's true, and the individual is forced to conform. One of the scariest concepts in the book is &quot;Ignorance Is Strength.&quot; I've spoken to many religious fanatics who believe that ignorance is strength. They would rather believe what they have always believed, than question &quot;so-called&quot; truth. The most valuable lesson that this book taught me is that any authority that cannot be questioned, cannot be trusted!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I viewed this book mainly as a pleasant romantic novel. But I found that the main character Winston was very arrogant and shallow though Orwell made sure that the character was very believable. Generally a very well thought out book, though some areas, such as when he is taken by the thought police are very simple and obvious and lacking in imagination. Anybody could have written that section, it lacked originality.However, I thought that the system of government was very well organised and well thought out and seems like an efficient and effective method of ruling. Although, very harsh and unfair and not something you would like to see in practise. Cold and harsh but effective.In conclusion a very romantic story that was upsetting in places. I cried when Julia was captured."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This 1949 classic has lost none of its punch. With his descriptive depiction of the future, Orwell really puts the fear into the reader's heart. With his description of a totalitarian socialist regime, Orwell's masterpiece stimulates a fear that is reminiscent and matched only by The Red Scare of the late 1950s.The most amazing feature of this book is that it still holds relevance today. With America's War on Terrorism, the Bush Administration has started restricting American's basic civil liberties, such as a right to trial. This action almost seems to be a precursor to the restricted socialist atmosphere described so well by Orwell. Still if this book has one message, it is that the individual mind is stronger than any government and that humanity and freewill are things to cherish, not taken for granted.This book is a crystal ball into our country's future and deserves to be read. The founders of our Constitution would be appalled at the current state of the USA and what the Bush cabal is doing to it/us.The ideas in this book are ones that are as appropriate now as when Orwell first wrote them. In this time (2001), we have our &quot;Two Minutes Hate&quot; with Osama bin Laden. Newspeak, the language created by the ruling party in 1984, is amazingly detailed and seems feasible in light of our dyslexic Bushisms. It is based on the English language, and its vocabulary grows smaller instead of larger every year. An appendix, included in the book, enumerates some of the terminology and syntax of the language, and explains how the language is designed to control the thoughts of those who utilize it. To bad it can't be updated with all the words our low IQ president has created.Many of the principles that Orwell writes about (e.g., thought control) are done in a quite blatant way in the book.

This book helped me appreciate what it must have been like."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"What struck me the most is - unfortunately - how timeless the book is. It wasn't the current political environment that drew me to the it, yet it's relevancy can't be denied (I'm a former English major and have been reading some of the classics that my education neglected).That being said, a lot of comparisons can be drawn between Saddam Hussein and \\"1984's\\" Goldstein (keep in mind I'm no Kerry supporter). I'm not saying Saddam's atrocities are fictitious, but they certainly were embellished to gain the support of the masses for a war the United States is incapable of winning. Now that war is being used by the Bush Administration (read Big Brother) to make a case for its being elected to another term. Or, to paraphrase Dick Cheney, if the other guy gets elected, you might die. I hate Big Brother.The manner in which Orwell gets his point across is a little gimmicky at times (a manual on how the government operates, as well as one on the language), although I doubt many writers could construct a better way of getting across their point. It's not anything that would detract from a five-star rating."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"why? read the book...i dont exist"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A certain mental maturity is needed to appreciate this book.

Go back to your Barbies, nitwits: you'll never be able TO READ."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"If you've yet to read this masterpiece, hurry. When you get tired of reading or think that what Orwell writes is unrealistically drab, then flip on CNN and catch your daily dose of propaganda. The world of 1984 is modern America, bin Laden is Goldstein and the book is terrifying. John Ashcroft on 1.29.02 ordered a semi-nude statue of Justice in the Justice Department to be covered by a sheet (check the nydailynews.com archive - No Nudes Good News at Justice). 1984 depicts a world in which the populace suffers but suffers because a war is being waged, a war against faceless terrorists whose existence is only proved by the occasional bombing and \\"telescreen\\" broadcasts of the Brotherhood's evil leader Goldstein. Life in Airstrip One (UK) is a miserable existence with barely enough food, many people going without shoes, no art, no free speech and cheap, rotgut alcohol. Give the recession and the Bush administration a few more years in their 'war against terrorism' and see if you can even still find this book outside of illegal personal collections.After you're done with 1984 check out \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" Orwell's account of his time spent in the Spanish Civil War on the side of the Communists and Anarchists (which means believing in no central government by the way, the way the Native Americans, Druids and numerous other peoples lived, not all out savagery like the American thought police would have you believe) versus the Fascists. Homage to Catalonia will help you have a better understanding of what WWII was all about, how the advent of technology set the stage for the top nations in the world to battle of raw materials, slave laborers and market share. Do some research and see that nearly all of Europe was Socialist or full on Communists at the time of WWII and then realize that American Fascism and Soviet Communism (really Soviet Fascism) defeated Nazi Fascism and that the Cold War was necessary for American Corporations to grow and take over the world with every country that didn't want to be bent over by the US Corps. being invaded outright or overthrown by American backed troops for being Marxists. The collapse of Soviet Russia was disatrous for America because no bad guy meant we had to pay back debts and answer for the daily suffering of millions of Americans.

Similiar to Huxley's view, the world of the future, even though set in the past, serves to remind us that not only we are the creators of our destiny, but the victims of it as well.

In fact, at first, I was speachless after reading the last sentence; the build-up was so intense that I actually thought that I was reading a historical account of the human experience. For those of you who haven't read the afterword by Erich Fromm, I highly recommend you do. He provides a much needed explanation for Orwell. This book offers a very important vision, one that needs due evaluation. If you read this account of the future, you must read Huxley's Brave New World, as he offers an alternative."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"People who see this book as merely an attack on the farce that was Russian communism are missing the real point. 1984 is a warning about trends that can easily devlop in any political system, try the one we got here in the USA where we wage wars aganst virtually helpless nations in the name of 'humanitarianism'. (read: economic interests, yes kids, Vietnam taught the State Department to fear organized anti-war sentiment, which is why we need these elaborate and totally bogus rationalizations) Orwell always belived in social progress, he considered himself a socialist. 1984 was not meant to deny socialism (meaning a system that promotes soical equality) but to warn us of some prevalent inhumane political trends, among other things. (if you think socialism means absolute equality, you need to actually read some political theory)"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I've been doing a whole lot of reading since the end of school and 1984 by George Orwell is definitely the best book. 1984 is a classic I reckon, but it's as compelling a the best science fiction by Asimov or Crichton. I really enjoyed it. It's kind of disturbing at parts. I mean the way he accuses society in general, about how this society is sickly, and how all it does is separate people and suppress natural instincts. The best part of the whole book is the Vocabulary part. how the government was reducing the whole dictionary, eliminating words. It was amazing to realize what power words have. With words one can express his/her thoughts, that's why the government was abolishing words, to stop anything against the &quot;orthodoxy&quot; of the state.

Once you've read it, test yourself, and one day pick up the book and read a page, and see if it's possible to leave it at that... :) i know i can't do it. This novel exists on so many levels, it's astounding. I read it in grade 9, and thought i understood it. I just read it again this year in grade 13, and I saw so much more within it. Forget all the hype around it, just read itfor yourself and enjoy !"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I just wish my school would assign this instead of animal farm, it's a great book. I especially liked the part when Winston starts to read Goldstein's book. The concepts Orwell expresses through this part are very interesting and some of them may be applied to the current world situation. Great book. The afterword on this edition is quite interesting too."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"As an avid reader, time and time again I'm asked what my favorite book is. I remember I had to read 1984 for a school assignment, and if I had known the first thing about it BEFORE being assigned the reading, I would have read it anyway.Time and time again I answer these folks that 1984 is one of my all-time favorite novels, as it offers some frighteningly real and chillingly recognizable flaws found in society, that, if not ammended, will result in utter destruction.Orwell's foretelling of that negative utopia is brilliantly portrayed. Even if you're not an avid reader - or don't consider yourself to be - read this book anyway - it's not difficult reading.And with the countless allusions encountered in daily life, you'll be a better person for it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's 1984 was a wonderful book. His style of writing was so unique and believeable. Orwell creates an elaborate future (which is now our past) which is perfectly plausable. It is an utterly frightening representation of what could be; a government which controls the people under them even in their personal lives. They are intimidated into submission. A beautifully phrased portrait of horrifying circumstances. While I could not put it down. It absolutely intrigued me. Already it has become one of my favorites. I could even relate parts of it to my life.I'd reccommend this book to anyone who is thinking about - both young and old. It is a wonderful piece of literature. I know that I'll be reading it again. For the full message of this work is something that deserves to be read twice.Five stars."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I sat down to read George Orwell's novel on a Tuesday night while my family had dinner in the next room. For the following few hours, their dinner conversation was interrupted with my bursts of anger and frustration. \\"How can you call the destruction of words beautiful?!\\" I cried. Orwell writes so convincingly that it frightens the reader into thinking, \\"What if Oceania really existed in that form? How could I break free from the oppression, the mindlessness, the fear and anger that surrounds all aspects of life?\\" It creates a level of paranoia, especially since there is no happy ending. The main character, Winston, is never freed from the bondage of being brainwashed and held captive in his own mind. For if we are not free to think, we are not free at all. However, I think Orwell succeeds best in terrifying us to the point that we are sure to count our blessings and be sure not to take for granted the beauty of words, thoughts, and freedom."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell has another hit. Animal Farm was only a glimpse at his intellectual genius. This story takes you on a carefully regulated emotional rollercoster. You will go from intense shock to indignation for the characters involved. This small glimpse into what Orwell considered to be our inevitable future has left me with a strong sense of denial. Everything from the telescreen that watches your every move to the mere thought of a &quot;thought Police&quot; force gave me the shivers. There are several interesting implications for example the use of a term called &quot;doublethink&quot; which implies that people can hold two contradictory thoughts in their heads at the same time and beleive them both to be true. overall this book was an amazing peice of work, there was never a time that i put it down unless i had to. i would definitely recommend this to any person who wants to take their mind for a ride."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell is a master of the English language, his superb style of writing and the intensity of the story is sustained throughout.The novel covers a timeless issue. Orwell attempts to shock us with the extremities that exist in a totalitarian society whose ultimate purpose is to obtain power. Perhaps these issues, as mentioned in the afterthought, are relevant in areas apart from totalitarianism. Perhaps capitalism is also a class distinction where money is representative of power.These and other issues are covered, proving Orwell's brilliant writing genius."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell had my attention from the first to last page of his novel 1984. 1984 is a fascinating and mind-inducing novel. The story of Winston Smith's struggle through life in Oceania is extremely captivating and thought provoking. Orwell's sharp, detailed descriptions paint an image of an unforgettably unique society. His story is a detailed description of a man living in the worst case scenario communistic society. Orwell's ideas and images are extremely brilliant. His extreme communist society brainwashes their citizens to become emotionless, violent, and thoughtless. I was mesmerized by the way the society dehumanized its citizens. People had no freedom what so ever. The concept of people having the inability to think, loves, and express themselves is engaging. I found 1984 to be an extremely thrilling novel, I recommend it to anyone interested in a classic and contemplative piece of literature."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I thought 1984 was an incredible novel. Orwell's compelling story of the the future not only presents an interesting and suspenseful plot but also warns the world of a possible society that seems good on the outside but is rotten on the inside. Orwell makes a powerful point that government control can lead to the worst, particularly when it monitors every aspect of peoples' lives. He also demonstrates the fact that conformity and sameness is not necessarily happiness. I think Orwell was commenting more on communism and totalitarianism than our society, since Americans are allowed to be indiviudals, plus we have the right to freedom of speech (along with freedom of thought). Personally, I would not be able to survive in the world of 1984, where one cannot think what they please, where emotions and ideas are constantly supressed and destroyed. Overall, I thought this was an absolutely amazing book. I especially enjoyed the fascinating concept of doublethink. I recommend this novel to anyone who wants to read a good eye-opening and thrilling book. I plan on reading it again myself."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The book shows the extent to which civilization can go to. While it's pretty scary and shows a gloomy foreshadowing to life, I enjoyed the storyline and the imaginative world that George Orwell imagined."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Other books that examine fictional fascist states include Jack London's &quot;Iron Heel&quot; (1908), which looks at plutocratic, monopolistic capitalism as the evil regime, and Nabakov's &quot;Bend Sinister&quot; (1947), which examines the struggles of an intellectual in a fictional totalitarian regime. Both are fine reads, and both were published before Orwell's &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Not horrible as in bad; horrible as in evil and twisted.

My opinion is that it is one of the best books I have ever read!!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"While this work clearly explores the effects of Big Brothers totalitarian regime upon the individual, I must agree with the comments made by a reader from Brisbane, Australia, as this is not in any way an attack upon Communist ideology. As for comments made by another (American) reader, Orwell does not set out to somehow reveal a 'secret Communist agenda' and does not attempt to portray a Socialist government. Many references made throughout the novel actually highlight his opposition to fascism and the extreme right, after the devastation of World War II. While ultimately, Orwell successfully explores the impact of complete political control by a small elitist group over a general population, his work is deliberately politically non-specific. 1984 applies to a number of regimes based upon general terror, and not directly to Communism, which in many cases has arisen, and is sustained, through popular demand."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's 1984 is the best book ever to be written. With frightening images of a future that is not only possible but also probable, Orwell reveals the truth about Communist governments. Images such as the ever-present Big Brother that is always watching and the thought police really hit hard. 1984 is a great book that EVERYONE should read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This was by far the best book i have ever read.

In THE LAST DAY, Kleier tackles the subject of authority in organized religion with startling &quot;Orwellian&quot; manner and outrageous wit and irreverence. LAST DAY is a classic, watershed novel in the manner of 1984. I found it a riveting read, and one that I greatly encourage all Orwell fans fans to experience."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is an excellent book that I feel everyone should read. It was written in the late 40's and gives us view of what is to come in 1984(at least dealing witht the government). There are 3 main characters in this story,Winston Smith, Julia, and O'Brien. The story is about Big Brother(Government) watching over and listening to our thoughts at all times. Winston share his emotions with Julia. Winston finally dies in the end after excepting Big Brother. I wont tell you the whole story because you'll have to read it yourself."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"There are two major types of morons in this world; Those who think 1984 is science-fiction and therefore should be full of action (It has no plot they say!)and those who believe that the entire premise of the novel is unfair because it denegrates poor old misunderstood communism.Firstly, Orwell's disturbing novel has an exceptional plot which is exquisitely crafted and gorgeously realised, it's just that most readers are too daft to comprehend it. Plot does not have to include massive progressions and a resolution which is life-affirming. Ultimately, fine plots are those which aren't obvious, which are overlooked by the lay reader who insists that reading should be as passive as the almighty television (bane of the stupid and spreader of more propaganda than any other device). Orwell's plot is in truth the major influence on this novel, followed by realistic characterisation.Secondly, Orwell's intention is quite obviously not to denegrate the theory of communism perse. In fact he was a member of the communist party as one other reviewer has already stated. Sadly however, that reviewer insisted (Probably because he/she is in his/her late teens or early twenties and attending university where the idea of communism is at the moment quite novel to him/her.)Orwell was soured by communism and didn't understand it as American communist's did not understand the party. To expect an intelligent person to believe that Orwell was incapable of understanding communism is remarkable in it's obscene stupidity. Furthermore to suggest an Englishman was incapable of understanding a theory which was developed in his own country is proposterous (Yes. Karl Marx lived for many years and died in England where he is buried.)While there are those who would suggest that Orwell is retaliating against communism, they are dreadfully inaccurate. Ultimately, what 1984 is about is a fear of all levels of politics and not merely communism.1984 is not about political propaganda but the human spirit. While the fascist power's of Big Brother are a lynchpin to the novel it is the squelching of the human spirit which is the over-riding theme. It's true, of course, that Orwell is satiring the communist Russia of the time but is this actually going to be considered an attack on the ideals of communism? Essentially, Orwell's point was that political powers could not possibly bring about utopia and that the communist ideal, while exceptionally dignified in theoretical terms, was subject to human nature and misuse. It is not communism but people who brought about the world of Oceania. Communism was just the political tool used along the way.The power in Orwell's novel can be missed by morons but never the informed reader. His vision is, today, as powerful as ever and a potent reminder of what any political system can achieve if misused, not just communism. 1984 is a study in human character and human frailty and it is only those who are disturbed by the stark truth of Orwell's vision that will not see both the power and the terror in his fictional world. Indeed the human spirit is infinitely malleable."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I recomend this book to anybody. A warning that must not be ignored"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four creates a nightmarish regime of totalitarian terror in which the protagonist, Winston Smith, lives an uncomfortable and fearful existence under the watchful eye of a seemingly benevolent despot known as 'Big Brother' and his infamously brutal 'Thought Police'. The novel conveys its themes and ideas by providing an insight into the life and mind of Smith, a secret rebel working in the propaganda department of Big Brother's omnipotent 'Party' - a tyrannical political organisation that also encompasses the middle and upper classes of the entire society. It is a story in the genre of classic science fiction novels that delineate the plight of individuals who seek freedom from the oppression of futuristic authoritarian dystopias; most notably Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot;, Ray Bradbury's &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, and Anthony Burgess's &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. Like the authors of these other famous books George Orwell was influenced by the physical and ideological struggles that characterised the two World Wars of the 20th Century; inspiring his rational philosophies and views on the political concepts of nationalism, socialism, communism and fascism. As a result the totalitarian terror and intense ideological debate invoked by the text does not make for light reading, but the novel is an acknowledged literary masterpiece that is recommended to all mature readers."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I've had to do alot of reading this year for my AP English class, and this is one of the best books I've read so far.

Folks, Old George was quite the prophet, because the Inner Party (with virtually all of the wealth and political power in the nation) , The Outer Party (with their 401k, Toyota Camrys, and houses in the suburbs), and the Proles (doing the underpaid grunt-work, their minds numbed to reality by sports and popular culture) all exist today in America.

The story is told from Winston&#8217;s perspective as he falls in love with Julia, which is forbidden as all devotion must be reserved to the Party. He also has an unusually warm relationship with an Inner Party member by the name of O&#8217;Brien who turns out to be Winston&#8217;s ultimate antagonist as he represents the Party in his every action. The reason that this book is such a timely piece of literature for today is that the world around us is going through dramatic changes in its structure. None of us could know where this cycle will lead, but Orwell provides us with a nightmare of where the tide of history and government could come to rest and how an average man may live and feel under such conditions.While this does not naturally appear as a love story, it does actually take an important look at a dark side of love and devotion. The Party demands more than absolute obedience; it demands the love of every subject. Even to the degree that no other love interest can be maintained. It is a very religious theme, similar to what you might hear during a Sunday morning sermon or straight from the Bible, &#8220;Anyone who loves his father or mother more than Me [Jesus] is not worthy of Me&#8221; (Matthew 10:37, New International Version). Winston&#8217;s love for Julia is ultimately the reason that Winston is tortured mercilessly and his love for her is what is used to finally break his will at the climax of his incarceration in the Ministry of Love.Winston also maintains a curious relationship with the stories antagonist, O&#8217;Brien, throughout the story. Early in the story, the two of them share a glance which indicates to Winston that they have similar interests regarding the overthrow of the current system. As it turns out, O&#8217;Brien has been working throughout the book to entrap him and presumably anyone else who might be caught up in ideas of overthrow. He is ultimately Winston&#8217;s interrogator, torturer and re-educator. However, even as he is being horribly tortured, Winston continues to hold a very high regard for O&#8217;Brien as he notes, &#8220;The peculiar reverence for O&#8217;Brien, which nothing seemed able to destroy, flooded Winston&#8217;s hear again&#8221; (Orwell, 1949, p. 225). Winston would go on to betray Julia, but would never lose his admiration for O&#8217;Brien.Orwell&#8217;s story takes the idea of &#8220;big government&#8221; to its most extreme conclusion. The story is particularly timely in a day when our own nation has clearly voted in recent months for a larger, more intrusive federal government. America has shifted over the years from larger to smaller, less regulated government and back again throughout our history. However, it is interesting that Orwell gives an idea of how one party was able to stop the pendulum from swinging by ensuring that average people were stopped from obtaining wealth. Orwell (1949) uses the following passage to describe the process used to obtain total control of the society: &#8220;It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which wealth in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste&#8230;In the long run, a hierarchal society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance&#8221; (p. 156).In the end, Winston is a beaten man who has failed to stand up to the power of Big Brother in any way. His character represents the limitations of the individual against an all powerful government. His mind is coerced and his love confused. The Party has done with him as it has with all others and will continue to do. And the story concludes with no hope for a positive resolution. This is a story which should be read by everyone to ensure an understanding of the evil capable of a powerful government.REFERENCE:Orwell, G.

It is a story about negative utopia, where the people behind Big Brother believe they have created the perfect world, where there are no freedoms. Heck, one of their three slogans is &quot;Freedom is Slavery.&quot; the others are &quot;War is Peace&quot; and &quot;Ignorance is Strength.&quot; The lead character is Winston Smith, who has been one such human who has lived both in this new &quot;perfect&quot; world and in the world of the past, where everyone lived in peace, where they were not watched 24 hours in a day, where their THOUGHTS were still a private issue. He thinks he can remember back where life was lived how anyone wanted to live it, but no one around him believes him. How can this be? There is no past. Ironically, Smith even works in the Ministery of Truth, where he is among the many who receive newspaper clippings and other data which he must rewrite to make it look like Big Brother is controlling the people perfectly. If there is a shortage of crops? Winston merely writes in that the years previous crop yield was less than the current years, so the yield is no longer a shortage, but a surplus. Rearranging the past trickles down to the roots of Big Brother, where with a simple eraser, people easily believe that Big Brother life is much better and offers even more freedoms than the life people had been living in the past. It is up to Winston Smith to change this view, find some evidence that life before Big Brother was more peaceful. A truly must read for lovers of any genre, eaily one of my all time favorites. It took over a couple pages for me to realize that I was hooked. Not only does orwell offer us a look into his version of the future, but in turn offers us an incredible ending, with a shocking last four words."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"&quot;1984&quot; is more or less what awaits us at some point in the future, I believe.

The book was kind of hard to understand at first because of the language but after the first few chapters I was able to slide right through out. I found it to be very enjoyable because I like the science fiction type genre. Also, it was a different kind of science fiction since it wasn't based on aliens; it was based more on futuristic type inventions and the pros and cons that arose. I would definetly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in sci-fi type books.

The political oppression, the control of our minds, the hopelessness of the masses, and their eventual capitulation to \\"BIG BROTHER\\" were in existence then, and are in existence now. Who can doubt it, when you listen to the political \\"DOUBLESPEAK\\" that we get from our \\"BIG BROTHER\\" today? As you go about your day today, and especially this PAYDAY, reflect on the doublespeak concept \\"LESS IS MORE\\". Perhaps that will enable you to get through another week, or month, or maybe more. And, if you start to feel that you are being singled out for suffering, and how unique you and your situation ARE, think of another Orwellian concept, paraphrasing a little from his work \\"ANIMAL FARM\\"; all of us are UNIQUE, but some are MORE unique than OTHERS!MICHAEL"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I know that some of you might be high school readers looking to give a book report and scouring the reviews trying to find some nuggets on which to base your report. A lot of these reviews do look like book reports don't they? This book is hard to appreciate in high school. It has many layers and really stretches the reader (which is why they want you to read it in high school - to stretch). Anyway, I will add my two cents to the 1000+ reviews already here.This book paints a dark picture of the future (even though 1984 is past us, it still paints our future) as we go torward more government control and intervention. The book forces us to ask serious questions - how far are we willing to go? What role does freedom play? What does freedom mean? Orwell's masterpiece - though Animal Farm is also a good one."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell is gifted at making us believe this futuristic society. I can definatley see the government trying to cover up every mistake they've made as though they've never been wrong, watching us constantly, and making us afraid to even think a negative thought. I'm just glad I have the freedom to say2 + 2 = 4"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell was a socialist, who had served in the Spanish Civil War fighting fascism - a true believer. However, the betrayal of ideology, mass murder and abuses by Stalin in the name of socialism prompted Orwell to write _1984_: a brilliant satire and a classic of 20th century literature.In the future, there is the one state, ruled by &quot;Big Brother&quot;, an allegedly benevolent ruler who is rather sinister. Obedience is demanded, subjects are not even allowed the freedom of thought. All labor and effort is geared towards the &quot;greater good&quot;, in a totally egalitarian society that is as stifling as it is sterile.Written as a criticism of Stalinism and the Soviet system, its biting criticism is testament to the extremes of ideology. While it is an easier read than the earlier Soviet work by Eugene Zamiatin's _We_, I feel _We_ is the better book. Nonetheless, 1984 is worthy of a reading."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Many readers have trouble digesting books that are commonly accepted as classics. Books written many years ago often times fail to resonate with the modern reader. 1984, a book more than 50 years old, is a true classic that anyone can enjoy.Unlike many accepted classics, this is not regal, dry, stuffy, nor thick. 1984 is mostly a light read, with some exception towards the end when Winston starts repeating from 'the book' to Julia. Other than that, words generally flow down the pages, and you quickly find yourself engrossed by the story, such that it becomes hard to put down...and hard to stomach at the same time.Orwell creates a world that is both absurdly terrifying yet strangely familiar. Strangely familiar because of what we see happening right now in our present day history. Orwell proclaimed that he did not think 1984 would happen, but that it could happen. If he were still alive today, he would be no less convinced that it could happen.Today, reality does not give us leadership which is this draconian. 1984 presents a possible reality; a reality that is an extreme case of government gone bad. While I don't see this as our eventual fate, I enjoy the eye-opening approach Orwell takes in creating this story to make his point.The result of his foreboding is eye-opening and fear-inducing. Those familiar with Animal Farm will recognize his ability to paint a very nefarious, yet realistic, scenario in which leaders of any societal order strive to exclude. Those not familiar with Orwell are in for a treat and should read Animal Farm in addition to this.This review is being written in early 2003. At the moment, US politicians are attempting to create legislation which will enable federal agents to track every electronic move that people make. In light of that, this book is a required read. Disregarding that, this book is still a required read.While I do not think this book represents a potential reality, it does highlight the danger of losing one's freedom to think independently. And in that vein, Orwell forces you to ask questions about the core of humanity and just how far things could possibly go.In perusing some of the 821 reviews of this book, I don't think it's fair to say that this is the best book ever written, or even one of the top 10 for that matter. It is a good book, and one that I highly recommend. But I cannot in good faith call it one of the best ever.The only issue I might have is that Orwell does assume that the average person is so mentally broke that he could allow this to ever happen. I don't know if this was his aim, or if it's to proclaim this *would* happen if the upper echelon got their way. Then again, in the day and age of media-fed TV junkies, perhaps he was more right than he could possibly have known.A very good book and certainly worth the read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I was so upset to learn that this is no longer required reading in advanced English in high school. I ordered it for my son, because no one can be considered well read without this in one's history."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"To me, Big Brother has to be the scariest fictional villain I have ever encountered. His &quot;picture&quot; is everywhere you look and it appears as though he is always watching you. Everyone believes in him but you don't know if he is an actual entity or just an omnipotent idea. This is the trouble the Winston Smith faces in &quot;1984,&quot; a chilling novel by Orson Wells.Those who believe in Big Brother do so religiously while those who don't are stuck in poverty on the fringe of society. Winston believes there is a way to topple Big Brother and the answer lies in the non-beliving masses. The problem is that they have no idea what their situation. Winston must find a way to organize these people while avoiding detection from the Thought Police.Mind control is rampant, people disappear, and &quot;history&quot; can be changed with one slip of paper in &quot;1984.&quot; The scariest part of this novel is that, in the information age we live in, there is the possibility that someone is always watching you. This novel is a must read for a society that hopes to avoid the level of big government that could lead to the situation contained within."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I was blown away by this book, couldn't put it down. The similarities with today are a bit scary. It's a great horror without the horror, if you know what I mean."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell was the pen name of Eric Arthur Blair. He first gained fame for publishing 1984. He was born in 1903 in Bengal, India and died in 1950. He was poor until his 30's. He was frightened by communism and his books reflected that particularly in Animal Farm.The author's goal in this book, 1984, was quite simple. He wanted to frighten people about a totalitarian, technologically backwards society where truth is changed to what is the present people say. What they say is are lies. The telescreens that are mounted everywhere destroy privacy everywhere but in the slums when they are like cameras. There is no such thing as love. If discovered, the secret would condition it out. There is a constant fake war as an excuse to make goods and then destroy them. There are 3 types of people, the proles, the outer party, and the inner party with all the wealth, goods, mansions, and servants.The author without a doubt achieves his goal. It is akin to detonating a brick of C-4 to swat a fly. He definitely frightens the reader into a coma. The reader's own children turning them in for thoughtcrime. Could anyone imagine that? No Bill of Rights? Room 101 where all the reader's worst fears come out and haunt the reader? If there was a secret police, how would people live? By looking over their shoulders, and holding low pitched conversations, thats how. Once the reader died, there would be no trace of the reader. No mention on the newspaper. It would just be changed the next day. The reader couldn't say anything subversive, because the readers' co-workers would turn them in. The worst of all is that speech would all be polarized. Everything that you said would have negative or positive connotations.The book has its strengths, when it describes the antiques shop and how there was relics like china. The description of Newspeak and the different ministries abbreviations are also strengths. The abbreviations are just a way of getting the mind to conform to new values. It was all about perception.The weakness is when the baser instincts leak through into actions. One example is when Winston wanted to rape Julia because he thought she was part of the secret police. Another is the very graphic screen, when Winston is getting interrogated and sells out his love for Julia just to get the pain to stop. It is a little too strong in my opinion."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's book 1984 was a tremendous, very enticing book. It shows a government under which no one can trust anyone. Everyone has to watch what is said to everyone because there is always a chance that the other person they are talking to is a spy.It starts off with Winston questioning what is going on in the government. He is wanting to revolt against them. He realizes that all the people are changing the history everyday to go with what the government says.He isn't careful of what he does and he gets caught. That goes back to always watching what the characters say around other people because if they aren't careful, they will get caught. That leads to George Orwell's purpose of this novel.George Orwell was a very good writer. He had a reoccurring theme in this book and in Animal Farm, which was communism. In 1984, he showed his vision of how the world would be if communism took over. There would be no freedom, and one supreme ruler, or in the book, Big Brother.Orwell accomplished his goal in this book. He was warning people against the negative aspects of communism. It may have been a little dramatic, but still there is not much freedom in communist countries. He showed that the government would have a hand in everything, even what people said in private.This book has many strengths and a couple weaknesses in it. The first strength is that it is written very well. It is put together so that everything fits together perfectly. Another strength is that it is a very enticing book. Once the reader picks the book up he or she can't stop reading it until it's done. The one weakness it has is the ending. It somewhat just cuts the reader off at the ending. It basically says Winston gave up on loving Julia and he accepted the party. So, Orwell is saying that Winston gave up and accepted communism. Overall though, it was an excellent book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"It's a beautiful thing the destruction of words\\" This appelation coming out of the mouth of a character Syme seems strange for any author to intone, tantamount to writer's heresy. In a way, this whole book was about heresy, 'thoughtcrime' towards the regime which ruled Airstrip One. This book will be able to teach a lot about politics in the modern day. The only place where it really strays is at Orwell's atheistic uterances. Otherwise a great read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"1984\\"--or \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" in the Oldspeak--is one of those books prophecizing doom that has remained relevant enough to generate a famous Macintosh commercial, a \\"Simpsons\\" parody, and a reality television series named for it among other things. What allows \\"1984\\" to remain in our consciousness and not a relic of the post-World War II, Cold War, Atomic Age era is that like the book of Revelations, \\"1984\\"'s dire predictions can be adapted for each new generation.\\"1984\\"'s epic battle of good versus evil doesn't take place on any plain of Armageddon, but rather within the mind of one man: Winston Smith. Winston is a 39-year-old man who works for the Party at the Ministry of Truth, which has an ironic name because Winston's job is actually to doctor reality so that the Party always appears infallible. Winston sees that while the Party, under the leadership of Big Brother, claims surpluses of everything, no one can buy simple items like razor blades or shoelaces. As he becomes disillusioned by the Party's rule, he and a young woman named Julia begin a torrid secret affair. Then he is contacted by a man high up in the Party named O'Brien who works for a resistance group known as the Brotherhood. But before he can help the Brotherhood, Winston is betrayed, arrested, and taken to the dungeons of the Ministry of Love, where he endures physical and psychological torment that threatens to break him and strip him of all humanity.As it is written, Big Brother and his Party would seem to represent the fascist or Communist movements of the 1940s. Taken literally it would be easy to dismiss the book as an archaic remnant of Cold War hysteria. But the beauty of \\"1984\\" is that because it focuses on the internal struggle for Winston Smith's soul, it can transcend all that. For the warning in \\"1984\\" isn't about communism or fascism, but the threat of letting anyone crush the human spirit through overbearing dogma.Much like faithful Christians of every generation have painted everyone from the Pope to Hitler as the Antichrist, every generation looks for its Big Brother. From communists to corporations to churches, individual readers can read \\"1984\\" and make their own interpretations of who or what Big Brother and the Party represent. But no matter how each of us sees it, the general warning should be clear: the human spirit is our most precious possession and must be retained at all costs.That is all."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is a great book, as is Animal Farm. It's horrifying,enaging,and sad at the same time. I also love the language. Nineteen Eighty-Four is probably one of my favorite books ever."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In this negative-utopia, the world is a place of despair, brainwashing, and lies. For 39 year-old Winston Smith, he is one of the only persons to realize it.While the world is at an everlasting war, \\"Big Brother\\", the leader of Oceania, is in a way, omnipotent. He controls the past, as everything he says is true. He controls you, as you are forever watched and observed. His lies are accepted as truths as there is never any proof, because all is either altered or destroyed. Everyone knows that the present is better than the past, simply because there is nothing they can compare it to. The world is lost of individual thinkers.Winston knows that \\"The Party as they are called, and Big Brother, are wrong and that they are manipulating everything, but only his memory can prove it. As Winston attempts to find ways of defeating The Party, his hopes rise and fall, with the meeting of Julia, his secret love, and O'Brien, his political rescue hopeful. His defiance against Big Brother rises to a turning climax of confusion and surprise.George Orwell creates an stunning image and almost a warning of a tainted future bound to destroy our meaning of living. The book written in 1949, was based on the World War and what frightening alternative may have happened.While the author is truly talented and creates an astonishing picture, the book seems to rush too much into details in some instances and be slightly vague in others. After reading the book one is felt that some questions are let unanswered, even though all the answers are there. Yet again, I mention the vagueness of some parts. Instead of giving an excerpt of what Winston is reading, Orwell gives almost the entire book, and while this is incredibly creative and shows immense talent, it also leaves the reader bored and tired, although, it does play a bit of an important event.Overall, it is clear to see why this book has become a classic over the years and is frequently read or referenced. It provokes the mind to wander and raises an incredible amount of questions about our society today, and the future of Oceania. It creates a vision of horror and keeps us alert of the way we are heading now."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is one of the most unique and thought-provoking books I have ever read. This book is so unique because, at times, it can be interpreted, espeically in today's society, as both a fiction book and a non-fiction book. While the characters and happenings throughout the book are fictitious, the parts of the book Orwell dedicated to his social commentary/critiques are entirely real and relevant to you as a reader.As stated by many reviewers, the most amazing thing about this book is that it was written almost sixty years ago and has only gotten more appropriate as time has gone on. It took me longer than expected to read the book because there were times when I put the book down and thought about the accuracy and depth with which Orwell disucess society's structure and how clear he presents himself on the page... all done in 1949! A supurb novel, social commentary, and read. Do not pass this up."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"There is a reason why 1984 by George Orwell is a classic. One of the reason is that this book is entertaining. This you can find in many classics. Another reason is that the reader feels for the characters. This can be found in many cheap paperbacks that you find in supermarkets at the end of aisles, so that isn't it either. This book makes you think about what you are not used to thinking about. This is better, but still does not make this book a classic.This book also is very easy for the reader to enter the world of INGSOC and Big Brother (be careful, he could be watching you). This could be the reason. However it is the combination of all 5 of these elements that make this story a classic.1984 revolves around your average-Joe, Winston Smith. Winston works for the Department of Truth (falsifies the past to make it the truth). He is satified with his way of life that involves thought-police (an FBI of sorts that makes sure you don't think any bad thoughts about INGSOC, the ruling party), double-speak (a language that is used to keep people from thinking bad thoughts), the Ministry of Love (prison/torture chambers), Ministry of Peace (War Department), Party slogans (War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength), and, of course, the Junior Anti-Sex League (so the government can control human reproduction).Winston finds himself inlove with Julia. Julia pretends to be a die-hard party member, however she actually plans to overthrow the party. Winston finds himself friends with a person that could cost him his life.The story of 1984 is really a great page turner. In fact, I HAD to finish it as soon as possible because I was worried about what could happen to the characters. The suspense is second to none.I found myself making connections between our world and Winston's world. That is what makes this book easy to relate to.I would suggest this book to everyone over the age of 13 or 14 because this book is a true masterpiece. However it would be a little too scary for anyone younger."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"With freedom on the Internet under attack after big business already mugged the rest of the media and turned them into government sock puppets, this book is more important than ever to read. You may hate Winston Smith for going against himself in the end and being forced to call defeat a \\"victory\\" but blissful ignorance and non-cooperation and no motivation of putting checks and balances on the elites, whether we're talking business giants or our ever-corrupt politicians especially the neocons will only make it easier for the government and their henchmen elite to take away what previous generation Americans had long fought for and that's the BIG WARNING this book sounds the BIG ALARM on ! Read it, drop that ignorance, and help take back America while there's still a chance to salvage what's left after the damage done for decades !"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read 1984 a few weeks ago after having ordered it from Amazon.com. My reasons for this were because the book had been mentioned quite frequently on some of the websites that I freqent online, and with all that is going on these days with the government, and everyone's fears (including my own) of our diminishing freedoms here in the United States, I found my site interested in reading this book. I haven't actually read anything else by George Orwell and not sure if I will or not, but I did enjoy reading 1984 and found it to be of great interest.Some of the parts throughout the book were scary. Some were sad. A few were humorous, such as when they were talking about the newspeak for the first time and how they wanted to get rid of a lot of words, which would no doubt make the language quite confusing. Much of the book was creepy, though, and I found myself comparing certain things in this book to stuff that was happening currently in the United States. While an exact replica of Oceania probably isn't likely to occur, it is very possibly, and unfortunately very likely as well, that the US may at some point in the near or distant future become something very close to what Oceania was in 1984, and that's what is so scary about it. I am not saying that it is a premonition set in stone, of course, but 1984 does serve as a warning that, yes, something like this could indeed happen and will happen if we allow it to; if only more people would listen to it...The character of Winston Smith was very well portrayed. He is a confused character throughout the beginning of the book, not sure where he stands, not sure if he is insane or not, though as it goes on, he becomes more sure in his stance against Big Brother, and his struggle to remain human in an inhumane society devoid of all emotion, save for a fierce loyalty and devotion to Big Brother.There isn't a lot of action and suspense in this book, so if you're looking for that, you might do well to look elsewhere.On the other hand, there are a lot of interesting philosophies and politics discussed throughout the book, and its definitely something that will make you think long after you are done reading. Along with being thought-provoking, it lends a credible, yet very terrifying vision of the future."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Like his earlier novel \`Animal Farm,' George Orwell's masterpiece 1984 explores the terror of totalitarianism. Both novels are cases of socialism gone awry, of revolutions which start out trying to throw off an oppressive government and end up establishing a new one which is even more oppressive than before. The masses (not very intelligent, according to Orwell, and easily manipulated and persuaded) are used by the middle-class to displace the upper-class, not so a system of equality can be established (though that is the promise given to the masses) but rather that a new upper-class can take the place of an old one. It is significant that Orwell, who was a believer in socialism himself, used socialism as the basis of the revolution, but it is also true that this concept can be applied to any form of government.This book expands upon Orwell's message in \`Animal Farm.' In that book, the animals stage a revolution--in this book, the revolution is already accomplished, and the new government firmly in place. The government of \`Big Brother' (the dictator figure of 1984) allows its subjects no liberties and no freedoms whatsoever--not even privacy in their own homes. The past-in the form of old media and history books-is controlled by \`The Party,' as is the language (The Party is working on a system of language, which will eliminate any words which do not agree with the Party's intentions). The Party government of 1984 seems very exotic, since nothing of that sort has actually taken place. But there are still lessons to be learned.Perhaps the most poignant lesson of the novel is described by the \`Newspeak' word \\"Doublethink\\" (Orwell coined this word). It means, in effect, the ability to believe something even in the face of evidence to the contrary. A parent who will not believe her child would use drugs even when she finds them in his room is a good example of this. In fact, \\"Doublethink\\" is a much greater threat than we choose to believe. The genius of this novel is that Orwell is able to point out problems such as these, problems in our own society. Though most of the setting of the novel is extreme, many of the ideals and guidelines the Party teaches are real threats, threats we face today.This is one of the great novels of the 20th century. It is almost standard reading for high-schoolers, but this does not mean that it is a juvenile work of fiction. On the contrary, the mental dictatorship of 1984 is not an impossible threat, even today, and for this message the book is justly termed a classic."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"At the time this book was written, in the 1950's, this book was feared as a posssible future for the world. This story is a bleak prediction of the future of man. Whatever they say is the rule, whatever they you think is ungaurdable, and even the smallest change in your apperence is subject for search. The biggest question of all though, is not how you can escapes, but who can you escape from. They know everthing that you are doing because of the telescreens located in every room and any thought of treason is picked up. This is the story about a man in this world, all alone, trying to figure out which is which. He knows the Party lies, and can even alter the past, but in a world where alliances wavor, and there is no certainty about who you are, how does he know he is fighting against the right people.

All three have similar subject matter: the bleak future. Both Brave New World and 1984 depict technology run rampant and used to further de-humanize the populous. 1984 is a bleak book, but in parts very powerful. I would say, however, that at times Orwell lost my interest. He is in love with narrative, which is fine, but occasionally it drones on. I would say that Brave New World is a better book to read about how the future CAN go wrong, mainly because it is much more entertaining.

Many parallels can be drawn between this \\"futuristic\\" government structure and several present-day political regimes.

I was in my early teens, the Cold War seemed anything but that, and the fear of nuclear annihiliation was quite real. Although this fear has resurfaced in the last year and a half, at least in those years there was an antinuclear movement that gave some hope for disarmament. On my first reading, Orwell's vision of a nightmarish future seemed relevant to both superpowers' hopes for world domination. What has stayed with me through the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, was Orwell's fascinating treatment of language and truth, his dissection of the ways people in offices of immense power, regardless of their political affiliation, distort reality to suit their purposes. The idea that resistance to such distortion begins with being true to oneself and decent to the people around you has sustained me through a dismal political era. In 1984, Orwell shows how such truthfulness and decency are their own rewards.I've read 1984 five times in twenty years and I've recently taught it for the first time. It's remarkable that Orwell's perceptions, written over fifty years ago, remain relevant regardless of the party in power, whether there are two superpowers or one, whether people read 1984 in the radio age or the Internet age. In a society whose citizens are linked more by their spending habits than their political outlooks, where many personal desires are shaped by images of inaccessible lifestyles, Orwell's perspective on language and truth, appearance and reality, become even more relevant than when they were first written.Readers often criticize Orwell's pessimism but he didn't underestimate our capacity to go along with things as they are. He might have avoided this criticism had he made Parsons, the loyal, dim-witted Party member, a more prominent counterpoint to Winston. Most of us, sadly, don't need to go to Room 101 to learn to love Big Brother.

The evil state in 1984 sought to control mindspace and to dictate identity to its subjects. \`\`The command of the old despotisms was \`\`thou shalt not''.

But the Party is not a masterpiece society. For example, if the mythological, immortal Emmanuel Goldstein(get it?) , the face to be forever stamped on, is said to be a traitor, once a member of the Party. What problem should BB have with thoguht criminals walking to the stake proclaiming their heresy? Also, within years of the story, all Inner Party members would be dead. But the Party would still continue, the old world abolished? No, as was seen with Julia, even those raised from birth by the party still occasioanlly break free from the rule. Also, there is hope int he proles. A thought-criminal might have no more to dot han get some possessions of the Inner Party to the hands of the proles, enough to make them realize they are oppressed. This novel is, however, horribly accurate in its prediction of dehumanization by technological advancement.

People who read this book that aren't ready for this transition will find the experience unfulfilling."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book, which is really a science faction, as opposed to a science fiction book, is most disturbing. Orwell's main theme in this book is that the aim of any dictatorship is to bore it's citizens to death and thereby suppress thought.Any form of excitement is thwarted by the Junior Anti-Sex League,24 hour interactive television and repetitive labour.Orwell seems to be saying that without imagination, there can be no freedom.Still,despite the lack of a clear plot, this is the best dystopian book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Nineteen-Eighty Four is by far one of the best novels I have ever read. It struck me at first as a simple novel of the so-called future, but I then came to see the more subtle aspects of the human psyche. By the end of the novel, the reoccurance of &quot;War is Peace; Freedom is Slavery; Ignorance is Strength&quot; begin to ironically make sense. Anyone who reads this novel will begin to realize a type of &quot;Big Brother&quot; in their own life."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Many of the reviewers on this page are part of the pre-millenium paranoia that seems to have gripped our country in a solid grasp in the last few years. What many of the people who have joined this movement fail to realize is that they have done just what Orwell warned against, becoming part of a faceless movement. All that need be given to form a mindless mob is a galant cause, and the destruction of the evil &quot;new world government&quot; fits that bill perfectly. What these people fail to realize is that the individuals trying to violate our homes, and ultimately our brains, are the pervayors of capitalism itself; that is the owners of huge corporate conglomerates , private individuals that have a larger motivation than world domination . . . greed. So, go ahead and buy this book on a computer built by a huge monopolizing business, over an &quot;internet&quot; that has exposed your personal knowledge to thousands of people (a service wich you pay for), using a credit card which holds you constantly in debt to a group of people which you have never even seen.

Saw the movie (with Richard Burton) three times.Orwell's tale is the tale of our time. It is the story of a man's total loss of himself, and the story of the nature of the society that took his very soul. Smith's fight against Big Brother proves more than just futile. His fight is the direct cause of his undoing both in his loss of &quot;freedom&quot; to move within his restricted society and in his loss of any concept of self.In many respects this is the ultimate horror story because after all the tyrany, torture, hate, and deceit, the greatest horror still remains inside the human psyche. Smith who could no longer believe in his lover Julia, who could no longer believe in his neighbors, who could no longer believe in the resistance &amp; Emmanuel Goldstein, who never believed in &quot;God,&quot; finally failed to believe any aspect of himself. What's left? &quot;He loved Big Brother.&quot;This is an extremely powerful book. I have only touched on one of its major themes. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The first ever Orwell book I read. I was younger, but I got the message loud and clear.

Although it is fiction, it is very believable; plausable, but hopefully preventable. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is, to put it lightly, hypnotic. Almost every little thing in Winston and Julia's world is clearly described. When it all boils down, it's about a guy, whose world's current status quo is to have no soul, fighting against an insurmountable evil. Being a fan of the X-Files, I thought I was paranoid.

This is clearly one of the greatest pieces of lititure ever written."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In this book, George Orwell paints a very dark future for human kind in his novel 1984. One must wonder how accurate he is about this, society's future. He shows how a gov't can alter the past just as quickly as the present occurs and still maintain full power over it's people. Today is the world going in the direction that this book depicts, to the exact destination, or are we going the opposite way. One can only think and worry about this situation, but it does appear society is heading towards what Orwell wrote so many years ago. The people of Oceania in this book were governed by telescreens monitoring everybody's moves and giving them rules to abide by. This book depicts a communist gov't and a guess at how the future will be. I personally really enjoyed this book. It was one of the few books that kept my attention on every page. This is definately a book for the intelligent reader.

While I found the world that Julia and Winston lived in scary, what was even scarier is that some day this could actually come true! While I'm only 14, anyone who is 13 or above should be able to grasp the main concepts of this book. You are very compassionate when you realize the vain struggle of Winston and Julia. This book also shows that human emotion while difficult can be altered and controlled. Your only hope in totalitrain society is mass rebelion or death. And the song, &quot;Under the spreading chestnut tree, I sold you and you sold me.&quot; When that played at the end my heart dropped cause it makes you realize that when humans are dissected to the core all they care for are themselves. If you think you are liberal enough to get a new view on life, read this book for it will change your outlook on life, love, and politics.

It was a bit of a depressing read because certain parts reminded me of our current political climate. But the concepts of doublethink, thoughtcrime, and so on are definitely food for thought. In the week or so since I finished reading it, I've found myself thinking about those concepts, in particular when I see an ad or something that says exactly the opposite of what it really is (the \\"Clear Skies Act\\" comes to mind right now)."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"What a strange title for a review. I hated this book when I had to read it in High School (along with \\"A Brave New World\\" and \\"Animal Farm\\"). It wasn't I couldn't understand the story, but rather, the \\"Meaning\\" of the story was being thrust down our throats. I grew up in the time of fear of Communism overtaking the world, where people even feared their own government (it was during Vietnam and all the riots at universities; where anti-war people were voicing their opinions, etc) and every teacher I had was seeing this as some \\"sacred prophesy\\" of time to come. At University I had to study it, and write a lengthy discussion on its intended meanings. Interestingly, as I researched the novel I discovered that the date was not some \\"futuristic prophesy\\" but rather a reversal of the date 1948, and much of the things mentioned in the book were common practice at that time and even before it during the war.I was completely put off this book and all those other futuristic books because they viewed society as nothing but a group of mindless nothings doing what the government told them to do. And I considered how long I had to wait for that horrible year, that prophetic year to arrive. Surely someone would improve on society and not destroy it.As years passed, and the \\"inevitable date\\" arrived, the world didn't stop, the mind control wasn't happening, and well, we were able to think as we wanted to. Obviously the book was not prophesy. Communism fell so all the books decrying that \\"evil way of life\\" became empty and their content no longer important.So, what makes the book worth while now? It is not what it is saying was happening in Britain at that time (though it was telling us a bit of the truth), it is not its warning about Communism or even society in the future; it was it warning about what happens in life to us when we allow ourselves to give into the propoganda of governments, media, and whoever you may think of, even the super right wing, and allow them to tell us what to think, and control what we do.In order for us to do that, we have to actually pretend the truth around us is not so, we have to decide what we hear is more real than what we live, see, and experience. It is that sort of \\"pretending\\" that Windston, the main character, simply cannot do. That truth to self does get him in the end, for that sort of mental and emotional independence is seen as a threat to the society he is living in. What Orwell was telling his reader was simply, when we allow ourselves to accept the \\"pretty lie\\", to believe as we are told to believe, to conform when it means giving up our very ability to think and understand, we create the soil for such a society to exist. We create the world that lets in sterility of thought, that allows massive belief of whatever we are told (like what Hitler did regarding the Jews); we allow society to control us, to think for us, and to tell us what value we hold. All these things contribute to create a society devoid of creativity, conscience, direction, meaningful life, and of compassion and caring. Society becomes cold, calculating, and inhuman. His book is exploring what a society is really like when those \\"virtues\\" become its heart.Now that the book has been stripped of its \\"prophetic revelations\\" and all those other trappings that teachers thrust on it (that made it a real pain to enjoy to read), I have discovered a profound thought, one far deeper than the fear of \\"Big Brother\\" or of Communism; a society devoid of real thinking, self-determined people becomes no society at all, no matter how \\"perfect\\" it may seem on the surface.Orwell used what he knew, the experiences of his day, and they are just as applicable to our day as they were back then in war torn England. And we are being sold the same bill of goods. Sadly, though, we buy into them because of our fear of what could be. And so did the characters in the society Orwell described. They did as they were told because even that discomfort was better than the imagined threat life had to offer them. Are we not told we must endure the \\"never ending war on terror and through never-ending war we will be at peace?\\" Are we not told that by giving up our freedoms and our ability to think and openly express our views, even our opposition to government policy, we are helping protect our freedoms?\\" Are we not told what to think, including our \\"fat police\\" out there who want to regulate even what we eat (very 1984, I have to add)? What he described is, we are a society where we let and allow others to tell us what to think, how to act, and we gladly give up our agency to choose, because, if we can put the responsibility on someone else, we feel freed from any guilt when things fail. The exaggerated technical controlling of the people may not yet be a reality, but the ideological controlling of people is now our reality.I agree with many reviewers, this book is a book of our time, even if we have to strip it of all the past interpretations and fears to get to the substance of the message. The book increases in meaning with age."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Doublethink and Newspeak need no explanation to people growing up with a Patriot Act that takes away liberties. We don't need the brilliant economic explanation that Orwell provides for the state of perpetual war with constantly changing enemies...But it's amazing how \\"1984\\" keeps popping up on enigmatic posters at recent antiwar rallies with references to doubleplusgood wars and war equalling peace and freedom equalling slavery.

The slogan that &quot;freedom is slavery&quot; and &quot;war is peace&quot; is a constant theme within the story, and Orwell's explanation of war being a mere political and economic tool is exactly correct, as has been demonstrated by vietnam and the korean conflict, as well as other US military involvements. His description of the government being an all-powerful, all-knowing entity is not entirely too far off from the communistic governments of today. What is amazing is that Orwell wrote the book in 1949, projecting what life would be like 35 years later, and he was not very far off in his assessment. The amount of freedom that people have has drastically been reduced in society, as is the case in 1984. Telescreens which can see and listen to people's private lives are the norm in a world where nothing is secret and almost anything is a crime against the State. The main character, Winston Smith, spends the entire novel realizing that this is the case. Orwell's 1984 is truly a fairly accurate portrayal of the social and governmental conditions that are present in todays society"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Why do they make high school kids, whose lives are already fraught with uncertainty and uneasiness, read such depressing books? I suppose back in the 1950&#34;s this was a fresh new picture of totalitarianism, but today pick up any newspaper and you see this story all over our modern world. It's not that I think Orwell isn't relevant, it's just that I think high school English teachers could do a little research, find books that are well-written, expand horizons, but that lift people up, not depress them. Maybe books that would help kids, at their vulnerable age, to laugh, become wiser, and look at others with more compassion. &#34;Cold Sassy Tree&#34; comes to mind. Something with warmth, humor and wisdom, rather than bleakness."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"While 1984 is now considered a cautionary tale about totalitarianism, it should be remembered that Orwell was an ardent socialist. Perhaps the most important (and least discussed) element of the story of 1984 is the doublethink of its author: Orwell's ability to condemn an outcome, while advocating its cause. Even as Orwell portrayed the corruption of socialist government in Animal Farm and the cruelty of totalitarian government in 1984, he insisted that these are perversions of socialism, rather than the inevitable fruit of socialism.This is the same foolish idea as Marx had; that human nature is malleable and can be forced to adapt to a socialist zeitgeist. Sadly, many people suffer the same delusion today; believing that government has the right to mold human nature rather than the responsibility to yield to human nature and respect our natural rights. Socialists do not like that human nature opposes slavery (i.e. socialism) and insist that with enough socialist indoctrination and through the force of socialist government, human nature can be remade to love subjugation.When we look to the troubling conclusion in which the rebellion is crushed and minds are retrained by imprisonment and indoctrination, it appears to be a break from the tradition of a successful resolution for the hero of the novel. Could it be that this was a successful conclusion in the mind of a socialist? Just as Brave New World ended with society purging its misfits from its midst, 1984 ends with the arrest and reeducation of its misfit.Could it be that socialists are so wedded to their ideology that they have lost the ability to sympathize with human rights to liberty and freedom of conscience and would rather sympathize with the State? What if the ending reveals that the hero of a socialist novel was never meant to be the individual; is the hero in fact the State?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell was dead-on in his vision of a possible future for the Western world.

How far will the few in positions of power go to improve their personal ideals in the guise of overall social improvement?I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys dark themes. The ending had me in tears."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I came to 1984 after reading a series of novels by Russian authors about life in Stalingrad during the onslaught by Hitler and then after the cruelty of Stalin. It's easy to see how Orwell extended the grim realities of the concentration camps of Germany and the labor camps of Russia into this dark prophecy. Of course, in many instances his vision has become realized. Big Brother seeks to invade our privacy at every turn via electronic media. Governments pose rhetoric immersed in \\"doublespeak\\". The Thought Police exist to bully our free expression. Power is exercised by imposing real human suffering upon multitudes. \\"The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent.\\" Oil comes to mind here. And munitions. And diverse other commodities. In 1984 the war is endless. \\"Everywhere there is the same pyramidical structure, the same worship of a semi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and for continuous war.\\" Sound familiar? The High, or the \\"priests of power\\" only fall when assaulted by the Middle and usually assisted by the Low classes. Then the Middle becomes the High and oppresses the Low for which change only means a new master. The protagonist, Winston, a \\"minority of one\\" questions his own sanity but ultimately defends the \\"spirit of man\\" as a force which cannot be overpowered. In the closing pages we see Orwell's true convictions about the infallible power of Big Brother and the triumph of the human spirit. This dark view has real overtones of Nietzsche and Machiavelli, who wrote with the view of realism based upon the inhumanity they witnessed in their heydays by \\"princes\\" with the \\"will to power\\". But the \\"spirit of man\\" is truly formidable and cannot be overcome, except temporarily, by totalitarian figures and corrupt democracies. The next US national election will be telling about down which road America will travel. 1984 is a cautionary, post-World War II tale but to say it's unrealistically dark and couldn't happen here and now is to overlook eons of history. And to be unconscious of the powers of orthodoxy infringing greedily and corporately upon the spirit of man in our time."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Anyone familiar with the lives of the Russian people under Stalin and his GULAG (Main Camp Administration) system will notice the many parallels between it and a lot of the goings on in the novel 1984. The story within the story is that of one man, 39-year-old Winston Smith, who works at the Ministry of Truth in London, the chief city of Airstrip One [England], which is (p 5) \\"the third most populous of the provinces of Oceania.\\" The party's slogans: \\"War is Peace,\\" \\"Freedom is Slavery,\\" and \\"Ignorance is Strength,\\" make it easy to accept the fact that Smith's job at the Ministry of Truth involves telling lies. More specifically, his job is to edit previously published official documents such that the \\"facts\\" du jour spewed by the government are shown to have been correctly predicted, (p 42) \\"Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date.\\" As Winston thought of it (p 43) \\"It was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another.\\" Each time the country's war opponent changes, Smith's job becomes especially busy modifying documents to show that the country has ALWAYS been at war with Eastasia and allied with Eurasia. Oceania's opponent and ally alternated regularly, but everyone is expected to unquestioningly believe otherwise. Smith meets and falls in love with a 26-year-old seemingly hard-core party member who, in fact, despises the party but has perfected the part of rabid party member to hide her true feelings. Outside the small world that is their relationship is the larger world of the all-powerful government, especially Big Brother, shown as an enormous face with a heavy moustache (Stalin?) on posters proclaiming, Big Brother is Watching You. Citizens are constantly being monitored by cameras and microphones as well as by their \\"comrades,\\" acquaintances and even family members. Everyone has a telescreen, which is always turned on since it can't be turned off. As expected, the couple is eventually caught. And Smith is tortured and starved before it's all over. The novel 1984 is an exceptional book about, among other things, the overinvolvement and of the government in the lives of its people. Also good: Planet of the Apes by Pierre Boulle, Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, and (for 9 to 12-year-olds) The Mysterious Benedict Society by Trenton Lee Stewart."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The book itself is quite great.

Wow, what an eye opener. The things Orwell predicted in 1984, such as the technology, is amazing considering how long ago it was written. The politics are messed up by current standards, but frighteningly possible. The tense mood of the book draws you in, and there are moments (especially near the end) that would be truly terrifying to experience. The chapter with \\"Room 101\\" I read with a shudder.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it bogs down a few times. I understand that this is to explain the world and how such a horrific existence came to be, but a slow start to any book is rather annoying."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book should be manditory reading in grade school. As a whole, 1984 depicts the world as many in todays world want it to be,but won't admit it of course, a world with out free speech, with out free thought, without the ability to critique and question; yet Orwell created the book prior to the calamities we see around us. Prophetic in a fashion, buit also written in a time when PC sugar coating wasnt the norm and you could see and even say what needed to be said. Big brother is watching us, whether it be the ACLU, some church, some group of fanatics who want to take away freedom, the GOV't, whoever. This book shows the desolate result when human curiosity is censored and oppressed, and the will is stamped out. Dystopian literature is a good thing, it isnt all bells and happy ssmiles, but that is life, and in order to fight against terrible things you need to know why they are evil. This book shows why and how many things become evil even without the need for a diety. Collectively our \\"Room 101\\" is not far off if we dont wake up and stop the idiocy of placating becasue we dont want to offend. Part of being human is being offended, part of humanity is the capacity to be unhappy; some say being sad all the time is a sickness, but the person who thinks things are fine all the time I believe is far more ill because if you look around the world, things are not OK; they are turning out alot like 1984."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The classic original.

Some have argued that we now live in a pseudofascist state in the modern United States, in large part thanks to another George. I'm sure Orwell's book was profoundly influenced by the historical context of his own life, especially WWII. It's certainly a very well written book, with vivid imagery and several memorable scenes. The movie version with John Hurt is also very well orchestrated. Author ofAdjust Your Brain: A Practical Theory for Maximizing Mental Health."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell has masterminded the collection of terminology resources that today we are aware of, but at times, I guess, without knowing their origin. Although modern terms like \\"hatecrime\\" and \\"hatespeech\\" in the book do not come to the surface, I am sure now, that they are implicit product of the heritage left by Orwell.The true value of a book is in the aftertaste, which urges one to think about human instincts and their function. And at the end, it is almost impossible to object to Orwell's argument, that the strongest human instinct is self-preservation and only then comes the drive to procreate.Winston Smith lives in the society founded upon hatred, he believes in the proles, and rightly so. Regardless of the fact, that two, and in some cases, even three generations of the Eastern Europeans experienced a number of Orwell's revelations to become reality (and to become truth!), they managed to change the course of events. In certain circles, though, the collapse of the Soviet Union is still being regarded as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century. As long as such a view will exist, Orwell's messages will not loose their urgency.Finally, I remember that those who studied the law in the former Soviet Union were taught that every crime is two-sided, having its subjective and objective side. While fully understanding what is being meant by first, there was some difficulty, though, among the students, in embracing the later. This novel is like a textbook to understand that concept."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In 1984, George Orwell extends the social analysis into a devastating critique of the principles and processes of political rule. The world of 1984 is divided into the Inner Party, or \\"Brain of the State,\\" the Outer Party, \\"its hands,\\" and the Proles, who survive in a kind of squalid freedom. The plot centres around the attempts of the one Outer Party Member, Winston Smith, to escape the totalitarian society in which he exists. His failure results not in execution, but, more chillingly, conversion, the surrender of his will. Nineeten Eighty-Four contains the famous sentence, \\"If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever.\\""},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"For years I had stayed away from this novel because I feared it would be a whiny book about how the bad government was mean to us. I was dead wrong. But can you blame me? Everyone nowadays shouts \\"Big Brother\\" whenever they see a security camera in a public place.I swallowed my apprehensions and bought this book. Glad I did.My first surprise was that the novel was far more subtle than I had been led to believe. I was intrigued, I wanted to read on, and I did.The first two parts are good, though I wasn't affected more than that. I was interested in this new world, I still wanted to learn about it and understand it. Some passages are truly epic, such as the history and explanation of this new world. After the first two parts establish in practice and theory the world we're in, the third part comes in, and that's a wholly different ballgame.Without saying anything of the plot, let's just say that I was mentally and physically shocked. By this I mean that I have rarely been so affected by words before. Everything *1984* exposed in its first two parts comes to a head in this third part and the point is gotten across with the force of a hammer to the heart. While I could remain safely out of reach during the first two parts, the third part had me. Newspeak, doublethink, all this stuff and more appeared to be pure evil, and if you're someone for whom truth is the ultimate value, and someone for whom language is a vital proponent of our thought, evolution, and morals, then you should feel like you're facing pure evil too.Orwell did what few authors have done - to my knowledge - in that he hits one of the biggest literary homeruns I have ever read. A boot stamping on a human face forever.I can't say enough about *1984*, but I will say that it was nothing like what I expected from the hearsay and the abuse of terms from this novel. The depth of this book is downright frightful. Pure evil inhabits this novel. Few books have made me feel this uneasy.I absolutely recommend it to anyone, and I also recommend forgetting people's use of \\"Big Brother\\" and other Orwellian terms applied to things that are, in truth, far remote from what Orwell was writing about.Lastly, while this edition is excellent, don't read the inside flaps as they give away major plot points. I couldn't believe such major plotpoints would be disclosed in the flap, but it was. The people who designed these books seem to think everyone has already read them. Do not read the flap! Take that dustjacket away as soon as you get the book and only look at it after you're done."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book provides a dark but compelling vision of the future. It isn't always comfortable reading, but you are engrossed in the concept and the relationships in the book. One mans struggle against the totalitarian system is fascinating to read and the ideas of societies development is scary to consider. A classic book, well written and should be on every bookshelf.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is a timeless book that seems more true with each passing year. Despite being written by Orwell in the 40s, this classic novel is still relevant. Instead of the Ministry of Information, we have the TSA and other government authorities telling us things we know not to be true. Orwell was a prophet when it came to predicting how governments would try to keep control of information. Fortunately for us, there is no \\"memory hole\\" down which inconvenient facts can disappear - we have the Internet and the free flow of information. As Orwell wrote in his book, the story of our age is one of government against the individual. 1984 is a great cautionary tale and a prescient warning to all who love liberty, to be on guard against tyranny."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Read it in high school enjoyed it then, and with all the unrest in society today, bought it for my collection, it's scary how close it is to actually occuring."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I see 1984 not only as the classic book people read for its metaphoric view of politics and history, but as a great novel as well. Its a highly entertaining book that makes you think and wonder, excellently written from beggining to end.If you have not read it, consider its among the best novels ever written, and one great page turner too.HIGHLY RECOMENDED"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"1984\\" by George Orwell is a great novel about what happens when a government becomes consumed with power. The story takes place in London in 1984 which was in the future when the book was written. London is part of a country called Oceania. The main character is called Winston.Oceania is continually at war with either Eurasia or East Asia. Once Oceania makes peace with one of those countries and goes to was with another it pretends in its government propaganda that it was always at war or at peace with whatever country it is at war or peace with.The majority of the population in Oceania are Proles who are like a peasantry. The elite people are only allowed to have sexual relations for the specific purpose of producing children but the Proles are freely allowed sexual relations.The citizens are kept under almost constant watch by camera-like screens. Writing in a diary is not allowed.This novel depicts a future where there are almost no human rights granted citizens. There is no privacy. Anything people do is known by the government. In our modern world so far this hasn't happened in the country U.S. where I live. Due to knew technologies which could give the government a greater ability to watch its citizens there is a danger of it happening so this book serves as a good warning."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is \\"about totalitarianism\\" and \\"about socialism\\" in the same way that \\"Star Wars\\" is about combat spaceships or \\"The Matrix\\" is about computer technology. If you read the book it becomes quite clear that the totalitarian regime depicted bears no resemblance whatsoever to socialism (it's the opposite, a totalitarian oligarchy), so when people say this book is a warning against socialism they are revealing their own practice of doublethink and so the warning of this book becomes even more important. \\"1984\\" is about the ways in which the human mind can become silently (and forcibly) stolen from an individual, and therefore from the masses, through manipulation of media, perception of scarcity, scapegoat-targetted engagement of strong emotions, and anti-intellectualism, among other things. All of these influences exist in our Western world, not merely in Stalin's Russia or National Socialist (Nazi) Germany of the past. The afterword by Erich Fromm should also be required reading. I wish I could find this edition (with that afterword) in hardcover form."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A confession from this reviewer: 1984 was first read in the early 1960s as a high school junior. Too young to really catch on. The readers of this review can be assured, though, that 1984 got just re-read before recommending now.This personal sequence turned out to be a good and lucky order of things. Reading 1984 as an older teen served as a good \\"memory bookmark\\" for the work about how wildly different was the storyline, especially having been written in the late 1940s. Reading it again much later let the whole ugliness of the theme sink in. Thus the realization grew during the years from awe (\\"cool\\"?), through bleak horror, to appreciation of the comprehensiveness of its scientific terror or at least the understanding thereof.The \\"naughty\\" parts of 1984 - the reader will be on his/her own finding these - are few and rather tame by today's averages. The truly overwhelming and blunt description of the terror-managed society-continent of Oceania (along with its equal counterparts, Eurasia and Eastasia) creates a fascination which is hard to stop reading about. Part II describes how Oceania (and the other two) came about in the 50s and 60s and its development, told ingeniously through a \\"smuggled\\" anti-Oceania revolutionary handbook. The reader will not be able to put the book down here, nor fall asleep during its reading as did Julia, the main girlfriend in the book. Part III takes the reader through the imprisonment and interrogation of Winston Smith, the main character and victim. Further description here will only serve to ruin the story. The reader will almost certainly be infuriated at various places! Yes, the very recent - 1st half 2010 - unfortunate remark by a US government executive about a \\"boot on the neck\\" of a certain oil company will find the phrase said much earlier by Winston Smith's interrogator, \\"... imagine a boot stamping on a human face, forever.\\" In the paperback version, page 267.The reader will find little problem coming up with possible flaws with the functioning of Oceania. Some events and outcomes may not look likely. These do not matter. The governing \\"inner party,\\" a sharply-defined and merit-selected upper 2% of society, formed the most illiberal government imaginable, with the future destined to become more repressive even as the resistance becomes weaker, and stretching out forever. Further, this inner party had to believe in the party philosophy more rabidly, more thoroughly than the other 98% in order to remain in power. You will finish the book and ponder!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell in his essay \\"Politics and the English Language\\" makes explicit his belief that language and thought are intricately intertwined, and in his masterpiece \\"1984\\" he makes this even more explicit.The protagonist Winston Smith is almost 40 years old in the year 1984, making him as old as George Orwell's adopted son who was born in 1944. Under the Ingsoc (English socialism) system, Smith is an Outer Party cadre, but what he really is as a writer. He is neither a Alexander Solzhenitsyn nor a Noam Chomsky because there simply is no tolerance for any dissent whatsoever. He is trapped not physically but mentally, and every second of his life is like torture to him. As a writer he, like Orwell, believes that language permits thought which permits the self. What Ingsoc enforces is the negation of language (Newspeak) and the negation of thought (doublethink) which equals the negation of self.Newspeak is the reduction of language ino meaningless absurdity, and thus Newspeak is the ultimate bureaucratic language -- it eliminates all the nuances and subtleties of the language, making it only functional. Newspeak is the ultimate straitjacket for a writer.Doublethink is a mode of thinking that accepts contradictions, holding two opposing ideas to be both true. Doublethink negates logic, and thus higher order mental processing. More nefariously, it creates servility in most men, and duplicity in some: most individuals cannot comprehend two competing ideas at once, and thus doublethink negates them into no-think; those geniuses who are capable of holding contradictions in their head automatically become deceptive and manipulative -- in holding two competing truths the person becomes the only truth.In \\"1984\\" there are two individuals capable of doublethink: Winston Smith and the book's antagonist O'Brien. Smith refuses to submit to doublethink, and instead seeks the freedom to pursue truth. He writes in a diary, a blatant crime, and he addresses his writings to O'Brien, who Smith correctly suspects can understand him. They are doppelgangers of each other, and their difference is in their attitude towards doublethink. If Smith is doublethink's greatest critic, then O'Brien is doublethink's greatest practitioner. If Smith cannot stand to live another day under Ingsoc, O'Brien is in fact Ingsoc, Big Brother, and the Party, for he alone is the truth. If O'Brien wishes to be Big Brother's greatest enemy he is the truth, and if he wishes to be Big Brother himself he is still the truth.Ingsoc is a system of slow banal torture, whereby individuals must voluntarily (under the threat of torture) surrender their selves to Big Brother. They are not permitted to write, to think, and above all to be intimate: the greatest act of rebellion by Winston Smith and Julia was to make love and to love each other. It is not enough for Big Brother to demand your obedience -- he must also control your thoughts and your memories.O'Brien is clearly a psychopath, and Smith is his plaything; O'Brien does not fear and hate Smith -- he is just contemptuous. For seven years, O'Brien had been watching Smith (\\"Big Brother is watching you\\"), and when Smith carelessly and faithfully went to O'Brien with his subversive thoughts then O'Brien's only thought could be: he's always known. Smith orchestrated his own sacrifice, but it was not a martyrdom: it was in fact just an escape from his life. If a writer cannot write, then that is a fate worse than death."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I am a history teacher and always recommend this novel to my class when we embark on the 20th Century single party states IB paper. Orwell lived during the era of the great dictatorships of the 20th Century and was acutely aware of the brainwashing techniques such regimes used to control their populations. The concepts are clearly and horrifically articulated so they rattle the brain - ideas such as Thoughtcrime, the scrutiny of our innermost mental processes, and newspeak - the rewriting of the language to prevent any freedom of expression.Yet, more than this, Big Brother can also be read as a piece of English pastoral - scenes where Winston Smith conducts his love affair with Julia in the countryside, and his dreams and memories of the 'rabbit bitten pasture' evoke a lament for a pastoral Britain in danger of being submerged by out of town shopping centres and motorway culture. George Orwell, changing his name from Eric Blair to encompass both England's patron saint and one of its main rivers, was a true patriot in the best sense. His writing holds moral clarity towards the best of British freedom, and encourages us to think for ourselves as to how to carve out our own independence.No, we are not currently living in a dictatorial regime, and whatever the shortcomings of the present parliamentary system it would be intellectually lazy and insulting to those who are living under such regimes to claim that we are. but Orwell's novel alerts us to the preciousness of the human mind, and its vulnerability to systemic outside forces that destabilise us. Which makes 1984 compelling literature."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"In the old days, he thought, a man looked at a girl's body and found it desirable, and that was the end of the story. But you could not have pure love or pure lust nowadays. No emotion was pure because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred. Their embrace had been a battle, the climax a victory. It was a blow struck against the Party. It was a political act.\\" The year is 1984, or so Winston Smith thinks. Nothing is ever certain anymore except he lives in Oceania and they are constantly at war with either Eurasia or Eastasia. They had always been at war with Eurasia, until a quick announcement and falsification of thousands of records made them always at war with Eastasia. The Party is always right, or so it would seem. By looking at records you know existed, you would find only lies. Winston Smith knows this because he works for the Ministry of Truth, which deals with the falsification of records. The Party is the single reigning body of totalitarianisim for 1/3 of the world. But, is this simply a mere story, or something more? Was George Orwell trying to warn us of the direction our own government is heading? This version is a little extreme, but it proves its point. Winston Smith is an average man working for the Party. Scared of it, but also hating it, Winston believes that he is good as dead. He does not believe in the Party or its values, and in this world, that will earn you an arrest from the thought police for thoughtcrime. The Party can virtually read your mind through the telescreen; a two- way video broadcast system. You can never be alone with your thoughts."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell was way ahead of his time with this book. It's amazing that in the late 1940's when in the West relatively little was known about the life under communism and it's impact on everyday life, Orwell was able to capture this so brilliantly! However, this book isn't just about communism, but about any social, religious or other structure that is trying to suppress freedom and exert control over human mind. Still relevant today.Probably the only thing that he did not get right is that he associated communism too closely with the ability to innovate. When there are no personal rewards and people live in fear, there isn't innovation. But that's just a side note and it does not take anything away from this brilliant book.It's a timeless classic that has something to say to every generation and should be a required reading. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I couldn't believe myself when I saw this book. Top quality, for such a nominal price.

The ordeal of protagonist Winston Smith is similar to that which many Americans are experiencing today, through the gradual erosion of personal liberties and the creeping intrusiveness of government. The most chilling aspects of the novel concern not its depiction of graphic torture, but rather its treatment of its fictional media, which distorts reality at whim to suit the aims of Big Brother. The extent to which betrayal by government plays a part in the story should also be haunting for today's citizens. These maladies are too eerily close to what is happening today in America, as media spin distorts every story out of control and politicians are making themselves more impossible to trust every day. That George Orwell foresaw so many decades ago the rise of leaders like George Bush and Dick Cheney truly testifies to his sagacity, just as the story's power to transfix and haunt modern readers testifies to his brilliance as a storyteller."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Today's American is mentally incomplete if he/she has not read this book. If you haven't read it, please do so. If you have read it, please read it again. And keep in mind that reading it is not the goal. Knowing it is the goal.The distinction is important because Orwell so masterfully describes the loss of truth, the loss of individuality, the loss of freedom so subtely and so effortlessly, that the crucial points are missed if the reader has a lack of focus.with uncanny brilliance, Orwell describes the tactics used by a totalitarian state against its own people to gain submission and cooperation. The submission is so complete that the proles (the masses) no longer have ownership over their own thought! It is a subtle and painless process and only Alexis De Tocqueville, in his monumental work, \\"Democracy in America\\" has come close in the past 175 years of describing it, but even Tocqueville admits that he can't give it a name.\\"In fact there will be no thought...Orthodoxy means not thinking-not needing to think. Orthodoxy is unconsciousness\\" writes Owell. Orwell later writes that \\"orthodoxy is stupidity\\". What the reader needs to understand with this point is that \\"orthodoxy\\" is the \\"news\\" we get from our mainstream media, our establishment press. Because our mainstream media is government controlled, as explained in the book:U.S. Television News and Cold War Propaganda, 1947-1960 (Cambridge Studies in the History of Mass Communication), naturally only government orthodoxy will be espoused.In the novel, Orwell writes, \\"There is no possibility that any perceptible change will happen within our own lifetime\\".There are so many unbelievably essential tactics described in this book that I can't do much justice to them in this review, but the reader needs to connect with Orwell's cleverness and understand how important it is to Big Brother to control the language and rewrite the history, in fact, write the history before it even happens. This, the torture to get confessions, attacking an ally and blaming an enemy (false flag terrorism) is all here and Orwell wrote this masterpiece 60 years ago!This book, Nineteen Eighty-Four, is drawn from heavily in the book,Don't Weep for Me, America: How Democracy in America Became the Prince (While We Slept).

The main character, Winston Smith, dares to defy what he is being told and tries to rebel, unfortunately he lives in a society where you cannot trust anyone and Big Brother is always watching you.This is definitely a thought provoking novel of blind faith, and the inner workings of the human psyche. What makes children turn on their own parents? What would you do if you were not even allowed to enjoy intercourse? These are just a couple of the questions that George Orwell brings to mind, I am not sure if we could ever truly know the answers to some of the questions that are posed in this novel and I hope we would never have to find out. It was an interesting book and I am glad I read it. George Orwell was able to capture such a frightening future so realistically some people have begun to believe this story may be prophetic, I myself see it as purely science fiction.

Having them now as ebooks also allows a rapid comparison which was very useful. Fortunately, to me, the writing styles were very different and thus both held my attention to the end.The characters in 1984 showed less depth and detail, rather the book focused on the fractured society in which it was set.

There is absolutely nothing appealing or redeeming about the 1984 society or life, which makes the main character's life all the more fascinating.The reach and relevance of this book to today are profound in that there are frequent references to it and its ideas in other books, movies, the media and even idle coffee shop conversations as it is the foundation of terms/concepts such as Orwellian, Big Brother, thoughtcrime/ Thought Police, War is Peace, doublethink, newspeak, etc. That combined with it being a good, well-written, thought provoking book make for a compelling reason to read it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"If you think socialism, Marxism or even communism is the worst think that can happen then you must read this book.

That is to say a society ruled by the few for the benefit of only themselves. The overwhelming majority of people in Orwell's Oceania work for the ruling caste in every sense. The masses of the citizens in this dystopia also live their lives under the control of the rulers. Even the reproduction of human beings is done in a controlled environment in a scientific manner.Orwell's Oceania is made up of the inner party (rulers), outer party (workers), and the Prols (isolated poor). Winston, the main character, is a member of the outer party in Orwell's dystopia. He works to maintain the society in which he lives while he despises it. Winston secretly wages a revolution in his mind until it can no longer be contained there. The problem is that in Oceania there is no place to rebel from or rebel to. Winston ends up falling into the hands of the state which attempts to fix him or cure him. Orwell leaves it up to the reader to decide whether the officials of Oceania have won and Winston has changed. -"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read this book back in high school, thinking \\"Well, it's a classic.

In a way it's a political treatise disguised as a novel, and it will have you nodding your head as you consider the state of the world today - perpetual war, sophisticated systems of propaganda, distorted news, doublespeak, the surveillance state... the list of parallels goes on and on.It is also a masterful novel, aside from the brilliance of Orwell's ideas. When the telescreen \\"surprised\\" Winston and Julia, I almost fell out of my chair.Certainly not a fun read, it is grim and bleak and wretched.

I\`ll recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read 1984 for summer reading and enjoyed it greatly. It's a book that makes you think, and makes you excited TO think about everything going on. I was actually eager to write an essay and discuss the book once school started. There's so much to this book.It's a book where, at the end, there are more questions than solutions. Your head is left spinning. And yet, it couldn't have believably ended in any other way. It's frightening and intriguing.This book is great for conspiracy theorists, and anyone who likes great, thought-provoking literature."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Love the book, very appropriate for the time we live in. It arrived in the condition described."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Read this book 40 years ago and find it very interesting in light of the events of today. George Orwell may have had the date wrong but the basic premise is spot on for today's world of managed news, wars, big brother watching, global chaos, and the struggle for the human mind, that we see everyday in our politics. The competition for the mind in todays world is very destructive to our way of life."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I enjoyed this novel so much! I'm still reading it but it is so engaging that I can't put it down. George Orwell was a great writer and he always had that vision of the future that was truly amazing. It is a sin not to read this novel!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"So much has been said and written about this novel that it would be difficult to come out with something new and original. surely it is a book that will be remembered in history because it is ever still so relevant. I would just say that if you like this book and the developpment of a dystopian government that controls everybody you should definitely read Democracy Society by John Christmas, different style but equally good"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This was my first time ordering 1984, and figured it'd be a drawn out and dry book considering when it was written. I was quite surprised when it kept my attention after the first few pages; the parallels between what is in the book and what is going on today are unnerving. Read it and see what I mean. Read other reviews to get a better idea of the synopsis of this book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is great example of Hegel saying \\"Government is God walking.\\" Government controls every aspect of life in for the sake of protecting itself and its war making apparatus. This book invokes the dream state of left leaning ideologies National Socialism taken to its full extent. This book that shows the meaning of state is father and social services are mother."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell is one of the few writers who can effectively describe a future like the one in 1984 and still maintain a sense of reality while doing so. This is one of those books that everyone should read just for the sheer fact that it has so much depth and a huge base of messages to pull from that it can leave a reader thinking to himself for days about the meaning of symbols or plot points. As far as symbolism is concerned this book has some of the greatest! The depth and dimension that Orwell is able to add using objects like a paperweight or even Wilson's ulcers is remarkable. Mastery of the art of writing is reflected in author's ability to turn the mundane into powerful tools which sub-textually say more about the story than perhaps whole chapters could.The plot of the story, in my opinion, moves pretty quickly. This can sometimes be a bad thing, but considering the length of the book and the way that Orwell handles it 1984's plot is engaging and entertaining. The one complaint I have is the suddenness of a love plot that develops. It has always seemed to jump out of nowhere, although I know that it would be hard to develop it more fully and still keep the main story moving. The description of the setting is phenomenal throughout the book. It is very easy for the reader to picture the place that Orwell is trying to take you. The images of Big Brother, the monitors, and even the government buildings all help to drive in the point of the book, an action which is mirrored in the repetition of these objects in the book.The most blatant allusion that Orwell makes is to communism. Describing the working class as Proles brings to mind the Proletariat hero of Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto. In the Manifesto, the proletariat rises up out of frustration over broken promises and minimal compensation for their exploitation. The rebellion results in the capitalist system being over thrown by a united people and then establishing a society were all needs are met and where everyone is equal. This type of utopia seems like a logical desire from a working class that has been exploited and subjugated; however, Orwell very delicately handles the situation of the Proles and leaves the reader free to interpret what may happen. All that we really get is that the Proles have been relocated to a specific area and kept there pretty exclusively. This means that the more educated live away from the uneducated, drunk, slum-living working class of 1984. On a note of optimism Wilson notes that only the Proles, who are the majority of the population and ought to be the primary benefactors of \\"the Party\\" (which they clearly are not), are capable of rebellion. By sheer force and numbers it is only in the Prole populace that a successful rebellion could ever really take place to over through Big Brother, however, without well educated people among this group of people could the rebellion ever come up or reach the broader whole of the populace? It is those segments of a story that allow the reader to develop their own opinion that make a good story a great one. 1984 is a brilliant book not only because of its subject matter, symbolism, or depth but also because it is though provoking. The reading doesn't end when you finish the book and that is the hallmark of a great piece of literature."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I have heard the book 1984 mentioned many times in my life, and I finally decided to sit down and read what all the commotion was about. I must say that it certainly lives up to the widespread expectations. The author's writing style, his talent in story-telling, the complexity of the characters, and the plot itself are remarkable. As you read the book, it gives you the feeling of seeing the scenes with your own eyes. The author describes each detail with such emotion, that you can't help but think you are watching a movie, rather than simply reading words on a page.The main character is Winston Smith and he represents the modern day, average man (even though it was written more than 50 years ago). He presents questions and doubts that any one of us would have. As he goes through the journey of the book, things become confusing for him, and at points you are left confused as well. The author does such a great job at embodying the reader with Winston, that you try searching for the truth, just as Winston is. I found myself going back through the text, and searching for an answer that it is virtually impossible to find.The book leaves you with many questions, but you must understand that was the point of the author. You are Winston, and just as Winston is complicated, so are we. I must warn you that it is a disheartening tale, however it will definitely satisfy your thirst for a good read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It's 1984! But not the 1984 you'd expect. There are no headbands, hair bands, sex, drugs, rock and roll, or Regan. Instead there is Oceana, East-Asia, and Eurasia, and the only thing you have to yourself are your thoughts.1984 takes place in the post nuclear war society of Oceana. Where people are constantly under watch by the government.1984 is about one man's struggle to thrive, in Oceana. His struggle against the government by joining a forbidden society and participating in a forbidden love affair. All in all 1984 is a philosophical revelation told in the form of a modern thriller. It is exciting yet still provokes philosophical thought. However sometimes the constant rants are not only superfluous but can appear unscientific. But all in all, 1984 by George Orwell is a well rounded novel.One interesting and rather exciting aspect the novel explores is the creation of new words in Gilead and destruction of obsolete words. Words like thoughtcrime and doublethink are created. These words are created for the government as a means to control the people. This thought provoking concept is one most people never examine.Even though the chapters are philosophical, some are hardly scientific. There are 10 pages in the middle of the novel dedicated to a giant rant, rather than any substantiated claims. The novel has several of these rants, and quite frankly, I get tired of them.But all in all, I would recommend this novel to everyone and in particular high school students. I like the fact that it is not only a thriller, but a novel that critiques the governments and societies that govern us.What I don't like about it is the fact that sometimes it appears to be ranting without evidence.But all in all, I recommend everyone read 1984."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I had heard many great things about the works of George Orwell, particularly with regards to 1984. As the brief description adequately puts it, this masterpiece is filled with almost &#34;dangerous&#34; ideologies, which are cleverly portrayed and frighteningly prophetic. I highly recommend this book to any person who has questioned authority."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In 1948, on the island of Jura in Scotland, a middle-aged and gravely tubercular man pen-named George Orwell (real name Eric Arthur Blair), began writing his sixth novel. Orwell, an extremely influential journalist and author who was known for his adroit ability to craft with the English language, his strong opinions on political issues such as totalitarianism, and his satirical novella Animal Farm (1945), sent the final copy of his sixth and final novel to his publisher on 4 December 1948. On 8 June 1949, the novel hit the shelves of bookstores, bearing the name Nineteen Eighty-Four. Seven months after his book was released, on 28 January 1950, Orwell passed away because of complications with tuberculosis. Over 60 years later, people still enjoy this grim, enigmatic tale of a futuristic society gone horribly wrong. The edition I am reviewing is a 328- page reprint by Signet Classics, complete with the story, an appendix with the principles of Newspeak, and an afterword by Erich Fromm.In the futuristic super-state Oceania, which consists mainly of the Americas, the Atlantic islands, Australia, and the southern portion of Africa, the story takes place in what used to be called Britain, but is now known as \\"Airstrip One\\". One could infer from the title that the story takes place in the year 1984 (although the government's falsification of history has created some uncertainty regarding what year the story really takes place in). Oceania itself is governed by a three-tiered totalitarian party, separated into an Inner Party, an Outer Party, and a large proletariat population, all of which are led by a mysterious dictator named Big Brother. Winston Smith, a member of the Outer Party who works in one of the ministries of the Party, takes the main role in this story. Because he possesses a mind unlike many of those within the Party, a mind full of resistance and hate towards the Party, Winston regularly does things that would be considered a crime in Oceanic society, a society in which the truth is censored, the actions of people are closely monitored, the thoughts of people are controlled and altered, and peoples' individuality has been removed.At the opening of this story, we find that Winston works in the Ministry of Truth, a large governing ministry which is responsible for rewriting historical documents and media and changing facts to fit Party doctrine and make it seem like the Party is absolute and never wrong, in essence turning most news media, and even some books and some forms of art, into propagandist media (and also turning the name of the ministry into a lie). Normal Party members are oblivious to falsification because their minds have been trained to simultaneously accept two contradicting beliefs as correct (this is referred to in the story as doublethink). However, Winston is different. He begins to see through the party, their abuse of power, their lies, and their hate, and because of this, he seeks psychological freedom.Winston seems to recall a time in his life when things were much better. However, he doesn't quite remember when that time was, or what it was really like. This mere feeling causes Winston to ponder whether or not there was a time before his where life was much better; a time without perpetual war, political unrest, or harsh living conditions. Because of this, he seeks a way to bring down Big Brother and the Party. He finds hope in rumors of an underground organization known as the Brotherhood, created for the purpose of overthrowing the party. He also finds hope in the proles, theorizing that with the size of their population, if they realized that their life could be much, much better (though how can you do that when this is how you have lived since the day you were born?), they might band together and overthrow the party.He also finds hope in a fellow employee, Julia, who Winston at first believes is an agent of the Thought Police. However, an encounter at work changes his mind when she reveals to him that she loves him. They begin an affair, rendezvousing in remote locations to make love; not just because of love, but also for rebellion against the Party. They then make a home in an antique shop in a proletarian quarter of Airstrip One. Another fellow employee of Winston's, O'Brien, displays discontent for the party as well, and upon Winston and Julia meeting with him in his flat, he reveals that the Brotherhood really does exist, and he allows Winston and Julia to be a part of it, so long as they understand that the change they desire will not happen in their lifetime.Winston had finally found paradise in a collectivist hell. Not only that, but he had also become part of the force that was going to bring down the Party! He knew he had people on his side! Although this seemed very, very promising, this proved to be nothing but a lie. Winston receives a book from O'Brien regarding oligarchical collectivism that was written by Emmanuel Goldstein, a co-founder of the Party who ended up betraying it and, because of this, becoming the primary object of hate in Oceania. Shortly after this, Winston and Julia are betrayed by the owner of the antique store they lived in, who turns out to be an agent of the Thought Police. Shortly after this, they are both taken away to the Ministry of Love.During his captivity in the Ministry of Love, Winston is beaten, abused, neglected and periodically interrogated by members of the Inner Party (his treatment being indicative of yet another misnomer of a ministry that specializes in interrogation through torture). O'Brien, who revealed himself to be a member of the Inner Party, interrogates Winston several times, and at one point reveals to him that the Party wants more than just confessions from people who are considered \\"thoughtcriminals\\". The Party needs to be certain of every citizen's love for Big Brother and the Party because they simply want every citizen to believe in Big Brother and the Party. They don't want to exterminate those who do not believe. Rather, they want to go to the fullest extent to force them to believe. With this as their motive, what will happen to Winston? Will he continue to resist the Party? Will he end up just like every other brainwashed, orthodox citizen of Oceania? The conclusion of this story reveals all of this and more. What O'Brien revealed to Winston shows that in a totalitarian regime the top priority of the party is to control everything they can possibly control. Even your own mind. This book clearly illustrates for the reader the dangers of totalitarianism and how this political system dramatically affects the quality of life for the citizens held within it.Late teens to adults of any age who have strong opinions on political issues or enjoy dystopic fiction or social science fiction will enjoy this book. However, people who are sensitive to sexual content or violence might not like certain aspects of this story, because there are points where topics like this are either hinted at, or sometimes even elaborated upon. Also, a recommended prerequisite to this book is to possess a rather advanced vocabulary, that is to say that if your reading level isn't quite at the college level, then you may have some difficulty getting through this book. I enjoyed this book. I actually enjoyed it a lot. The ending, however, I did not exactly enjoy because this book did not end the way I wanted it to or the way I thought it would. However, by no means does the ending negate the book's appeal; the book is sure to be a great choice for anyone who enjoys complex characters, an enigmatic storyline, and outstanding, elegant usage of the English language."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In a terrifying atmosphere of totalitarianism, Winston meets Julia, and a romance begins. What follows is a description of the triumph of human depravity. The government, which seeks power for its own sake, destorys any human relationship that can be interpreted as a conflict of loyalty. Everybody must be made to love Big Brother, even if the cost of this love is the loss of dignity, freedom, and common sense. Based on Stalinist Russia, Orwell's novel certainly has broader implications and is a warning against complacently accepting what is being presented to us as real by the powers that be.The book starts slowly. Orwell tries to set an ominous mood for his readers. Unfortunately, Orwell is best when he does not try to write around too much and goes straight to the point. So I recommend that you press on, even if at the outset the book is not terribly exciting. You won't find many characters in this book, but those you do find are done pretty well by Orwell. The thrust of the book is, of course, social and political. It makes you think. For example, why can't something like this really happen, let's say in 2084? The answer to this, in my opinion, is not simple. Orwell gave us a warning. We would be fools not to heed it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book caught my attention by the first paragraph. I had HUGE trouble putting it down. The only thing that got me to put it down was the fact that I wanted it to last! This is by far the best book I've ever read. George Orwell put great thought into every aspect of this book. The most amazing thing is the technology that he accurately predicted like the SpeakWrite (program in which you speak into a microphone, and it types up what you're saying).If you like this book, you will probably like Clockwork Orange, and vise versa. They both have reminitions of Communism ruling the world (which was a great fear and quite controversial idea for that time), and they both have new languages, brutal police, and strong governments.My only warning, is that this book contains parts that can depress the easily depressable (like myself). So read it, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 excellently depicts a negative utopia, a world in which government is everything and everywhere, and individuality means nothing. A man named Winston rises up to find the truth and to see through the government coverups. Since the government is so allpowerful and corrupt, it allows such people as Winston to rise up just for the joy of crushing them and turning them into mindless believers. 1984 is like the other great negative utopias, Brave New World and Farenheit 451, because in all books the governemnt controls all aspects of life. However, Brave New World uses material pleasures such as the drug somna to control it's citizens, Farenheit 451 burns books to keep it's citizens ignorant, and 1984 uses fear. In 1984 there are thought-police, people who can see you at any time through TVs, even in your own home. They would arrest those who would even just made 'face crime,' or not supporting the government even through just one upset glance. These three books are very exciting and while these futures may or may not be happen, it shows us that the human spirit will always strive for knowledge and individualism, even against impossible odds."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A wake up call!! This eerily prophetic book should serve as warning to all of the horrors of collectivist totalitarianism and of the seductive snares that lead us there. This books best value is a warning against collectivist totalitarianism.

In this case it is the government."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The essence of 1984 that carries it beyond mere fiction is Orwell's deep understanding of the totalitarian urge common to those who seek and wield political power. Today we stand at the brink of a technological society where the political levers of control and surveillance are far beyond Orwell's darkest imaginings. All that prevents their implementation is the political calculus of the time. As Jerry Furland has shown so vividly in the novel &quot;Transfer&quot; the systems already exist to enslave each of us. We are left wondering when, not if, the political will to execute the final transfer to a new Utopia will occur. This is the dilemma of our modern age."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Possibly only equalled by Brave New World, 1984 is a dystopia which unfalteringly relays the full horror of dictatorship and social manipulation to the reader. This magnificent novel has an almost perfect structure - Orwell has so delicately considered not only how this society could arise (offering detailed explinations of new social &quot;super powers&quot; and how dominace and political power could be successfully sustained), but why. His successful attempt to offer the reader a philiosophy of the nature of humankind, eventually distilled to the nature of power, draws some disturbing, horrific conclusions. Orwell's philosophy is that man dominates simply for the sake of power - the only, unchallenged reason. His unsettling final symbol of the new order - a man's face being crshed by a boot - is a symbol not only of totalitarianism, but of political human misery, and all it's destructive connotations. An extremely disturbing novel which must be read"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"There are three novels I recommend to everyone, especially adolescents, to encourage critical thinking. These are Orwell's '1984', Rand's 'Anthem' (or 'Atlas Shrugged' if you have the time) and Huxley's 'Brave New World.' Orwell's vision of a totalitarian regime ruling its people under a microscope through propaganda and punishment is unfortunately realistic. It is also extremely well written. It is not chance that the symbolic \\"Big Brother\\" is so often referenced, feared, and loathed. Orwell christened a phenomenon: the increasingly observant eye of authority. The illustrative crushing of the human spirit is heart wrenching to bear witness to, but stands as a reminder of the value of our liberty. This is a must read for the freethinking individual."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time (and Orwell's Animal Farm is on that list also). I had to read it my sophomore year of high school. If you enjoy reading books that really make you think, then 1984 is a good choice. Orwell has a way of writing so that a reader is interested and challenged at the same time."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell's classic dystopian novel is an excellent read. I was forced to watch the movie as a sophomore in high school and wasn't interested in it, nor was I old enough to really grasp the concepts. That has changed however. This book is enthralling to the point that it is hard to put down. Following Winston Smith in his life under the totalitarian regime of Oceania, 1984 weaves a scary and alarming story of what happens when government gets out of control. In today's political environment, it is a shining example of what we, as citizens, need to be on the lookout for in the name of \\"national security\\". The political propaganda used by Big Brother is quite relevant to that which our own political parties push on us during elections (obviously to a lesser degree)."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is a book that can be talked about for hours and hours. This book compells the mind to think about where society is heading. It is amazing to find the many similarities between this book and today. Although 1984 is an exageration of reality, it still hold a certain significance.The book follows a man named Winston, who is a man that works inside the government that. Winston is a smart man that knows how things run and knows what is going on, but this knowledge puts him in danger, for \\"Big Brother is watching\\"1984 is one of my favorite books because of how hard it makes you think and the many different ways you can think about it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A true classic that transcends the boundaries of time, generation, global power distribution, and world culture.With every passing day its pinch is more real. Everytime Fox News does Big Brother speak to control my thoughts while I watch my projection tv, everytime I hear Pink Floyd's Another Brick in the Wall, everytime a non-lobbying blogger is incarcerated, and everytime a new country in the world is branded a regime or evil based on Big Brother's agenda; I think about this book, and my heart skips a beat.What's interesting is that futurists of our era, who have written great classics with dated titles such as 1984 (also. 2001: a space odyssey) have erred on the aggressive side. Amazing as their insights and trend projections might be decades ago, humans do not live up to the pace of projected progress (or decay). Contrary to what Alvin Toffler would have us believe! :-)"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"With American politics trying to become big brother this classic tale of a bleak future looks more and more spot on.

Orwell projects a totalitary and brutal world. The world has become a totalitary nightmare. The government and its leader Big Brother control their citizens with an iron fist and a heart of steel. Everybody is being watched every second of the day were ever they might be.The main character of the book, Winston Smith, has felt a feeling in the back of his mind his whole life. He has always felt that something is wrong, there is something in his society is not the way Big Brother claims.On a deeper level 1984 is not about a single person, it's about a society, a dictatorship more totalitarian then anyone might have imagined. 1984 is one of our times most discussed and quoted books. How come? First of all it's a brilliant descriptions of the hitting similarities between fascism and communism even thought the ideas are different the product those ideologies being with them are always dictatorship and oppression.Up until 1984 there was a saying all over the world. When a state or government did something to control or supervise citizens people said \\"This is like 1984\\", it became a expression.In my opinion 1984 is one of the best books ever, mostly for its extremely hitting critic towards society. Certainly the book is written in a past time, but still it tells us something about today society. George ORwells nightmare during the forties is alarmingly much like the world today.Even if you look past the society critic, 1984 is still a very good book. Orwell is in my opinion a master when it comes to describing environments and persons. The half sci-fi environment feels as realistic as anything I have ever read.At last, some words of wisdom. George Orwell have been quoted many times, this is one of his more famous quotes from 1984, think about it fore a moment.\\" - Political language - and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists - is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.\\"./ Jakobs Erik DanielssonGagnef,Sweden"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell's tale of a society where not only behaviour, but also thought is controlled, seems to grow ever more relevant as the years pass and new technologies of surveillance emerge. 1984's concept of \`Big Brother' has passed into everyday use, and the \`telescreens' used not just to broadcast, but to watch people, increasingly appear throughout the real-world society in the form of surveillance cameras. Whilst the totalitarian governments of \`Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia' depicted by Orwell may seem to have passed (in the majority), his general sense of helplessness, as expressed through both the protagonist Winston, and the oppressive atmosphere, is as relevant today as during the years of the Cold War. A timeless and enduring tale that will remain relevant and controversial well into the future, despite being set in the past."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Written in 1948, George Orwell saw the trends in society that he felt would lead to an over-bearing government who traps the minds and lives of all of its citizens in the near future of 1984. Orwell switched 1948 to 1984, but his future society is an eerily accurate portrayal of the future that is more 2006 than he could ever really have feared.In 1984, there was a lackluster film of the same name that tried to capture the paranoia and the futuristic evil society. The film failed, but Monty Python alum Terry Gilliam fortunately brought us his brilliant version in his 1985 film \\"Brazil\\", which was originally titled \\"1984 and 1/2\\". The story is the same premise as Orwell's 1984, and is a must see for those who enjoy the book.I also recommend the equally inspired book/film combinations of Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" and \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" by Anthony Burgess. These movies are just as powerful as the books. But by no mean should you miss out on reading the books in favour of the films!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Many readers will love the way that Orwell is able to paint a vivid if bleak picture of the futre of London. In this masterpiece of dystopian literature, you will find yourself questioning everything that happens in the book. From the perceived reality to the altered history, it is difficult to tell what is real and what is planned. This is also the brilliance of the book since you are able to feel as Winston does, never quite sure what the Truth is. For those that are fans of dystopian lit and even casual readers, 1984 will grip you from the beginning until the ultimate end."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"There is nothing that I can add to the cacaphony of praise and reverance for this book. I won't really try, other than to say that it seems to me that the story in 1984 is so compelling and the scenary and mood are so masterfully described that I think that the reader can miss the fact that this is (a) fiction and (b) it is fiction written so well that you almost forget about the writing and enter the world itself. As a piece of creative art, this is extremely well done. I'll add a little to the chorus that 1984 describes a world (or at least a political unit) that could exist and has and does exist to some extent on Earth. It's not America - otherwise we'd be arrested for participating in this forum; but it does bear clear resemblance to the Communist regimes that arouse in Orwell's day. Of course, those regimes were too heavy to support themselves for long. Perhaps that is the 'unbelievable' part of 1984, that a totalitarian regime has the stamina and resources to so control it's subjects that even the past can be erased and every single citizen can be monitored inside and out - and individually tortured and reprogrammed as needed.I am not an Orwell student, but it seems to me that Orwell may have had a personal struggle with grasping the concepts of reality and truth. The thread that runs through 1984 is the control of the Party over history and thus over reality. We see Winston Smith broken down to believe that things he saw and knew in fact never really happened, and that, if he was told so, that 2 plus 2 equals 5. Orwell takes Smith to a nightmarish place where the only thing that you can really know for certain is the thing that is right in front of your face, and even then you may be mistaken. Caeser and Charlemagne and the lack of hot water in your shower and the misery in your mind are not really there unless the Party says so - and how can you say otherwise? I suspect that Orwell dwelt in a place a little like that. What did he struggle with? Ethics? Economics? God?Anyway, great story, beautiful descriptive fiction, and thought-provoking premises. Add to that the gifts to our cultural lexicon of \\"thoughtcrime\\" and \\"Big Brother\\" and \\"Newspeak\\" and even the title itself (a year now more than two decades in the past), and you've got yourself a classic that must be read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell (Eric Arthur Blair) was born in 1903 in India, a part of the British Empire. His father worked in the Indian Civil Service. His family was part of the British middle class and could send Eric Blair for education at Eton, a famous public school in England. After Eton, Eric joined the Indian Imperial Police and he served five years in Burma. He resigned in 1927 as he disliked the political system which treated other races as inferior. He also wanted to concentrate on being a writer.Eric Blair decided to move away from the relatively privileged and pleasant life of the middle class and join the working class. He, therefore, changed his name to George Orwell. He then went to live with the poor in London and Paris, whom he considered to be victims of injustice. He wrote the book \\"Down and Out in Paris and London' in an attempt to educate the wealthy class about the life which poor people lived.In \\"1984\\", George Orwell continues on his theme of exposing the lie about the life under dictatorship and draws attention to it. He was able to detect fraud and dishonesty in the world of politics. He wanted to expose the lies and contradictions in politics. He exposes the sense of injustice, an exposition of the way a political system can suppress individual thought and emotion and how man can behave in inhuman ways towards other people.The author writes about a basic lie (in his opinion0 in which an imaginary England of 1984 was based on. The Party (a one party state) emphasised that there was no such thing as objective truth but that everything could be changed. The Party could, for instance, change the past at a moment's notice.Winston Smith is a member of the Party, which constitutes a small percentage of the population. He works at the Ministry of Truth and his job is in the Records Department of the Ministry. His job is to manipulate records at the whims of the Party. In writing \\"1984\\", George Orwell aims at exposing the inhuman nature of political oppression.Orwell published \\"1984\\" in 1949, a year before he died. He was very ill during the time he was writing and this partly explains why the book is so gloomy. The book is recommended reading for those who want to understand the nature of political oppression and manipulation and those that wish to understand the evil nature of dictatorship."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read George Orwell's classic 1984 in High School, as a summer reading project. I still have that dog-eared and worn book sitting somewhere in my library, and I refer to it or quote from it quite often. It is haunting and horrifying. I both love it and hate it; in many ways, I believe that is the reaction Orwell wanted a reader to have when he or she put down the book, having read those four, final words (for those who've read the book, and understand it, you know exactly what I mean). I remember asking a friend of mine in that high school what books she had read for the summer. 1984 was on her list as well, and she hated it: she claimed it was depressing, that it was too dark, too dismal. That she didn't think it could happen. To that idea, and to others who would argue the same thing, I say that it is SUPPOSED to be dark, and depressing, and dismal. It is supposed to horrify you, to grab you and tear you from one revelation to the next, and to finally make you realize, through the conversion of the most average man in the world (Winston Smith, the protaganist), that any person in the world can be made into a machine, and learn to love it.(...)One can walk away from this book with many different feelings on it: Orwell's predictions and fears leave a reader with so many ways of interpreting his prose. One can, and should, be horrified and sick to one's stomach at Smith's surrender to blissful ignorance. Personal freedom and thought, sex, love, honor, and hope are all crushed beneath a government that wants to reduce humanity to worker ants. The Party promises a future in the image of a boot stamping on a human face for all eternity. Reading this book, one immedietly begins to look upon the rest of the world, and begins to see how dangerously close to Orwell's fears humanity has come.Wonderfully written, with incredible complexity (he did, after all, make up his very own language--NEWSPEAK-- to prove his points), and full of imagery that only furthers the sense of hopelessness and hollowness that makes up the theme of the book, this book is simply incredible. Love it. Hate it. Fear it. Read it. It is, without question, one of the great classics of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is an awesome book! It changed my life. It will change yours."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book, which was George Orwell's basic predicitions for what to come can have many different meanings. It all depends on you, the reader. Not only does it make you wonder if your trapped, or in a totaltarism kind of the world, but it then makes you think your glad your not. (or are we?) I'm only a teenager, but I have a tendency to question authority. This is one of the best books I have ever read. 1984 is filled with intellectual thoughts and ideas. Youi will definitly NOT regret reading this book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Why are you even spending time to read reviews of this book. Any educated individual should read this masterpiece. What a book, what an ending, what does our future really hold?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"What simpleton compares &quot;1984&quot; to &quot;Brave New World?&quot;New World is a simple morality tale about a world forced into conspicuous consumption. Yawn. 1984 is the frightening tale of a future gone awry, and a brutal government well aware of its intention to maintain power at all cost.We follow Winston, an editor with an odd job, rewriting history. Wiston is forced to &quot;double think&quot; his way through a life he knows is contrived to forever remain stagnant.As Winston ponders the present, the war weary remains of Oceania's capital, London, he is forced to deal with memories of a very different past - and he fails to reconcile the two.Orwell's eye is a magic thing. A reporter at heart, his eye for detail in fiction and reportage is awesome. While reading 1984, one feels Orwell IS Winston, in his head and in his world. With any imagination it becomes easy to allow 1984 to become real, and Winston's desperation your own.Orwell side steps silly sci-fi detail (that dopey Huxley embraces too readily. What is it with all the helicopters in &quot;Brave New World,&quot; anyway?)and creates a desperate world that, though written 50 years ago, seems perfectly plausible now.This chilling masterpiece is a must read for anyone who ponders the delicate balance of power and politics. More so, this dark tome considers the loss of individuality in an increasing global society. At first blush, it is easy to dismiss 1984 as completely off the mark, but after some consideration, one is forced to concede that maybe nothing here is really improbably.A must read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is THE most depressing book I have ever read. It's just so hopeless. It actually made me CRY at the end. It's a really good insight into collectivism and totalitarianism. Just an all around good book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"More relevant than ever over 50 years after it was written.It is more frightening than any Steven King novel because this is where we are heading if we are not vigilant. Too many on the left are still hellbent in plunging us into a worldwide Orwellian nightmare. Just observe their obsessive Orwellism, where aggressors are defenders and defenders are aggressors, where justice is injustice and injustice is justice, where war is peace and peace is war, where freedom fighters are terrorists and terrorists are freedom fighters, and with its total lack of interest in facts and truth. Despite the chilling socio-political warning the book still shows us an endearingly poignant portrayal of humanity and love struggling to survive in totalitarian society which will not stop at anything to stamp out all that is good and compassionate. Next time you hear anyone refer to anything disparagingly as 'borgeois' think of the alternative to love,honour,fair play and all the noble things that some brand 'bourgeois' and therefore plan to destroy"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The book takes the manifestation of totalitarianism to the worst imaginable degree. George Orwell described a world where people are constantly under surveillance by its totalitarian government. By employing two-way televisions and police in civilian clothes, the government monitors people's behavior, deed, and most frighteningly - their minds. No individualism is permitted, and anyone who remotely opposes the government will somehow be caught and completely distroyed.The idea of the book is as far-fetched as it is realistic. That's what's so haunting about the book. The described totalitarian practices may seem absolutely impossible, while when compared to the world we live in, we see more eerie resemblences than not. Moreover, the writing itself was splendid. The descriptions were so vivid that you literally feel yourself a persecuted citizen of the world described.On the negative end, perhaps in an effort to accentuate the point of atrocity of the negative utopia described, the author employed too much descriptions and time on the actual persecution process. The descriptions were grotesque at some points that you really have to have the stomach for it. My advice is, read it, but read it in small dosages. I read the second half of the book in one day, and was gravely depressed for three hours after I finished."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Growing up, I didn't read many books purely out of interest (most were school-assigned), but 1984 is one of the first I ever chose to read. I could not put it down. So much more than a fantasy or a sci-fi tale, it is so real. It says the ironic truths that governments throughout history were afraid to admit. Containing a language within a language (Newspeak) and a book within a book (Goldstein's book), I can't possibly regard anyone as being a literary genius above Orwell. He plays with readers' minds, turns truths inside out, and turns paradoxes into perfect sense like no one else. Reading this book will make you a lot less naive about the world. After reading 1984 and Animal Farm, I will surely read everything else Orwell has written too."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"What an amazing book. It is much better book than both We and Brave New World. Besides, Emanuel Goldstein is the greatest!!!!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Winston Smith is a pitiful lead character, yet we doubtlessly empathize with him and feel his infinite despair. His destitute disenfranchisement from any semblance of normality is not only shocking and frightening, it is downright abominable. I would hate to spoil this ingenious book for anyone, so I will refrain from dissecting the ending. However, I must say that it did leave an immensely pungent taste in my mouth - as is intended.1984 is as potent as it is mesmerizing. It is infinitely unique as there is no other book quite like it, albeit Brave New World is strikingly similar. Two Minutes of Hate is classic. Who cannot appreciate the ThoughtPolice, DoubleTalk, DoubleSpeak, and the many other Orwellian words that have been firmly implanted in the English language? 1984 could very well be the most profoundly provocative work of the 20th Century. 1984 projects an appalling, yet veritable premonition in lieu of our continually decreasing civil liberties. Highly recommended by this humble reviewer. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The power of Orwell's writing comes from the ideas expressed therein, not from the characterization or the quality of the writing. Orwell's characters in this novel are crafted of the finest cardboard, the writing is crafted of the finest of didactic lead, but the ideas therein are important -- because they are prophetic of what 2004 could be, and what 2003 may be becoming, if the current leadership of our country has its way."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"If you read one book in your life this one should be it. I read this back in the 7th grade(I am in college now) and I cannot say how much I appreciated this book. From the expansive sci-fi in it to the vocabulary words to represent the society... this is a work of art.If you haven't read this book... read it. If you have read this book, then read it again."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 has some of the most powerful images of totalitarian authority and lasting depictions of a world devoid of moral structure -- of any work from the 20th century. Yet, the greatest contribution of Orwell to our present day is his critique of language and it's effects via his fiction.As O'Brian says to Winston \\"You're not very good at metaphysics.\\" If you want to understand the philosophical ramifications of relativism this book is a great place to start or, if you read it in a literature class a while ago and currently have an interest in ethology, deontology, aretology, moral philosophy and ontology, a must read - again.Morality can only be viewed as a positive, yet even now our language has begun to be distorted by subjective interpretations of our words. Example: Do we have a positive moral structure or a negative moral structure? -- There is only one *moral* structure. This book lays out the frame work of a society engineered on the basis of definition control. Vocabulary is perverted to serve the machine.This is the world we can choose to create or destroy."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Walter Cronkite said that this story has ..&quot;a power that seems to grow rather than lessen with the passage of time.&quot;This story is even more relevant today than it ever was. If you want to understand today's events and where we might be going- READ THIS BOOK! Any thinking person will see the relevance, all of those less cerebral should still take the time and either read or listen to the audio verion of this story.I simply cannot emphasize enough how vital a part of your personal library this book should become."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Big Brother is watching and I don't mean the reality tv series. This book is not only an interesting read, it also holds a deeper meaning. It is a window through which the possible dangers of communism/socialism in the extreme can be viewed. A comparison can also be made to Plato's idea of a utopia.This book makes one question the validity of our own past and reality as we know it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I will start off by saying that if you have not read George Orwell's &quot;1984,&quot; then you have missed out on one of the true masterpieces of English literature. The ideas presented here have become so essential a part of Western society that phrases such as &quot;Big Brother is watching&quot; and &quot;Orwellian doublethink&quot; have become forever incorporated into our vocabulary.&quot;1984&quot; is above all a commentary on the social and very human forces that drive authoritarianism. At every step the role of human nature, a nature which is at times so independent and yet at other times obedient, is explored in multiple facets. What motivates us as social beings? What creates the need for control? How do we, beings whose ultimate love and need is freedom, become acquiescent in authoritarian governments? Orwell answers all of these questions with amazing clarity and directness. He convinces us with his powerful vision of the &quot;future&quot; that human fragility and human strength are two sides of the same coin. Without one the other cannot exist.The issues raised in &quot;1984&quot; are extremely valid today. In the terrible aftermath of September 11th, Americans, as lovers and upholders of liberty, have been eager to protect these most valued keepsakes. Yet this protection comes at the expense of freedom, the ultimate goal, with greater government surveillance and control over the lives of innocents. Thus we face the classic dilemma of &quot;1984,&quot; as puzzling a problem today as it was then. All we can hope is that as individuals we do not face the same fate as the protagonist, whom we last see proclaiming his love for Big Brother."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Wow is the first phrase that came to my mind after finishing this book. It is one of the best I have ever read and certainly my favorite read over the last year. I am sure everyone knows the plot by now so I will not rehash. But I knew the general plot beforehand i.e. \\"Big Brother\\" and the thought police, and I was STILL overwhelmed by 1984. Orwell's writing makes you keep coming back for more, always eager to find out how the current situation will turn out, and what will happen next. Besides the sketch of a tyrannical government using mass propaganda to literally brainwash its citizens, Orwell also shows how powerless the ordinary citizen becomes, how much trouble must be gone through to engage in illegal conduct, and how brutal the aftermath of getting caught is. And the love story, which I expected to be the weakest part of the book, is actually fascinating and heartbreaking. A Must-Read if there ever was one!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"No matter what happens in the world this book continues to provide us with warnings. With the coming of Homeland Security we should be ever watchful that the small liberties we enjoy aren't taken away. Orwell writes of a world in which the masses have been deemed weak and harmless, while the intellegent have been brainwashed and those that aren't are vaporized.With the government asking our country's truckers, toll booth collectors, garbagemen, etc, to bascially spy on the population and report any out of the ordinary occurrences this book once again proves how on the money Orwell was."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"&quot;Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four.&quot;In the world depicted in this powerful novel, the use of logic is prohibited. Citizens are required to follow the Party's ideas, believe the Party's lies, hate the Party's enemies, rejoice at the Party's victories. If the Party contradicts itself (which is common), the members are forbidden to ask questions, but to follow blindly, as sheep led to slaughter. Big Brother perfected what the Communists only dreamed of -- absolute obedience, total loyalty to a cruel master. Even simple human emotions are discouraged.What a perfect setting for a love story! Of course, there is romance entwined into the precise fibers of 1984, but the novel is not a love story. It's a society story, a political story. A story of human existence, if you will. This is a story about an eternal food chain. Though Winston's story is not the message, one grows to love him for endeavors to understand his twisted world.I read this book after hearing about it for many years. People will hear of it for many years to come, no doubt. The main message of the novel leaves the reader reeling, suddenly needing some time to reflect. Questions arise in the reader's mind: What holds our society together? What keeps Communism from working in reality? Could this ever happen?As a citizen of the US for all of my 17 years, I have come to value my freedom more after reading 1984. I'm thankful to live here where I can do pretty much anything I please, instead of Orwell's imaginary Oceania, where imagining committing a crime could land you several months of torture at &quot;The Ministry of Love&quot;.I can say for certain that this book isn't in my high school's literature curriculum. It should be. If we could learn to appreciate our liberty while we are young, the US would be a much better place."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A frightening look at what might have happened at the end of World War II, &quot;1984&quot; provides a fascinating look at a fictional society that is the PERFECT dictatorship. The Party is all-knowing, its citizens under complete control, and the truth is subject to the party's wishes. It would be impossible to overthrow the Party. A very disturbing book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is skillfully written, intrusting, and entertaining. It is not a difficult read, but is not oversimplified in its language, and despite being written in 1949 the story and language do not seam dated (this, I consider it worth noting is the opinion of a high school student, who read this book voluntarily, rather than for school.) The books image of life in a society, that is an example of a communist society as it is most commonly perceived, though is certainly not a society that follows the equality based principals of communism (no 'communist' nation ever has). The story, in summery, is definitely worth reading, and I would recommend it to anyone over the age of 14. (Worth is that I read, and liked, Animal farm, though I do not consider it to be nearly so good a book as 1984. I would recommend that to anyone as young as 12, due to the simplicity of its language."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is the best book I have ever read. The storyline is supurb; there is suspence, pleasure and even horrer. Although you may not expect it, 1984 is quite scary and it plays with your mind. It gets you thinking things like; &quot;what if the world was like this.&quot; and &quot;How horrible it must be to live like that.&quot; at the end it made me want to cry, shout and screem all at the same time. I have made everyone in my class read it and I give you some advise- READ 1984; THE BEST BOOK EVER!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Winston Smith is a normal person in 1984. Constantly being monotored by a telescreen, he cannot do anything against the government, or the thought police will arrest him. His little hidden betrayals to the Party soon transform into a conspiracy. He knows inside him some day he will be caught and killed. Winston knows the Party is wrong, but cannot prove it. Maybe he is wrong, and the Party is right? The book is wonderful, and could very well open your eyes to what the government could be doing behind our backs. Winston is led to believe that he has a memory disorder that causes him to believe events that never happened have happened. The reader is led to believe that Winston is right, and is perfectly sane. Some slogans that seem to be oxymorons make perfect sense. &quot;WAR IS PEACE&quot; &quot;FREEDOM IS SLAVERY&quot; and &quot;IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH&quot; are a few. This book will have a very big impact on you, and your view of the world."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"reading this book wasn't a lot of fun, but it was good for me. It's a classic for a reason, and should be required reading not necessarily for high school students, but at least for frosh/soph college students. The scenario is extreme and highly unlikely, but serves as a good and fair warning from an age when totalitarianism was a frighteningly real threat to humanity. If you haven't read it, pick up a copy - it's cheap, and it'll do you good."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 was one of the best and most thought provoking books I have ever read.

But you know, sometimes a book is just a book and there is no hidden meaning. Winston loves Julia and Julia loves Winston. I hate it when teachers and &quot;experts&quot; try to get you to see the &quot;meaning&quot; behind the book. What if it's just a fictional story about a man who lives in a future world where people live in fear of being found out and he falls in love with a woman? I won't give away the ending. I only gave it 4 stars because some parts of the book are a bit tedious...especially when Orwell(Blair) begins to tell you things that you know you read not 30 pages earlier. Just remember it's a love story...and a good one at that."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The book is not only well written but, in my opinion, an accurate picture of where the world is headed. Although parts may get a bit confusing, if you plow through those parts it all makes sense in the end. A bold and daring novel written as fiction but parts may be frighteningly real when you look around you at our current society. I recommend it to everyone but specifically those who are either paranoid or totally detest the way our society behaves."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The book was scary! It woke me up about the governments absolute power. It is a scary, story about the geovernment controlling its entire population. Telescreens follow and record every movement, speaking to you if you are doing something wrong. It will scare you every word you read. I would recomend reading it, if you would like nightmares, about the government controlling you. Every foot step, &quot;Big Brother is Watching You&quot;. WAR IS PEACE, FEEDOM IS SLAVERY, IGNORANCE IS STRENGH. The thought police enforce the crimes that Big Brother makes. If you are involved in a thought crime, you will first disappear from the population, and you will never be heard of again. They government brings you to their jail, and it involves severe gang beatings, and tortures. Everybody works for the government, but their job descriptions are faint. On what exactly the do, Winston(main character) gets a list of names, and is told to delete them off the computer, but he does not know what for. He deletes everyones name and erases their past. The beginning gets off to a slow start, but it is well worth the ending. It wraps the whole book up. Giving the total image of the governments power."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's classic &quot;1984&quot; is thought proviking and has not lost any relevance since the collapse of the Soviet Union. When the book was written, people were just learning about the pros and cons of Communism (I'm not going to make any political statements in this review.) Arguably, the book reached its prime in the cold war era, but it still as relevant as Orwell's other essays such as &quot;Shooting an Elephant&quot;, which, athough it dealt with British imperialism, is still very relevant when applied to other reigons of the world. The protagonist in this story shows the futility of rebelling against a totalitarian state when advanced to this level. I thought that the story makes a strong point even though the events in the story are not probable to occour in the near future. I personally am a big fan of negative utopias (&quot;We&quot; by Zamyatin is very good, don't waste your time with &quot;Brave New World&quot; by Huxley) because they show the human's primal desire to live and be free in a very raw manner. The policy of never creating martyrs for opposition really struck a chord within me. I have read this book at least five times and have come to appreciate it greatly. It probably is my favorite book, second only to The Brothers Karmozov."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"En 1984 Orwell nos dibuja un panorama asolador.

One need look only to the Russian Revolution and Russia under the rule of Stalin to see that such events are possible. There are very close parallels between Stalinist Russia and 1984. Josef Stalin is much like Big Brother. Once he has sighted opposition to him or intellect, he erases that person from existence. This happened thousands upon thousands of times in Russia while Stalin was in control. The people in 1984 live life much like the peasants in Russia. They get meager rations of tasteless food, if they get any at all. One more parallel between the two is that the torture chambers of Big Brother are much like that of the Gulags of Stalin. Society should take examples from history to prevent the world from turning into the one in 1984. It seems to me that this book is a warning to society. Examine the past, learn from it, and control the future. It is fortunate that Stalinist Russia came to and end when he died. Next time, the world may not be so lucky."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In 1984, Everything you do, everywhere you go can be detected an analysed.

The mutual trust between Winston and the man he trusted and how it was broken, and the pain he suffered more mentally than physically really make you think. After reading this book, I am sure you will be pondering its agenda and reality for time to come, and you will learn to think of your own life and freedom.I recommend also &quot;Animal Farm&quot; by George Orwell Also an excellent look at communism."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It is hard to belive that a totalitarian government can happen, People say it can't, but in truth it has. George Orwell's book has almost in a cense read the future. Take what happened in Stazi Germany, it is identical. And i belive that anyone who can guess at the future like that and be so right is deserving of some complement. And for the people out there who think that the readers of this book are all paranoied they are wrong. Read this book and then take a look around, how close are we really?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's masterpiece, 1984, is a thoroughly astonishing look at a dystopian future- a &quot;negative utopia&quot; where free thought is a crime punishable by death. Winston Smith, an allusion both to Winston Churchill and to the common man (Smith being the most common English last name), is a member of the Outer Party of the Republic of Oceania, and lives in London. His job is the rewriting of past records for the further glorification of &quot;Big Brother&quot;, a figurehead that has come to be synonomous with any activity of invasion of privacy by our own government. Stripped of the simplest rights, like the right to free speech or the right to record any events or possess any records of the past, 1984 is the story of Winston's struggle to overturn both Big Brother and the ideas that he stands for. This book won't fail to impress, nor to depress- thoroughly sad at many different levels."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Fantastic!!

It covers areas such as privacy, alteration of the english language and freedom of thought. As the government in 1984 used Ingsoc to alter the meaning of words and limit them to total neutrality, so do the mondern day politicaly correct. The alteration of language is an alteration of thought and it is wrong. I recommend the book &quot;Straight and Crooked Thinking&quot; by T.H.

Well that's your problem and it shouldn't affect your review of a book, that's like a film critic who doesn't like comedies giving a comedy a bad review for that reason.

It's been on my list for 7 years and I'm so glad I finally got around to reading it.The beginning of the book drags, but sets the tone for all that happens towards the middle and end. If you that can get through ther first 60-70 pages, you'll fly through the last 150-200. Julia was my favorite character and the way Orwell set up the first sexual encounter with her and Winston was a stroke of genius. I think my heart stopped when they were in their secret bedroom and got caught. I was waiting for them to get caught, but it happened so suddenly I got caught off balance. The action tails off towards the end but by that time the story has the reader so engrossed the end is like a carrot on a string."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Anyone notice that 1984 has already occured? Not the date, I mean, but big brother did come already. In Maoist China, in the 50s.

Powerful, very moving, amazing book. the movie is a terrible disappointment because it focused on the visual: the nudity and trysts. this has too many metaphors, literally, the movie was overkill."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"It takes a lifetime to read this book. It's packed with symbolism and meaning. Few people will be able to absorb it all in one reading. Probably one of the Top Ten greatest literary works of all time.

It should be required reading for everyone who wants to live in a free society."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read this book when I was 13 and couldn't put it down.

It was actually quite good."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984. It was a year, and it is also a book. The book is a classic. You cannot finish high school without reading it. And why is it considered a classic? For the creepy window it gives us on what the future may be. And like all disturbing images of the future, people are now convinced it is coming true.As is the case with many other modern classics, as time goes by, people are absolutely convinced that the situation is getting worse, and that slowly, slowly we are moving towards a totalitarian universe like there is in \\"1984\\". What I think is that with so many people reading the book, we'll stay farther away from the disturbing image Orwell (or Blair, more accurately) painted for us.\\"1984\\" can't really be summed up, but it's pretty simple, when you think about it. Totalitarian state. No freedom, even in your head. Methods of brain-washing. Constant propaganda. It's as freedom-less as you can get. And in this state you have a few people who try to fight back, but by this time it's practically impossible.I both liked and disliked this book. I think that it's definitely creepy and good, but on the other hand, there were many parts that were simply too boring. As someone who has managed to survive through the great unabridged classics (think War and Peace, The Count of Monte Cristo, etc.), having twenty pages of \\"1984\\" be unreadable was an incredible failure on the writer's part. There were parts that did not have to be as boring as they were. Honestly, the plot is a bit flimsy too. The love story isn't exactly a love story, but more of a passion story. I happened to enjoy the second half of the book much more, where it all starts to make sense and become clear how the government has so much power.If you want me simply to tell you what the book is about, I can't. It's not exactly describable. You have to read it to understand. You shouldn't trust other people's opinions either. Everyonoe thinks differently in regards to this book. You have to read it to find out, and you HAVE to read it.On the other hand, if all you're looking for is the \\"anti-utopia\\" book, go for the much better, much more interesting \\"Brave New World\\". \\"Brave New World\\" follows the same concepts (though it preceded \\"1984\\"), but is written in a much easier manner and is a superb book. Read THAT first, and then move on to here.I recommend you read this book. While it's not superb, it's the sort of book everyone needs to read. It is informative, slightly creepy near the end, and very powerful at the end. It does its job, showing us what the world may be like if we don't take care of it. It's a must read, but beware of some boring parts."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"this book was unstoppable!i couldnt put it down.i suddenly felt like i was being watched from everywhere just like the folks in the book.ive read it twice.the 1st time i was on winstons side but i learned to love big brother by the time i was done the 2nd time.big brother is watching!writer george orwell gets a lot of props for \\"animal farm\\" but this ones way better!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In Erich Fromm's afterward, he says: the book is about the near despair of the future of man and the warning that unless the course of history changes men will become soulless automatons.A fascinating read, Orwell keeps the pages turning. The story focuses on a man of the \\"party\\" who starts questioning big brother.It's where Nazism left off.Orwell concocts a new dictionary-language, called \\"newspeak\\"; the melding of words, a simplistic speech that controls the masses. It is now the world of the thought police, there watching you; a totalitarian rule, be mindful who you choose to associate with; the \\"party\\" is always monitoring your moves and your conversations; a world war that never ceases; a time where anything is legal and nothing is; total power will be the only pleasure.In reality the story is a bit ridiculous, how could a country function or survive. It is obvious the book should not be taken seriously, but read as a warning. There are still amazing insights that closely resemble the future, now. Compare it to the war were fighting and the \\"new world order\\" arising.There are many reasons why this book is quoted, but may I interject one thought on this? Could not the thinking be: that the materials used for war could be used to uplift the poor out of poverty. They would then have the insight that the rich have, hence bettering society, an equality. The thing is, we are not equal.\\"Double think\\" is already here. The holding of two contradictory beliefs. This coined by Orwell."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Im a big fan of Anti-Utopias and this is arguably the best in the genre. Orwell takes you on a journey of Hope and dispare, love and betrayal. while this is a great story what kept me reading is that this book is very well written and I couldnt wait to pick it up again and read on. If you are interested in books of this type, books like \\"Men like Gods\\"-HG Wells, and \\"Brave New World\\"-A Huxley are also excelent. For a little Harder read try \\"Utopia\\"-T Moore The language is a little difficult and with out understanding the latin and greek humor it is still an excellent story."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell goes into extreme detail and outlines, with vivid detail, life in Oceania. The thought of 24 hour monitoration and all aspects of the 'Party' are not as far-fetched as one would think. This novel is scary in its possibility and will leave the reader thinking."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I heard so much about this book before I read it that I kind of thought it pointless to actually read - but I was mistaken - this book has so many levels on which it can be enjoyed - not just the obvious reasons! The ties to modern society are fairly obvious - especially the idea that one can be watched at all times (sattellite imagery). The overall idea, however, is that it is hopeless to change a system that is based in such fundamental deception. It makes us ponder our own fate and how much control we actually have over our lives. When people know what your deepest thoughts are your deepest fears they have power over you..."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Did George Orwell actually believe that in the year 1984 the world would resemble the chilling, bleak vision he portrays in this novel ? This is a truly engaging work because it's a cautionary tale speaking strongly against Fascism, Communism and Totalitarianism that Orwell saw rise in his time during World War II. Orwell's characer Winston- drawn from Winston Churchhill-is a British man living in Oceania, which is presumably the UK or the West, is a working-class stiff slaving away in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth, which ironically specializes in destroying the truth and giving it an illusion of truth through re-editing. The official language is a mutated English, Newspeak, that is so incredibly condensed it's purpose is to eliminate elaborate and intelligent thought! Instead of saying thinsg like evil they use \\"ungood\\", instead of using the whole word Ministry of Peace they say Minipax. Winston secretly loathes the stifling and totalitarian world he lives in. The empowered Party, headed by a fictitious Big Brother, is constantly monitoring everyone's thoughts, and urging families to spy on one another. Eventually, Winston falls for Julia, a rebellious girl from the supposedly virginal Anti-Sex League. But Julia is no virgin and has engaged in sexual relationships with even members of the Party. However, because they fall in love with each other and are against the institution of the Party, they are punished through torture and seperated. The story is well-written, with enough description and character development, particularly that of Winston and his enemy, the wicked Party pawn O'Brien who works in the Ministry of Truth. O'Brien's character is devilish and cynical, a man who represents devotion to the Party and its system of mind control. They have everyone so subjugated that they believe one plus one is four if the Party says so. What is the theme of 1984 ? If we are not careful in preserving civil liberties and maintaining strong democratic systems, we will live as close to this nightmarish world as possible."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Though the novel does drag when you read tracts from the conspiracy's manual, I found the novel to be rather enjoyable. The idea of how the world would be shaped and for what reasons was interesting, and the narrator was able to lead the reader into the world and allow the reader to be engulfed into things.The end was well done, and it was a good closure to the work. The character does not die, but he is changed. Indeed, he awakens to thye doctrine of the state and accepts it. Yeah, he has been tortured and brainwashed, but he does not give in under that torture, though seeds are definitely laid.If you have the time and you like depressing books about totalitarian states that try to stamp out individual thought and reason, go ahead and pick this book up. If you want something lighter though, I would try to find something else."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I would never have come to the conclusion that Nineteen Eighty-Four was going to be as it was - frightening, thought provoking and ultimately distressing. To think that a work of fiction from the 1940s could so accurately discribe elements of life today is amazing, and almost unheard of.This book speaks about a guy by the name of Winston Smith. He seems like a pretty cool guy in the story in the story. He started out with thoughtcrime. He graduates through a series of misdemeanors and even plans to overthrow the government that took him in as an orphan.It is a book that makes you aware because your every move is watched and where the media is controlled. This book has it's own language, a twisted corruption of English, which can in part be seen today. It is easy to imagine that a camera is on you all the time, that people can look inside your head. This book makes you wonder about things like that. Like what if somebody can come into my mind and read my thoughts and what if somebody is watching me all the time and I never sat down to think about this. To me the book was very good I think if you just give it time and really get into the book you would really enjoy yourself. It is kind of scary, but hey so is life."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The book 1984 is quite simply one of the best books that I have read, period. The book was written by George Orwell (real name Eric Arthur Blair) short after World War 2. Similar to myself, Orwell fought in a war as a Sergeant for the British Army. According to Orwell that purpose of the book was to \\"to alter other people's idea of the kind of society they should strive after.\\" With that goal in mind, I believe that Orwell did a wonderful job in constructing a society that would definately alter any idea about a totalitarian society.The reader is introduced to Winston Smith who is a citizen in the imaginary super-state of Oceania (present-day Great Britian and the Americas). Under the strict totalitrian rule of Big Brother (the \\"ruler\\" of Oceania) Smith becomes increasingly anxious about \\"being a human being.\\" The novel follows his journey to overthrow life (and government) as he knows it, in his quest to become a human being.In the book, Orwell does a wonderful job of introducing his character and creating the surrealistic world of 1984. One would guess that is characters came from real life experiences as a working class individual under British Imperialism in his homeland of India. Orwell's ability to develop his characters leads the reader to sympathize with (or maybe hate) those in the novel. The characters are nicely placed under the all-seeing \\"Big Brother\\" and the reader does feel this tension throughout the story.The theme of is straight forward, as stated eariler Orwell want to paint a picture of what he believed might become of the different political and social organizations of his day. While the way Orwell presents his thoughts might seem outlandish at first, a through reading of the book does give the reader a erie feeling of the current political situation of America. For example, Orwell discusses the need for war to maintain society:\\"The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of humna labor. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent.\\"While the reader may disagree, Orwell understood all to well the function of \\"war\\" in our society. In addition, Orwell discusses \\"classism\\" and other relatively socio-political aspects of government formation in this novel. Within all of the different discussion of these things, Orwell still manages to produce a wonderfully entertaining story.While we have not (in America) reached a totalitarian state, the novel does present an erie allusion to the current state of the world. Nonetheless, I believe that this book is a must read for anyone who loves books. You definately will not be disappointed! Orwell's style makes this book an easy read and a highly intellectual lesson. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read this book about 25-30 years ago and it seemed so unrealistic back then. But---now children Do spy on their parents, and what is a fad if it's not dressing alike to an extent, and how about the schools now using uniforms, ie. dressing alike to know if you belong there, and oh yes.....Big Brother is watching us now---cameras at traffic lights, speed sensors on the interstates and turnpikes. Oh, and the news that the media prints isn't always true and isn't that &quot;history&quot;? This book does get tedious at times but it's definitely worth reading, I know I have thought about this book of fiction/fantasy off and on for the past few decades.

I too cried '1984' when the government tried to collect even more info on us.Shortly after Princess Diana's death, though, I read this book for a second time. I then realized that we have been looking for 'Big Brother' in all the wrong places. Big Brother isn't the collector of information, he is the controller of information. Who controls information today? The media. Compare Princess Diana's life to Winston's.Very good book. Well worth reading again as an informed adult. At least that is this proles opinion."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I wonder what people in the early 50s thought of Orwell's view of the future. They must have thought it unimaginable, but to the current reader it appears to be less and less bizarre.I thought the book was well written and exciting for the most part, but it started to really drag when Winston started reading &quot;the book&quot;. Overall I give 1984 three stars primarily because of the dragging toward end (I had to speed read some of it just to keep the pages turning), but also because the ending wasn't what I wanted--I can't fault him for that though.Good book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I have read 1984 many times. Each time that I have read it I come away with new insights to its pure genius. The very concept of 'DoubleThink' and 'NewSpeak' are not just literary devices in a great book, they are current trends that exist in todays world. In Americe, the land of the free, the insidious grip of Political Corectness has worked it's way through society. We have manged to criminalize words, because their meanings have been perverted by special intrest groups who have their own agendas. New words or terms have been formed to gradually herd people into new ways of thinking. We have a leader who by all indications has broken the laws of the country, the bonds of his marriage, and the basic morals that all people are expected to live be. Most anybody can recognize this yet at the same time cannot see where any wrong doing has taken place. A court appointed counsel has taken the form of Goldstein, where virtually every crisis and point of evil in the nation and possibly world has been blamed on him somehow. The internet has come into most peoples homes and office. A person cannot go anywher now without being watched by security cameras or electronically tracked at airports and by credit card transactions. It is 1998 now, but in many ways we are living in 1984. We just haven't looked up and noticed it yet."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"love this book, no problems on my kindle fire. amazon wants me to write more blah blah blah blah blah"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is a powerful book that I first read in high-school and like with most everything in school you don't fully appreciate until you are much much older. With that in mind I recently re-read this classic and was shocked and appalled how much of George Orwells dark and dreary vision has become a reality in our lives since my high school days.Winston the protagonist in this book is a low level party grunt working at the Ministry of Truth in a fictional London dedicated to scrub history books and records of inconvenient facts, such as who we are at war with and why to streamline history into lockstep with the ever changing party line. Orwell foresees technology that for his day was in its infancy and describes how this technology can be used to oppress people and that whoever controls the past will control the future (and present).Orwell Imagines a world in which every home has a two way 'television', that is used inbound to disseminate propaganda while at the same time allowing the thought police to check up on its citizens. Virtually every inch of his imaginary world is covered in listening and spying devices and even small deviations from the norm carry the death penalty. Winston's crime is to keep a journal to record his own version of history, this will ultimately bring down the thought police on him, who (SPOILER) captures, tortures and kills him, but not before breaking his spirit and making him love big brother and his henchman.The most striking thing about this book is that we can see almost all of Orwells more imaginative concepts come to life in our modern day society, not necessarily exactly the way the author envisioned them, but in a more subtle but no less disturbing way. One can't help to draw parallels between Orwells concept of thought crime and the political correctness movement that is doing its best - and succeeding in - making certain words unspeakable and by extension certain thoughts unthinkable. It's chilling to read a news article on how interest groups trying to change Mark Twains classic to strike a specific word from the book for school versions where it is appropriate in both the text as the context of the time it was written. The ministry of truth resides not as a specific location it rather resides with special interest groups fighting to revise history.The Internet - obviously unimaginable at the time - serves as a close and even more powerful parallel to the ever present surveillance in Orwells world, but instead of a government forcing us to be available (and surveillable) we willingly surrender our deepest emotions, private thoughts and actions to social media sites like Facebook and twitter where they are for sale to the highest bidder including our government.9/11 as global watershed moment has served as justification for more and more snooping and warrant less searches while our airports serve as testing ground on how much more privacy intrusion we are willing to take at one point. In the name of 'homeland security' we are living in fear of the boogie man, not Goldstein, but Osama Bin Laden and his band of Islamic terrorist serving as the external threat on which more and more intrusions on our personal freedoms are being justified with.If you ever wonder how a prequel to 1984 would look or how Orwells world got to where it is, turn on your TV and browse the Internet and you will find that you are living it.

I'm glad it took me this long. I don't think the teenager in me would have fully appreciated it as much. The novel describes a totalitarian society, ruled by the iron fist of \\"The Party\\", and where even dissident thoughts, and not just actions, are considered a crime. The plot follows thirty-nine year old Winston Smith, who struggles with accepting the seemingly immortal regime. Much of the literature and other media that deals with totalitarian society owes its elements to the ones developed in Ninety Eighty-Four, and sometimes it's hard to recognize that that which has now become clich&eacute; was still novel at the time of publication. I think this contributes to the first part of the novel feeling quite slow. However, one thing to keep in mind is that while some plot elements may seem predictable, the reader should be prepared to be pleasantly surprised. One major flaw in the work, in my opinion, is that the narrative grinds to a halt about two-thirds of the way into the book. Orwell introduces what is essentially a treatise on the society he constructed. While fascinating at first, I found that it detracted from my overall enjoyment of the work. The last one hundred pages, however, make it completely worth it. The psychological elements here are terrifying, and even the reader begins to lose hope in this frightening but always possible future. Orwell sends a stark warning to future generations with this novel, which makes it plain to see why it has become such a classic. I would recommend to anyone to re-read if they had read it in their youth."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's genius and prophetic book does not need my review. I would only mention that Orwell made also a scientific and sociological discovery that is valid in today's world: If you change the very meaning of words, if you change the language, you are able to change the society.

In fact, there are many plot gaps and false steps. But the implications itself are staggering. Somewhere along the way, this book becomes less science fiction and more science fact. Orwell accurately predicts the advent of things like \\"perpetual wars\\" -- not for the sake of winning, but for the sake of warring for profit, and \\"doublespeak,\\" or, as we refer to it now, political euphemisms, or \\"political correctness.\\" When our politicians sidestep an uncomfortable question by answering one that was not asked instead? that is Orwellian. Even the questioner, apparently, has forgotten what he or she just asked. And when the motive behind a question becomes the question itself, supplanting the original, that too is Orwellian. The removal of certain words from the english language to cover up crimes? It's Orwellian, and comes straight out of 1984 -- as when torture suddenly becomes \\"harsh interrogation techniques.\\" And it is happening more and more; more, perhaps than we'd like to admit. For the good of more, the less are squashed, and the president mangles his principles. There are many people today who believe wholly in a past which in fact never actually existed -- unless it was on shows life Leave it to Beaver and Father knows Best."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"All starting to sound familiar... great book. We could learn some lessons from the masterpiece written by Mr. Orwell. Cheers."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is absolutely phenomenal, George Orwell was very sick when he was writing this novel in the 1940s. The Soviet Union was flooding fear into the world, this book gave a conception to the possibility of communism taking over. And it did this in the most conventional way possible, the book gives the perspective of a normal man in a world that he fears completely. Constantly retaliating in his mind but to scared to actually revolt. I highly recommend this book to everyone, its one of my favorites and definitely worth your time."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"If you've never read this book, one should. Big Government has a way of wanting to control our lives, and this book depicts that. A good read. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"still a harrowing tale even in the modern age. the bleakness of life told in this vision of the future is a future we should all be trying our best to avoid"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This novel can be read from the left side or the right side of the political spectrum because the overarching horror of the totalitarian state presented by Orwell here is told to us in an honest and forthright manner. Orwell's narrative retains its relevance because we still seem to go through phases where the freedoms of the enlightenment are challenged from many angles. Whether you read Big Brother as Joseph Stalin or Sam Walton and The Party as being representative of a fascist or communistic authoritarian State, the \\"truth\\" of this novel, that liberty, personal freedom, and the freedom to speak and be understood are ideals that should be treasured and protected in practice. As long as there are human beings who wish to control and eradicate the humanity of others, 1984 will remain a novel worth reading."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"An eye opener vision of how far big government, big business, and any dictator can control apathetic people and societies when we decide to go with the status quo. We don't want to lose our jobs so we accept compromising what is right -- it gets easier every time. How about putting the fun and easy things in life before fixing the things in our nation, neighborhoods and families that are failing. More laziness leads to freedoms lost when peoples of a nation live with the mindset of let the government take care of us , let's trust them to do what is best for us without complaining when the loss of our freedoms are disappearing ,slowly, but usually in the guise of - being told these laws will be better for our safety, our pocket books, the health of the earth etc... Apathy to the extent of having 1+1=3 be an acceptable \\"reality\\".... we reap what we sew and a whole nation sewing apathy seeds in their lives every day paves a path to our own destruction.Look at what is on TV we have shows telling us vampires, big foot, werewolves, zombies etc... may be or are a reality , how many people believe this nonesense... again I say we reap what we sew. Orwells 1984 is well on its way to becoming reality and noone cares enough to ban together in thought and ideals to say 'no more' . The USA constitution reminds us that people are willing to suffer all kinds of evils and do nothing until the suffering is absolutely unbearable. That in my opinion is the reality of todays' America. And it is the picture so clearly painted by George Orwell in his book 1984. I would give the book a 5 , it deserves a 5 , but my heart cannot stand the thought of the horrors my grandchildren and great-grandchildrens lives will be if we pass them our legacy of apathy - sheep led to slaughter, by the actions (or nonaction) of our own laziness."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I want to give you all a heads-up about what reading this book did for me. The more objective things are well documented and I don't want to go into that. Reading this book really got to me, gave me creepy feelings about my own hard childhood in the family gulag and made it hard to sleep for a few nights. I guess my comment is that a prospective reader might think about this kind of affect and mull things over before getting into it. The book is well written, for sure, and Orwell keeps the action going...but that action literally goes straight to hell. Not an easy read--at least for me it wasn't."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"One of the great books of the 20th century - it is amazing how much of Orwell has entered the language : Big Brother, Thought Police etc. The story is a bleak one - &quot;Imagine a boot stamping on a human face, forever!&quot;. Orwell intended it as a warning, not as a prophecy. As a warning, it worked - 1984 was read by every Russian dissident, about the only English book (besides Animal Farm) that can make that claim. Yet, the abuse of language described by Orwell, the way thought can be controlled by inculcating poverty of language, in a certain sense describes much of today's media - &quot;dumbing down&quot; actually limits the possible human response - look at the jeers and cheers on 'the Jerry Springer' as pathetic subjects explode their inarticulate rage. The nearest thing to the '5 Minute Hate' that I have ever seen. Yet, Orwell possibly made the warning too bleak (he was dying of TB as he wrote, it was his last book). You feel that while Julia and Winston Smith do ultimately betray each other, yet it was done under duress of torture, and there could possibly be forgiveness in their hearts afterwards, not the disillusion of the book. The power of human love could defeat the Party, perhaps. A book that repays several readings."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is a book about a controlling government taking too much power over it's people. This book totally reminds me of my favorite movie series, Star Wars. The dictatorship is close to the communism in present-day Cuba where the people have no say in any matter. The government known as Big Brother has developed a language, Newspeak, for the people of Oceania. The language prohibits people from acting against Big Brother. All citizens are under intensive constant watch including the main character Winston Smith. All thoughts, actions, and words are recorded by telescreens at all times. These telescreens are watching for anything out of the ordinary. Winston is constantly thinking rebellious thoughts while knowing the government is &quot;ungood&quot;. The common English word &quot;bad&quot; translates into Newspeak as &quot;ungood&quot;. The setting holds three superstates Oceania, Eastasia, and Eurasia who all have simmilar governments looking to gain ultimate power over the other two.As the book goes on Winston finds a co-worker and future lover Julia who thinks the same way as him. The two share thoughts and present them to O'Brien, a third worker who is believed to be in charge of &quot;Brotherhood&quot;. Brotherhood is the rebel group who disagrees with Big Brother. Two weeks later we find out the secrets of Big Brother. Doublethink is the known method used by Big Brother to have a single person think to opposite thoughts and believe both. O'Brien tells us about doublethink with &quot;Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else,&quot; says O'Brien. &quot; . . . In the mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal. Whatever the Party holds to be truth is truth.&quot;Orwell obviously was a strong believer in the warnings of a &quot;controlling American government&quot;The book makes me think to myself could this all happen if the government became everything it has become throughout 1984."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Very good book, and certainly deep in terms of political ideas, but a little slow in the middle, and the ending is too pessimistic. &quot;We&quot; by Evgenii Zamiatin (which was written first) is similar and though it has its own weeknesses is probably a better book overall. Nevertheless 1984 is a thought provoking book and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"When Orwell originally wrote 1984, it was to be called 1948. This was because he'd figured that by 1948 the world would be split into &quot;superstates&quot;, and all a form of some totalitarianism or other. And a terrifyingly new kind of totalitarianism. One that utilizes technology to invade the privacy of every one of it's citizens. Orwell gave us the term &quot;big brother is watching&quot;. And this is done by cameras that are placed everywhere. Knowing it to be impossible for someone to watch you 24 hours a day is small comfort when you never know when you're being watched.It bothers me that Orwell is not considered to be one of the great authors of the 20th century, as he was so adept at breaking down complex societies, and goverments into contexts that most everyone can understand. Both in 1984, and Animal Farm.1984 is the story about an average man who finds more and more that the life he's leading, and the government he works for is wrong. Horribly wrong. The society he lives in is sick. In time he discovers, through a forbidden book, that the decades long war they've been fighting against the other superstates is actually a fabrication based on the concept that war can sustain an entire economy, because everything that a society produces is destroyed. And that stoking the fears and hatreds towards the other superstates can create a nucleus that a society can form it's self around. We are versed on double-think, and double-speak; where one can spout, and believe government rhetoric, all the while knowing the truth right in front of their face. The book is endlessly fascinating, well written, and deeply provocative. It is, after all, a classic."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"One of the most irritating and literal-minded criticisms of this book is that the events in it didn't happen in 1984--as though Orwell were writing prophecy rather than social commentary or just plain fiction. In fact, the majority of thought-control processes he described are in full effect today, as Fromm's splendid addition to this edition makes clear."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"A while back I started listening to a record by Radiohead. At first two songs really struck me as &quot;Whoa&quot; but I couldn't figure out why. I listened to the rest of the songs and they soon struck me as &quot;Whoa.&quot; I continued listening and I wanted to know what other people thought. I found a comparison between the book Nineteen Eighty-Four and this album. I didn't read anything more than the idea because I knew that I wanted to investigate for myself. I read the book and for the longest time I could not figure out any minute connection between the two. I listened day and night and eventually it made itself clear. OK Computer is the soundtrack to 1984. Each song has some relation to this book. This book is great, and everyone should read, while listening to radiohead. yeah."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book is very engrosive and is what I consider &quot;literature.&quot; In my mind literature is what makes you think.

It is almost haunting how close to home some of it hits. You must read it for yourself to truly understand how startling it is."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Nineteen Eighty-four is one of those slow starters, but this does not mean it is not enjoyable. This novel takes place in 1984 when the whole western hemisphere (Oceania) is over-taken by Communism. Everything you say and do is monitored by the thought police through telescreens (television screens that have cameras built into them that monitor the place where they are placed). Winston, a man in his thirties who is against Big Brother, decides to secretly do small actions that go against the law, trying to avoid getting caught. One of these things he does is write a journal for the future describing the life now and his thoughts about the situations. During his out-lawful actions, he meets a girl named Julia. Together they commit small crimes and avoid the law. After the first part of the book, the author really gets you into the story and the environment. You feel like you have to be as quiet as possible so is not to get caught by the thought police as Winston and Julia avoid the law. I give this book three stars because though it has a slow start, it is very interesting and fun to read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Unlike \\"Animal Farm\\", this book isn't inspired solely by the Soviet Union. The totalitarianism described in the book is very different from every-day life in Socialist countries while not lacking some coincidental similarities.You are going to see a totalitarian regime through the eyes of a small party official. You'll get introduced to his every-day life and work, and see him starting to have strange thoughts that he's actually not supposed to think.Orwell's world is much worse than the Soviet Union ever was. I must warn you that some very brutal scenes are described in detail and are really hard to take. The end is very Orwellian - too abrupt and somewhat disappointing.The movie was pretty good, too."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I read this book, curious on government issues during the late 40's. I was shocked at what lie beyond the doors of this classic novel. Orwell has introduced me to a society where propoganda dominates. today, I can easily relate this to the media and press. Orwell wanted to clarify his stand on Communism and propoganda and did so with this intriguing work of literature. What lie beyond the doors of room 101? As I say, something worse then death...."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Twenty years after having read &quot;1984&quot;, I can still feel its visceral and intellectual impact. IMO, it stands with &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, &quot;Age of Innocence&quot;, and &quot;Name of the Rose&quot; as the very best of the hundreds of fictions that I've read in my lifetime thus far.It's a testament to the power of Orwell's masterpiece that, after the title of the book has been relegated to the past, its message of warning is still more relevant today than ever - just look at Iraq, North Korea, Bosnia, Congo, just to name a few.A must-read for those who fight to preserve freedom of ideas, and also for those who seek to repress it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Across the country there is a travesty going on. High School teachers are requiring students to read Animal Farm by George Orwell. By the same author there is a much finer example of satire and the multiple levels Orwell attached to each of his books. Nineteen Eighty-Four is simply one of the best books written this century. It approaches a subject matter, Communism, attacks it and then inadvertantly exposes a greater meaning and truth, the essence of freedom. Orwell meant 1984 to be an attack on Russia and what would happen if Stalin and Lenin won. It trascended that and became a handbook for freedom. If anyone doesn't come out a Libertarian after reading this book, they didn't read it close enough. One of the many books that will be on classic reading lists for centuries to come."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's novel 1984 is a dystopia about a world where authoritarian governments rule the world. Everybody should read this book, because freedom of thought is not something that comes naturally to all of us in every country.Even in democratic countries like the United States where people will cross the ocean to fight for democrazy, but can't be bothered to cross the street to vote in national elections, freedom of thougth is something each individual has to gain themselves.Apart from oppressive governments sometimes religions decide that they know what's best for people they have control over. Authoritarian religions and authoritarian governments have so much in common that Orwell's book could just as well be about religion. Sometimes those in powerful positions even decide that their subjects don't have to think for themselves, but blindly obey what the leaders think is in their best interests.I was raised a Jehovah's Witness. 1984 was one of the books that opened my eyes. Don't be afraid to think for yourself. A good start is to read this book.If you have a loved one whose mind is controlled by a religion this is an excellent gift for them. Because this book is not really about religion Jehovah's Witnesses can read this book, although they are forbidden to read material that is critical to their beliefs."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's 1984 is one of the, if not the best science fiction novels of this century. A warning about the menaces of totalitarianism. The novel is set in an imaginary future world that is dominated by three perpetually warring totalitarian police states. The book's hero, Winston Smith, is a minor party functionary in one of these states. His longing for truth and decency leads him to secretly rebel against the government. Smith has a love affair with a like-minded woman, but they are both arrested by the Thought Police. The ensuing imprisonment, torture, and reeducation of Smith are intended not merely to break him physically or make him submit but to root out his independent mental existence and his spiritual dignity. Orwell's warning of the dangers of totalitarianism made a deep impression on his contemporaries and upon subsequent readers, and the book's title and many of its coinages became bywords for modern political abuses."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I wish there was a way Amazon would let you rate ONE book with six stars, your all-time favorite. If they did that, 1984 would be my pick. I've read it at least four times, once when I had insomnia I read the whole thing front to back again. The first time I read it was in high school, and I was disappointed because it didn't have a happy ending, because Smith didn't manage to somehow smash Big Brother. But now I recognize the book for what it is: a timeless statement on totalitarianism and individualism. Don't let the title fool you: if we're not very, very careful it can happen yet."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book will stay with you forever. It is such a horrific prophecy of socialist control of government that you will find your resolve strengthened to continue to fight for the freedoms with which we are blessed in this country. You will be intrigued throughout this book and find yourself with a new heightened awareness of the brutal nature of governmental control of our lives."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Breathtaking, in one word. Compellingly written, with a chilling plotline which is familiar to virtually all: a terrifying vision of an authoritarian future. It doesn't matter that it didn't happen, or that the settings are stylised: the real undertows of emotion and concept are played out in your head. It may have drawn inspiration from contempary communism, but the true commentary is far deeper - freedom, compromised in any system, and the appearance of freedom. The beginning is monochrome (dull, as some have referred to it) because Orwell was crafting some of the finest textural novel-writing ever - the contrasts with Winston's violent mental rebellion, the freedom of his reckless affair and the dark, futile scenes in Minilov are there for a reason. The ending may be 'depressing' but it is also one of the most powerful and affecting conclusions devised. The courage to end this way is telling of Orwell's uncompromising artistic stance, and his deeper intentions behind the novel.Three things really stand out. Firstly, the interesting and intriguing conceptual work expertly weaved into the plotline. Orwell used both satire and philosophy to emphasise a single variable - control - in his fictional world. It's a gritty, naturalist way of working; rather than through elaborate symbolism, and Orwell's journalistic style shines through. Secondly, his portrayal of this world. Although repeated readings have bought out subtler tones eg.the proles, newspeak, my first reading was dominated by the overwhelmingly convincing tone of observation and everyday slavery. The opening section builds up to a great atmospheric crescendo. Finally, although I mention a lack of symbolism, 1984 stands as a symbol itself for all the great struggles of the individual. Within its pages are independence against control, love against adversity, the vivid against the mundane, freedom against propoganda and expression against conformity - perhaps even life versus death. (see the attitude of the Party towards death, both in regards to others and its own continued existence). In displaying Winston's will waged against fate and society, Orwell has created one of the great political fables, and a supremely human novel."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I first read this book about 5 years ago ( being 9 years old !! ) and at the time I didn't understand it well, considering its a book based on life experiences but after it I felt sad and a little scared ( of O'Brien ). Now I'm older ( and re-read the book ) I think different of the book. I find it ironic that the bad reviews here tend to have the effect &quot;it never happened and its unrealistic&quot; because they don't seem to think of the effect some things have on them. Personally, I think its double-standards to MAKE people read this since they have the freedom not to.This book is brilliant. O'Brien is probably the scariest person created by an author, and in the end when Winston traces 2+2=5 in the table you see the fraility of the human spirit. You can see many parrells to today in many of the events in the book ( people disappear in Latin America everyday ). I think this is A LOT better than Animal Farm. Also, for those out there who gave this 3 stars or less, 1984 is NOT insulting communism. You can see that it represents other systems other than communism more. You can see where you would fit in ( I would most probably be Syme ) and where you would turn out. And the best thing about this is that the more you discover about life, the more you discover in this book. I am no way near understanding ALL points in 1984 since I am only 14. My ending note would be - READ, that is if you dare... You'll be trapped into a new realm for life."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Inspiring piece of worldly paranoia, that is truth, quoted well into the twenty first century as the future, and it is, not because mankind doesn't think it will ever go this way, but because we know full well we are, but somehow are allowing it to happen everyday. It is decentralization of power from the human being, in all aspects of one's life, to a higher power, a bigger cause, communism called the great Lucifer because all was given to the collective body and not to God, now God is the great Lucifer because we give ourselves to the collective body of something that we can not prove, so Science is the great Lucifer, producing weapons to kill the world a million times over, toxins to poison us a million times over, are all forms of giving to a collective body the nature of death? Is it the giving to a collective body that robs the soul of its power? Is it giving oneself wholly and utterly to something other than one's own self the conduit of decent into the investment of despair. 1984 sees men and women working their themselves to skin and bone to achieve a greater good that never emerges, the ultimate failings masked by a strict authoritative regime, BIG BROTHER, the power all seeing and ever controlling, rewriting history, editing the world around them, at war with this nation one minute and switching to another the next, neighbours up and vanish and protagonists invest in each other for but a fleeting glimpse of love only to be captured by the THOUGHT POLICE for engaging in illegal activity, men at the top of this society using torture and mind control to enforce a pathology of unquestionable and undeniable supremacy of all the power to the BIG BROTHER system, and that this is the system and that is why they are alive at all, at which point we question if it is worth living at all to which Orwell delivers a resounding, no, of course it is not worth living this life, why bother at all, and that this is a piece of work that must be understood by everyone and anyone who can read and is certainly mandatory reading for anyone in least bit interested in politics or political science.Unfortunately however we tend to vote in military commanders, lawyers and extreme capitalists into government and then ask why it is all going down hill.The problem is there is no terminology in the English language to describe the act of one human being killing their unborn future children by process of setting up a bad management system with a legal body incorporated into that system before they die. This prison kills, yet it is justified. 1984 is maybe that word, filicide being the closest English equivalent."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"No novel seems to be more relevant these days than George Orwell's 1984. While the year has passed the ideas of trickery and deception by the government still exist. Oceania could easily be the United States and Big Brother could be any one of the three letter orginizations in the US. No there arent telescreens everywhere, but thanks to the deceptivly titled &quot;Patriot Act&quot; Orwells nightmare is eerily closer to reality than ever before. Read this book. Period."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Everyone must read this book. If you read Animal Farm and thought it was good wait until you read this! It blows away Animal Farm by far! It shows what George Orwell projects as the future when he believed at the time would be under strict totalitarian rule. If you think communism would be a good form of government you might change your mind by the end of this book for it shows how society will be enslaved by its rule and eventually even the freedom to think will not endure."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 by George Orwell is a story of a totalitarian government and a man living under its power. Winston, the main character, struggles to fight the ruling outer party, even though his works for them changing historical documents to fit the parties needs. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys conspiracy stories. The only negative thing I can say about this book is it becomes slow in some parts, but over all it is a great read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Great book. Some of it is funny too. The ministry of Love, which is in charge or torturing, is called Miniluv in the language of Newspeak. The book presents a picture of a futuristic cruel society. Unlike A Brave New World, I would not want to live in this society. Some of the things that go on in this book one can relate to the real world. For example, in the book constant war is a stimulant to the economy, which resembles how some presidents use war to stimulate a bad economy in our times. The book also contains a book within a book, which appears to be an original concept. The book within the book describes an elaborate construction of the workings and politics of the Party. The torture that takes place is incredible. The Newspeak language was an interesting idea designed to reduce the possibilities of thought crimes by reducing the numbers of words in the language. The ideal speaker quacks like a duck, duckspeaking, such that speaking originates from the larynx as opposed from the brain. Duckspeaking is a marvelous, but scary idea indeed."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I first read this book on a friend's reccomendation and since then, it has become one of my favorite books of all time. many other reviews give you the plot summary, so i won't bother. I would highly reccomend this book to anyone, especially someone who wants to think about the direction our society is heading. it's kinda disturbing, but only because it's plausable.happy reading."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is frightening. 1984 is thought-provoking. 1984 is a literary masterpiece, warning society of a possible future that would more or less end meaning in life. There's little more I can say. Just read the book for yourself; it's what I call required reading."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This 1949 classic has lost none of its punch. With his descriptive depiction of the future, Orwell really puts the fear into the reader's heart. With his description of a totalitarian socialist regime, Orwell's masterpiece stimulates a fear that is reminiscent and matched only by The Red Scare of the late 1950s. The most amazing feature of this book is that it still holds relevance today. With America's War on Terrorism, the Bush Administration has started restricting American's basic civil liberties, such as a right to trial. This action almost seems to be a precursor to the restricted socialist atmosphere described so well by Orwell. Still if this book has one message, it is that the individual mind is stronger than any government and that humanity and freewill are things to cherish, not taken for granted. This book is a crystal ball into our country's future and deserves to be read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I would like to make a very brief comment on other reviews.Wh do so many reviewers of this book confuse Socialism with Communism?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell's 1984 is a fascinating account of Winston Smith and his world. This world is ruled by a collective oligarchy with &quot;Big Brother&quot; in charge of everyone. And yes, Big Brother is watching over everyone through the use of telescreens, which can be found everywhere in Oceania, his country. Winston works for the Ministry of Truth, where he changes the past to correlate with the future. While working there, he meets a coworker named Julia who has similar beliefs. They meet several times for love which builds the story into the climax.The theme of this book relates to the effects of negative Utopia. It refers to the total opposite of Utopia, which is defined as &quot;an imaginary place considered to be perfect or ideal&quot;. Hardly anything is perfect or ideal for the characters in this book. Big Brother promotes this idea as it makes society as efficient as possible. The national slogan &quot;WAR IS PEACE, FREEDOM IS SLAVERY, IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH&quot; will certainly make any reader believe that Winston Smith is in a negative Utopian society. Orwell certainly makes a dramatic nightmare of what society may become.There are few characters that operate as individuals in this collective society. There is a deep relationship between Winston and Julia, as they become rather involved, and consequences later result.This book was quite different than anything else I have ever read. I have never thought how much a government could control a society, but this book shows how easily a totalitarian government can take over. It makes me wonder if our government today is spying, as there is certainly the technology to do it. I wouldn't want to have telescreens dangling from every wall watching me no matter where I go! George Orwell has created a masterpiece and an excellent example of science fiction. Through reading this novel, I realized how many famous things about the proles and Big Brother have resulted from the context of this novel.This mesmerizing novel tells how Big Brother takes over Winston and all the other residents of Oceania through telescreens, Newspeak, the Party, and hate. Big Brother and his Party are controlling all aspects of life that are sometimes taken for granted. They control people's destiny, your occupations, dress, social status, meals, residence, family, and their minds. Thank goodness the year 2001 in America (or anywhere in the world for that matter) is not like the year 1984 in Oceania."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell is an accomplished author and 1984 is a classic novel written much before its time. Although much of what the world turned into within this story didn't occur, for the most part, I fear what Orwell would say about the advacement in electronic surveillance and reduction in privacy today. I very much enjoyed this story and can easily relate much of the allusions of this book to today's society and it's possible future. However, I don't find the politics and geography of this story very realistic; the same for its primary ideologies. Yes, it's a work of fiction written over 60 years ago but for example it's unlikely Europe (minus England for some reason) would ever side with Russia to make Eurasia any more than South America and South Africa would side with North America to make Oceania. Geographically it sort of makes sense but politically it does not. The whole \\"Equatorial Region\\" discussion didn't make much sense either. The land area on/near the Equator is probably the least populated with the fewest resources in the world; though I'm not positive about that. I also felt that the chapter containing sections of \\"The Book\\" was much longer than it needed to be. That one chapter probably took up about a quater of the whole book, and it wasn't even real. The main character was tricked into thinking it was and even he claimed to not learn much from it. Granted this is the chapter that pretty much details Orwell's political ideologies for the world of 1984 but the same points could've been in a more succinct manner which wouldn't sacrifice a thing. Aside from those points, and the fact that 1984 is incredibly depressing/pessimistic (I prefer at least neutral endings), I would recommend this classic book to any political, historical, or literature fans.P.S. The editors really need to go through this book again; it was full of spelling errors."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book should be required reading for every student who purports to live in a \\"free society\\".

I underestimated the length of the Afterword/Appendix so I was not expecting the story to end when it did because it seemed I still had such a sizable clump of paper between the fingers of my right hand. The ending came up so suddenly and kicked me in the face. After I turned the page and saw there was no story left I literally said out loud \\"f---, son\\".No wonder this is a classic. For those of you who think they read it but really only skimmed it for school-- read it eventually. Damn it's powerful. Part 1 was my favorite. Part 3 seemed to drag on and get redundant but then I realized that's the entire point. Also I thought it was awesome that it included within itself excerpts from \\"the book\\" enabling Orwell spit his philosophy right out in front of the reader in an analytical fashion without taking anything away from the story.9/10...took 2 days to read cover to cover.

I smuggled a copy of Orwells's \\"Animal Farm\\" in German to East Berlin in the mid 1980's for one of my wife's cousins to read. I gave them the book in \\"Alexander Platz\\" thinking we would not be observed because it is an open area. Wrong! In the 1990s when the tactics came out of the East German secret police, it was shown that the whole area was under hidden video surveillance. Welcome Big Brother! Orwell's dystopian world still exists in many forms in our society today. Look at what governments are still trying to do - control the internet, video surveillance systems everywhere etc.This is a classic must read for all. Its message is still plain to see today as when it was written in 1948 and the year that ii discusses. We may not have reached that point of North Korea, but it can become a reality in the near future. This is one of the top 100 literary fiction books to maintain in your personal Library.And remember my favorite Orwell quotes. \\"Big Brother is Watching You & Some pigs are more equal than other pigs\\""},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"the author talks about how the \\"big brother\\" is mind controlling everyone. i believe this is the case in our own society. with the government controlling the majority with entertainments and news. and the mass also teaches their children these beliefs, and this is how false information passes down. the way to cure this sickness is to read books, and THINK for yourselves. this is the only way to get out of the cycle. i recommend this book to anyone who wants to think for themselves."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"**Minor SPOILER\\"There is no doubt that George Orwell was ahead of his time when he wrote this book. If you look at our society today, although no where as severe as Orwell's vision, the shear human stupidity that abounds and the oppressive governments still present in certain parts of the world leads one to believe that his vision if we are not careful could become a reality in the near future. It seems that as time goes by and with all the technological advancement we've made, individuality and uniqueness are in danger of becoming extinct. It's enough to listen to today's music, to see what we now call \\"entertainment\\" for the masses to know that George Orwell ( at least when it comes to human beings) was right on the money.It certainly wasn't a pleasure read and while I do admit that it is a relevant book and it is one of the most thought provoking books I've ever read, I can't say that it is one of the best books I've read in my life. It was deeply disturbing and depressing and I was thoroughly disappointed with the end. I consider myself a realist but I was really hoping that Winston's idea of the defeat of Big Brother would become a reality, but in the end the Party is the one that wins. Did Orwell write this book with the intention of scaring us? No, he wrote it as a warning of how seriously screwed up the world can become if we stop thinking for ourselves. I only recommend this book if you like dystopian (opposite of utopia) society books."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I first read this book in high school because it was required. Needless to say, I have read it a few more times on my own since then. Why? Because it's worth it. Orwell offers eerily accurate correlations to a hypothetically world that places heavy reliance on media. Not only do people begin to forgot how to think for themselves, but a world of pure uniformity and lack of individuality begins to develop. One will be shocked at the little things that will remind you of devices that exist in our culture today and perhaps spark a bit of motivation to embrace one's flaws and unique attributes. After all, Orwell essentially warns in this novel that if we conform the ending won't be good. I guarantee one will complete this novel in record time because it's simply one you can't put down until your questions are answered."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Gods, where do I even start with this?As with To Kill a Mockingbird, I wanted to read this during Banned Books Week for two reasons. First, it's on the ALA's list of top banned or challenged books, and second because it's really, really good.As with all the books I read, there's always a little part of me thinking about what I'm going to say about the book once I finally decide to write about it. Sometimes I start composing in my mind, coming up with the pithy words and phrases that have made me into the international book reviewing superstar that I am.This time, however, I could barely concentrate for the cacophony in my head. There's just so much going on in this novel that doing it any sort of justice would probably require writing a book that was longer than the book that it was analyzing. And as much as I love you guys, I'm not about to write a whole book about this. Probably because I reckon better minds than mine already have.Regardless, it's hard to choose where exactly to go on this one. There are so many political, sociological, psychological and philosophical threads to pick up here that no matter what I write about, I'm pretty sure I'll get responses about how I didn't mention the solipistic nature of Ingsoc and its relationship to the philosophy behind modern cable news network reporting strategies. Don't worry, guys - I got that one.I suppose two big things came to mind while I was reading it this time, and the first of them was inspired by the previous book I read, To Kill a Mockingbird. In that book, Atticus Finch talks a lot about bravery. To teach his son about what it truly means to be brave, he gets him to take part in an old woman's struggle to free herself of a morphine addiction before she dies - an excruciating process that is more likely to fail than to succeed. But she does it anyway. Atticus says to his son about bravery, \\"It's when you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do.\\"The question in my mind, then, was \\"Is Winston Smith brave?\\"It's a hard question to answer, really. By Atticus' definition, you could say that he is. A member of the Outer Party that rules the superstate of Oceania, Winston Smith is a part of a greater machine. He works in the records department of the Ministry of Truth, diligently altering and \\"rectifying\\" the data of the past to bring it into alignment with what the Party wants to be true. His is a world where there is no such thing as objective truth - the truth is what the Party says it is.A good member of the Party sublimates his will to that of the Party. What Big Brother wants, she wants. She has no love but love for the Party and no dreams but to do what the Party wants of her. A good Party member doesn't have plans or hopes or dreams. He doesn't ask questions or idly wonder if things could be different from what they are. A good Party member doesn't think. He is born, lives, consumes, and dies.Winston, however, cannot be a good Party member. He wonders why the world is the way it is, and begins down a road to assert his own identity as a human being. He knows full well that he will fail, that in the end he and the woman he loves will be delivered into the hands of the Thought Police, and he is appropriately terrified. But he goes through with it anyway. He keeps a diary of his thoughts and actively tries to join an underground movement that is determined to overthrow the Party and Big Brother. He declares himself willing to undertake acts of heinous treason, all in the name of resistance against the Party.And in the end, he fails, just as he knew he would. So does this make Winston, a man who is so far in character from Atticus Finch, a brave person? Well, yes and no.He does meet Atticus' definition of bravery - persisting in what you believe to be right, even in the knowledge that you will probably fail. Winston puts his own life on the line multiple times, committing Thoughtcrime of the highest order. But is he doing it for some higher ideal, or is he doing it for more selfish reasons? Flashbacks to his younger days suggest that Winston Smith was an unrepentantly selfish child, who was willing to disregard the dire straits of his own mother and baby sister in order to get what he wanted. Could we not say that the adult Winston does the same? That he is more interested in freedom for himself than for others? Is his rebellion against Big Brother political or personal? He claims that he wants to see the world changed and freedom brought to all people, but how far can we trust a mind that's been well-trained in Doublethink?This, of course, gets right back to the Big Question of why people do the right thing, when it might be so much easier and profitable to do otherwise. Atticus Finch could have let Tom Robinson swing, thus saving himself and his family a whole lot of trouble, just as Winston could have just given up and emulated his neighbor, Parsons, becoming as good a Party member as possible. Neither man could do that, though, because is was not in their nature to do so. It was impossible for Winston to continue to live the way the Party wanted to and, given time, he may have been able to reach beyond meeting his own personal needs and seen to the needs of his greater community.Unfortunately, we never get the chance to find out, as the Thought Police eventually get tired of watching him and take him in. To his credit, he does hold out to the last extreme before he betrays Julia in his heart, so perhaps he is brave after all.The other thing that came to mind while I read was the modern use of the word \\"Orwellian,\\" and how it falls vastly short of what is depicted in this book. It gets thrown about any time a city puts up a few CCTV cameras downtown, or a business decides to put surveillance cameras in their store. It comes up when we put RFID chips in passports and credit cards, or when we think about how much data Google can hold about us. The word brings to mind a sense of constant surveillance, never being able to move or act without some government or corporation knowing what we're doing.While the concept of the two-way telescreens in this book certainly are a logical extension of surveillance culture, to call a customer database or red light cameras \\"Orwellian\\" is like calling a Bronze-age chariot a Ferrari. It betrays an incredible lack of understanding of what exactly is going on in the world that Orwell has built. We may be watched by these people, but in comparison to the average citizen of Oceanea - prole or Party member - we are still remarkably free.There are still freedoms available to us that people like Winston never had, and couldn't understand even if they were offered. We can protest, we can voice our disagreements, we can channel our energies into whatever pursuit we choose, or not channel them at all. We have the freedom to decide who we want to be and how we want to live, at least within the limits of a well-ordered society. We do not live in daily terror that we might be abducted from our beds, our lives ended and our very existence erased from record and memory. Honestly, I think a few security cameras pale in comparison to the horror that is Oceanea and the world of Big Brother.There is so much more to talk about with this book. I find Newspeak fascinating, and its foundations both amazing and terrifying. The idea that a concept can only truly exist if there's a word for it brings to mind those \\"untranslatable\\" words you find in every language. For example, there's no equivalent to the English \\"miss\\" in Japanese, as in \\"I miss my mother.\\" Does that mean that people in Japan are incapable of missing people? Of course not, but the underlying theory of Newspeak suggests otherwise. Once the party reduces the English language to a series of simple words with no nuance or subtlety of meaning, the idea goes, Thoughtcrime will be literally impossible. After all, how can one wish for freedom if the concept itself is impossible to articulate?Then there's the idea of the mutability of the past. The way the Party exerts its unbreakable control over the population is by virtue of the fact that they control all media - newspapers, radio, television, publishing of all sorts. If the Party wants to, say, claim that Big Brother invented the airplane, all they have to do is revise all relevant media to reflect their desired past, and then replace and destroy anything that disagrees with them. With no evidence that Big Brother didn't invent the airplane, all that's left is fallible human memory, and those who do think they remember the \\"right\\" version of the past will eventually die anyway. Whoever controls the present, the Party says, controls the future. And whoever controls the past controls the present. By remaking the past, the Party guarantees that they can never be gainsaid or proven to have erred in any way.Fortunately for us, Big Brother never had the internet to contend with. As anyone who's been online for a while knows, nothing on the internet ever goes away. Ever. The words of any leader or influential person are all there, in multiple copies, all of which can themselves be copied and distributed in mere seconds. While it is possible to fake a photograph, the awareness of that possibility, as well as the technology to suss out the fakes, are just as available to anyone who wants them. Even in cases where there are disputes about the past, or re-interpretations of past events, it is impossible for one version to systematically replace all others. While this sometimes results in competing versions of the past, the one with the most evidence tends to prevail.Continuing in that vein, the understanding that the Party controls all information about itself leads to a very interesting question that's not addressed in the book - is anything that is not directly witnessed by Winston Smith true? We are led to believe, for example, that there are three world powers - Oceanea, Eastasia and Eurasia - which are locked in a state of perpetual war. The nature of this war and how it serves the interests of these three nations is laid out in Goldstein's Book, which is the text of the Revolution that Winston and Julia want to join. But here's the thing - Goldstein's Book is an admitted fiction, written by the Party as a kind of honeypot to bring suspects through the last stages of their Thoughtcrime. So we have no proof that the world of Nineteen Eighty-four actually is laid out the way it appears.The Party could in fact dominate the world, using the pretext of war to keep the world's citizens terrified, needy and compliant. On the other extreme, Oceanea could just be Britain, turned in on itself like some super-accelerated North Korea, its borders sealed and its citizens kept in utter ignorance of the world outside. We don't know. We have no way of knowing, and neither do any of the characters in the book. Even the Inner Party members might not know the truth of their world, and wouldn't care if they did.One more thing, and I'll keep this one short - Doublethink. The ability to hold two contradictory ideas in your mind, believing in both of them simultaneously and yet being unaware that there's any conflict at all. Knowing, for example, that last week chocolate rations were at thirty grams, and at the same time knowing that this week they had been raised to twenty. All I can say here is to look at the current health care debate in the United States. Here's a fun game: see how often someone says, \\"We have the best health care in the world,\\" and then see how long it takes before they tell us that health care in the United States is irrevocably broken. Your average politician and pundit does this kind of thing all the time and, in accordance with the basic principles of Doublethink (also known as Reality Control), they immediately forget that they had done it.This game is much easier if you watch Glenn Beck for half an hour.There is just so much to be gleaned from this book. Probably the most important is this - the world depicted in Nineteen Eighty-four is certainly not an impossible one, but it is unlikely. The people of that world allowed the Party to take over for them in a time of crisis, and in that sense this book is a warning to us all. It is a warning to keep the power that we have, and to resist the temptation to let a government decide who we should be.-------------------------------------------\\"I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY.- Winston Smith, Nineteen Eighty-four-------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book arrived very quickly and was in excellent shape.

I think had I read it in high school - when the majority of readers experience it - I would have been more impressed. But reading it now, I was repeatedly struck by the book as anti-Communist propaganda. I feel that Orwell's decision to portray nothing as positive in this society is a major fault of the book. I think that what makes a dystopian society believable is that there exists some aspect that is highly appealing (absolute physical safety seems to be the most common tool). In the absence of anything good in the society, the reader is left to doubt the ability of such a regime to come to and maintain power.Additionally, I found the depiction of the proles as short-sighted and completely incapable of revolution to be insulting. I felt that Orwell's conclusion is that revolution can only be instigated by the elite, yet historically this has not been so.In respect to Winston's relationship with Julia, I bring my own bias. I simply find it unbelievable that love cannot withstand the pressure of a totalitarian society. Thus I found Winston's betrayal of Julia to be an unrealistic turn of events.Ultimately, I think that Orwell's mission to demonize Communism on all levels led him to make many seriously compromised choices in the book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I find it very intimidating to review a well-known classic. I think since there is so much information on both the book and the author that I will just touch on a few of the concepts pervasive in the novel and, considering this is one of the daddies of dystopia, how the novel's presence has impacted literature as a whole.Big Brother is the ever-present leader of the party, staring at the citizens of Oceania wherever they go with the aide of telescreens. Winston, an employee of the Ministry, isn't really sure if Big Brother actually exists or if he's really even an actual entity. The point Orwell is making here is that the party is always watching and has complete control over its citizens' bodies and minds. As party members go higher up in the ranks, vagueness ensues until one realizes that no one really knows who is ruling the country.One of the most disturbing examples of the Party's mind control, and there are many, is illustrated in the description of Winston's job. His role within the party as propaganda officer is to alter official government publications in order for them to fit with the Party's official version of how events really went down. The Thought Police are constantly vigilant, searching out dissenters of the Party. They monitor citizens to the point where having a dissenting thought against the party is against the law and punishable.Inevitably, Winston becomes one of these disillusioned dissenters,and he is arrested and tortured for it. During his interrogation, his captors explain to him that he will be re-integrated, or brainwashed, back into the Party.The influence of Orwell's 1984 is indeed extensive; how many times have you heard someone describe something as \\"Orwellian\\"? Anthony Burgess wrote 1985, which was intended to be a sequel to Orwell's original work. In more recent work, Cory Doctorow's Little Brother directly references 1984's Big Brother, and Doctorow's main character, Marcus Yellow, is a direct reference to Winston Smith.I recognize this book's extreme importance in the field of dystopian literature, and I found parts of it to be truly terrifying. However, parts of the novel, especially the segment in which Winston read entire chapters of the underground opposition party's manual, moved very slowly and were very dry. I'm glad I've read it but will probably not revisit it."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Every American should read this book! It deeply touches the mind and heart! - Levin is brilliant!

I can count on one hand the books I've re-read in their entirety of my own volition, so that should tell you something about what I think of it.I'll resist the urge to draw current political parallels and just say that the way Orwell portrays how a collective autocracy intent on nothing but preserving its own dominance can erode individuality fascinates and terrifies me like little else I have ever encountered. Reading this book is a permanent loss of innocence. You leave it sadder and wiser--but a lot sadder than wiser."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell's distopia about a secret government that monitors what you write, what you do, and even what you think was very believable. The first part sets up how the distopia functions and the consequences for defiance. I love Orwell's style. The way the character's talked was not pretentious and there were some big surprises too!The book drags on a little in the beginning when its going through the distopia, but it picks up after the defiance begins. The defiance comes in the form of a romance between the characters, who have to constantly look over their shoulders for Big Brother. The romance is very well done and even beautiful in its own way.At the end, you can tell the author is instilling his own views about a corrupt government. Yet, the way Orwell writes his ideas fit in the context of the book without shoving them in your face. I wont reveal anything else because I want your heart to jump like mine did when I read it!!The book was very compelling, captivating, disturbing, thought provoking, and enjoyable. I dont think its for everyone... its intense and even depressing, esp. at the end.

However, Orwell's work is more importantly a powerful depiction of the power and danger of an unchecked government. He grimly depicts the psychological, economic, technological, and other weapons a government has at its disposal against its people.I recommend this book highly to everyone; I would even say that it is a must read. The writing is not difficult to understand, however, the political concepts are better appreciated with first hand experience and interaction with government and its potential for power abuse. I first read \\"1984\\" as a sophomore in high school and did not fully comprehend the books meaning. The book is even more valuable as a comparison to modern day political events."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Put simply this is the greatest work of dystopian literature ever created. It's not filled with useless details like Atlas Shrugged and is more vivid than anything Huxley or London have ever created.Nineteen Eighty- Four shows the ultimate consequences of government intervention into the individual's life. The book takes place in a totalitarian state called Oceania where even the thoughts of the citizens are controlled and punished by the ruling party.Follow the life of Winston Smith, a mal adjusted government propagandaist, as he struggles to keep his mind, body and soul free for the death grip of the all encompassing state.A must read for all who value individuality, liberty and non-comformity.Come and discover why Orwell is one of the most influential and referenced author of the last century."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Several concepts from \\"1984\\" - especially \\"Big Brother\\" - have been popular cultural references for many years. Despite being familiar with them long before reading the novel, I still found the novel to very engaging and entertaining. One easily identifies with Winston Smith, trapped in a brainwashed society and wanting to rebel, knowing things could be better. Instead of feeling dated, the story feels even more relevant today with the level of surveillance that governments across the globe exercise currently.Some elements such as doublethink may appear to be a bit far-fetched, but still remain scary because one can see a government seeking absolute and unending control going to any lengths to achieve their goal. Indeed, attempting to control people's thoughts isn't outside of the realm of possibility; it can almost seem like \\"political correctness\\" taken to an extreme. So while fans of science fiction and readers of almost any dystopian future story will be familiar with some of the concepts seen here, this is well worth a read, being both one of the earliest examples of the story and still one of the best."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Obviously a great book, but the Kindle edition (at least) omits the Appendix \\"The Principles of Newspeak\\" which any reader should want to have!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's \\"1984\\" is such a powerful read, and a fascinating look into the world where one is under control of the State through the \\"Big Brother.\\"There is one quote that stood out for me from this book:\\"Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past.\\"What if this \\"Big Brother\\" is true?

The three slogans of the Party as described in book is very familiar with what we hear from our leaders in these times:War is PeaceFreedom is SlaveryIgnorance is StrengthOrwell paints a picture of how this fascist totalitarian state is controlled by control surveillance, the new language of Newspeak and the three main ministries that are:\\"Ministry of Peace\\", which concerns itself with war\\"The Ministry of Truth\\", which takes care of news, entertainment, education etc. in short translated as the place of propaganda\\"The Ministry of Love\\", which is concerned with law and order and according to Orwell the most frightening one.It is truly a must read book as the rise of fascism is happening.

The characters, the setting, the message, still ring true today. Individualism is crushed in this books world; humans become like insects, and think with a hive mind. The doctrine that the people of this world chant like a mantra are all basic contradictions, such as, \\"War is peace\\". Putting the mind in a double bind where normal thought is paralyzed. A lot of people say that we are moving forward towards the 1984 world. I agree in a sense but we are going about it in a subtle different way. Such as the current cry for everything in the name of safety, really, Can you ever be safe enough? Therefore any law could effectively get passed in the name of safety, or battling terrorists or global warming, or equal rights, or etc infinitum. We have to remember to use common sense when something is presented as truth. Further we must be careful and ever vigilant when it comes to human rights and freedom of speech, and learn the lessons that Orwell tried to teach us."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Reading this novel again in today's context is even more enlightening.

Of course, the closer the world moved towards 1984, the more we wondered how closely the world would resemble the picture drawn by Orwell.Reading the novel again after 1984, and especially now that the cold war has ended and been replaced by other threats to humanity, it is interesting to think about what Orwell's message really might have been about, and its relevance today.Certainly, the psychology of fear and abuses of authority remain central issues. Media manipulation has been elevated to an art form and control of information probably doesn't matter much if people are not well enough educated to dissect facts from interpretation and possible consequences from likely causes.1984 is a great novel. It invites the reader to think about the shape of the future and about a more ideal society. One, perhaps, that optimises the balance between individual rights and responsibilities, and collective safety and obligations.Prescience, irony or paradox? Thankfully, each reader can form their own view(s).Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I do not much enjoy reading the works of George Orwell; they are far too grim and pessimistic for me. Despite their unpleasantness, however, Orwell's books are amongst the finest ever written, particularly \\"Animal Farm\\" and his masterwork, \\"1984\\". Having recently experienced \\"1984\\", my being is still in a state of disarray, as will be that of anyone who encounters the novel. \\"1984\\" challenges everything humankind stands for, examines what it means to be human, and then spits on the face of humanity. It does more than that, though - it also tears out all our insecurities and flaws, exposes them in bright sunlight, and then strips us of all confidence and hope, leaving us feeling like little more than dust in the wind. And yet still \\"1984\\" is as much a celebration of humanity as it is a ghastly warning of the dystopia awaiting us should we allow the human spirit to be corrupted.Orwell's novel was written in 1949, shortly after the end of World War II and the detonation of the atomic bomb, and the paranoia and fear that arose from those conflicts as well as from the threat of communism (which even at this time Orwell was well aware of) clearly spawned \\"1984\\". The book is set in 1984, probably (because in the future no one can really keep track of the years). The world has been grouped into three opposing forces: Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia. Winston Smith is a citizen of Oceania (which grew from America and England, among others), living in London. In this society, you are monitored at all time, primarily through \\"telescreens\\" placed in every room (a telescreen being a device which transmits and receives information simultaneously). When you are alone, you are never really alone. Individualism is not only discouraged against - it is forbidden. Everyone must work toward a better Oceania. Sex is frowned upon, and is to be used strictly for reproductive purposes. The only music and films are those put forth by the government, and there is no such thing really as \\"entertainment\\". One's time should be divided between work and community activies, such as joining the Anti-Sex League or, for children, joining the Spies, a group which encourages youth to turn in their parents should they commit \\"thought crime\\". Thought crime is when, even for a moment, one should think a negative thought about the government. Crime is monitored by the Thought Police, an elite and secretive government organization which \\"vaporizes\\" criminals - that is, takes offenders in their sleep and erases all records of their existence. In essence, this future society is a far more perturbing version of communism.Winston is 39 years old and works at the Ministry of Truth, a division of government dedicated to revising old news articles so that any record of something being slightly different from the way it is at the present does not exist. (Time is shaped and controlled, even, by the government.) Winston is a dreamer, however, and he suspects that things were not always this bad. Not that that could be proven; any real documents detailing life before the last few years say only that it was very bad. One day he buys a journal and begins writing in it - an act punishable by death, should ever it be discovered by the Thought Police. He fantasizes about a future when the \\"proles\\", the majority of society, the peasants, will rise up against Big Brother (the mascot and ruler of Oceania) and overthrow the government, returning things to the way Winston believes they once were. Winston doesn't think of any way to begin this revolution on his own, however, until he receives a note from a co-worker whom he suspects to be a member of the Thought Police. Then Winston discovers the ultimate way to rebel: he falls in love.How grievous an existence George Orwell must have led. \\"1984\\" is the work of a man not only perturbed, but horrified of the future he saw looming ahead. Fortunately, 1984 has come and gone and present society is not anywhere near as terrible as Orwell's dystopia, but under the control of George W. Bush and our current government it is growing nearer. Thus the message of \\"1984\\" comes across strong as ever, and the \\"inevitable\\" future it predicts remains the most horrific thing imaginable. Indeed, \\"1984\\" is very probably the most unnerving novel ever written.Nevertheless, it MUST be read. It is the strongest message one could send about staying true to the ideals of those who founded the United States of America, but more than that, it is the strongest warning one could make about violating human rights. Human rights must be protected, whether the human in question is black, white, American, Japanese, man, woman, criminal, innocent. Otherwise, society will turn into the nightmare predicted in \\"1984\\", and that is the most tragic thing I can conceive.It's endlessly terrifying, entirely bleak, and ultimately hopeless, but \\"1984\\" is a brilliant novel and unquestionably one of the greatest ever written. George Orwell set out to concoct the most powerful and timeless warning he could, and \\"1984\\" was his grandiose success. The human spirit must not be oppressed, lest all that should remain are humankind. And what is humankind without humanity?"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 was a phenomenal book. Few books I've read have caused me to think so closely about societal issues, the government, and human instinct. The book proposed a sociey in which the government has complete and utter control over every action and thought that it's citizens experience. I don't usually enjoy books that have a science fiction basis, however, 1984 truly captivated my attention, and I found myself reluctant to put it down. It relays the story of a man, Winston, who wishes to change a society where all oposition to the government is dealt with swiftly and severely, usually by death. He joins forces with Julia, a strong willed woman, who also acts as his love interest. Together, they attempt to get in touch with the Brotherhood, an anti-Big Brother agency, in hope that one day Big Brother will be overthrown. The twists and turns that the book contains are exquisite and they culminate into one superb ending. The book is at times somewhat dry, but none the less, I would highly recommend it to anyone who is ready to read a thought-provoking piece of outstanding literature."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Hmmm...some pretty hyperbolic reviews for this book so far. Well, I can't deny that it is now the equal best book I've ever read (along with One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which I'm going to read again, to see which is better), but all this talk of causing depression and paranoia is a little over the top. Frankly, it made me feel euphoric to be so engrossed and stimulated. It certainly stirs emotion, it certainly is prophetic and it is impossible to put it down, but the real strength for me lay in the absolute craftsmanship present in the writing. I think this is because the book is a combination of fiction and political philosophy - all the more clever because the political philosophy has to ring true in regard to the fictional content, and also be relevant to reality in order to make it's impact on the reader.Much of it describes the conflict within Winston Smith's head; the contradiction between what he believes to be true and what he is told to believe, so you have a lot of thoughts and concepts being discussed at length during the story. To order and structure a novel of this kind and present a cohesive description of a system of government in such a way is an amazing feat. Having seen the film, I could not see how the people employed alongside Winston Smith can be involved in their own deception and be blind to it, but Orwell is absolutely convincing. It is such an intricately woven novel. I have often thought that I would like to write a novel, and one of the things that stopped me is the knowledge that I would not have the patience to get to the end, but then to read something like this makes you realise that there is no point because it would be impossible to write anything as complex and compelling as this. Orwell discusses so many ideas yet every time he revisits one, he takes it further and delves deeper into the system, and deeper into the mind - without repeating himself.Frankly, I find it difficult to explain just how well written this is, to say nothing of the great story.To sum up in one sentence...absolutely fascinating."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is, quite simply, a book that everyone should read. It is one man's view of the world that we were, and still are, becoming, and it is a view that is not a pleasant one. Told through the eyes of an ordinary citizen living in London, George Orwell expounds upon the ways in which an unchecked government would intrude into our daily lives. From the cameras that are always watching, to the children who are brainwashed by the state to spy on \\"thought criminals,\\" to the revisionist history that is nothing but pure propaganda, and the continual reduction of one's rations for military purposes, the country that is run by Big Brother is one in which there are truly no freedoms, and those who speak out are quickly silenced.It is also a story of hope, even in the face of such an invincible enemy. The main characters attempt futily to fight back, trying to find their own form of seclusion. Yet, whom can they trust? It seems as though everyone is on the government's payroll. In the end, they have to make a last ditch effort for a piece of freedom, knowing the consequences will be severe if they are caught.1984 is, to some extent, a slow read, but this is necessary due to the intricate descriptions of the characters' ordinary actions. While news of the war is always heard of in the background, the front is far off, if it exists at all. Rather, we are taken into the homes, workplaces, pubs, and streets of a horrifying world in which we have no power, save that to succumb to the wishes of our rulers. 1984 is a warning to those who would place too much power into our government's hands, for as we have seen in real-life examples, the government is not afraid to abuse the power it is given."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Written in 1949, this book has become such a part of the culture that even people who've never heard of it (if there are any such) would recognize the terms \\"doublethink\\" and \\"thoughtcrime\\", among others that this book introduced to the lexicon. The truly scary thing is not that there are noticeable similarities between our political culture and the culture portrayed in this book, but rather the even closer similarities between that culture and our corporate culture.After all, in the corporate world, as in the \\"Oceana\\" of this book, the \\"proles\\" (common laborers) can pretty much think and say what they want, although it IS possible for individuals to go too far. But if one wants a comfortable life in an office job, one not only has to watch what one says, but how one says it, and what one can be demonstrated to think. If one is caught in the \\"thoughtcrime\\" of being insufficiently enthusiastic about one's company, or showing doubts about whether what it's doing is right or not, one will surely be \\"disappeared\\"; one's co-workers will show up one day and simply not find you there, and if anyone is foolish enough to ask what happened, they will simply be told, in a tone of voice that brooks no further questions, \\"s/he is no longer with the department\\". If the offense was serious enough, that person will never work in as high-level a position again, anywhere. They won't have been taken off and tortured; they will simply have been exiled to the status of common laborer, where they're no longer dangerous.Also, if you doubt the existence of \\"doublethink\\", consider that corporations want honest, trustworthy employees, but heaven help the employee who speaks his/her mind (even quietly, on his/her own time) if it disagrees with corporate policy.The real world may be more subtle than the novel, but truth is no less truth for being subtle."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"How easily can humans be influenced and manipulated?This question has to be considered to decide whether the novel \\"1984\\" written by George Orwell in 1949 as a \\"negative utopia\\" is realistic or not.The protagonist Winston Smith lives in London, the capital of Oceania which is one of the three existing superstates. As an outer party member he is constantly controlled and observed by the \\"English Socialist Party\\" (Ingsoc) and its imaginary leader, Big Brother. The country is always in the state of war with some other state to prevent an increase in the living standards to keep the power over the population.The plot of the novel is divided into three parts that reflect Winston's development in the totalitarian system that requires full orthodoxy. In part 1 he secretly starts to rebel against the horrible circumstances, the emptiness and loneliness of his life while he works in the Propaganda Ministry of the state. The second part describes Winston's relationship to Julia, an uncomplicated, optimistic woman. When the two are arrested because of unorthodoxy and so-called \\"thoughtcrime\\" Winston is tortured and brainwashed in part 3.The novel describes the experiences and reactions to a cruel suppression of individuality. The continuous control body and mind (emotions and thoughts) by the Thought Police and the punishment Winston is afraid of, force him to look expressionless to the telescreens while his doubts and emotions whelm up inside him. He tries to express himself in a diary (thoughtcrime) though his feelings are manipulated by indoctrination to hatred towards a virtual enemy. In his work Winston has to manipulate himself: he has to alter the past by rectifying newspaper articles the party needs to prove their correctness. One has to learn to believe in two contradictory aspects simultaneously (doublethink). In his love affair with Julia Winston experiences peace and trust, but, at the same time, he knows the cruel end that must come. As expected, the two are discovered after Winston tired to understand the sense and intention of Ingsoc. In his torture, that is carried out by O'Brien who has a sort of father role, Winston has to learn that nothing exists than through human consciousness, that truth is what the party claims to be true and that the individual is only a biological cell. Winston finally accepts what is required after he has given up his hope and starts to love Big Brother in the belief that it is an authentic feeling.You see in part 1 a common manipulation of the party members through the everyday recurring \\"Two-Minutes-Hate\\" and information given on the telescreen. After Winston' s search for his authentic feelings in part 2 he is individually manipulated by O'Brien the way of brainwashing \\"to make him sane\\".As the story is conveyed through Winston' s perception and written in an eloquent style, you can be easily involved, so while reading you get almost always the same opinion as Winston even if they are sometimes contradictory. When finally the party uses Winston' s counter-strategies against himself I got confused what happened to \\"me\\".The manipulation of emotions and thoughts is quite obvious in the novel. Even the reader can be partly manipulated by the imaginative and convincing expression.In our time the technical methods to manipulate are numerous. For example in the advertising. But I think, because of Orwell's intention to make ways of influence obvious we shall be critical to search for our own thoughts and authentic feelings.This is what I think we can learn out of this novel."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Nineteen-eighty-four is a prime example of what the future may have looked like had the world had fallen to a reign of totalitarism; a world of total government control. If you enjoy lengthy narratives with details oozing out of the binding, or take a fancy to history and government, this is a must read. If you like books that make you think, this would be a good choice; however, if these subjects don't excite you, you may want to stay away from this one. The incredibly detailed writing clarifies and depicts each scene with stunning reality, but can slow the reading with the intriguing, yet tedious facts.The main themes are love, oppression, and hidden rebellion. It deals with the struggle of man against the indomitable machine of politics. Nineteen-eighty-four is set behind the perspective of the main character, Winston. Only what the he sees is what the reader sees. Given this, you see a great deal. If you harbor even the smallest interest in totalitarian government or communism, this is a good read. The book follows Winston through his daily life and describes its intertwining with the people around him, the &quot;Brotherhood,&quot; and the &quot;Party.&quot; Through hatred of the governmental restrictions and an illegal love interest, Wilson secretly plans the Party's demise as the plot progressively thickens. The insight and imagination that Orwell used to fabricate an entire world is outstanding. He has a marvelously terrifying viewpoint of Marxist policy, scary to the point of realism.However, as good as this book may seem, it is aimed at the mature reader, a fabulous choice for the high school and college students and great for adults too. So for all of you who have always heard the well-known phrase &quot;Big Brother's watching you,&quot; and never knew what it meant, take the chance to figure out what it means by diving into 1984; you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Orwell, for a skinny accountant-looking Englishman who's real name is Eric Blair, you rock for this single shining moment in literature history. Yeah, kudos to you.The nightmarish world of 1984 has yet to hit us yet, though we are getting there sometime. His world of Oceania is completely thourough and believable, with many similarities in today's society. It's an Animal Farm for the real world, no metaphors, no representations, just humans so idiots who didn't understand the latter can feel smart, too.Winston, our hero, is almost a perfect mirror image of Orwell himself, wandering around the plot and pointing out the ways people will try to control you without even really trying to point it out. It is written so well it just speaks for itself. It doesn't need to be explained, it is understood at first glance.The world is alive with sugar rations, forced morning exercises, paroles, betrayals, hipocrisy, and chestnut trees (You'll understand all too well when you finish the book).Winston sees cracks, deep and ominous, in his utopia and eventually tries to rebel against it only to be &quot;re-educated&quot;. The book explores the meanings of truth, of history, of what really is for our own good.From the first sentence to the last four words, this book is one that will stay with you forever."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's 1984 is a riveting story of science-fiction where everyone is constantly watched and every move analysed.It is also, and more, a sociological book about totalitarism. It asks the question?: What if the government could read your mind? How could they control your life? What do they need to do to control your life? How to they get you to think like they do? The answer to all is by controlling the media. You control the information the public gets, then you can control their opinion. It is a book about power and how bad it can get. It also talks aboutthe different classes in the society, how they act toward each other. Even if the book was written quite some time ago, the answers it provides are still quite accurate, and that's what makes it such a powerful book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's classic '1984' was absurd to me when I first read it in 1984 at the tender age of sixteen. Now, at twice that age, I realize how close we really are to the horror he envisioned. It is a cynical and depressing look at how weak the human spirit really can be. Even now, it is appalling to see my generation sacrifice liberty for security at every turn. The novel leads you along expecting the best for our protagonist, but in the end his doom is sealed not by his own unwillingness to fight, but the unwillingness of mankind. A society where people would gladly live in shackles (even in the metaphorical sense) rather than make a stand for the right to live free, is not so hard to invision. The society described in Orwell's nighmarish future is only off by a few generations...we are on the road to &quot;doublethink&quot;. WAR IS PEACE, FREEDOM IS SLAVERY, IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. This novel should be read by all high school students, and read again by all parents."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell's novel 1984 is an intriguing piece ofliterature. It is interesting, inspiring, and terrifying all at thesame time. Published in 1949, the novel's unyielding dystopian realism gives a warning that concerns the menaces of totalitarianism that Orwell feared could completely grip the world in the near future. The novel is set in an imaginary future world that is dominated by three constantly warring totalitarian police states. The novel's hero, Wnston Smith, is a minor party official in the Ministry of Truth, where the motto is, &quot;he who controls the past controls the future, and he who controls the future controls the past.&quot; Ironically, it is Winston's relentless longing for 'truth' and decency that leads him to secretly rebel against the government and its esteemed leader, Big Brother. In doing so, Smith becomes involved in a love affair with a like-minded by the name of Julia. Together, with the purpose of overthrowing the totalitarian government, they join an underground organization called the Brotherhood. Unfortunately, they are both apprehended by the Thought Police shortly after their admission into the organization. The ensuing imprisonment, torture, and reeducation of Winston and Julia are intended not merely to make them submit or to break them physically, but to root out their independent mental existence and spiritual dignity to the point that they betray the only thing that they have ever loved: each other. This novel made a deep impression on me. Orwell does an excellent job of getting his warning across while at the same time touching on romance and the natural instincts of the human heart. The daunting part about reading this novel is that it is very realistic and possible. 1984 is a novel that should be read by everyone, and the warning that it gives should be heeded. By Alicia Crawhorn"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 by George Orwell is a dystopian novel about the totalitarian regime of the Party, it's the story of Winston Smith and his intellectual rebellion of the Party, and consequent captivity, torture, and re-education. The Party and Big Brother totally control the people by psychological manipulation to dictate thoughts and actions.Imagine a world where you are being constantly watched and you don't know it, and a common enemy is used as the object of fear and hatred for the party- a means of controlling the population of course. Imagine a world where the party wishes to have all human desire disappear, sex is a grotesque act committed only for two reasons; reproduction and duty to the Party. To desire anything was a thoughtcrime, you should only want Big Brother's love and acceptance, as O'Brien says,\\"There will be no loyalty, except loyalty to the Party.\\"You believe everything the Party says, it is always correct. They have lost the ability of independent thought, and memories are lost and never were. A new language is created \\"Newspeak,\\" essentially the destruction of words. So thoughtcrime against the Party is impossible because there are no words that can correctly express emotions.So, \\"freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four\\" and this freedom is never granted. Two plus Two is anything the Party wants it to be, and \\"war is peace\\" because war is used as a tool to control the people.The novel takes the reader to a world that is so scary and vivid and almost possibly like ours.' It's a masterpiece and Orwell will take you to a world that will shake you because it is almost like our own, but thankfully and hopefully will never get as bad. Orwell tells you how important freedom really is, and that you might not even notice that you don't have it, and that two plus tw0 should always equal four or somethings not right."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I got this for my husband for Christmas. I don't even know it was his favorite book. I was excited to know that after 25 years."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The best reviews here have already covered it. It's a great quality book for the price, easily readable, and of course it's an amazing story you don't want to miss.Get this book, read it, love it, then buy a more expensive model of it for the bookshelf.And remember, Big Brother is watching!!! This could easily all happen to us!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Bottom-Line: I implore all freedom loving people to read \\"1984\\"; it is depressing, but then again so is life in general for the most part.First published in 1950, \\"1984\\" is a chilling, depressing, and yes, heartbreaking look into the future existence of mankind. It is a world that is at once dark, bleak, joyless, loveless and utterly without hope. Human's are as humans have always been, divided into three classes, only in George Orwell's there is no hope of movement between the three; they are static, fixed, inexorably and utterly.Religion has been banished (not an altogether bad idea), but so too has intellectual, personal, and political freedoms; mankind has been reduced to a soulless conglomeration of empty husks who do as their told, and believe whatever they are told by Big Brother, the party. Human intellectual, social, and cultural progress in any real sense has ceased for good or ill. Music, science, art, literature, is no longer the province of self, the Party owns it all.In the world of \\"1984\\", the world has only three nations, Oceania (North America, South America, Great Britain, and Southern Africa); Eurasia (Russian, Europe and Northern Africa); and Eastasia (China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, India, etc). These nations are perpetually at war with one another, but, the aim is the neither gain, nor lose ground to the other; the aim is be at war so that the masses never expect too much, nor have reason the question the supremacy of the Party.The Party controls all and is embodied in the persona of Big Brother, who is literally always watching or listening, via telescreens and microphones in people apartments, places of work & play. The Thought Police are never far from view. Privacy is a thing of the past, personal pleasure and leisure are frown upon, sex is a dirty joyless affair tolerated only for procreation (now doesn't that sound familiar), and the Party has three over-riding slogans the masses are controlled with; War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, and Ignorance is Strength. The Party has four principle ministries it uses to maintain control of the people; The Ministry of Truth, The Ministry of Love, The Ministry of Plenty, and The Ministry of Peace all of which are represented by four white monolithic building built in the heart of London where this tale unfolds.Most of the book centers on the life, and brief love of Winston Smith, an outer Party member, who live a life of quite misery. He hates the Party and wants to rebel, but he knows Big Brother is watching, and listening, so he is forced to rebel only in his mind. But little by little, step-by-step, Winston finds way to rebel, buying a diary in which he records his thoughts, and eventually he has a forbidden love affair with a fellow party member. This leads to other flirtations and a search for the illusive Brotherhood avowed enemies of the Party.Personal Thoughts\\"1984\\" is an intricately woven tale of a world gone completely mad by today's standards, a world where none of use could conceive of living in, and yet there are shades of \\"1984\\" type behavior by our government darkening Republic's freedom loving horizon. After reading just a few pages of 1984, you will come away with a frightening realization; the loose of our freedoms, both intellectual and personal will not happen over night, but it will come about gradually; there will be subtle changes in the landscape, a dimming of the constitutional light that warm all of us. Already, we are at perpetual war with an enemy who can not be found, but who pops up every once in a while to taunt us, to assure us that the danger is real, just as Goldstein does in the world of \\"1984\\".Our government, is engaged in doublespeak, bending the lies until they become the truth everyone (well at least half of the American electorate) will accept without question. This is evidenced by the fact that almost half of the America public believed (or still believe) Saddam Hussain had a hand to play in 9/11 even after the 9/11 Commission and other reports stated categorically that he did not. But Bush ties him to it right after the event, using doublespeak to mold the America mind. Already for far too many Americans Ignorance is Strength; witness the last Presidential election, the continued debate over Gay rights, school prayer, and abortion.Politicians now seem to speak in nothing but platitudes (doublespeak) that are released like confetti at a Party Convention until the truth is swept away like so much recycling only to be reborn as a sound bite tomorrow. One Party insists that it has the lock on family values, but fails to support the family in any meaningful way, but it doesn't seem to matter to those that support the Party. And yet they, along with the rest of us are being hurt by the slow strangulation of the America family. Disheartening to say the least. And shades of Newspeak are already inserting themselves into the political lexicon; the Estate Tax becomes the Death Tax, a woman's right to choose, becomes right to life, and the fundamental rights of Gays becomes a Defense of Marriage.George Orwell was amazingly insightful way back in 1950 to have written a book so relevant some 55 year later. The end of the book gives a rather lengthy explain of Newspeak, and the Afterword compares Orwell's work with other seminal novels that touch on the same theme: Aldos Huxley's Brave New World (next on my reading list), and Russian Zamyatin's We; it is fascinating and intellectually stimulating reading.I implore all freedom loving people to read \\"1984\\"; it is depressing, but then again so is life in general for the most part. Not living Winston's life should in the very least give one a renewed appreciation for our own."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is another must-read dystopia.

Too bad nobody really ever learns from this book or we'd not be electing the leeches we do."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is a dystopia novel written by George Orwell, pseudonym of Englishman Eric Blair, that opens up with the narrative ruminations of a man named Winston Smith. Winston Smith is just another face. Not particularly good looking or smart, Smith is meant to portray an average dissatisfied Englishman (or Oceanian according to the book) in Britain circa 1984. Circa 1984, because Smith is not certain of the date (probably right within a year or two) and, though it is never clearly stated, it is inferred that this is also the work of the nefarious \\"Party\\" which contrives to bring all under the power of its thumb.Early on Blair endeavors to paint a picture of doom-and-gloom and a not a little despair. a world where \\"hope\\" seems to be all but stamped out. Though overtly about communism, there can be inferences drawn to politics in general with such things as \\"doublespeak\\", which is the ability to believe two opposing things about the same subject (or even word) at the exact same time. For example, \\"duckspeak\\" (to quack like a duck), when applied to an opponent, is a derisive insult. However, the exact same word, when applied to an ally, is also a compliment.Blair does an excellent job of painting a picture of a future so bleak, while still being possible, as to send a shiver down the spine of any freethinking intellectual.

We recommend this book to all high school students because it not only deals with the harsh reality of the government, but also with the feelings of the narrator, Winston Smith, towards the system. 1984 has encouraged us to take an active role in our government as voters, and has helped us to realize the full extent of our freedoms in the USA."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is perhaps one of the best books i have read- Not for It's literature.

Anyone who sees this book as simply &quot;a book about communism&quot; may as well set the book ablaze, for he has already destroyed it's message. The book tells of humankinds self-enslavement, where people are nothing more than machines doomed to produce and consume endlessly for the sake of further production and consumption. The only prevailing human emotions are greed, hate, distrust, sorrow, and loyalty to invisible characters. Any word, thought, action, or a mere facial expression that might make other Party Members nervous results in instant termination. History is nonexistant in the sense as we know it. The Party controlls all records-as the slogan goes &quot;who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past.&quot; There is no escape. The book does not give a solution to the enslavement, but in its bold and frightening forecast, gives the reader the means to prevent it. Never let yourself be silenced. I highly reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The book is a fantastic read of Orwell's projection of a future in which three totalitarian governments (all equivalent) rule the earth. I would say the book has two sections, the story, which follows an Outer Party member's struggle to rebel, and philosophy, which is Big Brother's Manifesto (or, one could say, Goldstein's but really they are one and the same). The book puts the story on hold when Winston, the protagonist, reads the manifesto; I would say that there is flow problem with the abrupt nature of this switch. Certainly the Manifesto is endemic to the book and provides another perspective and history of the rise of Oceania, the state in which Winston lives."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Have you ever thought what it would be like to have a central government monitor everything you do? To live in a world where you are limited in what you could say, or even think? Or how would you feel if your government assigned you to a partner, and you had to breed, for the sake of the government and nothing more. In the book 1984, by George Orwell, a character named Winston Smith lived in a society very similar to this. He lived in the city called Oceania, during the year 1984. The book centered around Winston's life in this communist-like society. His life and everyone else's around him was controlled by someone or something only known to them as \\"Big Brother.\\" They were surrounded by signs constantly reminding them that \\"Big Brother is Watching.\\" Telescreens, or 2 way TV screens were mounted in almost every room, and street. Microphones were everywhere, monitoring every step you took. They lived their lives in constant fear that they would do something wrong, which would surely sentence them to the wrath of the Thoughtpolice, a task force organized by the \\"Party,\\" to keep order. This \\"Party,\\" supported, and represented Big Brother. A modified version of the English language called Newspeak was developed which completely centered around \\"The Party\\". Its vocabulary was limited to words that only supported the Party. All other words were eliminated. I thought this was a very good book. It was written very well, with strong imagery, and an interesting plot. It was a quick read, despite it's 300 pages. It touches on everyone's fears of communism, and gives you a different look at government."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"What else is there to say? Even those that didn't like this book must at least concede that it's extremely well-written - and I would wager that the overwhelming majority of those that didn't like this book are either 1) too young, or 2) simply didn't understand it.1984 is one of the classics of Western literature. If you're going to read an Orwell novel, read this before Animal Farm. Read both, but read 1984 first. It's entertaining and incredibly engaging."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I am particularly fascinated with Orwell's prophecy that the government would control the masses with pornography and support LOW class prostitution!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Wow! I read this after reading &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and found it fascinating. It's amazing that a book written so long ago could so vividly portray an author's prediction of how the world would be in 1984. Slightly scary, when you think of how Communism did take control of an empire. George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; is a classic that should always be remembered."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"When George Orwell penned his novel in 1948, he created a gritting and grim dystopian future like none ever before. With the fall of Fascism and the rise of Communism, the world seemed bent on becoming a slave to totalitarian rule.In the world of 1984, three superstates exist: Eurasia, Eastasia, and Oceania, who wage an endless war against one another for dominance over man, and supremacy over the world. The story is set in the city of Airstrip One, a place once known as London in ages past. A place where \\"war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength\\". A place where love for another is a crime, where family is an extension of the Gestapo-like Thought Police, and where thought and individuality can mean one's death.The story focuses around Winston Smith, an Outer Party member for Big Brother, the dominant and omniscient regime of Oceania. He works at the Ministry of Truth, a place where history is altered and fabricated to suit the needs of the Party; and where people can simply be erased from existence. Winston appears to be like the rest of the brainwashed citizens; pledging his love to the Party, hating those considered enemies, and accepting the propaganda imposed on the rest of the masses. Yet hidden inside himself, he longs to discover the truth of the past, and a way to break the iron grip of the Party. Orwell's vivid tale pulls the reader in, as Winston engages in a forbidden love affair, joins a resistance movement, and ultimately confronts his enemies in the chilling conclusion.Though the year may have passed us by, the ideas have manifested themselves throughout time, and will echo in the centuries to come."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is certainly a good book which fully explores this fascinating society. Winston's struggle was interesting, but it was the way this society was constructed that truly made this book great. I would encourage everyone to read it. The book starts off very slow, a little too slow for my taste, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five. Once it gets going, though, the book is truly engrossing. I was unable to put it down until the end."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"1984\\" by George Orwell is the kind of book that you only re-read because you didn't understand it the first time. While the concepts of the book are extremely intriguing, it lacks the kind of a plot line that would make it great. The lack of suspense and frequent drawn-out episodes make this book dry and very dense. The only things that got me through were the complex and extremely well thought out concepts which I couldn't stop thinking about. \\"1984\\" will cause you to rethink all that you know about the world you live in and make you pray that nothing like it will ever come to exist.With the single act of opening a blak diary, Winston Smith becomes an enemy of the Party, the totalitarian government led by a figure named Big Brother. \\"1984\\" follows Winston's fight against the oppressive government of the Party, including his search for an underground organization known as the Brotherhood and a secret love affair with another Party member. But in this world ruled by telescreens, doublethink, and the Thought Police, to oppose the Party is practically suicide. How can he know who to trust when falsification is the norm and the truth doesn't exist. Can he really expect to win against a government that has the power to rewrite the past and control human thought.I would recommend this book to people with a lot of patience. Anybody else will become frustrated before the first chapter ends on page 92. I would also recommend this book to anybody who has read \\"The DiVinci Code\\" or any of Dan Brown's other books. While not nearly as fast paced as \\"Angels and Demons\\", you will ensnared by the conceptual side of this book the same way I was. Overall, it's a good read for anybody that can handle complexity and density."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 deserves more than the usual, casual dismissal that, since communism is all but dead, we needn't worry about such things as totalitarianism spreading; democracy without end, amen. This is not true. Orwell may have written this at the beginning of the Cold War when we knew just how nasty life was in Russia, and looked to the USSR and Communism as its model. However, this could just as easily apply today.There are underlying themes in this book that apply to today's democracy-dominated world, unthreatened by the monolith of 1940's communism or fascism, just as they did in 1949, when this book was written.First, in the book they mention that people have the tendency to justify handing over power to a smaller, more efficient caste of people during an emergency. That's when it all starts to unravel. Give the government an inch and they will take a mile.When the press is not heterogenous and the government can influence it, you begin to have official lies. This happens in many countries that have \\"official state media\\" (think, the Middle East). Second, he mentions that when atrocities were committed by Oceania, they were considered noble but, committed by the enemy, were atrocities to be avenged. Be careful when you fight your enemy that you do not become just like him. It is when there is little difference between your tactics and that of whom you fight that you lose yourself and your identity as a human being.I could go on and on of countless examples, but these are just a few. You don't think a democracy could unravel? Think again. Read 1984."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"The book is very original and good. If you like a book that plays with your mind and questions the realities of the present and what will happen in the future, then this book will be great."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In this book George Orwell depicts a world in which a collective consciousness is imposed and controlled by a superbeing called the Party, which by excerting control over every individual's mind obtains control over what it calls 'truth'. Every person is one with the Party, which is personified by the infallible and omnipotent (but nonexistent) Big Brother. Through the individual story of Winston Smith, who initially attempts to rebel against the Party and is later tortured and molded to accept the 'truth' Orwell shows how a heartless totalitarian state might emerge and remain in power permanently by stripping people of all of what we tend to call 'human nature'.The book has the clear purpose of warning the reader of the dangerous path our society is following. Throughout the course of the twentieth century, and even in the present day, we can see signs of the kind of mind control described in this book, as well as several instances of blatant declarations of omnipotence. It is up to us (humans) to keep the gruesome world described by Orwell from ever coming into existence."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Even if you've read this book in the past, it's time to re-read it. More relevance now than ever. One of 'the' great books."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is about one man, Winston Smith, in a society that is really a physical and mental prison. When Winston believes he's found his own private space, however, he begins to do things - he begins to enjoy his freedom, extremely restricted though it is. Is there a happy ending? Does Winston continue to enjoy the fruits of his own privacy? Does he help topple the one party dictatorship? Read it and find out!I was very impressed with this book. I was impressed for two reasons: firstly it's beautifully written, despite its complexity; secondly, it has a sort of timeless relevance to our lives.The way Orwell expresses and captures sound, movement, thought and detail is really amazing: you read it and it's all vividly recreated in your mind - it can be scary. I think this may be because we are dealing with the darker side of human nature - POWER, its use and particularly its misuse.Secondly, and as many have commented on, this book has an important message. I don't want to give too much away to would be readers. For me, 1984 essentially raises questions about governance, privacy, control and power. These are issues we all, as citizens of our respective countries, should be greatly concerned about. Certainly, the society (if it can be called that) depicted in 1984 is one largely removed from modern democratic societies - it has greater direct resemblance with totalitarian regimes such as North Korea, or Stalin's time. But every time our governments enact new laws to increase there powers and reduce ours we need to think carefully and be cynical. In the age of the \\"war on terror\\" this book has great currency. I'll let you make the connections."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Maybe 1984 has come and gone, but its message is just as real as it was then. How much freedom are we willing to give up to feel safe? How much can we afford to believe the currant government? How much are they lying to us for thier own benifit? When did disagreeing with the governement become unamerican?1984 is a dreery story about what happens when there is no freedom. And I mean none. Real love is forbidden. Real thought is forbidden. All the matters is the love for the Party. And what the Party wants you to think.As the story goes on the major character does fall in love and sets out to destroy the party. I'm not going to give away the ending but I will tell you that its not a happy one.There was really only one way the story could have ended.I just hope things in real life don't end like that. But the older I get, the more I realize how close we are to 1984."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Does freedom bring happiness? Or does happiness come from control? These are the central themes of the great novel 1984, by George Orwell. In this novel, the reader follows Winston, through the futuristic world controlled by a group of people known as The Party. Winston works as a writer for the Ministry of Truth, where his job is to alter historical documents in favor of the Party, a common task that no one thinks poorly of. However, Winston feels that he's being lied to. The reader follows him as he strikes out to find out what freedom and happiness really is, and whether the Party is just.Orwell provides us with a shocking look at what the future may become. Even today, the United States government is taking steps towards becoming a \\"Big Brother.\\" With laws such as the Patriot Act, and No Child Left Behind, the government is slowly taking control of our freedoms. Perhaps, this novel's greatness is that it strikes close to home. Via remarkable characters that one can easily relate to, Orwell provides the reader a clear view of this futuristic world, both its marvels and flaws and provides a sense of realism into the piece. The reader wants to know why this form of living has come about and whether or not it is the right thing. Can people be happy free on their own? Must people be told how to live to attain this freedom? One must read to find out. Perhaps there is reason after all behind one of the Party's slogans: Freedom is Slavery."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell succeeds in capturing the reader's mind's once again as he did before in &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. Wheras Animal Farm might be considered a comical satire, 1984 takes another step in as a fictional perspective. In this case, George Orwell takes a stand as an oracle...he seems to conclude that sometime in the future communistic ideals may come into total control. I believe such ideas evolved throughout his influence during the World War II. It is not a wonder such dire predictions have been described. The book is a amalgamation of fiction, romance, politics, however beautifully combining them into a captivating and original novel. Definitely worth the time to read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"When my English teacher made a reference to 1984 I knew I had to read it and that was the best decision I ever made! 1984 is so deep with many twists and turns. Just the idea of &quot;crimethink&quot; and &quot;telescreens&quot; and &quot;big brother is watching you&quot; expresses the deep and futuristic feel of the entire book. Really relating to Winston and Julia helped a lot and when at first I thought it would be to deep for me as I am 13 I actually really enjoyed it alot. But you are warned. Once started you wil not be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"&quot;Thought Police.&quot; &quot;Big Brother.&quot; &quot;Orwellion.&quot; These words have become part of our national vocabulary because of George Orwell's classic novel &quot;1984,&quot; the story of one man's nightmare odyssey through a world ruled by warring states and a power structure that controls not only information but individual thought and memory. A minor functionary named Winston Smith joins a covert brotherhood and pursues a forbidden love affair against the cold, gray backdrop of the Republic of Oceania-only to become a hunted enemy of the state-and of Big Brother."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"In George Orwell's '1984' he describes a world that might someday be. Maybe even a hightened view of today's 'democracy'. In '1984' there are really only two classes- that of the party members and that of the proles. But no matter which you belong to, you are really the same, because you are born into a world where freedom is unknown. Born into a world where your future is pre-determined, and therefore, you are 'happy' in your ignorance. All of your actions and conversations are constantly monitored, and if you dare to challenge the rule that you are put under from birth, dire consequences are known to follow. So you grow up in only one world with only one option- that of obeying. And in your mind and in the minds of those around you, you become so accustomed to this system of unchallenged rule, that you begin to believe that it's right. This is a story of a man who suddenly awakens to the injustices of the Party. He examines the phsychology of the system and comes to understand just how the Party has manipulated and altered the past in order to control the future. I'm quite amazed at the depth of Orwell's knowledge and how he see's the precense of a ruling class in it's entirety. Throughout the novel he remains completely unbiased, and therefor gives us a true view of the mentality of government rule and how the working class comes to accept it. The only way that one could possibly dispute this book is if they came into it with an altered opinion, which is exactly what the book describes. This is really a work of genius and can change the way you view your life entirely. It's something that everyone should examine and study and try to understand. It really is an amazing piece of work."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This was the first time I had tried the &quot;futuristic&quot; genre- and I loved it! 1984 really made think- it was in-depth without being totally confusing. The characters are realistic and Orwell does a great job of describing how the citizens are controlled in the republic of Oceania. If you ever get the opportunity, read 1984- you will not be disappointed!!!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"An extraordinarily original and powerful novel, George Orwell's chilling masterpiece remains absolutely convincing, from the first sentence to the last four words.

The 1984 also talks about basic principles of freedom (&quot;It is freedom to say that 2+2 equal 4&quot;) and involves some other thematics such as birth of love and feelings in general in totalitarism which tends to be free of any kind of feelings.I fully recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This book offers very compehensive views for people who want to learn about how life inside the IronCurtain is like. IMHO, it is so well written that reading it beats reading tons of magazne articles on this subject. As a former citizen who lived in a communist country, I can testify that almost everything that Mr. Orwell wrote in his '1984' is truth to the point. Reading this book brings back all those nightmares that I had experienced and witnessed there myself. The thing I really like about this book is that although it's a very detailed piece of work documenting on the evils of a communistic social system, but the large amount of information presented in it had not bogged down the pace of the book at all. In fact, this book is a relative easy and fast paced read, thanks to the good writing skill of the author, the good structure of its presentation, and that sparkling but doomed romance that Orwell had geniously imcorporated into the story. All in all, this is a very worthy book for everyone to read about."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is a rather grim prediction for the future. The new world that it creates is frightening and surreal. The main character, Winston Smith, does not seem like the usual hero, yet at the same time one can't help liking his small rebellion. However, the total control excersised by the Party is alarming in its reality. Although George Orwell wrote this novel as a prediction for 1984, it is as significant today as it ever was. This book is definately worth reading. The style grabs you, and although the totalitarian society created could be confusing, the novel reads in a way that helps you to slowly understand each aspect of it. I would definately reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"1984 is centered around a male worker by the name of Winston Smith.

All around Oceania there are posters of Big Brother, and the Party's slogans are everywhere.WAR IS PEACE.FREEDOM IS SLAVERY.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.This book is a great look at totalitarianism and the views of the world during the 1940s-1950s (WW2).

How ironic someone would have know this was going to happen so many years ahead of time.Excellent reading and I don't normally read fiction."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Imagine, for a second, that tomorrow a large Atomic War starts, and the world is divided into three states. You are under the command of a leader called \\"Big Brother\\". Constantly on government surveillance, you try to escape Big Brother's listening and viewing devices, but, of course, you can't. Nobody can really escape.In the year 1984, bombs invade the city of London. On the Malabar Front a war starts, in another state of the world, called Eastasia. The Ministry of Truth, a government organization, broadcasts to the population via a network of telescreens. These devices, which intrude on all aspects of people's lives, are also capable of monitoring their every word and action. They form part of an immense surveillance system used by the Ministry of Love -another government organization- and its dreaded agents called Thought Police, to serve their singular goal: the elimination of \\"thought crime\\". Winston Smith is a Party worker; Part of the social party known as the Outer Party, the pity of the intrusive government. Winston works in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth - the government organization in charge of modifying historical news for consistency. When Winston finds proof that the Party is lying, he starts off on a journey of self-questioning. In doing so, he becomes a thought-criminal. Winston begins to notice that a young Party member, Julia, is watching him. She wears the special sash of the ultra-zealous Anti Sex League and Winston fears that she is an informant. However, to his surprise, she reveals herself as a subversive, and they begin a dangerous relationship. This inspires Winston to explore deeper the difference between propaganda and reality. Ultimately, it leads him to O'Brien - a member of the Inner Party who sets Winston on the beginning of an amazing discovery.The book 1984 is a perfect read for anyone that is willing to see the world in a whole new aspect. Not written to a specific group of people, this book can be perceived from any point of view, and from any part of a modern-day- society. One reason people should read this book is because it sees the government from a whole new perspective. The book, 1984 was published in 1949. It predicts the way that a slightly communist government, would function in the future. What I find completely surprising, is that many of the futuristic devices in the book 1948 have become true to this day. When you put a good amount of thought into it, it all becomes reality. Today the government watches our every move through computer, phone, and ever video surveillance. It's scary to think that even now, as you read this, someone could be watching you. Also, the government still hides secrets through propaganda press. Another reason why this book should be read, is because it has a large array of quotes, such as: \\"War is peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength\\" (Orwell, 1949, p.27). It provides the reader with a complete set of wisdom and knowledge through its quotation and lessons. The last reason that I will share, why someone should read this book, is because it keeps your interest. Even though the book isn't exactly a fast read, it's completely addicting the entire way through. Keeping your hands off of it is an almost impossible task to accomplish. It contains the ability to keep the attention of a monkey, and yet can relate to someone with the intelligence of Einstein.In conclusion everyone, and I mean everyone, should read this book. With its perspective of government conspiracy, relation to modern day life, knowledgeable quotes, ability to contain attention, and its intelligent relation; I am positive it will keep you, and anyone else, on the edge of their seat.-Jonathan Lightcap"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This is the classic and the mould of the dystopian narrative. Clearly written to explore the plausibility of what would happen if the technocratic regime of the socialist state was allowed to take its course, it stretches beyond this very palpable social critique. The final part is the most disturbing and harrowing as one can almost feel Winston's physical and psychological torment in a world that forbids love and legitimates peace through fear.I am amazed that this was written so long ago since these drives in social order seem so shockingly prevalent and the spectre of war as a lever to condition responses from the masses is clearly a vehicle even in the US. It does slowdown in the middle with the very transparent political commentary wrought by Goldstein's manual. Yet the impact of what abuse and harnessing of technical, psychological, social, and political power punches hard at the end."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I did not personally choose to read 1984 and at first had I no interest whatsoever, however that quickly changed when I got past the peculiar lingo of \\"newspeak\\" (annoyed me that I had to keep jumping to the back of the book for the meanings). Orwell intrigued me with his descriptive writing and caused me to hang on his every word as Wilson Smith, the main character, went about his life in a supposed Utopia. The fact that Big Brother, an unknown and possibly inexistent force, has so much control over this world. At first I was skeptic as to how on point Orwell would be predicting what may occur in the future but he was somewhat dead on. The entire movement of \\"The Party\\" seemed like modern day communism - everyone was referred to as comrade and no one had any say and couldn't even think negatively about anything that may have seemed wrong in society, for the thought police would get you. No one was treated better nor worse except if you were a traitor, then you were VAPORIZED!!!! As funny as it may sound, If Orwell had used actual countries, I would of thought it was factual, rather than some prophetic vision.One of my favorite scenes in 1984 was when Julia, Wilson's lover, came back from a proletarian quarter of the town wearing make-up and speaking of wearing a womans frock. I reminded me of a scene out of Pleasantville. She was only person with rouge cheeks and deeply reddened lips and make-up dabbed here and there, she stood out like a sore thumb.The importance of castes and war, erasing the past and replacing it with falsified information, hiding from the authorities, and only feeling safe when the lights are out; Orwell makes you wonder if theses rules still apply in modern time.I suggest more people read this or any other by George Orwell, I plan on reading Animal Farm next."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Brilliant literature!I recommend all books by this author.I also love the fact that the publisher, 1stWorld Library has made the text slightly larger which is a blessing for my thirty-something eyes.

Winston, (the main character), lives in a totalitarian society and basically comes to realise that He wants to change his way of life and wants to be able to control his own destiny. By doing so he risks all that he is just to live a \\"normal\\" life. Without saying too much, please read this book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"This classic utopian novel depicts a mad, fascist world, where truth is controlled by the government, and independent thought is illegal. Compassion for others is punishable by death; the only love allowed is for \\"Big Brother\\" who is always watching you through telescreens that permeate everywhere. The world is divided up into three superpowers, East Asia, Eurasia, and Oceania, which consists of the Americas and the former British Empire including London where this novel is set. The world is in a constant state of war. All social and technological progress has halted. All humanistic values like peace and love are crushed. The fascist government has complete control over every aspect of people's lives, including their thoughts.The people are in a perpetual state of poverty. The proles are the ignorant, listless lower class. The Outer party is the middle class, where our protagonist, Winston, resides; they do most of the so-called professional work for the Inner Party, though still live in abject misery. They work grueling hours in tiny cubicles, delivering misinformation to an ignorant public. (Sound familiar?) Sex is not to be enjoyed by party members; it is only for procreation. (Does this sound familiar?) Any violation is constituted a sexcrime. The English language is being stripped of words, butchered, and consolidated; OldSpeak is being translated into NewSpeak, a simplistic language consisting of compound words like DoubleSpeak. The people are incited into anger against their opponent in war and Goldstein, the leader of an imaginary opposition. It is a fascist world that crushes what is left of humanity.Winston, likely named by the author after Winston Churchill, is a middle-aged man working in the Outer Party. He begins to rebel against the fascist state by writing a journal in secrecy, committing thoughtcrimes, and entering to an illicit affair with the young Julia. He is betrayed by O'Brien, an Inner Party member, who seduces him with the truth. Winston and Julia are caught in bed and sent to the Ministry of Love, where they are tortured and brainwashed. In the end, they betray each other, and Winston confesses his love for Big Brother.This is a haunting, depressing novel, but a very important read. The political allegories can be applied to society today; it is intended as a warning to us. This novel is engrossing, thought-provoking, intelligent, and very-well written. George Orwell's \\"1984\\" is an educational, fascinating description of a totalitarian world."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Firstly: This Kindle book supports X-ray. I'm posting that here because I don't see any way to search for x-ray enabled books, which seems to me like a huge feature oversight for Amazon...Secondly: I was reading Escape From Camp 14, and so much of what is talked about in there sounds like it's straight from 1984, so I had to line it up for another read once I finish EFC14. If you pay attention to N Korea, read 1984 and remember how long ago it was written. Orwell was a genius."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"\\"1984\\" was written as a warning of what could happen when Government controls every aspect of our lives. I could imagine that it would gradually (with emphasis on the gradually) happen as government would slowly but surely take over aspects of our lives before it takes over completely.Most people would agree that government control is negative- but most would disagree on what aspect of our lives government needs to control or should I say to handle in order to keep us \\"safe\\".I would love to see a prequel to \\"1984\\" perhaps call it \\"1983\\" (or \\"The 1970's\\"). It would be interesting to see perspectives and perceptions that led up to a country such as the one depicted in \\"1984\\".JR FelisildaAuthor of the book,\\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\""},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"What can I say? It's 1984. Most people have seen enough references that they understand the word \\"Orwellian\\", \\"Thought police\\", \\"New speak\\", or \\"Big Brother\\" even if they've never read this.Nevertheless, reading it gives a much clearer view of these concepts.1984 is on a short list of books that have probably prevented the very totalitarian societies they predict. It fills the reverse function of the books fictional \\"Newspeak\\" -- it adds to our vocabulary and therefore to our ability to think and defend ourselves against oppression.I read this while I was also studying cults and mind control, and Orwell captures these concepts very well in this fictional dystopian world."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Even though this book has been out for a number of years, it is more appropriate today than the day it was written. It labors through some detail but ties is all together by the close. It will cause you to see today's headlines in a new light."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"George Orwell was such a talented and vivid writer that can paint a picture in your head with his words. This is such an incredible story that has lessons that still hold true today. Great book, great read, I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I don't usually read slow, passive, and thought-provoking books. Don't get me wrong though, I enjoy getting my thoughts provoked, just not usually at slower paces with passive characters. But even still, it was the way the world was and the thoughts of this one man, our protagonist, that drew me into this book so well. It's frightening how well our society was predicted by this book. Obviously it's not an exact match, but the ideas behind the book hit close to home; almost too close for comfort. I highly recommend this book to everyone that is literate. If you're not literate, learn to read just for this book."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"I decided to read 1984 because every single book list on the web recommended it on its top twenty. I can now see why! This book seems to me to be the basic foundation for every revolutionary idea, rebellious thought, or conformist ideology that was written in our modern time. I was mesmerized, betrayed, bewitched, and baffled by how real it felt especially since the world today is witnessing similar kind of revolution in the shape of the Arab Spring. It was a wonder to equate this work of fiction into reality and ponder if the very revolution he depicted can be stifled through the destruction of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"Packed with promiscuity, cursing, and rebellion 1984 was unlike any other classic. This book has many present day references despite being written in 1949. Relevant and surprisingly insightful 1984 was a great read."},{"Title":"Nineteen Eighty-four","review":"My coworker was telling me about the movie, and the book. I loved it. It is quite scary how he predicted today's government and politics. Great read, open your eyes more into reality."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],N={key:0},q={key:1};function P(n,e,s,c,r,a){const m=f("PoemCard");return t(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",W,[(t(!0),i(w,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(h,y)=>(t(),p(m,{key:y,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(t(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),i("span",q,"Loading...")):(t(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const C=u(B,[["render",P],["__scopeId","data-v-cc472aca"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/10.md","filePath":"quotes/10.md"}'),H={name:"quotes/10.md"},j=Object.assign(H,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),i("div",null,[v(C)]))}});export{G as __pageData,j as default};
