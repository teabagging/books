After I'd been playing a year or two I bought this book which made the reasoning behind some of the rules I'd been following blindly and altered radically my own approach to teaching the game to others. It's also generally fun to read and one section flows nicely into the next. My one complaint: The edition I have is printed on very cheap paper and I'm not sure how long it will last. Hope it comes back into print soon!"},{"Title":"Building Bridge: New, Quick, & Easy Way to Learn America's Favorite Card Game","review":"I'm just a beginner learning Bridge by all different means - computer programs, books, and so on, but not with real people and not on-line yet.

There are too many characters and none are developed to an extent that you can actually relate to them. For a first book, it isn't bad, but it certainly doesn't justify the exorbitant price for a short paperback.

As they pick up scientists for transfer, they prepare to head to Starbase 6 for needed rest and repairs. While stopped briefly to make some adjustments to the failing dilithium crystals, they are suddenly attacked by a Klingon warship that seems to come out of nowhere. When the threat is averted, the Klingon captain appears on the screen, and swears a blood oath to kill Kirk in revenge for killing his brother.With that now hanging over his head, Kirk must divert to a planet in an unsurveyed sector, that has sent an application for admission to the Federation. As it is deemed that this must be answered without delay, the Enterprise is diverted there. After beaming down, Kirk and company find themselves unable to commit the smallest act of a violent nature. A virus has been created on Perry's Planet, which acts to disable the individual when the biochemical buildup to violent action is begun. With the Klingon ship in wait for them, the consequences could be disasterous.Jack Haldeman is the older brother of Joe Haldeman, noted science fiction and Star Trek author, and an accomplished short-story writer on his own merits. Haldeman crafts a strong if short tale here, which seems to have been padded some from a short story length. Haldeman effectively uses the characters, and keeps them IN character, including giving some time to Scotty, Uhura, Sulu and Chekov. The writing is not soaring, but it is solid, and the story will keep the reader interested."},{"Title":"Perry's planet","review":"Having just finished the tedious Next Gen novel Ghost Ship, Perry's Planet was just what the doctor ordered. The Bantam novels in general were much more simple, streamlined affairs than the Pocket novels to follow. No space wasted on character interaction or inner monologues - just a bare-bones story (pun not intended).Perry's Planet is almost magic in the way it evokes the original series. The novel sounds and feels uncannily like an episode. The plot, like so many of the original series episodes, is a recycled hodge-podge from other episodes, including a Landru-esque society and computer program, and a pacifying virus akin to the spores from \\"This Side of Paradise.\\" A Klingon death vow starts the novel off with a bang but otherwise does not live up to its promise. Wonderfully concise, Perry's Planet provides a couple of hours worth of mindless, enjoyable entertainment."},{"Title":"Perry's planet","review":"This is one of the great \`non-episode' Star Trek books. This is one of the few books true to the spirit and style of the original stories. It's funny how many times other Trek fans have mentioned this one as one of their favortie Star Trek novels. It keeps coming back into print and I would love to see it re-released - say in a collection with some other Star Trek classics. If you are a fan and you haven't read it then this is a must have. It will really take you back to the old days."},{"Title":"Perry's planet","review":"I daresay this is the best Star Trek novel Bantam company has published. This author really is the first one to realize Klingon concept of honor. A pity the others didn't until TNG debuted."},{"Title":"Perry's planet","review":"This was one of the first novels based on the original Star Trek series, and while it has many of the characteristics of the following books in the series, there is a difference. The later books have tighter storylines as the authors and editors perfected the formula.In this book, a Klingon ship whose captain is on a blood vendetta against Kirk attacks an Enterprise with a tired crew. The Enterprise easily beats off the attack, but the Klingons also plant a device that wrecks havoc in the transporter room. Kirk and company are then called on to respond to a request by a planet to start the process of joining the Federation.Not everything in the planet is at it appears to be, as there are some unusual anomalies. While the leaders claim there is no violence, in fact there is, but the people do not notice it. The planet is actually ruled by a computer interfaced with Wayne Perry, the leader of the group that colonized the planet centuries ago. Perry's image is resurrected by the computer as a solid hologram when problems erupt.I found this story, which is essentially another one about berserk computers that take over a society, to be rather dull. The subplot regarding the Klingons was almost a distraction rather than an improvement. The manner in which the device was planted in the transporter was never resolved and stating that it was a simple device was unconvincing. A virus that prevents a person from committing violence and acts instantaneously on humans and Klingons exceeds my believability index.Yet, it is Star Trek and it is always great to read about the characters of the series."},{"Title":"The Signature of All Things","review":"Simply amazing!

It is deep, but it is providing me guidance."},{"Title":"Mister Stormalong,","review":"According to Anne Malcolmson's \\"Acknowledgements\\", this 1952 book was the first volume completely dedicated to the exploits of Alfred Bulltop Stormalong, the Paul Bunyan of the seven seas. Born in Kennebunkport, Maine of a long line of seafarers, young Stormy is cradled in a dory and cuts his teeth on whalebone. When he is thirteen years old, the thirty foot tall youth begins his sailing career as a cabin boy on a trade ship. During the course of his life at sea, Stormalong rides a whale like a bucking bronco; wrestles a giant octopus; battles the giant kraken; soaps the Cliffs of Dover; becomes captain of the enormous windjammer Tuscarora; improves his ship's design with fanciful discoveries and innovations; and successfully races the clipper ship Flying Cloud and the steamship Liverpool Packet.Dell McCormick obtained the tales in this volume from four previously published collections of traditional stories (all listed in the \\"Acknowledgements\\") and added previously unpublished legends he obtained by interviewing old-time seamen. Although he completed the research for this book, he unfortunately did not complete a final draft before his tragically sudden death.While the tales are well researched, their presentation suffers from Anne Malcolmson's writing, which is not as colorful, humorous or deliciously exaggerated as that found in other collections of tall tales. Joshua Tolfords' numerous and detailed black and white line illustrations add interest to this otherwise uninspired book."},{"Title":"Credit Mobilier (The Railroads)","review":"Short and sweet. Only 71 pages. Submitted as Masters thesis. Could have used more development. What there is isn't bad."},{"Title":"Heverly","review":"Heverly drew my attention for being the product of special effects visionary, Kevin Yagher, famous for his work in special effects make up and animatronics, with such achievements under his belt as Chucky from the Child's Play series, Tales From the Crypt's Cryptkeeper, and, nearest to my heart, the iconic make up of Freddy Krueger as he appeared in Nightmares on Elm Street 2-4. No stranger to story telling, he was instrumental in the development of the 1999 Sleepy Hollow film. With these qualifications in mind, I purchased Heverly with high hopes. My desire for a striking visual was more than sated. This book is unique in its execution. In lieu of tradition art, the pictures are elaborate photographs, starring puppets and effect wizardry created by Yagher. The result is one of the most visually dynamic and unique storybooks I have ever seen. It weaves a familiar feeling fantasy story, which is, at times, weak, and at others, forces you to question just who the target audience is. Even so, it is an enjoyable experience and clearly a labor of love. For what I understand to be Yagher's first foray into publishing, it is a strong effort, weakened only by a slipshod layout. For the amount of attention and detail that went into the photos, the layout is weak, with blurry, mismatched frames taking away from the lush beauty of his spreads. Even so, for fan of fantasy, illustrated fiction, or Kevin Yagher himself, this is a book that most definitely belongs in your library."},{"Title":"Heverly","review":"I tend to agree with the School Library Journal's review that storyline is somewhat lacking, especially for the targeted audience of 7-10 year-old readers. But my 4-year old daughter absolutely loves this book, she has us read it to her over and over again. Perhaps the proof is in the pudding -- a wonderful, fantastic tale for a younger audience. Your pre-schooler will love this book, and so I recommend it accordingly."},{"Title":"Persian Cats and Other Longhairs","review":"If you are interested in cats, previously had Persians, have Persians now or are thinking about getting a Persian cat this is the book for you.This is the absolute best book on Persian cats out there. Unsurpassed in its wealth of information - especially about breeding and colors. Hundreds of lovely pictures (both color and black/white). Anything you want to know about Persian cats is in here.Jeanne Ramsdale bred chinchilla Persians (also called silver Persians) under the prefix - or cattery name - 'Dearheart'. Her cats were magnificent and to this day stand out for their exceptional beauty. Just to see the photos of these cats - the book is well worth buying.Jeanne Ramsdale's love for the Persian cat is obvious throughout - the book is well written and always interesting. She writes knowingly about all aspects of cat care and breeding.Most of the photos are from the 1960's and 1970's - so this book is also a great historical record about the Persian cat.The 1976 edition is recommended - it comes in a revised edition with nice sturdy binding.Highly recommended to any cat lover !"},{"Title":"Persian Cats and Other Longhairs","review":"The author is my great-auntie on my mother's side.

However Gabe Morrison is not alone as his canine accompanies him as guests of the Cupid's Hideaway B&amp;B for the Christmas-in-July celebration. He, like Meg, is hiding as he suffers from writer's block unable to write the next witty advertising jingle though his Love My Tender jingo is the hit of the land. However, every time Gabe comes into contact with Meg, especially the merging of their lips, he feels stimulated to work on the ad campaign, making enthusiastic progress. Still he has a more important sell to make as he wants Meg to motivate him forever.This is a warm amusing tale that will send fans searching for Cupid's Hideaway. The story line avoids inanity due to a solid secondary cast led by Maisie, her beau, and an assortment of guests, and the roughest tag team on the planet. Fans of a humorous well written tale, but avoid the cholesterol of those tasty Time Burgers.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Noel","review":"Robert W. Arnold's &quot;Noel&quot;, is an exciting book I bought and actually enjoyed reading it. He had set his dream to write something like a book and he finally made it! For a long time since I know that he did say something years and years ago. So there is a book, he did done a fine job and I am proud of him. I know him as my old classmate (at Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind, Staunton) and a friend (I'm not sure at this time since I had not seen him almost ten years ago!) So well, I am telling you before you start to roll your eyes, this book is set for the Christmas holidays, but I think he's late and the Easter Bunny is more than happy to do his favor to publish it and put it on the market. I think I had my money worth buying the book and I rather not to say that I am lending him my support for his living expenses in the West coast. But actually he did it for the first time and I had seen his ambition in storytelling and he's creative in making the stories when we were the kids. I have to think hard to see if these stories told in the past were true or just plainly exaggerated? Oh well, he did it anyway. The book is so great, real funny at the most, and at least it is the thought-provoking story. Beware about the famous Dr. Feltgood syndrome! Uh? Yes! At least, it did made me feel so great after done reading the book, mind you! The characters created in the book are almost real and easily follow where the story led. Hilarious ones especially for Mr. Tyme! The big guy in the book, Howard Peel,eventually draw you in his world about his consciences after he brought his town into chaos, despair and anger after he once brought them alive with happiness and the riches of the prosperity. And also he ran away, seeking for the perfect gift for the town to redeem his failures but had not seen him for a year, building consequences against him. The tale told by Howard Peel had succeeded to peel the layers of guilt, greed, rich lifestyles and blind ambition of the free enterprise. The distinction of the tale between the town and the dream world seems similar but convincing. Even the outcome at the ending, bringing a hope, not abandoning the purpose to celebrate the Christmas. Wow, it is an unique story! He did wrote something in resemblances of his people in Virginia but nothing in the book is purely coincidental. Who knows? I can tell you to go on and to get the book, read it and you would be glad you did it. I applaud you for the finest writing and hope to see your second book coming real soon!"},{"Title":"Noel","review":"This book has so many incredible parts. The best part, in my honest opinion, is the character Mr. Tyme - his encounters with the main character Howard Peel are hilarious, yet after a while you realize they are truly profound and amazing. The whole book, set around a Christmas crisis, fools you into thinking it's one of these disgustingly cheerful books about Christmas. And while it IS a feel-good book ultimately, the vivid images conjured up by the author's hand are just amazing. Non-preachy moral lessons, amazing visual imagery, and humor - what more can you ask for from a book?Buy it no matter what the season."},{"Title":"The Third Choice: A Woman's Guide to Placing a Child for Adoption","review":"As a birthmother I found this book very helpful and even comforting. There are no words to say how wonderfully the authors captured the difficulty of the decision to place a child for adoption nor the greatness of the openness that they talk about in the book."},{"Title":"The Third Choice: A Woman's Guide to Placing a Child for Adoption","review":"While would-be adoptive parents have many books to help them in their journey, I have seen very few that address the trials facing a woman who is contemplating an adoptive placement. This book is an excellent resource for a woman in that position. Written by two adoption social workers, the book covers all aspects of an adoptive placement: deciding whether adoption is the right choice, choosing the type of adoption, finding the right adoptive parents, getting through the pregnancy and birth, and processing the grief and loss. No book can replace counseling, but this one would be the next best thing for those who refuse counseling (and a great adjunct for those who are getting counseling). I would also recommend it for waiting adoptive parents, because it will help them to better understand what birth parents go through.My only nit with the book is that it tries to cover a lot of ground without getting too long, resulting in fairly shallow treatment of some topics that deserve more depth.I am an adoptive parent seeking to adopt again, and I will try to make sure that any prospective birth mother we work with reads this book!"},{"Title":"The Third Choice: A Woman's Guide to Placing a Child for Adoption","review":"Mosconi and Foge are right on.

Mosconi and Foge are knowledgeable, informative and true advocates for birthparents, adoptive families and the open adoption process. This book is a 10 and I would recommend it to both birthparents and adoptive parents. There is no other adoption book like it, it is unique and very easy to read.

I found myself relating to every topic and question. Yes, I know the choice to place is one of the most difficult choices anyone may every have to make, but you overcome your grief. Your child is never forgotten, and he or she remains within your soul forever. Very few right choices are easy ones to make.

However it breaks down completely whenever the author deals with the issue of Birth Parent grief. Birth Parent grief and pain doesn't decrease or disappear after a year...it's a lifelong process that never ends. Some women do become overwhelmed with grief the first year and turn to emotional numbness as a temporary way to find relief from the pain....but this emotional defense only lasts so long...eventually the pain &amp; grief resurfaces in their life in the forms of: depression, anger, low self-esteem, etc. It's a shame that the authors didn't talk to any experienced Birth Parents about the true course and direction of grief. They took the easy way out and claimed that the pain goes away in a year...comforting for adoptive parents to hear...but none of my Birth Parent friends would agree with this claim!! Read books written by real Birth Mothers if you want to understand how wrong this book is about adoption loss &amp; grief."},{"Title":"The Third Choice: A Woman's Guide to Placing a Child for Adoption","review":"All the legal information in this book is spot on. That's all I can say that is positive about this book. The sections on emotional processing and grief, I felt, were directly damaging to the reader. The essence, I felt, was \\"get up and walk it off\\". I've not seen a book written by social workers that was this emotionally dishonest in years! What little information there was about the emotional and personal ramifications of an adoption plan were notintegrated into a fully human understanding.The \\"section\\" on birthfathers was positively insulting! A scant paragraph remarking that they usually aren't there and may or may not experience many of the same emotions as the birth mother was all the effort the authors put in. Combined with language and syntax choices that were generally mildly to moderately sexist (against men) this book made me feel angrier, more ashamed and more powerless than before I had read it!Best used as kindling."},{"Title":"The Third Choice: A Woman's Guide to Placing a Child for Adoption","review":"Birthmothers get over their grief in a year? Get real!! It's too bad these two authors (who just happen to be social workers) didn't get it right! That part of the book is very misleading for those contemplating adoption; it takes us back to the Dark Ages (i.e. most of the last century) when birthmothers were told they would get over it. (Most didn't!) For another slant on adoption, I suggest the book written by Merry Bloch Jones. Also the book by Gediman and Brown. A biography on this subject is Search for Paul David."},{"Title":"The Goebbels Diaries, 1942-1943.","review":"In 'The Goebbles Diaries, 1942-43,' we are given a glimpse into the mind of Nazi Germany's genius of propaganda and one of Hitler's most trusted lieutenants. These diaries shed light on the Nazis view of Churchill, Stalin and all the other central figures of the era. Goebbels also tells us of the anger he and other leading Nazis felt over the defection of Italy to the allied camp, dealing with the devastating allied air raids, and the fear and anxiety over the revearses on the Eastern front. Unfortunatley, these pages don't give us as clear a view of Hitler as one would hope and passages dealing with the Holocaust are few and far between. In all, Goebbels presents himself as a champion of National Socialist ideals who is loved by Germany and respected by his enemies. What one really sees is the almost ridiculous opptimism that Goebbels held through these years of struggle. It is surprising just how firm was Goebbel's conviction that victory was certain. Those interested in the Third Reich should read Goebbel's diaries as it is a rare look into this troubled time written by one of it's greatest criminals."},{"Title":"The Goebbels Diaries, 1942-1943.","review":"Dr. Joseph Goebbels was one of the most influentual and feared persons in the Third Reich. With strong influence on Hitler he managed to control virtually every important activity in the Reich. His diary undoubtably shows an extremely unscrupulous man, prepared to risk anything to achieve his beliefs (the tributes that are usually linked to Machiavelli could find even more proper place here). But he has done his homework well. He brilliantly understood the meaning of propaganda and its real influence on masses and he devised the methods to use it to all extent. We can read from his point of view how he was sailing in the dangerous seas of internal and international affairs and though his style of writing and thinking are not very nice due to his immense mental brutallity, we must admit that he was very succesful at what he was doing. Pure efficiency. It is very nice to learn something about a man who wrote history not so far ago, although it could be deadly for many among us. The understanding of his thought and point of view allows us to see the WWII in somehow another perspective. It must prepare us for actions to prevent such events from happening in the future."},{"Title":"The Goebbels Diaries, 1942-1943.","review":"In recent years, some (e. g., Yehuda Bauer, Steven T. Katz) have contended that the Jews were the only people in history to be targeted for COMPLETE extermination. Limiting oneself to the contents of this volume, consider this (December 14, 1942): \\"The Jewish race has prepared this war; it is the spiritual originator of the whole misfortune that has overtaken humanity. Jewry must pay for its crime just as our Fuehrer prophesied in his speech in the Reichstag: namely, by the wiping out of the Jewish race in Europe and possibly in the entire world.\\" (pp. 243-244). The fact that the extermination of Jews would not necessarily have continued beyond Europe itself refutes the uniqueness of the Holocaust.As late as March 7, 1942, Goebbels had still been entertaining a Final Solution that would send all European Jews to Madagascar (p. 116). In other entries, he was completely candid about the physical extermination of Jews (e. g., p. 86, 92; 243-244). However, Jews were not the only scapegoats; nor were they the only ones blamed for starting WWII. On April 17, 1943, Goebbels wrote: \\"... [Poles]...were the real instigators of this war....\\" (p. 332). After Mussolini's fall, Goebbels commented: \\"The plot hatched against us in Rome was backed by the monarchy, aristocracy, society, higher officers, Free Masons [Freemasons], Jews, industrialists, and clerics.\\" (p. 445). Nor were Jews necessarily the only ones supposed to be overly powerful. On April 30, 1942, Goebbels entertained fantasies of Poles being behind the panic of the Germans of Rostock following the devastating RAF attack (p. 197).There are veiled references to the planned extermination of Poles and other Slavs. Hitler is quoted as forbidding all sexual activity between German soldiers and Polish women (p. 95). On February 15, 1942, Goebbels commented: \\"...Slavs, he [Heydrich] emphasized, cannot be educated as one educates a Germanic people. One must either break them or humble them constantly.\\" (p. 88). The first step in genocide is the denial of the humanity of those targeted. The well-known de-humanization of Jews extended to Slavs, as on January 27, 1942:\\"The incidents that Sepp Dietrich related to me about the Russian people in the occupied areas are simply hair-raising. They are not a people but a conglomeration of animals.\\" (p. 52). Likewise, on March 20, 1942, Goebbels wrote: \\"But we, too, must realize that we shall have to fill with human beings such wide spaces in the East as we shall conquer. In geography, there can be no spaces without human beings...\\" (p. 139). The implication is obvious: Slavs are not human beings!Goebbels repeatedly (p. 388, 396, 399, 456) mentions the growing successes of Polish guerilla actions (e. g., May 27, 1943: \\"Conditions in the General Government appear to be more than catastrophic. Every day there are attempts at assassination and acts of terror, without our authorities being able to do anything about it. The German population and our administrative officialdom seem to yield, not to say capitulate, to these conditions.\\")(pp. 399-400). Goebbels even probably alludes to the successful Polish Underground action in the Zamosc area (May 25, 1943): \\"Suddenly, however, he [Zoerner] received order for resettlement that had a very bad effect on morale. Some 50,000 Poles were to be evacuated to begin with. Our police were able to grab only 25,000; the other 25,000 joined the Partisans. It is not hard to imagine what consequences that had for the whole area. Now he was to evacuate about 190,000 more Poles. This he refused to do, and in my opinion he was right.\\" (p. 396).Goebbels repeatedly discusses the Katyn massacre (p. 318, 328, 336, 346, 354, 487); triumphantly claiming personal responsibility for the ensuing Soviet-Polish split (p. 346). Didn't Goebbels realize that, had Katyn never come to light, Stalin would've broken with the Polish government-in-exile on some other pretext? However, Goebbels does smell the developing sellout of Poland: (e. g., April 29, 1943: \\"The Poles are given a brush-off by the English and the Americans as though they were enemies.)\\" (p. 347). According to Lochner, the translator, Stalin had, already on February 23, 1942, claimed that the Soviets alone were doing all of the fighting (pp. 257-258). This became a mainstay of Communist propaganda and, more durably, an excuse for the west's sellout of Poland. However, the west's inability to restrain Stalin is refuted by the fact that, by this date, the US had already shipped 2,900,000 tons of material to the USSR (p. 258). As for threats of a separate peace, it went both ways. Ironically, Hitler himself had preferred a German-English separate peace over a German-Soviet one (p. 435).Allied carpet bombing has often been second-guessed on moral and tactical grounds. In fact, the impracticality of selective targeting had been discovered early in the war. Hitler realized this (p. 190), and Goebbels added that the dislocations caused by area bombing reduce wartime productivity much more than the destruction of a munitions plant (p. 462).The translator Lochner (p. ix), based on some of Goebbels's entries (p. 138, 142, 146, 375), contents that the Nazis intended to destroy Christianity after winning the war. Public crucifixes were removed (p. 141), and Hitler saw the Christian doctrine of redemption as insane (p. 375). Hitler also re-affirmed his support of vegetarianism (p. 188)."},{"Title":"The Goebbels Diaries, 1942-1943.","review":"I have to say that this isn't a 5-star work because of the writing, the criterion I normally use when dishing out parts of galaxies. It's because I think the book should be read by anyone wanting to gain a glimmer of understanding into what became one of the most powerfully focused minds in the last century. Regardless of the pros and cons of Goebells being allowed to retain even honorary posthumous citizenship of an Earth he seemed bent on destroying, it is enlightening to read the words he set down. Obviously they were never intended to be seen by the likes of you or me, let alone those in power, who later had a chance to peruse them at their leisure. If only the good (sic) doctor had known.Anyway, following this gentleman of uncertain disposition down the path to what must have been close to madness (he must have had to stave madness off quite madly) and what was, an untimely death (in more ways than one), is an exercise that all students of human nature will finally be glad they chose to do.

The friend further remarked that listening to Goebbels speak, you'd've followed him anywhere! to any ideology! . . .This is Goebbels' first-hand account of the whole Nazi game. Pay particular attention to where Goebbels addresses you, dear reader, and where he writes with posterity in mind.

So when Pearl Harbor was bombed she was the only person who voted against war--though a few days later she voted for war against Germany. She was somewhat eccentric and was active in the anti-war movement during the Vietnam era though not in full sync with the moving spirits in that endeavor.

By holding back the dike with his hand, he learns the beauty of self-sacrifice for others, and receives respect and praise from his family and neighbors. This picture book is too dramatic for tiny children; it is much more suitable for children about eight years old and up. There are a couple of crude parts that could have improved the book by being left out (the man who rescues Jan is a man of ill-repute--could not he have been a man of valor who is the night-watchman?), but over all it is an entertaining book which has breath-taking artwork and brings to life the ancient children's tale."},{"Title":"The Boy Who Held Back the Sea","review":"This is a classic story about a boy who held back the sea (and cried wolf more than once).

Considering her age and experience I can see how she would want her mother when she thought Alex had been killed. She had been through a lot at that point with little or no guidance from the other adults in her life. The time in India was the best part of the book. I agree with the other reviews I think she would have been happier with Akbar. The had me crying when she had to leave."},{"Title":"This Heart of Mine","review":"Let's get some perspective. Velvet is a character that really grows and develops through the course of this lump of a novel. She begins as a whiny little girl only to come out a resourceful woman at the end. Honestly I haven't read many romance novels where a character's development has been so well done.That being said, the rest of the novel is a veritable travesty. Off the top, I cannot possibly believe that Adam de Marisco and Skye O'Malley would make an arranged marriage for their only &quot;miracle&quot; daughter in the first place. If I'm not mistaken, her parents' absence during important formative years of her life is what's responsible for Velvet's outraged attitude towards marriage and, well, life. It's good that there's an excuse, because otherwise it doesn't make much sense that an Elizabethan girl would raise such hell about a betrothal.As for the betrothed, Alex Gordon, whatever else you can say about him, he is a real character. Sure he's thoughtless and insensitive and every bit as involved in his own needs as Velvet is in hers. In later books he's said to have become Velvet's virtual love slave, however this book ends leaving me with a feeling of two strong individuals working on an equal relationship. At least Alex doesn't fizzle and mellow out by the end.The real fly in the ointment here would be Velvet's time in India and her sublime love with the emperor Akbar. Better to have left Alex for dead and developed a storyline about Velvet's love in the exotic wilds of India. That would have thrown some much needed spice into the O'Malley series. Above all, Velvet genuinely falls in love with Akbar--isn't that what romance is all about? Their daughter is like a natural sanction of their union. I think Small made a huge mistake in bringing Velvet back to England and to a situation that was tenuous at best.Nevermind enough name dropping that picking them all up would break your back. William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, Walter Ralegh, Bess Throckmorton...it goes on, but thanks Ms. Small for letting us know you can read an encyclopedia. Let's not forget Queen Elizabeth's actual speech delivered to her troops at Tilbury Plain.

After that he went nuts, first kidnapping his betrothed wife and then taking Alanna for his mistress. What an a**!!Like some other reviewers, I also thought Velvet should have stayed in India. Akbar taught her the meaning of true love (while introducing her to some very kinky sex!!)I was amused by Small's description of the loss of Velvet's virginity, when Alex can't even last long enough to satisfy her!!! It seemed to be representative of most women's \\"first time\\"!

Why oh why was Velvet snatched away from Akbar, a man she loved who loved her in return and with whom she had a child, and returned to arrogant, boorish Alex Gordon, who had about as much finesse as a bull in a china shop. I don't get it! And it's an annoying characteristic of Ms. Small's novels to let all the misfortune fall on the good guys (such as Akbar and Rory Maguire of WILD JASMINE) and let the annoying \\"heroes\\" have the woman -- as is the case with this novel.As if being snatched away from Akbar wasn't disheartening enough, Velvet had to endure the presence of Alex's love child.

If you can call this thinly constructed series of 'adventures' a plot!Characters I couldn't give a damn about!The most frustrating, annoying, rediculous premise for a marriage and re-marriage--if you read the first third of the book you will know what a mean!Sex that was considered shocking for its time but is now only 'so-so' by today's erotic romance novel standards...I was so annoyed that I glossed over the love scenes after a while, was aggrivated by the heroine and altogether annoyed with her boorish (and boring) first husband...Really don't like to read about the heroine sleeping with men other than the hero--and hate it even more when the hero has other partners other than the heroine...All in all this book could have been much shorter, and much better. Can't believe it was published. Can't believe it was written by the same author of the Kadin.All in all...a dud!"},{"Title":"This Heart of Mine","review":"Velvet is no Skye and Alex is no Adam. Velvet is headstrong like her mother, but in many ways lacks intelligence. Alex is overbearing and generally unlikable. However, this book is enjoyable if it is read with the rest of the series. Of course, we don't want Velvet to be a carbon copy of Skye. She should be her own character. She just needed to use her head a bit more. Her adventures in India were very interesting to me and I was glad when &quot;Wild Jasmine&quot; came along with more detailed stories about Indian life. As usual, I commend Mrs. Small's incredible writing ability. Nobody paints a picture with words as well as she does."},{"Title":"This Heart of Mine","review":"I will agree that Alex does make for a poor offering as the love to remember during all of the hard-times. However, I actually found myself with tears in my eyes from some of the touching scenes. The characters were convincing, whether in my loving or hating of them. This was the first book that I read in the O'Malley series. I quickly read the others. Mrs. Small has done an excellent job entwining history, romance, and endurance (in all aspects!)."},{"Title":"This Heart of Mine","review":"I was kind of disappointed with the first part of the book, and like other readers, I really, REALLY disliked Alex a great deal. I felt absolutely no incentive to cheer him on to win Velvet back - if anything, staying with Akbar would have been the smart thing to do! What I cannot understand is Skye O'Malley, of all people, knows better than to take any bull from a man, so why would she let her daughter marry a bully? (To be fair, though, she did express hesitation - but still!) This is just the beginning of weak characterization on Small's part, and it just gets worse later into the series."},{"Title":"This Heart of Mine","review":"I loved this book. The characters were interesting. Their flaws made them unique. Yes Velvet was spoiled but that was expected. I also dont understand why most readers were so appled that she was very intelligent, meaning she didnt use her head all the time. She was young and the baby of the family, of course she was impetious, it made her interesting and allowed plot twists.I loved Alex, he possessivness of Velvet was something I found very sexy. I hated the fact that he took a mistress (Alanna) but Velvet (not using her head) had basically left him so naturally being the macho Scot he was of course he would take up with some other woman in one way or another. I like agressive men and Alex was just that.The sex scenes were average for Small (which is still good just not her greatest).Those O'Malley women...do they attract sexual slavery or what!"},{"Title":"This Heart of Mine","review":"The adventures of Skye O'Malley's daughter was an interesting read. While I don't think Velvet is &quot;exactly like her mother&quot;, the tale was interesting enough to stand alone and apart from Skye's adventures. The character of Alex was a bit heavy-handed for my taste and if I had been paired with a man like that, he wouldn't have lived long enough to BE married - but other than this, the book left a very &quot;cool&quot; impression on me. It's not bad. But it's not as good as Small's earlier reads."},{"Title":"This Heart of Mine","review":"Well, I haven't read 'The Kadin' or all those raved about stuff, but of what I've read, this is the best. I've always felt that Ms. Small's characters don't live.. and the story revolves around sex instead of love, or life. Well, I loved the characters in this book. But one thing I've noticed : Ms. Small has something about sexist men. I would have left the husband and lived with Akbar, or at least made him admit that his values were wrong: he is allowed to take a mistress, but Velvet is not.Anyway, I always end up hating the hero of Ms. Small's books. Somehow, her less important, smehow in the middle -dumped characters are so much more appealing. Akbar was the best character in the book, and Velvet loved him. Or so it seemed. How she could return to Alex, live with him, and actually believe she loves him is still an unclarified mystery to me. I kept on hoping towards the end that Alex would somehow die and she would return to Akbar. He was ten times the man Alex was. In another of Ms. Small's books, 'Unconquered', I also hated the hero, Jared, and prefered the other characters. Also in 'Love Slave', the sultan was much more appealing, again. It gets on my nerves, it frustrates me. Love suddenly feels a little cheap. But, all in all, a good book. The only one of Ms. Small's that I would actually like to own - if only because of the middle section about Akbar. (Francis was also a nice character, I think)"},{"Title":"This Heart of Mine","review":"I loved this book as well, I really couldn't get enough of this series.

Definitely interesting reading others reviews on \\"This Heart Of Mine\\" and the unfair comparison of Alex vs. Akbar. Yes, Alex is stubborn, demanding, and selfish (like Velvet) but his character is developing and growing throughout the novel. In comparison, Akbar has lived life and is an older man (late forties) who was already a finished product. Seriously, it was easy for Velvet to fall for a sophisicated, older man who is completely in awe of her. Honestly, did he ever challenge her?Also, I think that it is very realistic for Alex to take a mistress in the 2.5 years that Velvet was incognito. Was he really suppose to be a monk while she was in a harem? Lets not forget, that Velvet fell into bed with Akbar before she fell in love. Both characters (Alex and Velvet) were initially being comforted during their 'extramarital' affairs....no more, no less."},{"Title":"This Heart of Mine","review":"I would rate this at 4 1/2 stars. After reading some of the other reviews I was a little sceptical but I want to read the whole series and I am glad I did. The story/sequel continues quite well for I was not disappointed in the 4th book of Skye O'Malley. When I saw another harem coming I thought OH NO!! but it turned out to be quite enjoyable and pleasant. This story did have some sad parts that I even got teary eyed at one point. Bertrice Small characters are always described quite well so you feel like you really know them. If you like her writing and the Skye O'Malley book you will want to read all of them even though the first book is the most awesome to read. I recommend this book right along with the first three and now I am off to start the 5th book \\"Lost Love Found\\"."},{"Title":"This Heart of Mine","review":"The story was done very well. It was the fourth in the O'Malley series and one of the best. Velvet is beautiful, but a very self-centered brat at the beginning of the story. Her parents have gone sailing away when Velvet's betrothed comes down from Scotland to claim her as his property.This doesn't go so well when Velvet inlists herself as one of the Queen's maids of honor. She eventually falls in love with Alex and agrees to marry him before her parents return. All seems well, until Velvet gets captured and sent to an Indian harem. All she can do is survive love lost, love found, and love lost again.. I loved it!!"},{"Title":"This Heart of Mine","review":"I liked this book, but Velvet, while interesting, is not as exciting as her mother and daughter. Becomes interesting when she leaves England and becomes the Mughal's wife. Even more interesting when she is taken away from him. Of course, if you are a Skye O'Malley fan, your collection would not be complete without it."},{"Title":"This Heart of Mine","review":"Although isn't as great as &quot;Skye O'Malley&quot;, it's still one of Bertrice's best!

I do have to admit I loved the characters. And I loved what Ms. Small did with them. When Akbar sent her home, it was heartbreaking. And the part about him aging so quiclkly once she left showed how much she'd influenced his life like nothing else could. After that things went down hill. Some of Velvet's behavior was just ridiculous and made me mad.The woman who'd won Akbar's heart disappeared and a child stood in her place."},{"Title":"This Heart of Mine","review":"Do not read this book! That is the best piece of advice I can give you! I never never ever give a book a one star rating, but _This Heart of Mine_ deserves lower. Let me tell you, I love books, I adore them, but this one is an awful edition to the romance world. I usually read three books in one week no matter their length, but this book was so boring that even though it is only five hundred some pages, it took me two weeks to finish. This was my first book by Bertrice Small, and it will definitely be my last.Velvet de Marisco is the beautiful, if spoiled, young daughter of Skye O'Malley. At age five she was engaged to Alex Gordon, Earl of BrocCairn, but she won't have to go through with the marriage if she doesn't want to. When Velvet is about thirteen, her parents leave to go on a voyage to India leaving her at home. When Velvet turns fifteen (her parents are still gone), Alex decides that this time is convininet for him to marry her. Velvet, fearing for her freedom, flees and becomes one of Queen Elizabeth's maids of honor. This will keep her safe until her parents come back, or so she thinks.Alex courts her as another man, and they fall &quot;in love&quot;. They end up married, and stay that way happily for two and a half months. Then, Alex fights a duel for no reason, and word gets to Velvet that he was killed. In a fit of hysteria, she begs her brother to take her with him to India to try to find her parents. There she is kidnapped and taken to the leader of India, Akbar, as a present.Meanwhile, Alex, who loves his wife sooooooooooooo much, takes a mistress. And, when Skye returns and finds this out, she tries to seperate them. But, Alex, who is sooo soo clever spots this and just takes his mistress back to Scotland with him to give her a child. All this time, Velvet is in India being courted by Akbar and she finds out what love truly is. Thinking she is a widow, she slowly becomes Akbar's lover. But, she is torn from him and taken back to the loving Alex. It goes downhill from there.Ick! Yawn! I can't believe that I read this book. _This Heart of Mine_ was truly awful. I'm sorry, but it was. Velvet was a character I grew to care very little about. Since she usually always got her way, I didn't really care what happened to her as she was getting it. Alex was the un-hero of the century. He so loves his wife that he takes a mistress right away while he knows she is alive. But Velvet, thinking herself a widow, takes much longer to find love again. Alex was just anoying. He was so pig headed with Velvet that everything he did made a bigger mess of their relationship. He didn't even deserve the evil mistress he took. Dear Bertrice Small-- you need to learn how to write romance. The sex was too kinky and the characters were made of cardboard. There was no emotion behind the many declorations of love. When Velvet or Alex or Akbar said &quot;I love you&quot; I was still left in the cold. I would rather read a book where the hero is scared to say the words but has the feelings inside him then a book where the hero just tosses around the word love but has no feeling whatsoever. The only saving grace about this book was the historical detail. It is painfully obvious that Bertrice Small spent many hours doing some research, but I wanted to read a romance, not a textbook. I do realize that this is the third book in a saga, but I would not read the first one or any of them unless I was forced to. Maybe _Skye O'Malley_ was a better book, but I don't want to find out. Please, just skip this book."},{"Title":"This Heart of Mine","review":"This book is horrible and biased. I found this to be an ignorant book written by an ignorant person."},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Captain Coignet: Soldier of the Empire, 1799-1816 (Greenhill Military Paperback)","review":"This is one of the top three Napoleonic memoirs that I would recommend, the other two being Parquins Souvenirs, and In the Legions of Napoleon by Brandt. Jean-Roche Coignet started as an illiterate private, and worked his way up to Captain in the Imperial Guard, one of those loyal, ever-present, tough as nails Grumblers that marched and fought the length and breadth of Europe.Coignet distinguishes himself in his first fight at Montebello in northern Italy in 1800 and is rewarded with a loaf of bread by Berthier, Napoleon's chief of staff. He is almost killed a few days later at Marengo, one of the few who survived in his company, and getting whacked over the shoulder by an Austrian cavalryman, which does effectively cut off his qeue, which saves his life.He is one of the first recipients of the Legion of Honor in 1804, serves throughout the wars all the way to Waterloo, and kills a Prussian officer in a one-on-one contest between the lines outside of Paris. The Prussian was yelling insults and made him angry.This is a great tale, well told by a loyal, hardworking, very good soldier who did more than his assigned duty. I have a picture of Jea-Roche Coignet, a photograph taken in old age-he still looks as if he could eat nails for breakfast, and wouldn't take too kindly of insults against his Emperor. Just seeing the picture made me believe the book."},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Captain Coignet: Soldier of the Empire, 1799-1816 (Greenhill Military Paperback)","review":"Very often used as a primary source, this classic memoir is well known to Napleonic writers such as John Elting.

Goes through his story swiftly and this may make many readers feel cheated."},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Captain Coignet: Soldier of the Empire, 1799-1816 (Greenhill Military Paperback)","review":"This book worth the time and the money expended on it. M. Coignet was there, fought and lived to writte his tale. Excellent for anyone interested in the Napoleonic Wars. Besides it is a primary source for a lot of other works on this subject.The author gives the soldier point of view, a battle is reduced to smoke, cries, fear and sweat. It is a very different thing them showed in the more usual historic approach. Superb.The only problem is that M. Coignet, in his own words, is to perfect, everybody liked and helped him. Ok, he entered the dreaded Guard, but one can't satisfy everybody everytime. Otherwise a great book."},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Captain Coignet: Soldier of the Empire, 1799-1816 (Greenhill Military Paperback)","review":"This book offered an honest and sober account of a man, who rose from very humble origins, overcame illiteracy, and distinguished himself so much as a soldier of long service in Napoleon's Grande Arm&eacute;e that by the time he was retired from the military in 1816, he had risen to the rank of Captain."},{"Title":"The Notebooks of Captain Coignet: Soldier of the Empire, 1799-1816 (Greenhill Military Paperback)","review":"Coignet tells things as he sees them, often with a disclaimer to reveal his bias. He is candid about his own weaknesses and mistakes often enough to make one believe that when events sound a little fantastic, they are indeed true. Doesn't claim to give us an overview of the Napoleonic Wars, but does an incredible job of letting us see the campaigns through the eyes of a decorated veteran and member of the Guard."},{"Title":"Codebreakers' Victory: How the Allied Cryptogaphers Won World War II","review":"It is ironic that Hervie Haufler's book, &quot;Codebreakers' Victory,&quot; was published at the same time that John Keegan's book, &quot;Intelligence in War&quot; came out. In the first sentence of his book, Keegan, an otherwise astute observer of military affairs, asks &quot;How useful is intelligence in war?&quot; Keegan's answer is, not very useful. He should have read Haufler. Though it contains only a little primary research, Haufler's compilation from solid sources collected over his lifetime is a major contribution to the study of intelligence during World War II. For battle after battle, on every front of the war, Haufler makes a solid case that intelligence has made a difference-in many cases a significant difference. It is unfortunate that Haufler is less well known than Keegan. I fear it may cause some to overlook Haufler's valuable book. It should not. Haufler writes in an easily readable style (in contrast to Keegan), and recognizes that, while intelligence may not win a battle or a war, it can make all the difference. Prior to this book, those interested in the role of intelligence in WWII would have needed to consult scores of books and articles to get this same picture. Haufler has done that work for us and has collected from the best the information in this volume. It needs noting that he does contribute some important primary research in the form of interviews with several WWII cryptanalysts. Haufler's only hyperbole is contained in his sub-title--&quot;How the Allied Cryptographers Won World War II&quot;. That, one can hope, was added by his publishers and not by him."},{"Title":"Codebreakers' Victory: How the Allied Cryptogaphers Won World War II","review":"Good seller . . the book arrived on time.

There was also an interesting tale about people in France disappearing due to an unexplained disaster. These made the book shocking enough which is what the author probably wanted. The book had a lot of French affinity which would make it appealing to a francophile leaving aside sex and death.But many of the other stories though interesting and provocative made you ask \\"so what?\\". One problem is that the author seems to try and project herself as a clever bilingual academic/scriptwriter which does not come across too well. Though scholarship/erudition when coming out through fiction is welcome, there was a flavour of immoral pretentiousness that made this book not worthy of keeping. It was a sort of \\"dark fiction, version lite\\". I gave this book away after finishing it.I think I'll stick to Katherine Mansfield and some others for the moment as masters of the short story. The exploration of sexuality, male and female, clothes, objects in further detail could have helped on which the book could have been a lot stronger."},{"Title":"The Champion","review":"Before I was midway into The Champion, I went online and ordered The Warrior.

Imagine his surprise and shock when she prefers to join a convent! Insulted and angry, he goes to court in London to find someone else, sleeping his way through any bed he can get in and drinking to excess. But one night he plays around with the wrong woman and is caught by her father who can convince the king to force Nicholas to marry her to save her reputation. The woman is Simone, a young Frenchwoman, who is supposedly mad. The reason is that she keeps talking to the ghost of her young brother - who actually exists and follows her everywhere. Suffice it to say, this isn't making the unwanted marriage any easier. While Simone has to come to terms with the fact that her husband wanted to marry another woman, Nicholas not only has to deal with Simone's murdered brother and the killer, who is still a danger to Simone, but also with attacks by the Welsh in his holdings...This is a nice and entertaining novel with some humour. What detracted from it for me was that some of the historical background was badly researched and therefore faulty (e. g. the English court would have spoken French, not English at that time), but it's still enjoyable. It's a follow-up to 'The warrior' and is itself followed by 'The highlander'. I think it can be read on its own, but makes more sense if you know 'The warrior'. Last but not least: If you're looking for eroticism, there's very little in it since the ghost interrupts them every single time. That's not a problem to me, but may be to some readers who prefer a spicy novel."},{"Title":"The Champion","review":"Nicholas FitzTodd is Baron of Crane and a past hurt has colored his feelings about marriage and besides he enjoys the pleasures of court too much to consider changing his life. Then at a social gathering he meets Simone DuRoche and his life changes whether he wishes it or not. Their moment of impropriety results in a marriage he feels trapped into. If that's not enough, he's forced to admit that perhaps the whispers of Simone's sanity may be true, after all what sort of person talks to themselves? This all falls to the wayside when he is forced to realize that Simone means more to him then he's comfortable with and that she could be in danger. Nicholas protects what is his and Simone...is his.Marriage to the guarded Nicholas is not easy for Simone who is torn by the passion she feels for him and the secrets that seem to keep them apart. When she learns the truth about her brother's death and the secrets her family has kept buried finally see the light of day, she knows whatever progress she has made in securing the marriage neither of them wanted from the beginning but one that has become very important to her is in jeopardy. Nicholas makes her want things she never thought possible and she will do what she must to make sure he never suffers from being forced to marry her. Will these two people find the love and happiness they both so richly deserve or will evil take it away from them?This was an amazing follow up to \\"The Warrior!\\" Ms. Grothaus has crafted another set of characters the reader will instantly fall in love with. Secondary characters are a fine addition and the reader will love the fact they get to reacquaint themselves with Tristan and Haith. This is a stand alone read so fear not if you have not picked up her previous title although you will find yourself looking for her backlist. The setting, time period, and characters all blend together into a seamless tapestry of romance and magic. Ms. Grothaus is a very talented writer and I can hardly wait for her next effort.

At this time, belief in the supernatural is a deadly risk, women are bought and sold in the marriage trade for flat-out amounts of gold and family ties--as well as careful and politically cultivated ties to the royal court--matters of life and death. SO with such a lot of great writing going on--what's the problem?

The authors contend that 1) economic development depends in large part on the stability that comes from broad-based and informed democratic participation of a country's populace, 2) media control can limit the development of democratic institutions and further oligarchic systems, and 3) increased support for free and open media in the developing world is necessary to sustain economic development and democracy strategies. The book closes by citing the growing importance of wireless internet as one of the ways to break monopolistic media systems. This is an important book that explains why expanded internet access is not just a luxury for the developing world; social and economic stability may depend on the ability of common citizens to communicate in systems that parallel but are not controlled by the established media powers."},{"Title":"Sulekha Select: The Indian Experience in a Connected World","review":"I got it from a friend who purchased the book and read it completely in one night.

This makes them easy to read and interesting. The quality of the writing is excellent even though all the writers are amateurs.Most of the stories/poetry/essays are re-readable. I plan to read them all again, and some have already been re-read a few times.Rose."},{"Title":"Sulekha Select: The Indian Experience in a Connected World","review":"This book contains the work of people from the Indian Subcontinent originally published at the website. I was totally impressed by the diversity of topics, originality in writing and the variety of genres. There is poetry, humor, articles dealing with social issues and fiction. Most of the authors are not professional writers, but professionals in other fields with a passion for the written word. The book is refreshing to read and is a successful experiment in capturing the diversity of the Indian spirit. The book is also great as a gift for your Indian and Non-Indian friends."},{"Title":"Sulekha Select: The Indian Experience in a Connected World","review":"I loved reading ths book - Sulekha Select. For one, it is a compilation of the works of many authors, both new and not so new. It was great to jump from one topic that was so 'thinking' to another that was rib tickling! A wonderful mixture of variable content and style. For the other, I am sure it gave quite a few writers the wondefull feeling of being published. My personal favorites are the ones that are on the lighter side,and I would recommend this book to everyone who does not want the oft repeated, cliched way of writing and also as a good inside view of the Indian Community in all its color."},{"Title":"Sulekha Select: The Indian Experience in a Connected World","review":"What's great about &quot;Sulekha Select&quot; is that not a single one of the stories, essays, musings or poems in the collection actively tries to explain &quot;the Indian experience&quot; in its entirety. Rather, each selection is a peek into the life of a single person, living in some part of the world, from his or her individual perspective. The authors are from the widest range imaginable of Indian backgrounds, and they're not professional writers: all of them contributed their efforts to the Sulekha.com website purely out of a desire to connect with each other and with readers. Taken as a whole, these essays and stories offer an introduction to Indian life and culture more complete and accessible than a book on this subject could ever hope to be, while at the same time leaving the clear impression that this collection is only just scratching the surface. That's the perfect way to approach learning about any community's &quot;experience.&quot;"},{"Title":"Sulekha Select: The Indian Experience in a Connected World","review":"I've never read a book written by a community before. It makes for very interesting reading. Of course, some stories are better than others, but the overall experience is excellent."},{"Title":"THE BATTLE OF THE VILLA FIORITA THE GREENAGE SUMMER AND AN EPISODE OF SPARROWS 3 in 1","review":"...still do.

I encourage anyone to discover this great great writer."},{"Title":"The Poems And Confessions Of A Mad Man: My Theater Of Pain","review":"My Psychology Professor told me to pick up this book. I did and was not sorry. It had highs and lows. This mans writing is for people with an open mind and a clear view of todays realities. I felt for a book of fiction, it really captures todays headlines.I highly recommend this book to people who enjoy fiction that seems to ride the razors edge of truth. It will take you from tears to anger to laughter from one story to the next. The gramatical errors seem to be deliberate to toy with the readers mind in the competence of the writer. Truly gifted! There is something for everyone in this book. I'm giving this book as gifts because I enjoyed it that much."},{"Title":"The Poems And Confessions Of A Mad Man: My Theater Of Pain","review":"This book is a great read, young or old alike! The truth is so hardly heard these days. It may be \\"fiction\\" But we all think this stuff but dont have the guts to say it! Brilliant writer!!!"},{"Title":"The Poems And Confessions Of A Mad Man: My Theater Of Pain","review":"Only a person who was abused can truly understand the pain inflicted onto one's soul. This book acknowledges how denigration, humiliation and physical abuse can affect a person's state of mind. Words like worthless, stupid, ugly and fat can accumulate in our brain like an infuriated demon ready to destroy you and everyone in its path. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to be a parent. Feel the hurt, anger and pain, the long-standing negative impact from a parent's actions. This book may be fiction but in todays society every word of it is true. This book is great for those who think they are perfect. If you want to stop the worlds Madness than stop abusing your children!"},{"Title":"The Poems And Confessions Of A Mad Man: My Theater Of Pain","review":"This book was given to me as a gift, so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect.The poetry is deep, dark, blatantly honest and skillfully written. There are stories you absolutely hope didn't occur (and trust that they are fiction, as the author mentions). Not all for the faint of heart. The author's imagination and creativity are impressive though.Despite my preference for \\"lighter\\" reading, the author's writing talents are evident in this predominantly \\"darker\\" book."},{"Title":"The Poems And Confessions Of A Mad Man: My Theater Of Pain","review":"I wish everyone would read this book! I absolutely loved it. It's like a mystery and a memoir combined. You really don't know if these things happened or not; the author makes you think they did happen, yet somehow you hope they really didn't!The poems at the first of the book are really awesome. Don't listen to anyone who says negative things about this book. Read it and determine for yourself. You may be a little shocked at some of the stories, but I bet you like it nonetheless!!"},{"Title":"The Poems And Confessions Of A Mad Man: My Theater Of Pain","review":"My girlfriend and I read roughly half of this book in the bookstore together because the cover made us crack up. It was bar none the whiniest, most melodramatic piece of self-important, goth-crybaby drivel I've ever laid eyes on. There are \\"ramblings\\" to be found here, but they are most certainly NOT the ramblings of a madman (or an interesting one at any rate), but rather those of a purely stereotypical goth loser obsessed with his own pain and misfortune. What kind of self-centric priss slaps a photo of himself wearing a straight-jacket and mascara on the cover of his own book (and peppered throughout the text as well), and feels the need to insert \\"-By Andrew J. Green\\" alongside each and every poem or essay in a book that only contains his work?I also can't help but find it interesting that the only positive review Mr. Green could garner for this pitiful colleciton was written by someone sporting a net-alias of \\"Green\\". I guess he told his mom he wouldn't take his medication unless she found the three minutes to crank out a three sentence review.You'd be better of dropping your cash onto the sidewalk and peeing on it than exchanging it for this book. It's badly written, it goes nowhere, and it doesnt contain anything original or insightful."},{"Title":"Tarot for Today","review":"The book itself is a good one. I have read many books on tarot and this one is especially clear and beautifully presented. The illustrations, photographs and text are pleasing. The information is concise and informative with extra connections given to how the images of the cards relate to astrology.There is information on how to read the cards, tips on consulting others, spread examples etc. I quite like this book and think it is a good choice for novice and experienced alike as the astrology connections are something I wish to learn more of.Upon recieving this book my only dissapointment was that I thought I was ordering the book and Universal Deck kit which Chapters and Indigo sells. The front covers of both look exactly the same and so I thought I was buying the product I had just seen at Indigo. The kit ISBN is 0-88850-771-2 which Amazon doesn't seem to sell. For the price of the deck and the book I think I would prefer getting the combined kit from Indigo or Chapters verus buying the two items seperately. If however you already have this deck or a classic traditional deck, or a deck that carries the traditional meanings this book itself is a fine choice."},{"Title":"Titanic: Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner","review":"Gorgeous 205 page, hardcover library volume. Beautiful full color and black and white large photos. Provides insight into the maiden voyage, terror at sea, in search of the Titanic, anatomy of the disaster, the trail of time, and an epilogue. Beautiful never before published photos. One of the best books on the topic to be found. Full color pictures of much Titanic memorabilia. A great addition to a Titanic fan's library."},{"Title":"Titanic: Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner","review":"Overall, this is a nicely-designed and illustrated book that would make a great gift. Many of the artifact photos (of which there are plenty) are unique to this book. The issue of salvage haunts every page of this book. On numerous occasions author Susan Wels makes the case for RMS Titanic, Inc. and their salvage operations. That may or may not be fine to you, depending upon your view of the whole salvage thing, but you'll probably find that it gets kind of annoying and repetitive after a while. Much is made of the fact that Titanic-finder Robert Ballard initially supported some salvage operations (he is now opposed to them).All of that aside, the rest of the book is nice to look at and worth reading. The text plays second-fiddle to the photographs, but that's fine for a book such as this.I was a bit surprised at one error in the text- in describing Captain Smith's safety record, Wels notes that he was captain of the Germanic when it \`capsized' in 1899. Well, the Germanic sank upright at its pier because of an ice storm; it was quickly re-floated and spent another 51 years in service; the captain and crew were found not at fault by White Star; and the captain at the time was Edward McKinstry, not Edward J. Smith."},{"Title":"Titanic: Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner","review":"I found this volume satisfying and very well done. I have ordered the James Cameron book too, but really this volume stands well on its own. As I probably won't get to see the traveling exhibit, I especially appreciated seeing the actual artifacts &quot;strewn&quot; throughout the book, much as they appeared on the ocean floor.As a graphic designer, I thought the design was admirable--contemporary, not overdone, yet sensitive of the period. I have several Titanic books, and consider this to be the most comprehensive visual assortment of information I have seen. To me, what was really special about this book were the computer illustrations mixed in --the opening sequence has a beautiful illustration of the bow coming into contact with the berg. The computer recreations of the ship's interior are also of high artistic quality and give the volume a dreamlike feeling. This together with informative charts and graphs give the reader a sensitive, nicely balanced account of the event--a true keepsake volume."},{"Title":"Titanic: Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner","review":"While a lot of Titanic books seem to focus only on the voyage, the disaster, and the immediate aftermath, this book goes into more uncharted territory. As it points out, in a way, the tragedy at sea was just the beginning of the story. It covers the construction of the ship, what sea travel was like before the Titanic (very dangerous even for first-class passengers because of the shoddily-built ships, crowded living quarters, bad food, and lack of ventilation), all of the wonders on the Titanic, at least for the first-class passengers (such as a gymnasium, a caf&eacute;, beautiful staircases, and a reading room), some of the people who were on the voyage, how and why the ship sank (a decades-old mystery that was finally solved in 1996 through cutting-edge modern technology), the long but finally successful quest to locate the Titanic on the bottom of the ocean, how the tragedy might have been prevented, the types of robots and undersea vehicles used to explore the wreck, the myriad of artifacts recovered from the sight, the stabilisation process used on the artifacts immediately after they come out of the deep water, and how much longer the Titanic will remain before it's totally eaten away by rusticles. Besides the in-depth text, there are also a lot of amazing pictures, many of them of the artifacts salvaged from the wreck (such as playing cards, personal letters and postcards that are still very much readable, cigarettes, dishes and pots, clothing, chandeliers, a bottle of olives, jewelry, razors, and money), as well as some great diagrams illustrating such things as the ship's layout, the anatomy of the disaster, and the various parts of the undersea robots and ships used in the salvage. It's a shame such a great book is currently out of print, since it paints such an in-depth and multi-faceted picture of the Titanic and the cross-section of humanity that was on board."},{"Title":"Titanic: Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner","review":"What Bill C. said is completely off topic this is a book about the greatest sea disaster that changed the world the Titanic. NOT the Lusitania which was sunk even after americans were warned by the german embassy in the US to travelers that any ship flying the british flag would be sunk. Bill C obviously needs to learn his history cause hes really showing how little he knows, The book is great it covers just about every major point of Titanic. If you want to read about the Lusitania which was on her last voyage from the start and was to be scrapped after she returned to england go read bob ballards book about the Sinking of the Lustiania. If you want to read a book about the greatest sea disaster that was foretold 14 years before by a writer and one that changed how things were done from having the wireless systems up 24 hours a day to ensure that distress messages would be receved to lifeboats for everyone regardless the tonnage which was how Titanic was required by law to carry 16 boats cause it stated anyship over 16,000 Tons is required to carry 16 boats even though Titanic was 57,000 Long Tons.I would recommed this book to anyone that wants a well put together book or anyone that is a Titanic buff."},{"Title":"Titanic: Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner","review":"Accurate, up to date, treatment in one volume of what happened to the Titanic. Also with excellent coverage of the discovery of the remains seventy years later, with copious pictures and illustrations. Students needing a short one-volume outline of the tragedy will find it here. Sensitivity and intelligence characterise this fine volume."},{"Title":"Titanic: Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner","review":"I found this book to humanize the Titanic tragedy. It put a face on the words &quot;Titanic.&quot; As far as scavangering, I feel that by bringing up remnants will assure that the world will never forget April 14,1912. Items of persons i.e. letters, clothing, jewelery, and toiletry items left me with a very haunted yet respectful feeling. Definitly &quot;brings you there&quot;. Very hard to put down, yet at times it was so intense that I had to put it down and give myself a chance to absorb what I had read."},{"Title":"Titanic: Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner","review":"TITANIC: Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner is a (if not the) definitive book on the Titanic. It has lots of facts and text and is almost grotesquely overwrought with pictures.In the beginning and end of this book, there is a complete list of RMS Titanic's passengers and crew which is very useful.Scattered about the book, it contains points of views of different survivors. Two facts are incorrect, the gross tonnage was 46,328 and the cruising speed was 21 knots.This book is worth all you pay for it, and Titanic buff should add it to his/her library."},{"Title":"Titanic: Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner","review":"Susan Wels' brilliant volume TITANIC Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner must rate among the top ten books on this renowned ship. What does set it apart from most other books is the wealth of high-quality photographs of artefacts salvaged from the wreck site. These objects were painstakingly restored to their almost original pristine conditions -- and viewing them makes the whole drama come alive. A shoe brush, a steward's jacket, a jar of olives -- all amazingly intact after more than 80 years on the ocean floor. The story of the ship's ill-fated maiden voyage will be old hat to most Titanic enthusiasts and so will the photographs of the ship and the wreck be. But there are some amazing illustrations of the ship's interior that are a credit to the artist. If you're a Titanic fanatic like me, this is a must. If you're only mildly interested in that Great Ship, get it anyway -- it's worth every cent!"},{"Title":"Titanic: Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner","review":"What a wonderful beautiful book! I read it to my daughter cover to cover. She is fascinated with everything Titanic. Now I have caught the bug."},{"Title":"Titanic: Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner","review":"So many books are available on the Titanic and more have come out as the 100th anniversary approaches. Most of these books offer the same stories and illustrations, but what sets this Time-Life Discovery Channel edition from the late 1990s apart from the others are the photographs of the artifacts recovered and preserved from the ship, including some photos showing the salvaging efforts themselves. Most impressive were the paper items which I would think would have disintegrated long ago. Not only were individual paper items salvaged and restored, but paper items stuck together, such as a deck of playing cards and a stack of postcards, were freeze dried and painstakingly separated. Some will take issue with items being removed from what is essentially a graveyard but seeing a photo of a satchel resting on the ocean floor being picked up by a mechanical device and another photo of the same satchel restored to near its former condition realizing what historic tragedy its owner had been through and how many decades had past is pretty remarkable."},{"Title":"Titanic: Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner","review":"The illustrations are beautiful. Fascinating artifacts collected from the ocean floor are displayed throughout the pages here. The recent salvage operations are described extensively. The wreck may be decaying but it will never disappear completely with books like this one around. It is a most valuable contribution to Titanic salvage studies.My primary interest is the infamous maiden voyage, not salvage or discovery. Having read so much on the subject one would expect little new here. I was most pleasantly surprised. Wels supplied details new to me and succeeded in placing me back on the Atlantic in 1912. I knew, for instance, about the wireless breakdown but didn't know just when it took place, learning it was in fact fixed early on the 13th. This is not a terribly long book and many pages are taken up with pictures so I hadn't expected such attention to detail."},{"Title":"Titanic: Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner","review":"For me, the greatest story of the Titanic was the true story. I'm not really one for nonfiction, and yet this story just fascinates me (and so many others) unbelievably. Anyway, this book is beautifully and poeticly written, full of amazing pictures and history. Best of all, it is incredibly up to date with a wealth of new findings and information about the wreck. Grade: A-"},{"Title":"Titanic: Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner","review":"The book is exceptionally well written, with a wealth of specific detail that brings the story to life. Susan Wels also makes a point of bringing in the perspectives of a wide assortment of people to give a broad sense not only of the tragedy, but of the whole experience. The design is tasteful and the photos/illustrations well chosen. My only criticism is that the text/illustration ratio is skewed too far toward illustration: My wife's first impression was that it was a picture book. It's not."},{"Title":"Titanic: Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner","review":"This book is an extraodinary look at the Titanic. It has wonderful pictures, and text. It even has a list of all the passengers who were on it's Maiden voyage. You definately should read this book!"},{"Title":"Titanic: Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner","review":"This book is a really good book for people like me that want to learn more about the Titanic and maybe see it with there own eyes one day. It has really good facts ,pictures, facinating articles,and memorabilia of the people who survived and were killed by the R.M.S.TITANIC on April,1912. I don't have the book,but I intend to get it before Christmas 1998."},{"Title":"Titanic: Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner","review":"I originally bought this book because of the Discovery channel tie - in. Ihad watched the special and thought it very good, and hoped thebook would provide more details. I was disappointed.The best qualities of the book are the numberous pictures of recovered artifacts.But that is about all the book has. It does provide a synopsis of the sonar findingsbut there is little new information. And as for pre-discovery of the wreck site, the book is very weak.What I found especially disturbing, was the constant belittling of Dr. Robert Ballard.The author goes to extreme efforts to point out that Dr. Ballard originally wanted to recover objects.The author also tries her best to minimize the accomplishments of this man; failing to even point out, that Dr.Ballard has been recognized in the scientific community, and is backed by the National GeographicSociety. This is extremely petty, and distorts the facts. The author has an agendaand seems to feel that any means are necessary to see that agenda fulfulled.The strange part of this is, I was actually divided on the issue of salvage before reading the book.Afterall, the recovered objects are so interesting and take us back to a veryinteresting era. But now, I am beginning to feel more as Dr. Ballard, and many of the Titanic survivors do.Fifteen hundred people died on that site. Some 350+ bodies were recovered; somegiven an immediate burial at sea.Perhaps we should allow them to rest.I wish I could get my money back on this book."},{"Title":"Tensions can be reduced to nuisances;: A technique for not-too-neurotic people","review":"Bergler wrote a lot of books; this is not his worst; but it's not his best. I only bought because his other, better ones are not available on Amazon. That said, it is, in absolute terms, a very good book, which, in addition to having theoretical value, is of some (though not too much) practical use."},{"Title":"Miracle at the plate,","review":"Do you have problems with your fielding? Skeeter does. Everytime a fly ball comes his way he falls or miss judges were the ball is going to land. There is one thing that Skeeter is really, really good at! He can hit real well. In fact he is so great that he is the best hitter in his league. He almost always hits a home run or something else that is awesome. Matt Christopher calls this book Miracle At The Plate. If you are interested in sports books then read his books. They're outstanding! Once I picked up one of his books I couldn't put it down! The setting of this book is baseball field. Matt Christopher also writes sports books for girl's like volleyball.Many of Matt Christopher's books have won awards. Matt Christopher can think up of so many different characters. He has a different character for every book that he ever wrote! Matt Christopher seems to get the readers attention by always having an awesome title and a great review. For example in the story he tells how Skeeter is afraid to slide. This book shows people that you should not be scared to slide into home or any other base. People get scared because they think that they might get hurt. You know in every book there's a weak spot. The weak spot in this book is when Skeeter goes to his cousin's house because I think that it goes off topic a little. I think that after you read this book you're going to want to read another and another.Also you would then probably encourage your friends who like to watch baseball. Then they would encourage their friends and so and so on. I would recommend this book to any one who likes baseball. A strong point in this book is when they play baseball games because it is so exciting."},{"Title":"Miracle at the plate,","review":"The book I read is called Miracle at the Plate.It's about a boy named Skeeter Miracle who can hit real well, having the best hitting average in the league.The only thing is he can't field and looks like a clown in the outfield. A second string player named Tommy gives it his best shot to steal Skeeter's spot. Tensions between the two get worse when Skeeter accidently injures Tommy's pet dog Pancho. Will Tommy steal Skeeter's spot?This book is a fun baseball book.I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Miracle at the plate,","review":"Our grandson will enjoy reading this book this Christmas - practice and perseverence - never give up - keep trying -- all good attributes for success in any area. He especially loves playing baseball."},{"Title":"Miracle at the plate,","review":"The copy we received is a very old copy with stiff pages and the cover is completely different.

It is cool and as a baseball player and someone who hates sliding into home, it helps me."},{"Title":"Miracle at the plate,","review":"In the book,Miracle at the Plate, by Matt Christopher a boy named Skeeter was the best hitter on the Barracudas grasshopper baseball team. The problem is Skeeter can't play the infield, because he cant't catch anything. Tommy, Skeeter's rival is the second best baseball player in the league and is trying to take over Skeeters place. Alan, the best infielder on the Deerslayers and Skeeters cousin, come together and pratice together to teach each other their best skills and leave Tommy in the dust.Matt Christopher brings together a variety of different players on rival teams to make the grasshopper little league baseball team the best in the state. Matt Christopher loves to write about baseball in my opinion.This book is worth reading for people who love baseball. Christoper writes all about different types of kids that have different skills in baseball and tries to make them the best."},{"Title":"Poisoned power;: The case against nuclear power plants,","review":"Raising 3 children who became sick one right after another, someone handed me this book and our lives were never the same!

Rothbard","review":"In the last five years of his life, Murray N. Rothbard--anarchist, economist, activist, historian--co-edited the monthly Rothbard-Rockwell Report, which featured some of his best polemical writings. This book collects many of the greatest pieces. (As a charter subscriber to that now-defunct journal, I might have included a few extra articles in this book, but then)At the time these articles were written, Rothbard had joined forces with a resurging populist paleo-right in his fight against the State, against war, and for free markets.(In decades past, he had built alliances with Stevenson Democrats, New Leftists, and the Libertarian Party, without ever changing his core political beliefs.) So the book is filled with attacks on Bush's war on Iraq, big-government &quot;libertarians,&quot; Clintonian liberalism, and Newt Gingrich's still-born &quot;Republican Revolution,&quot; all in Rothbard's curmudgeonly style. He is a joy to read.This volume is a must for fans of Rothbard."},{"Title":"The Irrepressible Rothbard : The Rothbard-Rockwell Report Essays of Murray N. Rothbard","review":"As I&#65533;ve said before, Murray Rothbard was a historian, cultural critic, economist and social theoretician, and political strategist. Until his death, Murray commented vigorously on the cultural affairs of the day in the Rothbard-Rockwell Report. These articles are collected in this outstanding work.Actually, I use the phrase &#65533;cultural affairs&#65533; broadly since these articles concern history, political strategy, movie reviews and more. With Rotbard you don&#65533;t get canned bromides like some other would-be &#65533;deep thinkers,&#65533; but an exciting and informed opinion on topic after topic. As just one example, consider the war against the Serbs.

Rothbard","review":"Murray Rothbard was a true polymath as any review of his work in poltical economy, history, economic history, the history of economic thought and philosophy would show. His dedication to his \\"purist\\" vision of a free society animated his whole work.Unfortunately this focus may deter many readers who do not share Rothbard's politics from exploring his work. That's a shame as his thinking and writing is clear and illuminating. Rothbard nevers beats around the bush. Non-libertarians need to discover Rothbard and cherry pick to their heart's content.This book shows another side to Rothbard's career. His journalistic writing. This volume covers politics, economics, culture and the movies. So in many ways it's his most accessible, and entertaining, book for non-libertarians. It is probably one of the best volumes of journalism covering American politics and cultural controversies in the late 1980s to 1990s. My guess is that in decades to come readers looking back on this period will be digging into this volume."},{"Title":"The Irrepressible Rothbard : The Rothbard-Rockwell Report Essays of Murray N.

Many of them are a pure joy to read. They are often hilarious, while still quite serious.Murray wasn't afraid to speak the truth as he saw it, regardless of the delicate sensibilities the self-annointed Thought Police (did anyone say Abe Foxman?).

Rothbard","review":"As I've said before, Murray Rothbard was a historian, cultural critic, economist, social theoretician, and political strategist. Until his death, Murray commented vigorously on the cultural affairs of the day in the Rothbard-Rockwell Report. These articles are collected in this outstanding work.Actually, I use the phrase \\"cultural affairs\\" broadly since these articles concern history, political strategy, movie reviews and more. With Rotbard you don't get \\"canned bromides\\" like some other would-be \\"deep thinkers,\\" but an exciting and informed opinion on topic after topic. As just one example, consider the war against the Serbs. Leftists from all quarters (Hitchens, Lerner, etc.) couldn't wait to go to war against the Serbs in defense of the so-called Bosnian nation. Murray points out that there never was Bosnian nation (or even a Yugoslavian nation for that matter.) Likewise, the left - contrary to its supposed representatives -- has never really been in favor of peace; after all Barnes derided the \\"pro war pacifists\\" of his day. Murray even points out the similarities of the Bosnian \\"Moslems\\" to the old Bogomil heretics of that area (humorously pointing out that the Bogomils were what Ayn Rand falsely considered all Christians to be.)As another example, Rothbard's article on Bush I's war against Iraq could have been written today.At the same time Rothbard was writing these essays, he was writing monthly articles on economics in The Free Market newsletter. Those articles are gathered in MAKING ECONOMIC SENSE. If years from now someone asks me what \\"really\\" happened in the 80s and 90s, I'll direct them to these two books.

As a Muslim libertarian, if that isn't an Oxymoron, I can sign up for most of his agenda.He cuts through political correctness with a great wit that enthuses all his essays. He attacks water flouridisation which he admits puts him into the conspiracy kook box, analyses Hollywood films and their underlying agendas, attacks big business/big government and even analyses U.S. elections based upon the premise the Rockefellers and the Zionist lobby decide the outcome.I now know the truth about 'famine' in Africa (aid agencies encourage it) and that the Rodney King beating Police Officers were right to be acquitted (the media created the 'injustice').

Being an eventer I found the story to be right on track with all its information. In regards to an earlier review, you can't bring back all the old charactors and horses because THEY GROW UP and since horses don't live as long as humans most of the origional ones would be dead by now. And also, Joanna Cambell doesn't even write this books anymore and you probably haven't ever read one she actually wrote (hence the term CREATOR by her name and not AUTHOR).

I mean, why does idiot Christina go to a high level trainig camp with her WONDER HORSE(not) Sterling, when she's been off the track for about three moths. You shoulden't even THINK about entering a horse that green in any sort of show. The books never really tell about Christina teaching Sterling to learn to jump cross-country or do dressage. After #24, in Melanie's Treasure, Sterling is jumping and doing dresage ect. And I think that Christina's Courage should be called Melanie, Kevin and Dylan's Coureage, because they have to put up with that ***** Christina. And now for this book, Christina acts like such a baby when she is put in the begginers group. She shouldn't even be allowed to ride at all!

They thought they would have nothing to do but ride their horses Sterling Dream, Christinas gray thoroughbred mare and Tribulation, Christinas pony which she outgrown and Melanie was able to ride. When they get their, they where told a few rules which was going to be kinda annoying. Christina, Melanie, Eliza and another girl would be in barn A and on the same team in the same room. At first Christina thought Eliza would be a good friend but them after a few words from Eliza, Christina thought Eliza was a little snot. Eliza keep talking about how Christina is a little spoiled brat and could get anything with a snap from her finger. But Christina soon finds out Eliza doesnt even have her own horse to ride. The horse she was riding, Flash wasnt really hers and her parents couldnt afford to keep him so Flashs owner lets Eliza take Flash to camp. Christina and Melanie both see a strong bond between them and when they find out Flashs owner wants to sell him, they know they need to help Eliza make enough money to keep Flash. The first buyer disliked Flash after he rode him. The man seemed like he didnt even know how to ride a horse and relief turns into another worry. During alittle trial at Saddlebrook, another buyer tried out the colt herself. Christina thought that if Eliza wasnt his rider, the women would be a good rider for Flash. But how can they stop the owner from selling Flash? Read Camp Saddlebrook (...)"},{"Title":"Camp Saddlebrook (Thoroughbred Series #28)","review":"This was my favoirte Christina book I read soo far. She tries her hardest to help Eliza buy Flash and starts thinking what she would do if she would to lose Sterling. Chrisitna did her best to help Eliza instead of enjoing her first week at Saddlebrook with no worries. When Christian meet Eliza, she thought Eliza was going to ruin her summer but it was like the other way around. Elizas summer would be ruined. And I kinda gave it 4 stars because it said that Eliza was a big pain and she she would do was start rumors about Christina. And when it says will keep Christina keep Elizas secrete to herself, its like saying she stole Flash and nobody knew and Eliza wanted to keep it at that. But this book was really good.

I have read it probably 20 times or more. I love all the Thoroughbred books, but this one is the best by far! I love the way it seems to have more freedom to the other books, and more imagineation. It lets you think more about what it would be like for you to be in the story. It is also much of an improvment to Cindy. She was probably the most selfish evil person I have ever heard of in a book. In real life I have seen worse but thats not the point. You can really relate to all the characters in this book. But it does need at least one more person trying to get Christina and Dylan together! I hate how Dylan and Katie dissapear in the upcoming books. We really don't need another Townsend (Parker) in the story! Off the subject again. Well, anyways this is the best book in the entire world and every person should read it! The horses are wonderful too not just because there are so many of them (but thats good too) but also because of how much they vary from the ones at Whitebrook. At Whitebrook, they always have those chestnut and bay \\"wonders, one horse in a million.\\" It was good to see more variety. You also see many more characters.

I love all the books and most of the characters(excypt Cindy I hated her). Christina is my favorite character and I don't think she is snobby at all. And for whoever said how did Flash get colic in the reviews odviously doesn't know much about horses because there are many many different ways a horse could get colic easily. I would reccomend buying this book and reading the whole series. You learn a lot and they are suspencful and interesting. This book was one of my FAVORITES!"},{"Title":"Camp Saddlebrook (Thoroughbred Series #28)","review":"There isn't much to say about these books now. If you haven't bought Camp Saddlebrook, don't. It's a pointless story. But is you are a fan of the series, forget the books leading up to 32. Because those will be about Sterling and Sterling only (like all the others). But in book 32 racing will be reintroduced. Melanie will become a racing &quot;enthusiast&quot;. Christina still likes jumping. In book number 33 Samantha and Tor are coming back. The Townsends will also be brought back. Samantha will become Melanie's mentor and teach her about training and racing. Christina will be competing against the younger Townsend's son, who is her age and is nothing like his parents. The plan is to alternate the books - one about jumping and Christina, the next about racing and Melanie.Joanna Campbell will be writing the first three books in the Ashleigh Series. The first, Lightning's Last Hope comes out in September. After that she will be writing a couple of Super Editions a year, trying to bridge the ten year gap between books #23 and #24.Joanna also says to send letters detailing displeasure with the series to the publisher so something can be done.

I'm glad that racing is slowly coming back, but so should the horses &amp; characters. I have read almost everybook &amp; know the old characters as if they were real.

I have read all the books and yes I'll agree that there getting worse. but they do have some good parts and I too am glad that cindy is out of the story. What I really want to say is that the storys and the series is not that believable because I don't know that many different people that can succeed in what they want to do. It seems that everyone is perfect and never fails. Another thing, all horses in this book are wonderhorses and can do almost anything! Sterling will jump 5 foot trees and make Christina believe she &quot;wanted to do it&quot; and &quot;its in her heart!&quot; Don't think so! I have a quarter horse and have written plenty of horse who have many faults and may never be anything spectacuar, mine especally!:) Ok, its one thing for some of there horses to be winners but not the all of them or the majority!

As such, it marks the culmination of Alita's identity quest into the world the motorball. What Alita has discovered is that use of her special cyborg battle training skills can trigger sudden flashbacks to the days before Doc Ido reassembled her as Alita. These come as peak experiences when the doughty fighter must push her body to withstand what no biological body could.We get to see to of these battles. The first Alita uses to test both herself and the cyborgs with whom she is considering teaming. This is an opportunity for both melee battles and some fine humorous moments when things do not quite happen as planned. The second struggle is the final confrontation with Jashugan. This we know will end up in a one-on-one confrontation between titans. The reader is entitled to, and gets, all the action art and surprises of which Yukito Kushiro is capable. Who wins isn't important at the transcendent moment, only that both have used up all that they had.I'm probably going to go on and on about the art for this series until I run out of manga to review. Yukita Kishiro has the kind of graphic style that makes the frames magnetic. The story, the diversity of characters and the introspective twists are an important part of this manga, and keep it from ever being a simpleminded hack and disassemble story. Something deeper is going on, and we see it evolve one small piece at a time."},{"Title":"Battle Angel Alita, Vol. 4: Angel of Victory","review":"This was the first Battle Angel Alita book I ever read, borrowing it from the library. But, since I read 1,2, and 3 AFTER this, I've liked the motorballs better. I think this is a kewl book, I wish I'd happened to read #1 first, tho, but this all works out. I loved it! Simply, Alita is finishing what she started with motorball, what with racing and winning, winning, losing, whataver. Her showdown with Jashugan kinda leaves u, uh... confused (at least it did me V_V) and it never says more. THE REASON I GAVE THIS A 4-STAR RATING IS BECAUSE... the index page (copyright, idex, etc.) is the one of TEARS OF AN ANGEL! what's up with that?? i just realized that one day, looking to see what part it was. and that {is odd.}"},{"Title":"Battle Angel Alita, Vol. 4: Angel of Victory","review":"This book, like the others in the series, is amazing to say the least.

This book is fast-paced and full of action, but it may leave newcomers to the series a bit confused as there is no real recapping of the past story. For those who do know the story, the book sucks you in and plays with your emotions, making you realy feel sympathy for the characters. Such is average fare for Kishiro's work."},{"Title":"Battle Angel Alita, Vol. 4: Angel of Victory","review":"After giving us the excellent volumes 1 and 2, &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot; and &quot;Tears of an Angel&quot;, Yukito Kishiro gave us what many consider the worst volume in the series, &quot;Killing Angel&quot;. Volume 3 dealt with Alita's new life after the tragic events of volume 2, and while it wasn't a complete blashemy against the series, the storytelling quality didn't live up to the first two volumes. With volume 4, &quot;Angel of Victory&quot;, Kishiro improves upon &quot;Killing Angel&quot;, but considering what he worked with, the storytelling quality still wasn't where it should've been.&quot;Angel of Victory&quot; is actually a continuation of &quot;Killing Angel&quot;, a continuation meaing that the two volumes can be seen as parts of each other. The story deals with Alita trying to prove herself the best motorball champion while coming to terms with the sudden changes in her life. By now, her character is very well fleshed out and we really do care for her in many ways. However, the story in &quot;Angel of Victory&quot; still deals with motorball, something that doesn't have anything to do with Alita trying to discover her lost past, the reason we fell in love with her in the first place. The story in &quot;Angel of Victory&quot; is far better than the one in &quot;Killing Angel&quot;, as it has several well-planned events and even a brief glimpse of Alita's past. But as a whole, the story isn't want we expected from the &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot; series. If volumes 3 and 4 had been placed together into one volume, they might've been seen in a better light, but as it stands the two volumes are nothing compared to the first two volumes.Graphically, Yukito Kishiro's artwork is amazing. There is so much detail that some artwork appears like it's come straight from a photo. If it had to be compared to something, Kishiro's artwork would resembled a polished version of Hayao Miyazaki's &quot;Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind&quot; series, and even then the comparison is unfair.All in all, &quot;Angel of Victory&quot; is far better than &quot;Killing Angel&quot;, but it's not the best in the series. Still, &quot;Angel of Victory&quot; does set up some small plot details later on in the series, so it's not completely useless. If read with the entire series on hand, &quot;Angel of Victory&quot; (and &quot;Killing Angel&quot;, for that matter) will be more appreciated. But alone, volume 4 doesn't live up to the first to excellent volumes in Kishiro's wonderful series."},{"Title":"Battle Angel Alita, Vol. 4: Angel of Victory","review":"The highlight of this manga is the fight between Alita and Jashugan, undefeated champion of the death-sport known as 'Motorball', yet do not be deceived into thinking that Battle Angel Alita is all about fighting and death with no storyline, plot or character development. Discard your preconceived notions of manga being merely violent caricatures of saturday morning comic strips. There is no definite 'right' or 'wrong', or 'good' and 'evil' in Battle Angel Alita. For instance, Emperor Jashugan is a hero in his own way, yet he is pitted against Alita - our heroine - in a no-holds barred fight to the finish. There is SO much to say about Battle Angel Alita which is beyond the scope of this mini-review...the only way one can truly experience Battle Angel Alita is to purchase a copy of this volume. Battle Angel Alita is one of the most recommended manga series out there and once one reads it, they will have no doubts as to how the series has garnered such high awards."},{"Title":"Battle Angel Alita, Vol. 4: Angel of Victory","review":"this book is awsome some of the best manga ive ever seen! the game they play called motorball is especially cool! i barrowed this book from a friend and now i cant get battle angel alita out of my head.

This is one of Georgette Heyer's most charming regencies, sure to delight fans of the regency genre.

In all honesty, one could do a drinking game based on the phrases that show up ad naseum in the dialogue."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (Bantam Books, No. SB4003)","review":"So now this is for sure...I'm officially hooked on Georgette Heyer. The last time something like this happened I plunged head first into anything and everything Plaidy and never looked back- it's not the same, I know; but there are certainly many similarities. There's just something about historical fiction writers who keep the language of the times and make the dialog seem so real as though it were actually written back then.The details of the setting, the perceptions, the fashion, the attitude and behaviour of the people- there's something to be said for this kind of historical accuracy. And when an author has got that under check, well then it's all a matter of storyline and plot. That followed through beautifully for Heyer in this incredibly comical story that caught me laughing out loud quite a few times. I love it when a period read can keep me entertained this way- what a wonderful way to unwind with an amusing tale that manages to keep you hooked until the end.The Corinthian is a story about a worldly, fascinating and wealthy gentleman, Sir Richard Wyndham, and the young, very impressionable and mischievous Miss Penelope Creed. How these two very unlikely people get caught up into eachother's lives is what this amusing book is all about. While Sir Richard's family's match-making gets him almost hitched into a marriage of convenience; Miss Creed's own planned marriage throws her literally \`over the edge' to find both of these exasperated individuals who have lost hope in convincing others of their non-compliance meet on a not-so- coincidental evening. An incredibly original night out on the town, and a series of unexpected events, changes their fate forever.I absolutely loved this fast-paced read. There was not a moment of boredom or even time to ponder in this one. Like a domino effect, the pieces of the story just tumble into place regardless of all the sidetracking events that plead to yet again sway you into an ever developing and changing plot. Amazingly entertaining and as usual, a tender loving story -endearing throughout, but especially in its finale.Wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Corinthian (Bantam Books, No. SB4003)","review":"This isn't quite in my Top 4 Heyer's, but it's a very near squeeze-out. Even if Pen and Sir Richard weren't a most entertaining couple, the hilariously incomprehensible speeches of Jimmy Yarde would themselves be sufficient to earn this a place of honor in anyone's bookshelf!"},{"Title":"The Corinthian (Bantam Books, No. SB4003)","review":"The meeting between Penelope Creed and Richard Wyndham is quite memorable! They are well developed, amazing characters that go on an adventure together while Penelope is dressed as a boy. There is intrigue, a murder mystery, romance, great sub-plots, and I must admit that Richard Wyndham is my favorite Heyer hero. However, I never quite understood the connection between Penelope and Richard. She is quite young (17) than Wyndham (29) and a very immature heroine. He and Sophia Stanton-Lacy from \\"The Grand Sophy\\" would have been a better couple!Either way, a great read, and love that Wyndham has a cravat tying technique named after him!

The characters were well developed and there were some laugh-out-loud scenes throughout the story. The plot and scene moves quickly and you are instantly in sympathy with Penelope Creed and are rooting for Sir Richard from the get-go. I have added this book to my \\"Favorite Georgette Heyer Books\\" list which include THE DEVIL'S CUB, COTILLION, and THE NONESUCH."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (Bantam Books, No. SB4003)","review":"Penelope is being forced into marriage with a cousin that she finds absolutely repulsive. Her cousin's family is in desperate financial straights and they need her money as much as she needs to \\"marry for the sake of the family\\", or so they tell her. So to escape this fate she decides she is going to dress up as a boy and run away to her childhood home, and childhood sweetheart, whom she swore a blood oath with that she would one day marry when they were small children. On the way out the window, dressed in boys clothes, she meets Sir Richard Wyndham who is, as he puts it, \\"viley\\" drunk and he decides to help her run away as he has some running away from an unwanted marriage that he wants to do himself. Throw in some stolen jewelery, highway robbery and a bit of a mysterious who-dun-it and you have a lovely romantic comedy action adventure of a novel.To explain the plot of this twisty novel would be almost impossible. There are several interweaving stories, plot lines and characters that result in several hilarious moments for Pen and Sir Richard as she drags him deeper down the rabbit hole and farther into the English countryside. Stolen jewels, a murder investigation, highway robbery, intrigue, a pursuing aunt, an eloping couple and Pen's secret identity all result in more tangles and trouble for poor Sir Richard who somehow has to make it out of this with his dignity and reputation in tact! It's no wonder the poor man falls in love.I have to say, as naive as Penelope is, her wit, sparkle, nerve and sense of adventure make her a very lovable heroine. I can totally see what Sir Richard sees in her. I have to admit this book really skirted the edge of what was considered proper at the time and the shocking ending was laugh out loud funny and an excellent way to bring a close to a gender adventurous book!"},{"Title":"The Corinthian (Bantam Books, No. SB4003)","review":"This is only the second Heyer I've read (and it's much better then Faro's Daughter IMO).Pen was a very delightful heroine, and I felt Heyer did a wonderful job developing the budding romance between Pen and Richard.The plot was engaging and well maintained throughout the book, full of the types of adventures you'd expect to find in a regency (i.e. struggles against marriages of convenience, a bored yet lonely dandy, a girl disguised as a boy). I did have a bit of a problem trying to understand some of the thief \\"cant\\" from the character of Jimmy Yarde, but kudos to Heyer for having it in there - it added to the period feel, although it was fairly incomprehensible to my 21st century American ears! Heyer even managed to flesh out some very minor characters introduced during a coach trip and make them funny and clearly drawn - it was probably my favorite part of the novel, although the last paragraph had me in stitches as well, I must say - read it and find out for yourself why!I will definitely read more Heyers, and hope I can find another with the brightness and engaging characters of The Corinthian. If you're wondering what Heyer to start with, I don't think you can go wrong with this gem!"},{"Title":"The Corinthian (Bantam Books, No. SB4003)","review":"I like the first portion of Regency Buck. I can just see Pen on the sheet rope and Sir Richard catching her. This novel could be made into a movie. Just how big was an Accommodation Coach? What were the roads like? Just how did Sir Richard sound when he was haughty?? I guess I'm just unused to haughtiness and iciness of the upper crust. Of course I loved the ending--classic.I regret that I hadn't the opportunity of seeing and listening to her when she was alive (If she granted interviews, which I doubt).I am rebuilding my Heyer library again after many years. The first Heyer novel I read was Regency Buck and I was hooked. My favorite Heyer novels are The Talisman Ring, the Reluctant Widow, False Colors, and Sprig Muslin, and I liked the mystery, The Envious Casca. Miss Heyer was so good at evoking atmosphere and her descriptions, while a little wordy, were vivid. And you HAD to read them or you might miss an important detail pertinent to the plot.What I really want now is to get a map of 1812 London and see just how close together were the places in the London she wrote about. I really wish I could get a sense of the toilettes she described, both male and female. But I loved her heroes and heroines and hated all the villains. It's all delicious."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (Bantam Books, No. SB4003)","review":"THE CORINTHIAN by Georgette Heyer is a fun introduction to the work of the queen of regency romance.

The details in GH's books are the best bits, the language, the sense of period, the descriptions of the inns, the Bow Street Runner, the costumes - everything is so well researched and authentic - you get a real feel for the time in which it was set but it all fits very naturally around the story."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (Bantam Books, No. SB4003)","review":"Not my favorite Heyer book, but frothy fun.Teenager Pen Creed climbs out of her window to escape the threat of marriage to a fish-faced cousin.

Stolen diamonds, disreputable characters, a murder, etc. contribute to one of Heyer's more light-hearted farces.A better Heyer book with a very young heroine is Friday's Child.

Penelope's conversation with Richard is often hilarious. The best dialogue has to be when she is discussing a friend's elopement. It had me laughing uncontrollably.

This book could use a few more pages to wrap things up, I hate to say it but it was quite negligent of Heyer and her editors to publish this as it is - it has no real ending, we are left to pen it ourselves to tie up the many loose strings. Despite this, I very much enjoyed this book and I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (Bantam Books, No. SB4003)","review":"(Originally published as _Beau Wyndham_, 1941.) Though she has since had many copiers, Heyer was the inventor of the \\"Regency romance\\" and over a long career she rang all the changes on the theme. Some of her novels set in England in the very early 19th century were sweetly romantic, some were coming-of-age mini-epics, some were even more or less serious explorations of the lack of freedom, to say nothing of life options, facing a young woman of good breeding in those days. This one, though, is a flat-out romp, the sort of thing that would have made a terrific Hollywood script back in the 1930s.Sir Richard \\"Beau\\" Wyndham is a dandy (they preferred the term \\"Corinthian\\"), a very wealthy man, facing his thirtieth birthday, and he's also the last of his line. To preserve the family name, his rather bullying older sister is insisting he get himself married. In fact, their late father had arranged a match years before with Melissa Brandon, who is now a young woman with the personality of an iceberg and the pride of an ancient name. Since he has no other preferences, Richard should make an offer there, and immediately. Everyone knows he hasn't a romantic bone in him, and it will be only a marriage of convenience with no effect on his other interests, so what's stopping him? Moreover, Melissa's father and brothers are unsuccessful gamblers and the Brandons are nearly broke, so Sir Richard's own deep pockets will be very welcome. He knows his sister is right, that he'll have to face the music, and the prospect leads him to get thoroughly plastered one night. And while making his way unsteadily home in the wee hours, he chances upon what appears to be a boy escaping from a bedroom window via a too-short knotted sheet, whom he catches when the kid lets go -- and then discovers it's really a seventeen-year-old girl wearing her cousin's clothing. Her situation is not unlike his own: She's an orphaned heiress whose guardian aunt is trying to bully her into marrying her own son, for the sake of her money. But Penelope Creed -- known as \\"Pen\\" -- made a pact of eventual marriage with Piers, her best friend back when she was twelve and she's determined to run away to her family home near Bristol, find Piers, and marry him instead. Richard, not thinking very clearly, insists she can't travel all that way alone -- boy's clothes or not -- and insists on accompanying her. And that's only the beginning! Pen, an engaging tomboy, is innocent and nave, but she's not stupid or slow and she certainly doesn't lack nerve or courage. On their journey by stage (a leveling experience that horrifies Sir Richard), they become involved with a thief who, it turns out, has acquired possession of the extremely valuable Brandon Necklace. One of Melissa's brothers is involved. So are the Bow Street Runners. So is Piers, whose interests have shifted somewhat since his adolescent agreement with Pen so many years before.Heyer's leading men are sometimes unpleasantly sarcastic brutes, but not the highly sympathetic Sir Richard. And Pen is the sort of solemnly well-meaning heroine one would have no trouble wanting to take care of. It's a complicated plot (with multiple elopements) but Heyer never loses control of the action or the actors. My advice is to sit back and enjoy, and try not to laugh too loudly."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (Bantam Books, No. SB4003)","review":"Georgette Heyer is wonderful. Her stories are rich with witty dialogue and a picture of the Regency Period.

Sir Richard Wyndham, about to make a marriage proposal to a woman he doesn't love due to family pressures, comes across Penelope Creed (Pen, if you will) dropping out of the second-floor window of her aunt's house, and life is never the same for this very proper, fashionable gentleman. Pen is so delightfully cheerful and innocent, and we can see Sir Richard, despite his proper and stern manners, falling for her. Witty and charming with quite a few funny moments, 'The Corinthian' is just delightful, and Pen and Sir Richard remain my favorite Heyer couple."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (Bantam Books, No. SB4003)","review":"I have dozens of old editions of Georgette Heyer's marvelous novels. I was surprised when I retrieved my copy of \\"The Corinthian\\" from the bottom of the pile because I didn't recall the story. As I re-read it, some bits came back to me but mostly it was like discovering a new treasure of her wit and humour. Sometimes I would go over the same dialog two or three times because it is so enjoyable.

One of London's foremost Corinthians [fashionable sportsmen], Sir Richard Wyndham, is walking home drunk, and brooding despondently on his forthcoming betrothal. Suddenly, from an upper window, a young stripling drops into his arms. He quickly discovers that the young stripling is a actually girl dressed as a boy who is escaping from her Aunt's house and determined to return to find her childhood sweetheart.Pen Creed, the cross-dressing heroine of the piece can't dissuade Sir Richard from coming along with her and she happily leads him into a labyrinth of problems. From that point Sir Richard is thrown into a series of increasingly twisted, confusing and hilarious events. In between stolen diamond necklaces, suspect looking pick-pocketing coves, an eloping couple and a pursuing Aunt this has to rate as one of Heyer's more complex plots. Numerous stories converge and overlap - and to try to explain it would be a bit like trying to explain the plot of the Marriage of Figaro - impossible.Needless to say Sir Richard's wit and good humour along with Pen's sense of the ridiculous coupled with her solemnly-uttered naievetes makes this one of Heyer's funniest and most enjoyable booksIts an easy read and make be a good introduction to Heyer for first time readers."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (Bantam Books, No. SB4003)","review":"This book has everything for a Heyer devotee: a sprightly handful of a heroine, an amused grey-eyed hero and a colorful and diverse group of supporting characters. Throw in a road trip, a murder over stolen jewels and a mystery and there's a little something for everyone. Miss Penelope Creed is as delightful a heroine as you will find. She meets the jaded Sir Richard &quot;Beau&quot; Wyndham while climbing out of a window. &quot;Cursed with a huge fortune&quot;, she is running away from a proposed marriage to a cousin &quot;with a face like a fish&quot;. The wealthy Sir Richard is in the same boat, having just decided to propose to a well-born but impovershed lady he has been expected to marry for years but whom he doesn't like. Sir Richard decides to escort Miss Creed on her journey to the country home of her childhood sweetheart---in a public coach, no less. You can imagine the travelers they meet! (A woman who smells of onions and a small boy with adenoids among them.) She dresses as a boy to avoid comment, a device used in other Heyer novels, but not with such amusing consequences. Penelope is actually accused of &quot;trifling with the affections of an innocent female&quot; and is almost called out. As it turns out, this &quot;innocent female&quot; is the new, and rather weepy and tiresome, innamorata of her childhood sweetheart. There seems to be nothing poor Miss Creed can do to win back his affections, so she plots their elopement. This is one of several sub-plots, including the theft of Sir Richard's almost-fiance's family jewels. (Of course, the thief was one of the people our heroine befriended on the coach journey.) This theft leads to the murder of Sir Richard's would-be brother-in-law, who is deep in debt and behind the theft. The scoundrel also attemps to blackmail Sir Richard when he discovers &quot;Penn&quot; (&quot;after the great Quaker&quot;) Creed isn't really a boy. With both their families right on their heels, Penelope's friendship with the hired jewel thief, who at one point plants the jewels on her makes for a smartly paced read. Also one of her more complex in terms of plot. The final coming together of the several sub-plots is nice and tight and done as only Heyer could. Heyer's characters are always real people and we come to care for them and take an interest in what happens to them. The slang of the day, including a liberal helping of thieves' cant from a pickpocket in a catskin waistcoat, her usual fine attention to the minutia of fashion and the accurate use of titles is superb. Many other Regncy writers don't understand the correct use of titles or forms of address, one thing that makes Heyer's books superior in quality. Heyer is the first----and she is the best."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (Bantam Books, No. SB4003)","review":"Sir Richard Wyndham is a Man of Fashion, a dandy, but he prefers the term Corinthian, if you please. He is somewhat bored with his life as a trendsetter of the haut ton, and is being forced to seriously consider a somewhat irksome marriage of convenience when he is waylaid by circumstance to aid Miss Penelope Creed, an heiress not yet out in society, on a quest to elope with her childhood sweetheart in an effort of avoid a match with her fish-faced cousin.The plot of the story is light-hearted and fun, full of adventure and misadventure. But it is Heyer's style, much reminiscent of Jane Austen's yet more colorful and engaging, that makes this book truly delightful. It is a must read for her description of a proper dandy alone. There were many places where I could not help but chuckle aloud.I know you will find it more than worth your effort to hunt down and read this book!"},{"Title":"The Corinthian (Bantam Books, No. SB4003)","review":"This has always been one of my favorite Heyer novels and I am so glad it is finally being reprinted in the US.

In the hands of Georgette Heyer it will have you laughing out loud and absolutely unable to put it down until its done!"},{"Title":"The Corinthian (Bantam Books, No. SB4003)","review":"Heyer takes on two of romance's cherished conventions: heiress Penelope Creed dresses as a boy to escape her guardian's matrimonial plots, and the rich but jaded Sir Richard Wyndham falls for the artless charms of a schoolgirl. The result is a charming adventure, but an unsuccessful romance. Richard is too gentlemanly to make advances while Pen is under his protection and Pen spends too much time in the role of a boy to develop as a romantic leading lady. However, the dialogue is delightful and Heyer juggles her plot elements with aplomb, so it's still a fun read. The conversations between Pen and silly little Lydia Daubenay are not to be missed. (The jaded rich man/innocent miss plotline is done with greater success in Arabella, where a more substantial plot allows better character development. For a marvelous girl-in-breeches story, hunt up The Masqueraders.)"},{"Title":"The Corinthian (Bantam Books, No. SB4003)","review":"Georgette Heyer was extremely fond of the lethargic, intelligent, sarcastic male character; it was inevitable that she will make such one into a hero in one of her novels. Both the hero and the heroine are extremely appealing characters; the plot is rather simplistic for a Heyer novel (even for her romance), but the characterization of the hero (see above) and of Penelope more than make up for it. Penelope is indeed one of my favorite Heyer females; she is intelligent, charming and innocent, and is believably appealing for such a character as the hero to be (finally) a woman whom he can fall in love with. A gender switch confusion adds to the fun (though it's not made too much of). Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (Bantam Books, No. SB4003)","review":"Well, to start off, I'll tell you how much I like this book in just a few words: I stayed up until one o'clock reading it.Yep. It's true. I couldn't put it down.Why? Well, for one thing (1), Heyer's characters are so engaging. To be true, Sir Richard seems to be the prototype aristocrat who is bored with life (as well as handsome, good with his \\"fives\\", etc), and getting old enough so his relatives are despairing of his every marrying. But one can forgive him this, and if not, Pen far makes up for it. Her innocence, intelligence, \\"fertile imagination\\", and amusing way of looking at the world, coupled with Sir Richard's dry replies, kept me giggling throughout the whole story. Second, the plot was very interesting. It's the best one I've encountered before (but, having only read three of Heyer's other novels before, I may have yet to come upon an even better one); full of twists and turns. And for you finicky types, rest assured, it's all nicely handled by Richard's dry ingenuity and Pen's outright audacity. Thirdly... well... *a short pause* ... it's just great! I've already listed my main likey-likeys and dislikes, so I'll just exhort anyone reading this review to buy this book, or pull thy rear off the seat and make all haste for the library. Most of them (the libraries) will have at least five or six of Heyer's books, so indulge yourself there and be sure to write a long, boring review on Amazon when you're finished. Tootles!...Yes, I'm actually going. I have much more pressing things to do than sit on my rear for any long amount of time, but I will say this: if you want to know the plot, or at least get a summary, go to someone else's review or actually drag yourself to the nearest bookstore (or the library; your choice).

The title character in this novel is also a dandy, always dapper, with coiffed hair, snuff box always at hand, and a well honed ennui. In Georgette Heyer's story, Sir Richard Wyndham is all that and comfortably wealthy too. Facing a long anticipated engagement, he meets and embarks on an impromptu adventure with a precocious teenager.Corinthian is wonderfully witty. There is much to laugh about plus mystery and intrigue in this romantic comedy. It reminded me a great deal of Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, and would make for an entertaining stage play or movie of its own. The unlikely couple at the center of the story changes little from beginning to end, but they are endearing and easily championed. The secondary characters and myriad twists and turns had me laughing out loud and eagerly reading through to the end.Corinthian is a thoroughly enjoyable read that would appeal to fans of screwball romantic comedy."},{"Title":"The Corinthian (Bantam Books, No. SB4003)","review":"Georgette Heyer stories are always fun to read The books are full of funny characters and the dialogue is quick and witty.

This book is a great way to start a conversation or a debate, but alone it is a very poor way to try and cut through all the complexities surrounding North Korean and American relations over the last decade.The primary thesis of the author is that the view of North Korea as a threat is largely a creation of the United States government, who benefits from conflict in the world. The US needs to appease its military industrial complex, it gains influence because the ROK will allow it to have 37,000 troops on its soil, and as a way for the US elected officials to \\"out-do\\" each other on creating external threats to look patriotic appease voters and get re-elected. In addition, it promotes the view that North Korea always works in good faith, and wants an honest deal, while the United States always acts in its own selfish interest.Tim's claim that the threat from North Korea is overstated is one I can believe. As a long-time Pyongyang watcher, and one who went hiking with the communists in North Korea, and one who is working on an MA in Korean studies, I hardly see North Korea as a threat. True, North Korea has a military first policy, and its internal propaganda demonizes the United States, but defector testimony from a variety of sources has shown that the North wants to survive more than it wants to commit suicide in a war it will lose. The fact that the North has an atomic bomb (at the time of the writing of this review), still doesn't worry me about its offensive intentions. Still, I am not an apologist for Pyongyang and truly look forward to the day that North Koreans are free from their oppressive and terrible government.Still the rest is highly biased. Bemoaning the fact that Americans demonize North Korea, one must wonder what the author really believes about the fact that North Korea teaches its school children to add and subtract with dying American soldiers, or why internal propaganda in North Korea goes to great lengths to teach its school children patriotic songs about its military killing Americans.The author also draws some sketchy conclusions without proving them. The fact that America's misadventure in Iraq has hurt our credibility is something the author takes advantage of. Before going into a paragraph about the lack of transparency in US foreign policy - the author claims that the US went into Iraq for oil. Following the footnote and finding the article that \\"proves\\" this leads us to a newspaper article that simply proves the US uses a lots of foreign oil, something that people know anyway but proves little. Nothing in the senate bill authorizing the use of force against Iraq is mentioned (a document that includes many more reasons than the often mentioned WMDs argument). The claim that politicians try to out do each other's patriotism by fabricating threats is also unproven, as many politicians get elected by questioning their opponent's overly hawkish views. The military industrial complex, as an aspect of American life is not developed much, except for the claims that because we have a big defense industry (the largest in the world), that it must dictate our foreign policy for us. A general audience that hasn't studied US foreign policy in depth (which I see as mostly successful, with the exceptions of Iraq version 2.0 and Vietnam) will be easily taken advantage of by this book. On the flip side, a general audience that doesn't know much about North Korea can be forgiven for believing Tim's accusations that North Korea always works in good faith. Sadly, Tim shouldn't be forgiven for taking North Korea at its word, given the complete lack of transparency in North Korea's politics and its wiggly way of dealing with the outside world.Statistics on North Korea can also be questioned. When different studies come to different conclusions about North Korea's weapons exports, counterfeiting, or gulag population exist, Tim Beal selects the study that put the North in the best possible light. Instead, an objective observer should point out that the lack of transparency in North Korea means that all statistics are highly questionable. Yes - statistics should be used, but not those that provide evidence for one's thesis.North Korea doesn't worry me as much as it worries most - but Tim worries me. Sadly, some people will take his book as gospel, and use it as an excuse to engage in American bashing. US policy hasn't been perfect in all realms, but on this topic I will heartily disagree with Mr. Beal's assessment as biased, one-sided America bashing."},{"Title":"North Korea","review":"This book does a decent job at portraying the DPRK in a light that might help create some form of deeper understanding in that it does provide insight into the many accusations against the DPRK. The most powerful piece of this book is its job at reminding the reader not to trust only one source of information. Tim Beal brings to question the many criticisms of the DPRK by outsiders, and while not necessarily saying that their accusations are wrong, it does reveal that some of the more heavily biased accusations only serve to further alienate the DPRK from the global community. In all, this book does provide some interesting perspectives on the DPRK in general, and the different perspective provided by Beal that is different from the typical bias in the Western sources does help in providing a fairer balance to the view of the DPRK.That being said, I also recommend that other sources are combined with this one to provide a more balanced look at the situation. The only other criticism I have is that some of the statistics are a bit misleading, but I have never seen a fair and balanced presentation of the DPRK by anyone. The best thing to do is to actually go there and see it with your own eyes if you can, but even then it is difficult to understand. However, this book is definately a decent book to add to your collection of DPRK information."},{"Title":"North Korea","review":"An interesting book, which discusses North Korea's relationship with the outside world, particularly the United States. The main thrust of the book is the various diplomatic agreements and negotiations of the past 10 years or so concerning the use and development of nuclear technology. In particular, the events surrounding the withdrawal of NK from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty are under considerable spotlight.Tim Beal argues that the wide spread view of North Korea as a belligerent nation, actively pursuing nuclear technology for manufacture of weapons is in fact largely based on myth. The myth is encouraged and perpetuated by the US, which benefits in a number of ways from maintaining the NK state in isolation, not the least of which is maintaining a strong US influence on the Korean penisula. The US is particularly aggressive in discussions with the state, posturing when it considers the North Koreans has broken an agreement or acted in bad faith. In fact, according to Beal, the United States have broken a number of negotiated agreements relating to nuclear agreements, much more than NK. NK wants to develop a more constructive relationship with the outside world, but finds itself hamstrung on the image front, with the US convincing the world at large of NK's misintentions. However, at times Beal makes hard work of his arguments, as the text is quite dry and academic particularly as he recounts the various agreements and treaties relating to nuclear technology. Nonetheless, he makes some very convincing arguments, and given the way the US has conducted much of its foreign policy recently, I'm very receptive to his case.Of course, arguing that NK don't have the capability to make weapons grade uranium is now a moot point, with the news that NK had detonated a nuclear weapon late last year. Therefore in some respects, this book is now out of date. However, some interesting points are made, particularly with respect to the hypocritical manner in which United States conducts itself in talks with NK, insisting the reclusive state must give an arm and a leg without the US conceding a inch. One could consider there are interesting parallels in the way the US deals with Iran over the development of nuclear technology in the Islamic state."},{"Title":"Alexander's Care of the Patient in Surgery","review":"Buy this book if you want to learn the surgical process.

I was thrown in to this unit as a nursing student. the facility had never taken on senior nursing students in a long term segment (7 weeks) and didn't have any idea what to teach me or what to do with me. My preceptor handed me this book and by the end i was able to circulate and scrub on minor cases with complete confidence in what i was doing. it is concise in some areas, and detailed where it needs to be, gives great explinations and rationals. the only problem i found was the different tools. The west coast and the east coast have different names for the instruments, and the ones named in the book are more consistant with the names in the west. but other than that. love love loved it"},{"Title":"Alexander's Care of the Patient in Surgery","review":"Many years ago I bougt this book.

It took me alomst a year to find the insignia on ebay. When I received this book, it had a section on Coast artillery and showed all of it's insignia! If I had had this book sooner it would've saved me a lot of time. It has lots of detailed information. There's one of these books for each branch of service.

I would recommend this for any collector and it must be invaluable reference to any soldier in active duty or the reserves."},{"Title":"menfreya in the morning","review":"I admit it -- I'm a sucker for a Victoria Holt romance. I just can't help myself and Menfrey in the Morning is definitely my favorite. I read this more than forty years ago and when I picked it up again recently, I still found myself enjoying it even though it's pretty predictable. This story has it all -- a young, intelligent but not beautiful girl;a dashing, slightly notorious older man; and a big, old, rambling house near the sea. It was a little like eating chocolate -- you know what it's going to taste like but it's delicious anyway."},{"Title":"menfreya in the morning","review":"I find myself agreeing completely with Amanda Miller's review; this was an intriguing book. I also did not want to put it down! From the time the story opened, narrated by 13 year old runaway Harriette Delvaney, to the time of its conclusion, the author sweeps the reader into another time &amp; place, with a sparkling visual of the Cornish coast, the sounds of everyday living in a time removed from our own. The author allows the characters, in their own words &amp; dialect, eloquently explain their Cornish culture &amp; history. There is an awareness of the small details of everyday life that contribute to the atmosphere of the book. There is suspense &amp; intrigue; the reader is not ever sure (at least this reader was not) who to trust. The exploration of the Menfreya mansion, the history &amp; lore of the Menfrey family, the wonderful sense of time and place, and the honesty and growth of the characters add up to an enchanting read. I particularly like the devise the author uses to let the reader see the characters through other characters eyes. The way the author uses this technique definetely contributes the the reader's understanding of the narrator's character."},{"Title":"menfreya in the morning","review":"Harriet has grown up with so little love that when she marries Bevil, she is suspicious of his love for her. As her suspicions grow, so do her reasons for it. She soon finds her marriage - and life - in danger.

Once I started reading this novel I literally could not put it down. The book had very interesting and developed characters. It is a romance and me, being a hopless romantic, found this book utterly satisfying. It also kept me in suspense. Was Bevil faithful of not? I would reccomend this book to any one who needs a little romance in their life or anyone who needs to hear a good story."},{"Title":"menfreya in the morning","review":"Great read! Fun adventure and romance! My teenage girls loved it! Wonderful character development! Would recommend it to anyone who wanted a fun escape from reality type of book!"},{"Title":"menfreya in the morning","review":"This book was purchased for an older lady who had read it years ago. She loved it and wanted to share it with her friend. This was the large print version and she was very well pleased."},{"Title":"menfreya in the morning","review":"Harriett Delvaney is somewhat of a misfit in the eyes of her family. Raised by her father, who is resentful towards Harriett because of her mother's death in childbirth, he makes no qualms of displaying his intolerance of her. Faced with fear, loneliness, and disapproval, she runs away from her London home to an abandoned property owned by the Menfreys, a wealthy Cornish family with a dark past. Opportunely, Harriett is united with the residents of the Menfreya estate and eventually goes to live at her father's rented home near the property giving her more time with the heir to Menfreya. Although she is no beauty and awkward, she marries the handsome Bevil and is introduced to the family's secrets which include murder, infidelity, and other trickery. Are her insecurities valid or just her paranoia? As she sleuths her way through life at Menfreya, her character takes shape and the reader discovers it's hard to put this book down.The mysterious mansion located by the Cornish sea is entrancing, hence the opening line \\"To see Menfreya at its best was to see it in the morning\\". If you are as enchanted with gothic romance as I am, add this title to your \\"must read\\" list. While Holt can be predictable, she never fails to entertain. I read this book in one afternoon and will definately pick it up for a reread sometime in the future. Menfreya in the Morning is one of two books ever that I remember the opening line. Coincidently, I read that this story was inspired by the other title I love so dearly... Rebecca. If you are a Du Maurier fan then you won't be disappointed by Victoria Holt's works."},{"Title":"menfreya in the morning","review":"The dramatic Menfreys always fascinated Harriet nearly as much as their lovely ancestral home Menfreya did. So marrying the handsome son of the house, Bevil, was a dream come true, until it turned into the terror of thinking the legend of the clock tower was foretelling her death.Engrossing story full of lively characters and a surprise resolution. Leaves most historical romance writers in the dust."},{"Title":"Margin of Error","review":"Truly the author has tied up all the necessary components in this novel set in a Miami that is beautifully diagrammed. Britt, a crime reporter, has her back up most the time but slides into a more human role about halfway into the book. The story weaves through the setting, crimes and a movie in a starkly lovely way, meeting some pretty weird folks. A bit different, but a good tight story.

I felt that certain scenes dragged which left me bored and turning pages without reading them. The chemistry between Lance and Britt could have been more explosive. There was something always exploding or catching fire in this book, too bad it wasn't them. And then, when a relationship between them is finally established, in the end they part and go their separate ways. I really felt cheated.

Heifetz was an intensely private man, who did not like to talk about himself and resisted interviews, questions about his personal life, and would-be biographers. Thus he made the task of anyone attempting a biography of him difficult. Artur Weschler-Vered in this book took on the intimidating job of writing what claims to be &quot;the first full-length biography.&quot; It's not without interest, but unfortunately it's not a very good one.Heifetz gave his own biography as follows: &quot;Born in Russia, first lesson at three, debut at seven, debut in America at seventeen. That's all there really is.&quot; He was a Russian Jew whose father was a violinist evidently determined to turn his son into a great virtuoso. Heifetz became a celebrated child prodigy in Russia. He and his family emigrated to the United States in 1917 at the time of the Russian Revolution, and he played a famous, career-launching Carnegie Hall recital in 1917, also the year of his earliest recordings. He became an American citizen, making his home first in New York City and later in Los Angeles, and continued to concertize and record until 1972, adding teaching to his activities in his later years.Despite his enormous international fame (RCA Victor billed him as &quot;The Violinist of the Century&quot;), Heifetz was regarded by his detractors as a cold performer, a faultless but soulless virtuoso who played with chilly technical correctness, who took almost everything at a faster tempo than other violinists, and who declined to &quot;emote&quot; during his performances, preferring to play with an impassive expression, the Great Stone Face among violinists. He was a reserved, difficult man, a legendary perfectionist and what today would be called a &quot;control freak.&quot; He had two failed marriages and troubled relationships with his three children, and as he grew older it seems evident that he was increasingly hard to get along with.Weschler-Vered's book is strongest on the early years and the late years of Heifetz's life, but there are serious lacunae in the middle years, extensive periods of time in Heifetz's prime during which he has little or nothing to report. Unfortunately these are the very years we would most like to have a full account of. Occasionally W-V seems to lose focus, as when he digresses at such length about Heifetz's teacher Auer (and other teachers Heifetz had nothing to do with) that the biography threatens to derail. Since Heifetz made the work of any biographer difficult, it is perhaps not surprising that there is considerable guesswork and speculation here. But this gets out of hand in the chapter ominously entitled &quot;Personally Speaking: Mystery,&quot; which attempts to penetrate &quot;the impenetrable mask behind the poker face&quot; of the famous violinist by means of none-too-convincing amateur psychologizing and psychological speculation. The author also occasionally gets his facts wrong. For example, he states categorically that Heifetz appeared in only one movie, They Shall Have Music (1938). But in fact he appeared in a second one, Carnegie Hall (1947), unknown to W-V. W-V also doesn't seem to grasp that USC (the University of Southern California) and UCLA (the University of California at Los Angeles), with both of which Heifetz became associated in his later years as a pedagogue, are two distinct and separate universities.W-V is a Romanian Jew, educated in Israel, who writes awkwardly in English. His prose is wordy, graceless, sometimes unidiomatic, and occasionally ungrammatical; he sometimes chooses what is manifestly the wrong word, and doesn't understand English punctuation well. He is a writer who needed a good editor, but he didn't get one, because this book is full of annoying errors that a good editor would have corrected, and shows evidence of never having been proofread (errors in grammar and punctuation, proper names misspelled, etc.). A sloppy job of preparation for publication by Schirmer Books, the music division of Macmillan, and publisher of many distinguished books on music.On the other hand W-V is an amateur violinist, and this gives him an advantage in describing the technique and mechanics of Heifetz's playing. It should be noted that his attitude toward Heifetz as a violinist is reverential and dismissive of criticism.The biography per se is 202 pages in length. The book also includes a useful, comprehensive discography (by Julian Futter, 25 pages) listing all Heifetz's many approved commercial recordings (1917-1972) (no attempt is made to list &quot;pirates&quot; or &quot;off-the-air&quot; issues), two sections of photographs illustrating the violinist's life from childhood to his last concerts, a bibliography, notes, and an index.In sum, this is far from an ideal biography of Heifetz, but for now it may be the best of a disappointing lot. Its few competitors all have problems, including a couple of personal memoirs by Heifetz students who knew him only in his last years and which have a self-serving component. For a Heifetz buff this book is worth owning for the discography alone. But let's hope that some day soon the great violinist will get the first-rate biography he deserves."},{"Title":"Sarah Ban Breathnach's Mrs. Sharp's Traditions: The Art of Domestic Bliss","review":"This book comes with beautiful illustrations and a plethora of ideas separated by month of the year. It includes crafts, recipes, games, and holidays I've never even heard of. Some of them are fairly elaborate, but most are simple and easy to implement.I am especially impressed by her consistent message that gentle parenting is the best kind of parenting, and that family togetherness is precious. It even includes sections on what to do on those of days when children are simply impossible, how to comfort a sick child, and making travel with children fun.It does remind me a bit of the Waldorf philosophy of education, since it incorporates an observance of the seasons, emphasizes creativity, and includes lots of fantasy play and fairy folklore."},{"Title":"Sarah Ban Breathnach's Mrs. Sharp's Traditions: The Art of Domestic Bliss","review":"This book gives you a step back in to the Victorian era and some ides of how to bring that slowed down comfort to your own home.

This book though is very different from Simple Abundance. She has taken on another identity and written the book as the character \\"Mrs. Smith\\". The book pulls traditions from the Victorian Era for just about every holiday and celebratory occasion you can think of, and offers unique ways to create traditions for your family on those occasions. But the tradition setting is not limited to celebratory occasions. She also addresses ways to make otherwise miserable times into pleasantly memorable times such as sick and rainy days. While some of the traditions suggested do seem a little archeaic and old fashioned (which I find to some extent in Simple Abundance), it is a great book if you have young children and want some ideas on really fun, memorable ways to celebrate special occasions.My New Year's resolution was to slow down and live in the moment (to the extent possible for a working mom of three children heavily invovled in extra-curricular activities!)and this book is really a helpful tool in fulfulling that resolution.(I LOVE the book but gave it 4 stars because I also purchased a used copy of an earlier edition of this book which is now out of print which has more stunning illustrations.)"},{"Title":"Sarah Ban Breathnach's Mrs. Sharp's Traditions: The Art of Domestic Bliss","review":"This is an excellent book!

THIS IS NICE TO PASS ON IN A FAMILY FOR CREATING TRADITIONS."},{"Title":"Sarah Ban Breathnach's Mrs. Sharp's Traditions: The Art of Domestic Bliss","review":"This book is okay, but nowhere near as good as the author's earlier works. Although initially intrigued by the &quot;legends&quot;, those I checked looked stupid to me ... e.g., about how a pansy's petals tell the story of how a wicked queen mistreats her stepdaughters, with no positive (much less fairytale) ending, nothing remotely uplifting, no moral, etc. DEFINITELY not the type of thing you'd print to give with a pressed flower pansy, or other form of the flower. The recipes are equally impractical, since few people use suet in desserts these days.And all the stories in the voice of the mythical Mrs. Sharp just seemed stupid and contrived. Although the premise was excellent, the book just didn't follow through."},{"Title":"Sarah Ban Breathnach's Mrs. Sharp's Traditions: The Art of Domestic Bliss","review":"Probably through no fault of her own, the author writes from the voice of a middle or upper class perspective. As a low-income homeschooling mom, I felt frustrated with how many of \\"Mrs. Sharp's\\" suggestions read like an old-fashioned Martha Stewart-style advertisement. This is no big surprise if you realize that the author got most of her ideas from a trunkful of antique victorian-era ladies magazines (quoted liberally throughout the book). Apparently women's magazines have always had that cutesy-positive \\"you should just buy this/make that/organize the other thing and your life will be soooo happy!\\"Here's a quote describing the fictitious Mrs. Sharp: \\"wearing a pretty apron to putter in while she tidied her house as she listened to opera, using freshly laundered Irish-linen dish towels to make her glasses sparkle, or writing down her voluminous \\"To Do\\" lists in enchanting floral notebooks tied with a ribbon.\\"What about wearing old jeans and stained shirts to do the farm chores in, putting on a library-copy Swan Lake CD so the ballet-loving kids can dance while I'm making breakfast, wondered where I am going to get more washcloths after the threadbare ones finally get tossed out, and using the back of an old shopping list for phone messages? I was hoping to get some good ideas on incorporating ritual and routine into our lives, and while there are a few of these, for the most part I get totally sunk reading about how I should have a \\"Rainy day cupboard\\" that only gets opened on rainy days. Where am I going to get a house big enough for a cupboard dedicated entirely to rainy day projects?Here's my favorite idea: On April Fool's Day, kids and adults switch rolls, so the adults act like children and the children take care of the adults. That sounds like fun, and it doesn't cost any money, or require infrastructure that is out of our reach. Thank goodness! And too bad this is one of very few ideas that don't need bought materials.Also, if you are not Christian, you may have trouble with the repeated references to prayer, godliness, and Christian holidays. These references are accepted within the text as cultural mainstream fact, and not looked upon in an anthropological way.I should have just stuck with \\"Circle Round\\" and decided I had enough holiday ideas."},{"Title":"Sarah Ban Breathnach's Mrs. Sharp's Traditions: The Art of Domestic Bliss","review":"I bought this book nearly eleven years ago when my first child was a toddler and have used it for every holiday ever since! Through this book we have learned so much about the history of holidays, as well as recipes, crafts, and activities. Even more importantly the author has helped our own family develop holiday traditions that are both fun and meaningful, even for that toddler turned teenager! Holiday traditions are comforting and bring families closer together, and this book is a tremendous help if you are looking for inspiration.

It is VERY important to me that the children have family memories to keep them reminded of their happy childhood. This book has been a wonderful keepsake.

I am definitely adding it to my home collection to use with my own family.

And I own a whole LOT of them! I have had it since its first publication twenty years ago, and it still delights me to read it. Now my children have grown up and had children of their own; and I have just sent a copy to my daughter-in-law who is expecting a new baby [#4] in the autumn. My only regret is that my children were teenagers when this book first came out. But even so I was often able to take the basic ideas of the seasonal 'joys' and adapt them to their age level.The first section of the book is a spectacular 'review' of how 'normal' life used to be and how to make it that way again. Ideas for mealtimes, bath times, Sunday dinners, keeping life orderly [especially helpful in these hectic times] etc. is advice that will still be practical a hundred years from now.So many ideas are contained in the book that it is impossible to list them all. But I find the attention to each month and season to be genius. Sarah/Mrs.Sharp manages to make appealing even the inclusion of history and old customs, which many of our children of today probably know little or nothing about. This in itself would make the book a great read.Aside from the information and ideas contained in the book, the art work is enchanting! Reminders of a simpler time help to drive home the reality that 'a picture [really] is worth a thousand words'. When I first came upon this book, I, too, was a working mother wondering how to divide my time into equally productive and yet comforting segments. This book filled me with so much joy and creative ideas that it literally changed my life. AND it helped me to grow closer to my children by sharing my time and energy with them.I believe there is a real hunger in 'middle class America' for a return to some sort of sanity in the family circle. If you are looking for a book that will help you find your way back to such a comforting place, or even to introduce you to it for the first time, this is definitely the one. I can't recommend it highly enough. You will not regret your purchase!"},{"Title":"My Heart Lies South, Young People's Edition: The Story of My Mexican Marriage (Young Adult)","review":"This book is an autobiography of an American woman who came to Mexico on what she thought was going to be a brief assignment and ended marrying with a Mexican and staying in Mexico for the rest of her happy life. But the book is much more than this. It describes the clash between the very different cultures of Mexico and the USA which result, almost always, in hilarious situations.Almost everything described happens in Monterrey, Mexico where she lived with her husband and eventually with her children, but as she mentions in the book, the extended family is extremely important in Mexico and she got to love and respect her \\"Mamacita\\" and \\"Papacito\\" (mother and father-in-law) as much, or maybe even more, than her own parents. \\"To Mamacita and Papacito I dedicate this book in loving memory.\\"The Trevi&ntilde;o Borton family is, in my humble opinion, \\"every family of mankind, the archetypal family about whom all mankind is dreaming.\\" (Quoting from a review of Finnegans Wake). As such, anyone may appreciate this book, but... for Regiomontanos (people from Monterrey) it means much more: it describes the inner workings of the social fabric in the city, it brings to life the infinite subtlety of their ways, it gives a microscopic historical view of the 1930's that you can hardly find anywhere else, it creates a deep longing for a beautiful past.I, like Borton, married with Monterrey. Her husband was Luis Trevi&ntilde;o. My wife is Olivia Trevi&ntilde;o and through Borton I finally understood why \\"the Family\\" is of such overwhelming importance for my wife.The interest that this book generated in me was so great that I decided to journey through Elizabeth's world... 70 years later.I have built a web site where you can see how her house, her Mamacitas house, and many other places she mentions in the book look TODAY... 70 YEARS LATER. ...Many things have changed during the years but writing from Monterrey I can say, as she once said, \\"I was then, as now, so safe, so happy, within that fortress - the family.\\""},{"Title":"My Heart Lies South, Young People's Edition: The Story of My Mexican Marriage (Young Adult)","review":"It would be hard to resist a person who asks, \\"Shall I sing you a song about love?\\", and so it's not difficult to see why Elizabeth Borton de Trevino fell for her husband. Their unusual courtship and often hilarious marriage is chronicled in \\"My Heart Lies South: The Story of my Mexican Marriage,\\" a story of clashing cultures and hysterical family.She first met her husband Luis in a hotel lobby, while on a writing assignment. After courting her with love songs in a taxi, Elizabeth Borton ended up going home with him to meet his rambuctious family and adoring parents, who approve of the young American \\"mees\\" as Luis's future wife. Suddenly Borton found herself living in Mexico -- but with a lot to learn.At first, Elizabeth struggles to deal with the cultural barriers and how she is being snubbed by the neighbors. But soon she adjusts to her new life, and runs into an ultra-religious cook, troubles with the legality of her marriage, a playboy in-law who falls madly in love with a very proper girl, and finding out how much fun it is to be pregnant in Mexico.Surprisingly, \\"My Heart Lies South\\" is not just an autobiography about Borton de Trevino's \\"Mexican marriage.\\" It's also a portrait of 1930s Mexico, which was very different from anywhere in the United States -- a place solidly entrenched in old traditions. It wasn't backward. They just did not see any reason to change things like the \\"Tia\\" aunts who care for a whole family.Borton's brisk writing goes pretty quickly, telling stories of young Romeo-and-Juliet lovers, authentic Mexican food and getting drunk in front of her husband's clients. She's funny and self-deprecating, not to mention unafraid of telling the world when she committed some social sin. It's almost like a sitcom, except it was all real.Perhaps the most endearing thing she shows us is Luis's family -- a sprawling, warm bunch of people who immediately take her under their wings. Particularly likable is Luis's mother Mamacita, and her playboy brother-in-law Roberto. But Borton de Trevino brings everyone to life, right down to the eccentric cooks and kindly judges.\\"My Heart Lies South: The Story of My Mexican Marriage\\" is a thoroughly charming look back in time, where an American woman clashes with Mexican traditions. The results are funny and heartwarming."},{"Title":"My Heart Lies South, Young People's Edition: The Story of My Mexican Marriage (Young Adult)","review":"This wonderfully authentic depiction of Mexican life and culture was a true joy to read!

You will not regret purchasing this book."},{"Title":"My Heart Lies South, Young People's Edition: The Story of My Mexican Marriage (Young Adult)","review":"Elizabeth Bordon from California, where she graduated from Stanford University, gives us an account of her life in Mexico. She had led a privileged existence and travelled all the way to Boston to study the violin and became an accomplished musician. In the 1950s, a young educated woman who wasn't afraid to travel had three major vocations from which to choose: airline stewardness, telephone operator or newspaper reporter. A more stable job which I tried on occasion was secretary and took more skills. The higher class pay childcare so the \\"smart\\" momma can feel fulfilled outside the home.Ms. Borton was sent into Mexico by the \\"Boston Herald\\" and spent five years interviewing film personalities. The photos show her at the ball in Casino of Monterrey, where her duty was to tag after Don Luis Travino from the Chamber of Commerce; she looks almost like me at my first college dance. She was becoming Spanish. I had a nice penpal in Barcelona, Spain. That's about all we had in common except for the fact we left our homes and stayed away for a very long time. Like Jennie Jerome from Brooklyn, a century before, she adopted the country and its restrictive ways, and there was no going back for either. Lady Randolph Churchill became an aristocrat play girl and the mother of Winston Churchill. Both were free spirits with time and money to go wherever they chose.In Mexico, women did not discuss religiion and politics. Elizabeth taught her two children how to be cultured people, something I wish Christine would attempt with Eric and Alec. Mrs. Churchill was a concert pianist and pushed her only son into politics at an early age, like Victor Ashe's mother did. Her affairs of the heart were similar to Diana's. Young Mr. Churchill became one of the most famous British statesmen of the 20th century. Both had fulfilling and rewarding lives in different parts of the world, something Mark has tried and yet to accomplish. In the Epilogue which was written twenty years after her account of a good life in Mexico, she lists some of the changes taking place on both sides of the border.She learned by making mistakes and doing what she could. In places, someone would say \\"You don't know me but I know you,\\" to her -- just as I said to the newly installed mayor, Haslam. She knew Carlos in Monterrey. A nice biography of a woman brave enough to do what I should have, gone to Sabadell, Spain."},{"Title":"Finn the wolfhound","review":"Good book about the trials and tribulations of a puppy being stolen from breeder.

A writer, an actor and a playwright, he is perhaps best known for his novel \\"Flight of the Doves\\" - which was adapted for the cinema - and his \\"Irish Trilogy\\". \\"Flight of the Doves\\" is one of the two children's books he wrote, and was first published, posthumously, in 1968.The Doves of the book's title are two orphaned children, Finn and Derval Dove. They live in England with their \\"Uncle\\" Toby, who is actually their step-father. Toby, once the family's lodger, married the children's mother after their father died in an accident. Unfortunately, as the book opens, the children's mother has been dead for two years - and Toby has not been treating the children at all well. When Toby comes home from work, he expects the house to be clean and tidy and his dinner to be on the table. Once eaten, he'll head out to the pub and won't return until the children are in bed. He appears to have a particular dislike for Finn - a twelve year old boy with red hair who regularly gets beaten by his step-father. Derval, the younger of the pair, is a seven year old girl with blonde hair. When Finn becomes afraid that Toby is going to start beating his sister, he decides it's time to run away. Although he does have a destination in mind - his Granny O'Flaherty's home in the west of Ireland - he isn't too sure exactly where she lives. The journey across the sea isn't made an easier by a notable lack of funds - but the children take off as soon as Toby goes out to the Red Dragon.When Toby discovers the pair missing the following morning - and realises he'll have to make his own breakfast - he falls into the depths of despair. Nevertheless, he believes the children will soon return of their own accord and doesn't notify the police. However, things change when he arrives at work and discovers the children are due to inherit a tidy sum from relatives in America. He realises Finn and Derval may have gone to Ireland, and soon the runaways are being hunted onboth sides of the Irish Sea. Although the children aren't long in making friends, their journey to Granny O'Flaherty's isn't going to be easy - not with the newspaper coverage and a bounty of their heads...A very easily read and enjoyable children's book."},{"Title":"The Flight of the Doves","review":"On the surface, this book appears to be the standard 'orphaned kids with the mean step-uncle run away to grandma's' but it is much more than that. With MacKen's laying this tale subtly over the Irish rebellion of the 1920's, we see England-born Finn also rediscover his Irish heritage. On his journey, we find ourselves realizing along with him that sometimes what is 'right' and what is 'legal' don't always coincide. [Note: sometimes this book is compared to Disney's 'Escape to Witch Mountain'. Please keep in mind that, unlike Disney, and aside from a brother and sister as main characters, the characterizations in this book are deeper, the writing is better, and nobody gets married and sings at the end.]"},{"Title":"The Flight of the Doves","review":"This book is about two kids, Finn and Derval, who run away from their Uncle Toby.

I've really benefitted from the combination of the Scriptures and 12 Steps and recovery principles. I've looked at other recovery-oriented Bibles but was not as pleased with their content or approach as I am with Zondervan's Recovery Devotional Bible. Throughout the text of the Scriptures, related 12 steps are indicated with blue brackets and corresponding Step numbers. What's more, there are devotional pieces written by various authors about how we in recovery can find hope and strength from God, the true and only Higher Power."},{"Title":"Recovery Devotional Bible: New International Version","review":"This edition made the New Internationl Version of the Holy Bible come to life for me.

In the columns next to the Scriptures, numbers indicating the various STEPS are listed to show their relevance to the 12-STEP program. This powerfull tool comes in the New International Version of the Bible, which I believe is the best modern English Bible. Of course, there are many more valuable treasures that are within this great resource, but you will have to discover them for yourself."},{"Title":"Recovery Devotional Bible: New International Version","review":"Once I saw this bible I new it was what I had been looking for for years.

It's helpful at your low points to point you exactly where you need to go.

I've been to several treatment centers, therapists, and doctors. I've tried countless times to quit on my own. The only thing that finally worked for me was the 12-step program in the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. With the help of people at AA and NA I have been able to achieve and maintain sobriety. These people saved my life. The steps are based on a set of principles that require you to admit your powerlessness over your addictions, and to turn everything over to a power greater than yourself.For me, when I walked into the doors of AA I knew from day 1 that my Higher Power was Jesus Christ. In the rooms they leave finding your Higher Power up to you-leaving it vague allows for all people of all beliefs to benefit from the program of recovery. I find such great comfort in this book. I'm currently working through the daily devotionals. It's so wonderful to see how the author points out Bible verses that connect so perfectly with all the different steps. The indexes in the back of the book are quite helpful. If you are struggling with a particular issue, look it up and you'll be guided to verses and devotionals on that topic. I've used this feature more than once under times of stress and have found it quite soothing. I love the way the book is laid out. Verses are marked in the side columns as to which steps they relate to, but these markings are unobtrusive and don't interfere with my reading. There are suggested reading plans in the back of the book for reading through the Bible in either 6 months or one year-a goal of mine in the future. For now I'm enjoying using the feature of the daily devotionals marked Sunday-Saturday that are throughout the entire book, all with topics based on corresponding scripture.I would recommend this book for anyone in recovery from not just alcoholism or drugs, but also eating disorders, co-dependency, gambling, sex addiction, or any type of addiction that has taken over someone's life. A wonderful addition to anyone working an AA, NA, CA, Al-Anon or other 12-step program, or a great starting point for a Christian who is struggling with substance use and questions if he or she could benefit from attending meetings.This is one book that is always on my nightstand!"},{"Title":"Recovery Devotional Bible: New International Version","review":"I have personally used the Recovery Devotional Bible since 2006.

This Bible is great for any recovery program even just self recovery."},{"Title":"Recovery Devotional Bible: New International Version","review":"Although I have owned many Bibles and Bible studies over the years, this one is by far my favorite! While I may not fall into 'traditional' 12-step category (gratefully I do not have substance abuse issues), I have found the 12 steps backed by Christian teaching to be a freeing, healing, and optimistic approach to life and to growth in faith. I should say that I do come from an imperfect (that is human), if not downright 'dysfunctional', background.I did read many self help books and went to counseling. I always found them lacking. Then I came across the RDB. The 12 steps offer a modern interpretation of the Bible based on faith. The readings in this Bible offer lessons that can be easily applied to modern life...based on a time proven (2000 years!)foundation.I should point out that these readings lean to a more liberal, less literal understanding of Christ and faith (while staying true to Scripture). You don't necessarily need to be a 'traditional' Christian (whatever that is) to get help from this Bible.It can be so challenging to study the Bible on your own. This one offers a sequential approach to reading the Bible in a year or 6 months or it can be searched topically, depending on your current needs. I have had the RDB about 4 years. I try to read it every day- even in re-reading my favorite parts I always find something new. To me this is the way the Bible should be - a well you can return to over and over. It is written in plain English. The lessons are gentle and firm, and always based on Scripture.The RDB helps me see what seemed to be remote, historical characters in a book as real living human beings who struggled with many of the things I do today: pain, loss, jealousy and finding joy, love, and contentment. They struggle with family and friends, politics, finances, trying to find right and wrong. They look for comfort and meaning in life. There are good people wanting to do the right thing and there are not-so-nice people who will never change.And so, as I have said, it makes it clear that the Bible is a book written for people of all times and all walks of life---it is meant for each and every one of us.I cannot recommend this Bible highly enough! especially for those who have struggled to connect with other approaches to the Bible. Truly, it has changed my life."},{"Title":"Rainbow Cottage","review":"I had never read this book before , it was a great Grace Livingstion Hill book.

A gripping East-meets-West love story of sorts about two compelling characters at odds with the world in general. It's a beautiful novel you'll want to savour slowly and never wish to end.A young Russian girl Lydia travels to London to escape from her past and to try and fulfil her ambition of becoming a photographer. Meanwhile, newly arrived English boy Alex is an aspiring drama student with big plans of his own. They find themselves in the city of lost dreams, meeting unexpectedly on neighbouring Chelsea houseboats and later working together at a local restaurant. With Lydia there illegally and facing deportation, Alex is determined to help her at all costs. Will the unlikely pair thrown together by chance become victims of political circumstance - or will they manage to overcome the seemingly impossible barriers to their blossoming love? If only life was that simple, as they both find out the hard way.For anyone who has ever lived and worked in a foreign country, the dilemma of Lydia and Alex struggling to adapt to new and sudden cultural changes will sound vaguely familiar; yet the 'Green Card' situation they find themselves in is given a fresh slant by this exciting new voice in fiction, Sophia Creswell. The author's unique perspective for this impressive and powerful novel was drawn from her own experience working as an English language teacher in St Petersburg.As for the characters themselves, you might find matter-of-fact Lydia a little cold at first as it takes time to warm to her hidden charm; but this is understandable when you begin to learn more about her troubled background. Her reserved nature actually works well to counter balance the irritatingly exuberant at times Alex - a naive dreamer whose head is in the clouds at first. Thankfully, he calms down a bit as he becomes more responsible and matures as a man. Both characters are believable - with faults just like everyone else - and what makes the story special is to see them grow together as people as the story develops. This is the secret of all good fiction and the sign of a great novel.I really loved Red Tape and it nows joins my list of favourite books I go back to and read time and time again. I've just ordered Sophia Creswell's earlier novel Sam Golod from Amazon; this, too, has a Russian setting. I look forward to reading it. A new novel by this talented writer is long overdue and will help bring readers to her impressive backlist I discovered only by chance when browsing through a bookstore."},{"Title":"High-Performance Nutrition: The Total Eating Plan to Maximum Your Workout","review":"There are enough books on nutrition to make your head spin.

Ms. Kleiner calls herself a nutrition consultant, but believes that peppermint patties are a good way to end a meal and that blue sports drinks are good for you. This book not only can kill a hypoglycemic with its high-carbohydrate suggestions, but is proof of how ignorant the educated can be. Ms. Kleiner and Ms. Robinson are not herbalists, yet they discount every herb that Eastern civilizations have thrived on for thousands of years- while ignoring the fact that prescribed drugs kill 100,000 individuals a year in this country alone. The authors easily condemn Ginseng, a Chinese adaptogen used for thousands of years, and sanction the use of Ephedra which has been shown to be life threatening in many cases. The authors concern themselves with the illusion that blue sports drinks, candy, and refined carbos are the best fuel for a healthy body, but they are themselves a product of an ignorant, drug-generated-for-profit country. Too bad their illusion is in print for the uninformed and unaware. As the old saying goes, don't believe all that you read- especially this book.

A favorite for the gold medal in Torino, Sasha spoke openly about the pressures and gained my respect when she maintained her dignity despite cutting observances and outright rudeness from the international press. Despite two falls in her long program and her own inner belief that all chance of any medal at all was gone, she got up off the ice and gave the program her all. Her perseverance rewarded her with a silver medal and inspired a generation of skaters to never give up. Great book."},{"Title":"Sasha Cohen: Fire on Ice (Revised Edition): Autobiography of a Champion Figure Skater","review":"Amazing! Wonderful! And beautifully written! Once I saw this book in my school library one day, I couldn&iexcl;t get my eyes off it! The thing was I never thought Sasha Cohen could&iexcl;ve written something as enthusiastic and detailed as Judy Blume, Caroline B. Cooney, or J.K. Rowling but she did it. It seems like she put a lot of effort into it.When I was reading I thought why I couldn&iexcl;t be as hard-working as her, not only if I was just at school, or just doing anything, but I didn&iexcl;t know why my parents had to scream at me everyday if I was playing computer or doing something I wasn&iexcl;t supposed to be doing, it just bothered me so much.Before I knew her as well as I do now, I thought that she was always at the rink, skating; in fact, she wasn&iexcl;t, a fifth of the time, she was also having fun with her other skating friends, or her family. There&iexcl;is also something else I learned, if your doing a sport not only skating, but also something like gymnastics, or tennis etc. You'll probably want to get good grades on the other hand; otherwise, you&iexcl;re going to be more struggling.

Consistentlyundermarked at competitions, she has managed nevertheless by the sheer magnitude of her talent to become one the great skaters of all time, medals or no medals (though by now she has her share of these as well). This book gives us a glimpse at the personal side of her story, on the ice and off, replete with high moments and low.

Even at a young age, she clearly stood out from the pack with her artistry and intensity on the ice. She is truly a beautiful skater. So, I looked forward to reading her autobiography.Written as a first person narrative, the book is somewhat banal, at times, lacking any real depth or insight. Nevertheless, the book will hold the interest of those who are fans of Sasha Cohen, as well as those with an avid interest in figure skating. In her book, Sasha Cohen lets the reader know how it was that she became a skater. She discusses what she had to do to get to where she is today. She also includes a number of tantalizing tidbits about the skating world.The book is peppered with many photographs of Sasha Cohen, in both black and white and color. This is definitely a book that her fans will enjoy, and it is a quick and easy read. It would make a lovely gift for a young girl or teenager with an interest in figure skating."},{"Title":"Sasha Cohen: Fire on Ice (Revised Edition): Autobiography of a Champion Figure Skater","review":"She's an amazing person to do a book report on and this book was just fantastic!

We learn about how her love for skating was ignited as well as how she started out as a gymnast. A lot of her gymnast qualities translated into her abilities on the ice, namely her flexibility and beautiful attention to detail. We learn about her comeback from a potentially career ending back injury as well as a few difficult defeats.While the book was interesting, it didn't feel very gritty or emotional. Sasha's career can pretty much be culminated as a big \\"what if\\". We never really see her mention what gets in her head that leads to her settling for any other place but first. While she is a strong short program skater, her long programs have always been her Achilles heel. She usually botches a jump which has cost her two Olympic Gold medals and two World Championship titles. We won't even mention the Nationals gold medals she let pass her by. She is my favorite figure skater of all time, but this book pretty much ignored the elephant in the room. Basically, it's nice back story, but superficial at best."},{"Title":"Sasha Cohen: Fire on Ice (Revised Edition): Autobiography of a Champion Figure Skater","review":"My daughters idolize Sasha Cohen and their respect grew much greater when she worked so hard to compete at the 2010 Nationals. Win or lose, as competitive skaters, they know what it takes to put yourself out there but, before that, log in those hours at the gym and on the ice to get those programs together. So, I was a bit appalled when I started thumbing through the book and was so captivated by the fiction, that I couldn't put the book down. Sasha could not have skated Juvenile without an axel and combination jumps. She definitely could have not competed and placed without one as the rules of competition are significantly higher than the testing requirements. In fact, she couldn't have competed and placed at the very first level of skating, pre-preliminary, without ALL her single jumps, in combination and the axel. It is very sad to have my daughters read a book about their idol and learn that she allegedly skated juvenile and intermediate AND placed, without all her jumps.Then, without this alleged technical basis and skill, she magically passed her intermediate moves and free skate test in order to be accepted by John Nicks. Again, an absolute impossibility and fiction under the rules of the U.S. Skating Federation since you cannot pass your free skate test without the axel and doubles, let alone be deemed competitive at a local competition since the competitive rules, again, require doubles and in combination with other doubles and singles! But, no one has to believe me. Just go to the USFSA website and take a look at the judge's forms and the requirements of the TEST listed for Juvenile and Intermediate free skating. Skating is just like ordinary school. If you don't know what is listed on the test, you do not pass. Period. The judges are pretty tough on the skaters and expect much excellence. You won't pass the tests without a high degree of skill and therefore, will be precluded from competing at that level which, always, to my chagrin, the competition elements are so much higher than the test elements at that level. They get reviewed every year but all the basic requirements pretty much remain the same.[...]"},{"Title":"Sasha Cohen: Fire on Ice (Revised Edition): Autobiography of a Champion Figure Skater","review":"I don't particularily appreciate athlete autobiographies, especially those written by figure skaters and gymnasts. They lack depth, inside information, insight, and good writing.Sasha Cohen's autobiography is no exception. It is a good book if you're a fan of her, especially if you want pictures (although there aren't too many of them in here). The thing that irritates me the most is how fluffy most of these types of autobiographies are. Sasha's autobiography is a piece of fluff. There is no information on what the real world of figure skating is like or anything along those lines. It just gives you her basic story, how she got started in skating, et cetera. The writing style seems pretty upbeat and happy, and I find it hard to believe that she wrote this all by herself (ghost writer, anyone?)I also think it's a little too early in her career for an autobiography (I think this was published before her silver medal win at the '06 Olympics). But, anyway, if you want a basic little autobiography of the U.S.'s latest figure skating Olympina, you may want to check this one out. Otherwise, skip it- it's nothing too special."},{"Title":"Sasha Cohen: Fire on Ice (Revised Edition): Autobiography of a Champion Figure Skater","review":"Sasha is the most charismatic and artistic figure skater of all time.

This new release, obviously, pays tribute to Sasha's time in Turin and gives readers an updated version of this young woman's life story.I did not watch Sasha when she was 17 years old and performing in the 2002 Olympic Games, but when I saw she was returning to the 2006 Games as a favorite to win the gold, I felt inclined to tune in. Sasha Cohen is far and away one of the most graceful and beautiful skaters I have ever come across, and it is genuinely a shame that things did not work out for her in Turin. I feel for her, because she is such a precise ice skater who clearly has all the necessary skills to be an Olympic gold medalist, but as we all know, you just never know what can happen out there. But this young lady coped with it about as well as anyone possibly could. She could have easily pouted and bawled her eyes out after winning the silver medal, but she kept that humble smile and classy attitude all the way through. And judging from everything I've heard about her very different attitude four years ago, I'd have to say that she has transformed into a true American--someone we can respect even more than a person who just sports a gold medal around their neck. So anyone who criticizes Sasha and focuses on the negativity should see that she is arguably one of the greatest class acts her sport has seen in this country.I wish Sasha all the best in her future and hope that she will consider training for the 2010 Games. No matter what choice she makes, though, I hope people will remember her for the beautiful skater that she really is. Fans will enjoy reading this autobiography, although I do agree with another reviewer here in that it does lack depth and insight. It is clearly geared mostly for young kids, so of course Sasha is not going to go into great detail on most things. Yes, it's fluffy, but that clearly isn't what was intended to be written. We all know that there was more to her disappointing finish at the 2002 Olympics than just being \\"happy to have been there.\\" We know she was more upset than that, but when you think about it this wasn't really the place for her to go into that. Not with a book geared for younger kids. Most teenage Olympic athletes write their autobiographies with a simple voice, not choosing to go too deep. The book does, however, help readers see how Cohen got started and evolved as an athlete, and with this newly revised edition it is a nice reminder of Sasha's Olympic success."},{"Title":"Sasha Cohen: Fire on Ice (Revised Edition): Autobiography of a Champion Figure Skater","review":"Caution! This looks like the older (Apr. 2005) edition of the book, which doesn't include '06 Nationals and Winter Olympics! The updated edition came out on 3/28/06. Make sure you get the right one! The new one has a white front cover, with a photo of her doing a Spiral. See her website for a picture of it.It (the old edition at least, and I doubt this has changed) is a very straight-forward account of her skating history. If her skating inspires you, then the book probably will too. If it interests you to learn that even athletes of her caliber can get so nervous before competing that they find themselves shaking, or that they can lose their jumps one day, only to regain it in time for the long program, the book will interest you. Among other things, you'll learn that she's a relative latecomer (at age 7) to a sport that many start at age 5, and had to play catch-up for years. (As an aside, Johnny Weir -- 1st, 5th, and 7th at Nationals, Olympics and Worlds, respectively -- didn't start till he was *twelve*, so it's never too late!).If you are looking for insightfull commentary about her experiences or on figure skating in general, then look elsewhere. Ditto if you are looking for dirt on the sport and its participants.It's upbeat, optimistic, and while the publishers are recomending it for children, adult fans would probably be happy with it as well, especially with all the recent bad press that some skaters have gotten for not having performed well at Olympics and Worlds."},{"Title":"Sasha Cohen: Fire on Ice (Revised Edition): Autobiography of a Champion Figure Skater","review":"Regrettably, a lasting message from this book is that Alexandra was a spoiled and indulged young lady whose parents doted on her chosen path of development and could well afford to do so.

That being said, the book is well done by Alexandra/Sasha and gives a glimpse and understanding into her life and growth, which is what an autobiography is supposed to do.The book is interesting and well done. I recommend it for people of all ages and genders. It is inspirational, but is more of a \\"fairy tale\\" and \\"wishful\\" for those whose background is not so fortunate. It also gives insight to the cost of such an endeavor.I believe Sasha is the most beautiful and vibrant skater I have ever seen skate. Even in real life and up close, such is the case.

After all, the major fun of digital photography is that you can edit an image before printing it! The only problem is that you need to have Photoshop (along with a vector drawing program) and should know how to use them to take full advantage of this book's advice.

The Queen Mother Amestris has returned to cause trouble and Commander Megabyzos secretly leads the rebellion. Concern in the empire over the Jews led by Nehemiah returning and rebuilding Jerusalem worry the Persians. Esther's apprehensions turn true when her husband is murdered. The new monarch must select a new queen. Esther's \\"sister in spirit\\" Leah feels she is heir apparent, but is stunned that the monarch clearly hates Jews; upon seeing the Star of David selects someone else as his is chosen one; Leah is relegated to the harem.In modern times, the present Hadassah, the wife of the Israeli prime minister is stunned when her beloved \\"Poppa\\" is assassinated. Before he dies Kesselman tells his daughter that she must find the ancient documents that speak the truth of what happened in Persia to stop terrorists from killing Jews living incognito in Iraq. After sitting Shiva for eight days, she begins her quest.This is an intriguing follow-up to the superb HADASSAH: ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING though too much has to be accepted as gospel this time around. Following up on what happens in Persia after Esther becomes the queen is cleverly handled so that the audience can sense the political uproar especially when Artaxerxes dies. The modern story line has it own intrigue, but plotted to enhance the past yet comes across disruptive of the follow up to Esther. Still this is a fine ancient biblical fiction novel that will please sub-genre fans.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Hadassah Covenant: A Queen's Legacy","review":"Sometimes it is easy to believe that God only works in big ways using big events: David slaying Goliath; Esther becoming queen and saving the lives of the Jews in Persia; and Saul transformed to Paul and becoming an apostle of Christ Jesus. For the rest of us, His hand is not always so readily seen, although He is always present. He has a purpose for every single person, and He is faithful to reveal it as we seek Him.The Hadassah Covenant: A Queen's Legacy captures the parallels between the lives of Leah and Hadassah, two ordinary women whose lives seem to have no extraordinary purpose. Leah lives in the times of the Jewish exile to Persia, following in Queen Esther's footprints. As the wife of the Prime Minister of Israel, Hadassah is well known to the current world but has no meaning in her life. But God has a purpose for both of their lives that spans the centuries of time.After her father is killed during a terrorist attack, Hadassah determines to track down his assassins. Her investigation is fraught with unusual twists and turns, and she finds connections between current and past events that she never could have imagined. Assassins stalk her. Jews living in Iran are being routed out and murdered. War seems inevitable.But she and Ari Meyer, an Israeli commando/archeologist with an obsession for Jewish artifacts, are determined to find the truth. This truth saves the lives of thousands of Jews in a way that only an omnipotent God can envision and carry to completion.Sometimes I really feel like I am just a puff of smoke--here today and gone tomorrow--but I can have peace in knowing that God knows otherwise. That's the lasting theme The Hadassah Covenant: A Queen's Legacy leaves with me. The read is quick with lots of action and adventure. Although I am not well acquainted with Middle East politics, the authors provide good background and I didn't get confused.Armchair Interviews says: We know you will enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Hadassah Covenant: A Queen's Legacy","review":"Picking up where the biblical book of Esther leaves off, THE HADASSAH COVENANT traces the fate of a concubine named Leah whose Jewish ancestry prevents her from becoming the queen of Persia during the Babylonian exile of the Jews from Jerusalem. Years earlier, Esther, then the queen, had befriended her, and the ongoing exchange of letters between the two women provides crucial clues to historical events that reverberate down to the present day.Those events place Hadassah (the Jewish name for Esther), the wife of the present-day prime minister of Israel, in the critical role of saving the lives of \\"hidden Jews\\" who are being hunted down and killed by militant Muslims in Iraq. Unable or reluctant to leave Iraq decades earlier, many Jews had hidden their ancestry by taking on Arabic names and assimilating into the culture; now their identities have been revealed, and their lives are at stake. Several brutal murders of adults and children have even been shown on television.The link between the ancient Israelites in Persia and the contemporary Jews in Iraq is Mordecai, Queen Esther's uncle and adoptive father who had served as \\"exilarch,\\" one who represented the entire Jewish population during the exile. The letters between Esther and Leah, which tell the rest of the story about Mordecai, offer the key to a peaceful resolution to the wave of terror that has struck Iraqi Jews.Enter the Mossad, the secret service of Israel, and one Mossad agent in particular who discovers and carefully guards the ancient letters as he analyzes their content. He and Hadassah share an important link, and they join forces in applying what they've learned from the past to forging a plan for peace in the present.Tommy Tenney and Mark Andrew Olsen do a credible job of imagining what might have happened in the lives of Esther and Mordecai and placing that possibility as a backdrop for present-day tensions in the Middle East. They've done their research, and on a technical level --- the book is highly detailed with regard to secret intelligence and covert operations, and the weapons and technology that make both possible --- it's all plausible. I had no problem believing that any of the governmental or terrorist actions could actually happen. The link with Esther, not so much, though it makes for a great story. Once I got past some of the unlikely scenarios and settled back into the story, I found myself genuinely enjoying it.From what I gather, if you've read the first book in the series --- HADASSAH: ONE NIGHT WITH THE KING --- you may be a bit let down by this one, which makes me glad I didn't read the first one. With nothing to compare it to, I got caught up in both the present-day story and the ancient letters. Sure, I had a hard time imagining the Israeli prime minister calling his wife \\"honey\\" (isn't that a purely American term of endearment?), just as I found it hard to believe that there could be two green-eyed Israelis named Hadassah (the second being a child who narrowly escapes slaughter). And yes, I'd like to circulate a petition calling for a moratorium on green-eyed beauties in Christian novels for at least a decade. But these are minor annoyances and, I suspect, problems for me alone. Same with the cover, which brings the word \\"cheesy\\" to mind. But don't judge a book by it and all that.

In modern Iraq, a member of the Mossad, Israeli&iacute;s secret service force, joins a midnight raid and discovers ancient parchments of incalculable value . . . and terrifying peril, for they contain the bloodlines and identities of Jewish families in hiding across Iraq.In modern day Israel, the Prime Minister&iacute;s wife finds herself the target of assassination attempts. Her father dies saving her life, but with his last breath, offers her a clue about the motives behind the attacks aimed at her. Careful research leads her to a meeting with one of the world&iacute;s most controversial Jewish people, a man whose demands for reparations from the Iraqi empire have set off a wave of anti-Semitic murders in Iraq. The gruesome executions of two beautiful young girls and their parents are aired across the world, shocking nations and stirring a cry for armed intervention.In times past an Exilarch represented the Jewish people in exile to their foreign lords. A modern-day Exilarch might hold the key to ending the violence and restoring peace and safety to the Middle East. But such a person would have to be descended of both the Davidic bloodline and of Mordecai&iacute;s line, Queen Esther&iacute;s adoptive father who served as Exilarch in Esther&iacute;s time.The information that will bring about peace and justice for all involved lies in ancient missives between the queen, Mordecai, and a Jewish concubine in the king&iacute;s harem that have been hidden across Iraq and Iran for centuries. But will the Mossad agent find them in time to save the lives of hundreds of Jewish families and prevent an all-out war between two nations fraught with enmity?The ancient missives in this book are heartfelt and moving, so acutely describing the plights of Esther, Mordecai, Leah, and Jesse, whose very lives are subject the perilous whims of a foreign king. They seek to do the will of God and live lives of purpose while forced to hide their Jewish roots.

Itfosters overvalued ideas and evendelusional thinking in patients whenthe &quot;dream&quot; is uncritically advanced asreality.If one wants to entertain spirit forces,then Nick's experience clearly fits thepattern of a &quot;cunningly devised fable&quot;that would occur through the influenceof a &quot;familiar spirit&quot;.Other possibilities exist as sources forthe reported experiences. The onepossibility that does not exist would bethat this revisionist history is accurate,in other words Nick Bunick is notSaul of Tarsus reincarnate. Saul (that'sPaul before his Damascus encounterfor the historically impaired) did indeedpose a significant threat to the followersof the real Jesus, and declared himselfas the chief of all sinners because of hisacts. Paul was the &quot;slave&quot; of Jesus, andhad no illusions of immanent divinity forhimself. Paul's writings have beenexhaustively studied and critiqued andvalidated, and stand as a testimonyagainst the erroneous fantasies orfraud presented in this book. Readingthe works of Paul is highly recommended,and you don't need to remove your logicalfaculties to do it.

Popular in the worst sense. We are interested in angels, but real, credible angels, angels and ideas (or their authors) with intellectual force. We read university level non-fiction mainly. This book is poor.So my question is, how do I return this book which my wife prevailed on me to inscribe (unread) since it was a gift. And what is your policy in general, for future reference?Thanks"},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"I recognize the psychic energy behind this story. I bought it primarily to read the second half, Bunick's regression account as Paul. I have not read \\"A Time For Truth\\" and do find resonance with Nick's spiritual positions, especially regarding Jesus.But the regression story about Paul and Jesus is very troubling to me, for several reasons. In my opinion this history has to line up in some foundation with scholarship. Bunick makes claims I find almost impossible to accept without clarification. There is little discussion about Paul's letters in The Messengers, perhaps in his later book. But here is where I find problems.Bunick remembers Paul as primarily a Pharisee, so much so that he wanted converts to be Jewish and follow Jewish customs. Yet Paul in his letters promotes a Hellenized Jesus, a Heavenly Christ which would contradict a Jewish tradition of Messiah as an anointed messenger. Paul says in the book that Jesus, or Jeshua, was the Christ or Christos that Jews had been waiting for. I doubt a young Pharisee would have used such a Hellenized word, which would emerge only later.In the Bible, Paul never or almost never mentions the Earthly Jesus, his life, his healing, events that happened to him. Bunick never addresses this contradiction, that one who apparently knew Jesus so well, was so fond of him, would never refer back to his personal incarnation. Why? Also, Paul in his letters is adamant in atonement philosophy, which Bunick currently (and rightly so) denies emphatically. Is all of Paul a set up by the church?The story in my opinion follows Biblical structure far too closely. The idea that Pilate would free a known zealot such as Barabas to kill Jesus seems ludicrous. Why not kill them both? The story of why and who exactly killed Jesus is unknown except it was a Roman execution. The Romans killed other proclaimed \\"Messiahs\\" without intercession from Jewish leadership. It is well known in modern scholarship that the NT is \\"metaphorical\\" (to be kind) to the point where very little can be seen as actual history. Why is the story of Lazarus only in John? Why would such an extremely significant event, one that many orthodox scholars (and Bunick) believe was the catalyst for the crucifixion be left out of all other NT writings?\\"Paul\\" seems blissfully unaware of other Christian movements and the book supports Biblical history (written by the winners) that Paul's \\"witnessing\\" alone was the foundation stone of Christianity. Yet most modern scholarship, such as Riley (\\"One Jesus, Many Christs\\"), Pagels, (\\"Beyond Belief\\", \\"Gnostic Gospels\\") and the Nag Hammadi documents portray an extremely pluralistic development of differing traditions for at least 100-200 years before emerging orthodoxy stamped them out.Most problematically, \\"Paul\\" alludes to Mark and Matthew being with him in process of writing their gospels. I'm sorry but this feels like utter nonsense. If the two knew each other, why is there no \\"sayings tradition\\" at all in Mark? Matthew was written about 80 C.E. and clearly used Mark as a framework. It is highly doubtful either Gospel writer knew (or knew of) each other personally. And I seriously doubt they were working in each others' company. Or even that \\"Mark\\" or \\"Matthew\\" were the author's real names. Ehrman calls this \\"false attribution\\"These are just few of the questions that came to me. Lastly, \\"Paul\\" makes no mention of any direct Divine support from God or Jesus in his journeys to give him strength. Although I am not a fan of Paul, there are moments from his letters when he is \\"in the spirit\\" and most eloquent. Although we all process differently, I find it difficult to believe that a man selected for such an important role would not have more ongoing communion with the source of his \\"directed order\\". Especially since we have instances from many other early Christian communities of just such Revelations. (such as Marcus having a vision of the Tree of Life a thousand years before Kabbalah was discovered.) \\"Paul's\\" journey feels very lonely in terms of Divine support, kind of left twisting in the wind. My own mystical journey is filled with encounters with Spirit that keep me afloat.Perhaps I am wrong but I find in New Age circles often a lack of rigor intellectually to deal with many claims and a willingness to accept nearly anything at face value. \\"The Disappearance of the Universe \\" comes to mind as a made up story to promote the ambitions of the author.I have my own psychic piece here. Take it for what you will. I went to see Neale Donald Walsch when he came to my area (\\"Conversations with God\\".) As I entered the room, I was literally floored by an energy and a voice that said \\"What Paul has bent must now be made straight\\". Go figure.I am not saying Bunick is cynical. Most likely quite the contrary. His current teachings seem well in tune with progressive spiritual thought. I just don't know what to make of this story. As I said, it feels very unsettling."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"Angels are waking up many, many people at 4:44 a.m. to let them know that there is a message for them to read this book!! It's a Must Read Book and Hard to Put Down!!! This book gave me so many goosebumps because it is filled with many special coded messages from God and Jesus/Jeshua. The primary purpose of this book is to reiterate the messages that Saul/Paul (of whom Nick Bunick was in that past lifetime) helped spread the Word from Jesus/Yeshua and God, the meaning of unconditional compassion, truth and love for everyone all over the world."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"The Messengers is a stunning book to say the least! The message is quite powerfull, even if you are not very familiar with the live of Jesus &amp; Paul or the Bible in general. The book gives us an insight in the live of the Master which is often very different from the description of His Life as we have become to know through the Bible. It will be quite a shock for people who are not familiar with the other sources of His Life to find out that the Bible might not be very trustfull in retelling His History. If someone is a little bit familiar with the other sources of His Life, which are often written by authors who didn't know each others backgrounds or works, one receives an affirmation of their theories or their suspisions! Reincarnation is one of many examples. As in other religions, reincarnation was very common and excepted in the first days of the Christian Church . Only when the Church Fathers found out that it was a threat to their wordly power they did abandon it and kept the people dumb, to say the least. So isn't it normal to ask the question:&quot; who was/is Jesus really? &quot;Read the book and find out if you really know Jesus"},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"The Messangers.....makes us remember who we really are and why we are here.

Thank goodness Nick Bunick has another equally excellent book out, In God's Truth, which I also highly recommend reading after this book! The Messengers offers solid &quot;proof&quot;, if you are one that needs &quot;proof&quot;, of the existence of angels and their assistance in our lives. God works in mysterious ways and we only need to ask for help.I was totally fascinated with Nick's journey with the angels, his friend's encounters with the angels and how one's higher power intervenes and helps out in our lives. The passages were written with such descriptive clarity, that I thought that I was right there. The angel encounters were so incredible - I am at a loss for words!I applaud Nick for sharing his beautiful story with the rest of the world. It is so interesting to read about Paul and how man has changed the Bible and the dogma and rules that have been put in place for religion. It saddens me to think that it was never meant to be this way at all.This is a book with a message and that message is love - pure and simple. The message is also about trust and faith and living our lives differently. This is a book that will leave you with many questions as well as questioning yourself. It will linger with you for days and gently tap you on the shoulder with a reminder of a &quot;444&quot; or &quot;111&quot; experience! Truely!If there are only two books you read this year, read BOTH of Nick Bunick's books - and your life will be forever changed."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"Now I know for sure that there is a reason why I wake up often and the clock reads 4:44. I was born knowing there was more to the story of Jesus and his followers. I couldn't &quot;just believe&quot; the stories presented to me in Bible school as a child but who was there to tell me which version was true or at least the most true. It took courage to publish this book knowing how strongly people feel about their understanding of the truth. I personally have always wanted to have my own experience as was promised to all who believed. Before I ever knew of Nick Brunick or read the book,I have been waking at 4:44 often in the night. I had no compulsion to do anything or even give it more than a passing thought. I had no dream recall of any experience nor had I ever met any of the people involved in the book. Still I woke at 4:44 a.m. and thought &quot;This feels like an important number but I don't know why.&quot; Now I know there are others who felt a kinship to the events that took place so long ago. Thanks for Sharing Nick and Julia and your friends who gave you so much support along the way. This book explained also why celibacy became necessary and why women were denied leadership roles. It was all so simple business-like. A decision that remains in practice today and is believed to be the will of God. Read this book then decide for yourself how important the information is to you and your spirituality."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"Angels really do exist, but I probably never would have read this book had it not been for the fact that I too began to \\"notice\\" some oddly recurring numerical sequences about a year ago and then experienced various Angelic \\"occurrences\\" which are continuing to this very day!Then, some of my friends began to report some very \\"interesting\\" things. Being a professional reporter and editor for many years - Hearst, CBS and NBC affiliates, numerous other papers - and a College-Bowl (like \\"Jeopardy\\") All-Star player, and having some truly remarkable friends around the world, it did not take me long through research and personal contacts to find out that Angels were involved; and that's what led me to \\"The Messengers\\" which is the true story of a multi-millionaire Jewish businessman in Portland, Oregon named Nick Bunick who not only begins to \\"notice\\" the \\"Divine Numbers\\" but also has high-level business associates who also \\"notice\\" them and soon begin to encounter Angels.Yea, it was just like my deal, except Bunick and associates experienced a few things that, so far, have been even wilder than my own experiences. Wow!Among other things, Bunick, it turns out, also has been told by several psychics over the years, friends of friends, that he \\"walked with the Master Jesus\\" in a previous life. Well, old Nick, a tough but open-minded man, finally is \\"prompted\\" to visit another friend's past-life therapist just to see what happens. Remember, Bunick is a real-life, top-notch businessman who also is Jewish. He doesn't need money, he really doesn't want the publicity, and why would a modern-day Jewish entrepreneur want to stick his neck out for Jesus? What he does want are some answers to some very nagging questions. Something money can't always buy, so why not give hypnosis a try?Enter Julia Ingram who, over many sessions, finds that Nick Bunick not only walked with Jesus but was none other than Saul of Tarsus who later became known as \\"The Apostle Paul.\\"Interestingly enough, I also have read \\"Sleeping Prophet\\" Edgar Cayce's \\"Story of Jesus\\" which was written long before \\"The Messengers,\\" and information about Mary, Joseph, Jesus, Paul, and the Apostle Lucius provided by Cayce fully supports information about the same that is found in \\"The Messengers.\\" The latter book, however, sheds a lot more positive light on Saul \\"Paul\\" and provides additional details about Jeshua \\"Jesus\\" and his ministry, contemporaries, and followers.I believe Nick Bunick deserves a lot of credit for having the curiosity, persistence, and courage to see this book through to completion; and I also applaud Julia Ingram, G. W. Hardin, and all the others who were part of the amazing story and/or contributed to the volume's success.To appreciate this book, one only must have some faith and an open mind, but it helps to be knowledgeable about Christianity and metaphysics (or at least the concept of reincarnation); and it really, really helps if the Angels start \\"prompting\\" you.

I have read it 3 times and each time something else comes out.I have given this book to the people who I feel are in the proper frame of mind to truly appreciate it.Excellant reading at a time when we could certainly use a little spiritual broad minded reality."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"Whichever way you choose to interpret this book doesn't matter. What does matter however is the messages within. I personally felt uplifted, filled with joy, hope and eager to experience whilst I was reading the book. When I had finished I wondered could this possible be true, I so desperately wanted to believe so. To believe that there are beings out there helping us to make this world a better place to live, to raise our children in and to help me achieve greater enlightenment about myself and others, how fantastic can that be. In the midst of another war in Europe and closer to home just looking around at life and attitudes around me, I think it would be a wonderful thing to know that I am not alone in wanting to make this different, better, safer. Not being a theologian but based on numerous books I have read, we really see Saul or Paul in a completely different light and if this story is true when you look at discrepanies recorded in history regarding his life, where else do we have the same discrepancies. Perhaps we can look deeper into the teachings of Jesus, and see what he was really trying to say?"},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"When I first read this book last year, I was just opening up to spirituality and the presence of angels. I know now that God and the angels guided me to read the book so that I could learn more about how the angels are with us every single day, and they are here to help. My intuition told me that everything in the book was indeed true, and I loved reading of all the angel experiences. Now, approximately one year later, I myself have conversations with the angels on a daily basis and they are my best friends. We all benefit by opening to their Divine, healing presence and asking them to help us with our lives. Thank you, Nick, for sharing your story with the rest of us!"},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"This is a very interesting book, and must be read with an open mind. After reading about the 4:44, I awoke one morning and the clock read 3:33. Maybe I am getting closer. I enjoyed the part of the regression, and felt like I was almost there in those times. Paul was a very complex person, but he really did beleive in the message Jeshua gave. But just like today, egos, power, control and money get in the way of the real message. Today people still worship the man Jesus, and never pay attention to what he taught. I have always believed that the bible was written by men, who wrote THEIR experiences of that time ,and had never met Jesus. Like Mark, who was 8 when he heard Jesus speak, but later in his life, after much maturing wrote what he felt. The books were by some men that never knew Jesus, but were stories handed down through family. And all the letters from Paul, were written over many years, and he had changed his views many times over. I don't understand how people today can read the bible, and take eveything literally. I love this book. Good food for thought."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"a true revelation. g.w.hardin can certainly be classified as one of our chosen light workers on earth. this book certainly renews our faith in the angels. it was so captivating i couldn't put it down. thanks for the messages."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"The lead up to reading 'the manuscript' promised a great deal - very much like Celestine Prophecies - but did not deliver. The premise is good and the book enjoyable. I wasn't convinced. If it had been more like &quot;The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth&quot; by Richard G. Patton - another book in a similar vein - it could have gone a great deal further toward making Angels in our lives a distinct reality. If the question and answer section (the 'manuscript') had been put more into historical context with a few details beyond general chat, I could have given it a much higher rating. All in all, I would recommed this book since it does offer intriguing possibilities."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"The content of this book departs so greatly from the normally accepted tenets of non-fiction that it's difficult to review without risking demonisation. Yet, as one who was raised in a devoutly Christian family, I find that every bit of it rings true. All of the questions and concerns I've had from the various denominations of 'mainstream' Christianity, including my own, are neatly answered here. The first third of the book is of passing interest, but does outline the angelic presence in the life of Nick Bunick. The rest of the book describes Jesus' ministry, from the perspective of St Paul, in terms that make much more sense than the accounts written by disciples and worshippers many years after the fact. It all makes sense, and neatly clarifies most questions that Christians may have about the Biblical accounts of the Acts of the Apostles and, in the greater perspective, God's purpose in the Universe."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"The Messengers is an amazing book, I was enthralled by the journey experienced by Nick Bunick. The overall feeling of the book was one of hope, a commodity becoming most rare in todays economic and political upheaval. I am now safe in the knowledge that I will continue to exist on many planes after I finally shed this mortal coil."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"I read this book last August, 1997, and it has changed my life. Although the two parts of the book seem distinctly separate, Nick/Paul's past life regression is fascinating, and it is enhanced by the miracles in the first part of the book. I believe that Nick's message of &quot;universal love,universal compassion, and living in truth&quot; closely fits my favorite scripture, Micah 6:8. What does the Lord ask of Thee? To act justly (universal compassion), to love gently(universal love), and to walk humbly with thy God (living in truth). Nick is very believable, and his interpretation of Jesus's joy and love to all around him just turned a key inside of me. After reading it, I started having 444 experiences, from waking up at 4:44 to seeing cars with &quot;444&quot; license plates when I was lost. Nick comes out with a new book in September, and I can't wait. This is a life-changing book!"},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"Many today are awakening spiritually, and those who have know the struggle and turmoil it involves as they shed their former concepts and beliefs and try to live in the light of their new found awareness. The Messengers beautifully illustrates this point as well as letting us know that angels are truly alive and well and working in our lives. Even if one does not accept the belief in reincarnation or that Nick Bunick is Paul, the story will open up their mind to the endless possibilities of the spiritual realm; and perhaps remind us all that sometimes God does work in mysterious ways.On my 44th birthday I was awakened at 4:44 AM. It happened again a few months later. I wondered why and spoke to a few friends about it. A few weeks later a friend insisted that I read The Messengers now! Coincidence? Read the book, then you decide."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"I found THE MESSENGERS to be a very good read on many different levels. For those who believe their God to be a God of unconditional love, they will find that God alive and well on these pages. For those who believe in the literal interpretation of the Old &amp; New Testaments and know their God to be a God of wrath and judgment as well as love, I'd say you'll have great trouble taking all of Paul's accounts to be truthful. However, there have been dozens of people who have been contacted by angels (according to the authors), through repeated contacts at either 4:44 am or 4:44 pm, requesting their assistance in the development and production of the book. I find that fact alone, equally fascinating as the accounts of Nick Bunick and his past life as Saul. Further, a good friend of mine just informed me that her husband has been awakened by their cat at 4:44 am on several different occasions over the last couple of months and he hasn't even read the book yet! Who knows?! I find the book to be very uplifting and encouraging for anyone with an open mind."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"I really enjoyed the way the story is unfloding in the book. The use of Angels as God's messengers. The time always stopping on 4:44 am as if it is some type of secret angel code. I believe it took alot for Mr. Bunick to write this book knowing that the rest of the world would think him to be some crackpot who failed bible studies. I for the most part want to belive the God that he describes in his book. What I got from this book was that God lives in us all and basically he just wants us to love each other to be as good as possible to each other. I got the feeling that Nick protrayed a loving God, some one that I would like to have known. A God that I am not afraid of, A God that I could even want to pray to or just talk to any time that I wanted. Yes Mr. Bunick has touched my heart and has me wanting to know more about the God he describes in his book. I look forward to reading his next book."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"I chose a four start because it was very well done, full of information and I liked it very much."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"I loved this book, really explains alot of things your not sure about.

I read the original version and it sort of changed my life and reafirmed my beliefe system."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"I was sadly dissappointed by &quot;THE Messengers&quot;. It is clearly two different books inside the same cover. The first part promises revelation but the second part is VERY tame and largely derivative. I prefer a more gritty and compelling book such as Patton's &quot;THE Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth...&quot; which is quietly unassuming but PACKED with revelation. Messengers is like the trailers that they show for films they know won't have 'legs'. The film is hyped so much that people are conned into seeing the movie before word gets out just how bad it is. This book had great potential and the cover is the best I've ever seen, but sadly...."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"Though I believe the experience of angelic encounters must be one of the most ultimate levels of spiritual gratifications for human beings, I remain skeptical of the acknowledgement of a reincarnate being as specific as the apostle Paul. However the book projects many wonderful events on which one can build a solid base for valid angelic encounters on earth. For the spiritually quested Christian this book offers new horizons for added adventure in the divine connection facing the church in the new millenium. The validation of Nick's experience will result with his active progression in future angelic encounters, a concrete demonstration of his sincerity to his acceptance of a major undertaking benefiting the people of this erra, also accepting the accountability for his part in this divine movement established by angelic intervention. An interesting account of things to come."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"A Book Reviewby Scott ParshallAfter finishing my copy of The Messengers, A True Story of Angelic Presence and The Return to the Age Of Miracles, I want to be one of the first to call it a work of wonderfully inspiring storytelling. Co-authored by G.W. Hardin and Julia Ingram, this true story is a phenomenal account of the experiences surrounding a man named Nick Bunick. In fact, it is so enthralling that I sense a bandwagon, and I just want to holler, giddyup! I'm not gullible, it's just very easy to believe The Messengers. Mainly because it is a true story; but also because it suggests the kind of possibilities for our collective future that I think we all would hope for in our world. And in the end it gives undeniable proof that we are headed in the perfect direction.The Messengers is two-fold, the first half being dedicated to angels. Overseers of Nick Bunick's destiny, as well as all of mankind's, the angels have messages they want everyone to hear. G.W. Hardin has written this story gracefully, uncovering the true suspense for all of us that lay in the hands of Nick Bunick. Hardin succinctly details the divine intervention from a very human point of view, and makes the reader want to believe it is true, hope it is possible.The fourteen witnesses in the book are easily made believers in the purposes of the angels, once so many paranormal phenomena occur. The Messengers is an adventure in which the players dare to trust in a better humanity. The angels speak of a loving world, and tell us we can create it ourselves. The only catch is -- and always has been -- that we must choose to make it so, ourselves.Every person named in The Messengers plays a role in supporting Nick Bunick coming public with his secret. His secret of memories, from a past life he lived as Paul the Apostle. In Part Two of The Messengers we are able to walk the sands of time with Nick Bunick via transcriptions from thirteen hypnotherapy sessions with Julia Ingram. We go back 2,000 years, and relearn the messages of Jesus, the Christ. Nick provides a window through which we can glimpse into the past, and readers should not be surprised to find out that what is called a true story is different from the picture painted by history. However, the revelatory fact that Paul was not the persecutor history displays is peripheral to his close friendship with Christ. This friendship gives us a deeper understanding of the original messages of Christ, and in the process, we learn much about Jesus, the person. The excitement only begins as Part Two of the book starts, and my very own eyes read Jesus' words, and share his thoughts. This time only once removed. After reading this version of Jesus' life, I have to admit it makes more sense than most.In short, The Messengers is a captivating true story, full to the brim with divine intervention, a higher purpose, and spiritual clarity. Although the reader senses that The Messengers is only a beginning, it wreaks of five billion happy endings to all of our personal dramas. For anyone who suspects that God made a kind and loving world, this is a must read."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"I read this book with a very open mind and heart and still just couldn't &quot;buy it&quot;. Too many phrases that were used while under hypnosis that are 20th-century christian terms--such as, &quot;witnesses&quot;, &quot;the word&quot;, &quot;salvation&quot;, &quot;conversions&quot; , &quot;converting people&quot; etc.--not terms used by the 1st-century church. This puts doubt in my mind of the credibility of it all and what I hoped would be unknown details of the lives of Christ and St. Paul. The fact that no personal details of the life of Paul were every &quot;uncovered&quot; and the &quot;missing years&quot; omitted the trek of Jesus to the East is also very disappointing, and making the &quot;story&quot; suspect of truth re: the real past life of Paul .The book also suggests that the healings were begun out of frustration by Jesus since the True Message of love and abiding with God was not being accepted by the crowds. However, IF it has any truth in it, the story confirms for me that is was the WILL and the VERY STRONG OPIONIONS of St. Paul that created the Christian religion, NOT the beliefs and message of Christ. So if this story is true, it confirms even more to me that the Messanger was deified and the TRUE messageof love, life and God was totally missed by the founder of Christianity."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"Nick Buniick's story ring's of &quot;Truth.&quot; I can see how man's ego could have re-written parts of scripture."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"Even though many of the Christian faith will probably denounce this book as inaccurate and misleading, the power and truth of the central message of the book will ring true for those of us who have rebelled against some of the doctrine of the Christian religion; that salvation is available for all people, even those who practice another faith; that reincarnation is not only possible but real, and that the central message of Jesus is that God loves each of us with unconditional love and that a part of God resides in each of us.THE MESSENGERS offers this vision of what I hope the world will become and soon realize...that there is hope of a return to the original message that Jesus brought to earth when he lived among us two thousand years ago."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"This book is very thought provoking to those who have an open mind. The message behind this book is to slowly prepare us for what is to come in the year 2000. Nick Bunick's recounting of his past life serves only to give him credibility towards his efforts in the future. How do we know that the stories in the Bible are true? We were not there. We do know that there is one all knowing, all seeing, God, and just about every major religion believes in a coming of the messiah, be it Mohammed, Jesus, etc. This book is a very exciting read, and written at a lower level in order to be read by many, not just scholars.

Anyone who reads this wonderful book will feel comforted and loved by God. Share it, Iwill !!!"},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"This book is in two sections. The first section is a vague, rambling account of various \\"business dealings\\" that Nick has with an assortment of people. The only relevance it has to the rest of the book is that it hints at a backstory that Nick has written some sort of \\"manuscript\\" that he is trying to get published. He and others around him are allegedly being contacted by \\"angels\\" who encourage him to get the manuscript published. However, this does not happen, despite the angels' predictions and efforts on his behalf.In the second half of the book, Nick then undergoes past-life regression by Julia Ingram. This half of the book contains narratives in which Nick vaguely describes his past life as the Apostle Paul. Evidently the whole New Testament is inaccurate and humanity has lived and died in error for two thousand years, since nearly every detail of the Gospels is presented as having been distorted by Jesus' disciples, out to make a buck. (Which doesn't explain why they went to their deaths for their witness.) To list the discrepancies between this information and the New Testament would take a long time. Read the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts for an accurate account of the events described.Either this book is false or the New Testament is. The reader will have to decide. In the words of the REAL Apostle Paul: \\"Let God's curse fall on anyone, including myself, who preaches any other message than the one we told you about. Even if an angel comes from heaven and preaches any other message, let him be forever cursed. I will say it again: If anyone preaches any other gospel than the one you welcomed, let God's curse fall upon that person.\\" (Galatians 1:8-9)Sounds like the Real Apostle Paul knew that pretenders such as this would arise, trying to peddle newsletters and seminars."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"I read this book because I am also looking for answers After completeing the book, I have a question. How can you believe Angels guided the writing of this book, and doubt they guided the writing of the Bible?"},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"The Messengers is two books crudely patched together, yet both worthy in their own right. The first section is well written without emotional conviction and the second half does not deliver what the first half promises. After just reading &quot;The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years&quot; and it's portrayal of Paul, the &quot;Messengers&quot; comes a poor second. The first half is well crafted though not a little derivative of Celestine Prophecies and it's search for THE Manuscript. The second half, though perhaps genuine, carries no more weight than a couple of average theologians positing likely scenarios around the time of the crucifixion. Nick Brunwick (the present incarnation of St. Paul) would have done better to publish his regression tapes without all the fair-ground razzle dazzle that preceeds the final telling. &quot;Methinks he doth protest too much&quot; - or rather too loudly."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"I am a devout Christian who believes in angels, and have an open mind on reincarnation, but I find many the things in this book difficult to accept.I find it strange that someone who prays regularly has never read the Bible or attended church. 'Paul's' skepticism about the virgin birth, and his uncertainty about Jesus' miracles and healings, Lazarus' and Jesus's own (physical) resurrection (&quot;some say yes and some say no&quot;) seems odd; surely someone so close to Jesus would have very little trouble in confirming or rejecting these events. I am also troubled by 'Paul's' dismissal of many Old Testament incidents as fables ('God would never do that'), and his account of Jesus' Eastern 'education' - does the Son of God, who astounded religious scholars with His knowledge and insights as a boy in the temple need further instruction from men?I would sincerely like to believe that Mr Bunick is St Paul, come to renew our faith in Christ. But many parts of the book are just too 'New Age' for my comfort."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"This is a book that I have owned for many years and I found that all the information written about remains a wonderful research book in understanding why we are all here."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"I just finished listening to Messangers. one of the things I found most disturbing was the narritive. a story this personal should have been written in the first person. I found myself wondering why a third person was describing how Nick &quot;felt&quot;. And if Nick was now so detrmend to make himself known why did he not!! This was my first audio book. what a disapointment!"},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"It is rare that one is able to read a work as thought provoking as the Messengers. This book about Nick Bunick's current and past life asks one to believe in reincarnation as well as the existence of angels visiting to encourage the publishing of the manuscript. As controversial as both subjects are, I found the book inspiring because these business men were so open to heavenly guidance. I also find the book inspiring in the way Saul views Jesus as I feel we would currently view Jesus if he existed in these days. He opens our minds to the humaness of the experience. Much of the comments about this book are exactly like I think people would react to a so-called messiah appearing today. Some would rave, some would doubt, and some some would persecute. Who among us can judge the accuracy of someone's past life regression? The truth is not possible, but the book opens one's mind to heavenly interventions and humaness within a metaphor."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"Actually, this book is two books in one (or one book and one real long preface). The last half of the book was written first and describes the author's revelation of his past life as Paul the Apostle. With a unique insight the author shares his experiences with Jesus. The reader is allowed, through the author's story, to witness Paul's growing admiration and conversion to the teachings of Jesus; as well as, Paul's interpretation of those teachings.The first half of the book tells of the author's reluctance to publish his story; and of the subsequent Angelic intervention to insure the book be published before the year 2000. For those readers who believe in Angels and their heavenly help in guiding us to reach &quot;on earth as it is in heaven&quot;, this portion of the book will confirm those beliefs.The Messengers is filled with thought provoking material, entertaining, at time humerous, and always inspirational. If you need to renew your faith and spirit give this book a try."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"I read this book many years ago, and almost immediately started getting 444s. I happen to be someone who believes spirit speaks to us via signs anyway, but \\"they\\" use numbers with me all the time. 444s in my life are RAPIDLY increasing and I do suspect it is connected to the approach of 2012. Just this past week I woke up at exactly 4:44 a.m. and got a FEW car license plates with 444s on them. Spirit also uses 1111 with me, but not as much. The funniest 1111 story I have is years ago I was trying to close out an old eTrade account and THOUGHT I transferred the right dollar amount out to close it. But, I made a mistake and would have overdrawn eTrade and bounced a check. As \\"fate\\" would have it, exactly as the transaction hit, a dividend was posted to my account that I had no clue about in the exact amount of $11.11 and was enough to prevent a big problem. I just looked up and said, \\"Thank you!\\"This true story about Nick B. is a great read and I always highly recommend the book.In Light,Atheria"},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"A thought provoking book. If you are closed minded you probably want to skip this book.I consider myself rather open minded so I gave it a try. I thought it was about angels, and the first part sort of way. However, I admit that the first part did not hold my interest.I also should admit that I am not a fan of St. Paul in the Bible. I thought his writings in the New Testament as the high and mighty over the top view of a convert. You know, the types that get religion and then shove their ideas down your throat, rigidly applying the law and their \\"truths\\" as gospel.So, when I realized that the bulk of this book was about a hypnotic regression to the past life of Saul of Tarsus I drew in a deep breath and started reading the life this person.I am glad I did. Read the book and see what you think."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"I admire the author of this book as I have been in her presenceat a Women's retreat and am inspired by her and her book."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"Although I had very much wanted to, I couldn't believe &quot;The Messengers&quot;. While the 'hero' may himself believe he is the reincarnation of St. Paul, he didn't convince me. As an earlier reviewer stated, it does appear to be two distinctly different books, crudely patched together. Each would have been greater on its own. For believability, these authors should look at the far more credible and inspiring &quot;The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years&quot; by Richard G. Patton. - And Patton doesn't use the Celestine Prophecies 'technique' of a quest for 'THE Manuscript' which 'The Messengers' have borrowed."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"What bothers me is that I bought this book. It was over-hyped by Amazon. I didn't realize it was a religious tract. I thought it was about angels--I mean, real, serious, angels.Angels--they don't necessarily exist, it is the idea of them that is so real--can be compelling. Black angels, white angels, macho angels, angels sent on special missions, heavenly CIA Agent angels, KGB angels, Nazi angels.The way I see angels, they are the ones who do the dirty work for God and the Devil--hit men, agent provocateurs, party slush fund agents, spies and burglars.Angels are interesting. But The Messengers is not about angels as I understand them. Don't buy this book"},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"The one thing to remember when reading this book, is that it is a secular book, and you can see that just by looking at the cover. Readers should be cautioned that the material is inflamatory to mainstream christianity (atleast the second part is). But what sells more books than controversy? For the record, I enjoyed the book, because I took it as a strict allegory, when it came to the second part. I am like Nick, in that I am pretty much skeptical about anything, probably a leading cause for dismay in my heavenly angels. It's good reading, in that it tells an interesting story when it comes to the apostle Paul. I think it's a neat secular view. If that's what secular people believe about biblical times. Since it's admittedly secular to begin with, I took it with a grain of salt-I don't think people need to worry about this being the next new bible any time soon. I think the important part of the book, people miss, because there is a circus when it comes to the content. There is a 'coded' message, in there, I think, and that is on page 15, and most who read it, who are like me, will probably pick up on it the first time they see it, like I did. It's something to watch out for, if there is angelic caution, it's merited, if it's what I think it is, (and it looks like it,) regulatory measures must be made as well as ethical considerations, if it's come this far. I don't even think the authors of this book have even considered the ramifications. I think all they see is the bottom line. The future can still change, depending on what happens, and I think, that's why it's still protected and again, it's merited. Read it for what it is, and you'll do fine."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"I bought the book as a gift and thought I was getting a hardback and that it was new,. I paid quite a bit for the book and was shocked when it arrived as it was a used paperback that was $6.50 and I was charged $45. + I was very embarrassed to send it and felt ripped off.NO FURTHER COMMENT,"},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"This book may be interesting and it may have some good things to say. I found it is a book that promotes showing love to people...BUT if you take this book to be true then you must completely reject the Bible. At no point in the book does it line up with the Bible. If you hold to the teachings of the Bible you will see that the way it presents Jesus and Saul is completely different from what is taught in the Bible. I found it interesting that at no point does it agree with exactly how the Bible is written. It completely questions the validity and puts the focus on Angels on the same level as their Creator God. I recommend that you purchase the book, &quot;The Stranger on the road to Emmaus&quot; which expains the Bible in a way that helps to solve the puzzle of the Bible. Plus, how do you know all angels are good?"},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"Enough said"},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"Absolutely stunning, true story of communications with angels which finally result in scientifically-based, past-life regression sessions with Nick Bunick. As I perused the previous Amazon on-line reviews of this book it becomes painfully clear that readers either love the book (I certainly do) or hate it (and they're pretty darn vocal about it). Bunick, a very successful Oregon businessman, is today experiencing the very same &quot;love it or hate it&quot; response to his message that Paul of Tarsus also experienced in his time on earth. It is the most profound book of religion, spirituality, love and &quot;real-life&quot; insights into the teachings of &quot;Jeshua&quot; (Jesus) that's been published in years. If you're open-minded and enjoy religion and/or spirituality and/or mankind's relationship to angels and/or the divine spark that resides within each of us, &quot;The Messengers&quot; will hit you like a lighting bolt of powerful, love-filled, spiritual energy. It's more than just angels, more than stories of Paul, more than reincarnation . . . it's about that infinite, intangible, real part of God that lives within each and every one of us. Excellent book"},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"A very positive, inspiring &amp; loving message. A great book for anyone hoping to expand their spirituality."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"In reviewing some of the negative responses on this book, I can only offer the following. I have been studying spirituality intensely over the past 6 years and have been teaching a course on Angels over the past 3 years. I always &quot;test&quot; whatever I read to determine if the information rings true. One: Did Nick Bunnick have the intention to submit information that would purposely &quot;delude&quot; the public?Not in the very least, this odyssey pursued Nick Bunnick, he did not pursue it. What does he have to gain by sharing his story? He is already extremely successful and financially secure. What would be the point? Therefore, how can one come to say that this book was contrived or fraudulent? Unless such an experience pursues you, how can any individual authoritatively state that his experience cannot be true? Are we so limited in our thinking to belittle Jesus and say that He has no ability to work through individuals in any fashion He may choose? Our ability to see all the possibilities that God has to reach us and communicate with us in our lives is only limited by what &quot;others&quot; seem to teach over and over again; that we must &quot;fear&quot; in order to have faith. What about having faith for the shear joy in doing so and believing that anything is possible? Haven't we learned from more recent historical experiences that history may not be as accurately reported as one would hope?Two: Does the context of the book give honor to Nick Bunnick or to the message contained within?Simply put, the entire book is a testament of a man who loved Jesus and had a very special relationship with Him. It glorified what Jesus accomplished in His life and what He stood for. There is no question that the memories expressed in Nick's regression are grounded in the respect and admiration he felt towards Jeshua. I found the book extremely comforting and enlightening; it made Christ more real to me than anything that I have ever read. Individuals who cannot see the real message behind the story are missing the point. Nick is not looking for some sort of fantasized glory from the success of the book. Good works are coming from the books success which is the way it should be if someone is truly touched by God.I personally identify with what Nick Bunnick is going through and admire his courage to go beyond all the reasons he has to legitimately walk away from such an experience. His is an experience, a bonafide calling from God that may have no equal in our time - except for what is yet to come...."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"Makes you aware of what's going on around you.

I found it to be very comforting. It feels really good knowing there are beautiful celestial beings watching and taking care of us. Saul changed me in some way. He confirmed a lot of my own beliefs. I thank you Nick for letting me into your world."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"Since February of this year, I have experienced the 4:44 AND 44 occurrences on a regular basis. I have searched many places for the meaning of this and it is the main reason that I bought the book. Although the reason for the number occurences to me are still a little unclear, I found much good information from Nick's experiences. Like many of us, he didn't ask to be a messenger, but found that his beliefs didn't allow him to ignore his role in bringing messages to the forefront. I am glad that he made the decision to share with the world. His experiences as Paul are completely believable to me. Man has done much to alter the message delivered through the Bible and it is great to have an eye witness account."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"This is a must read book!

After reading, I felt compelled to tell everyone I'm care about to read it. Needless to say it is making the rounds in my family. The story of Nick, a regular guy whose knowlege of religion is very limited is interesting in the fact that what he discloses under hypnotism he could not possibly have known before. I really felt like I learned new things about Jesus and christianity that I didn't know before. This book was hard to put down and kept you thinking even when you did."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"This is a truly inspiring book. I applaud the courage it took Nick Bunick to come forth with his personal experience and reveal it to the world. The message in this book shines like a beacon of light against the darkness of the apocalyptic cries of most of the world's religions. It is vastly comforting to know there are many people ( and even angels) who are actively working to bring peace to earth. It is a must read for anyone dissatified with the dogma of religion and who suspects the true teachings of Jesus may have been lost in transit."},{"Title":"The Messengers","review":"Finally, someone that makes sense to me and confirms my beliefs that the 10 commandments and most other ritualistic practices are for control of the masses. Jesus was sent because we just weren't getting it - to love and respect each other. The bible has made him the Son of God totally missing the point that we all are Children of God. And Paul, through Nick Bunick, is setting the record straight. Yes, Jesus existed as a Master and teacher.

The story is about some children who meet a stranger and then depart on a long journey, on route having to contend with certain challenges,some seemingly insurmountable. However as I read I got more absorbed into this fairly dark tale of a long ardous journey involving some lovable and some not-so loveable characters.The end I shouldn't reveal but will promise to please all. I would like to say that this story so amazingly written moves the reader either young or old between incredible depths of despair, hope and joy and at the same time giving valuable insight into our attempts to achieve moral character as we grow older.

Interestingly, the book arose from a series of letters to an &quot;unknown sister in Christ&quot; (the original text contains many female pronouns) on the spiritual life. The theme of spiritual combat is certainly present throughout the text, but Scupoli sees this battle as being won by not relying on self or trusting oneself but by confidence in God. Establishing this foundation first, he continues with advice on overcoming vices and the snares of the devil, growing in virtue, prayer and meditation, and practical advice on a few other topics. His words show great wisdom and spiritual depth, and the success of the book (600 editions in the four centuries since his death) is well deserved. One of the places it ended up was in the Greek monasteries of Mt. Athos, where Nicodemus of the Holy Mountain translated it with some editorial changes to make it more suitable to Orthodox readers. He added Scripture texts as well. It was this version that came into the hands of a Russian, Theophan the Recluse, who translated it into Russian with even more substantive changes ( the Jesus Prayer, quotes from the Fathers) that left some chapters entirely reworked, although others retain the wording of Scupoli's original. This work became an Orthodox classic in its own right, and which is here published under the title &quot;Unseen Warfare&quot;. It is marked by a profound wisdom of its own, and both Scupoli's text and this one are the sort of work that can provide spiritual meat for those who are willing to read and re-read them, chewing on their spiritual themes. I have found it an excellent meditation for growing in Christian character and building strong faith. I hope it helps you too! (Scupoli's work, by the way, can be found with an introduction in the book &quot;Theatine Spirituality: Selected Writings&quot; which is part of the Classics of Western Spirituality series put out by Paulist Press--perhaps readers not inclined to the Orthodoxy in &quot;Unseen Warfare&quot; would prefer the original Roman Catholic work)."},{"Title":"Unseen Warfare: The Spiritual Combat and Path to Paradise of Lorenzo Scupoli","review":"the Roman Catholic version from Tan Books is the more literal translation, and the wording more direct, however, this the Orthodox text is more of an interpretive rewrite containing many insightful embellishments that are certainly worth digesting. The 60 page introduction, though longer than necessary, provides background information that heightens one's appreciation of this 500 year old classic. For Protestants, this is the version I recommend, but if one can't read &lt;God punishes&gt; and think &lt;God disciplines&gt;, then bypass this book entirely. To truly appreciate the work, I suggest reading both a chapter at a time simultaneously, which can easily be done in 2 months if used as a daily reader. The chapters are short (1-5 pages) and limited to single topics. Many people preach what others should do, this tells how. Must reading if spiritual growth, to grow in virtue and moral purity in the presence of our Lord, is your desire."},{"Title":"Unseen Warfare: The Spiritual Combat and Path to Paradise of Lorenzo Scupoli","review":"As a Christian pacifist, I'm extremely wary of militaristic language, in either common speech (\\"bullet points\\" or \\"I got bombed last night\\") or allegedly spiritual discourse (\\"Onward Christian soldiers, marching off to war...\\"). So I was initially put off by the title _Unseen Warfare_. But as soon as I began reading the book, it becane clear that the type of warfare discussed was quite different from what we usually take the word to mean.Scupoli (along with Nicodemus & Theophan, his Orthodox editors) argues that Christian perfection lies in aligning one's will with God's, but that this alignment is extremely difficult because an entire army of contrary \\"wills\\" resides in us, continuously dragging us away from God. In order to counter these \\"wills,\\" the Christian must arm herself with \\"invisible weapons.\\" The \\"most trustworthy and unconquerable\\" of them are: (1) never rely on yourself in anything; (2) always bear in your heart a perfect and all-daring trust in God alone; (3) strive without ceasing; and (4) remain constantly in prayer.It's clear that these weapons, rather than seeking to overpower by sheer brute strength, take seriously the strength-through- powerlessness that St. Paul writes about. Unseen warfare is fought not by pitting one's will against a foe, but by surrendering oneself to God; not by trusting in one's own resources, but by acknowledging dependence; not by risking everything on one flashy, dramatic battle, but by persevering, little by little, day by day; and not by drawing up battle plans so much as by ceaseless praying. The language may be militaristic, but the purport of the language actually subverts the violence and self-assertion associated with war. It speaks of self-sacrifice, love, devotion, discipline._Unseen Warfare_ is a sobering read, because it convicts the reader (or at least it convicted THIS reader) of falling woefully short in the quest for Christian perfection. But it's also an inspiring and ennobling read, because it encourages the reader to greater resolve. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Unseen Warfare: The Spiritual Combat and Path to Paradise of Lorenzo Scupoli","review":"All I would add to the previous reviews is that I found the chapters on prayer - largely the work of St. Theophan rather than Scupoli - to be especially useful. His approach to prayer is the classical approach of the Eastern Church. These chapters alone are worth the price of the book and justify chosing the Orthodox rewrite over the original."},{"Title":"Unseen Warfare: The Spiritual Combat and Path to Paradise of Lorenzo Scupoli","review":"This book will set you on the path to God, if you so desire.

Earlier copies fallen apart from use.This work along with St. John Cassian's Conferences gives the needed help for the stuggles of our journey through life.When started, this work may appear a fairly easy read. Upon reflection it is very deep and rich guide. Well worth the time to read and follow the advice.I strongly recommend this edition."},{"Title":"Unseen Warfare: The Spiritual Combat and Path to Paradise of Lorenzo Scupoli","review":"While a number of books on Christian spirituality discuss the ascetic means by which reunion with God can be facilitated this is one of the few I have found in English geared toward the layperson (but still relevant for the ascetic).I cannot add a great deal to what other reviewers have said except that I was pleased but not surprised to discover that St Nektarios was said to regularly read Unseen Warfare (see \\"St Nektarios\\", a Saint for Our Century). After reading this remarkable Saint's life this is no surprise. The (Orthodox) Church has exalted Nektarios to the level of the Holy Fathers evidently because he battled and defeated his passions while living in the world--an often more difficult feat than doing so in seclusion.To accomplish such instruction Unseen Warfare takes the teachings one would derive from reading the lives of the saints and/or the Philokalia and places them within an almost instruction manual setting. However, it is far more readable and alive that a simple manual. The book speaks to the reader in a fashion that a staretz would speak to his son or daughter.I would disagree with some reviewers who have said it is a good \\"introduction\\" to spirituality. If one is looking for dense theological material then indeed, Unseen Warfare, may seem more straightforward. It is also easier to read than say, the \\"Ascetical Homilies of St. Isaac the Syrian\\". However, the former such work is not intended for spiritual development and the latter is for the monk (peroperly guided by a spiritual father) who has reached a very advanced spiritual level. Moreover, putting what is said into practice (which theological material almost never concerns itself with) makes it as \\"deep\\" as the writings of St Simeon the New Theologian or Abba Dorotheos (from whom many discussions are borrowed).One thing I would suggest is to skip the introduction. It is misleading and often simply incorrect about what is going on in the text. The author (H.A. Hodges) also seems only to refer to Catholic figures as saints while disrespectfully referring to St. Nicodemus and St. Theophan as merely \\"Nicodemus and Theophan\\". Moreover, the introduction, while making an attempt to sound deeply theological is rather simple-minded, or I should say, \\"simple-hearted\\". Hodges clearly has little idea of what the essence or goal of spiritual struggle is yet he wishes to overlook its nuances in order to make the Roman and Orthodox Churches appear to be \\"two sides of the same coin\\". He neglects the fact that grace is simply more perceptible in one church than in the other and that much of this is due to the Orthodox preservation of the essential lessons contained in Unseen Warfare. Such a reductionist approach merely wastes the reader's time and delays the valuable lessons of the text.Finally, and I say this with caution, while I believe everyone needs a spiritual father (a guide who can objectively evaluate your thinking, as the book suggests) the book is an excellent guide for someone who has yet to find one BUT who prays to God that one will be given to her. Temporarily, it can suffice to answer a number of questions when no one experienced in spiritual warfare is around to assist."},{"Title":"Unseen Warfare: The Spiritual Combat and Path to Paradise of Lorenzo Scupoli","review":"\`For the good that I would do, I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do'Romans 7:19Very many wish to be vouchsafed the Kingdom without labours, without struggles, without sweat; but this is impossible.If you love the glories of men, and desire to be worshipped, and seek comfort, you are going off the path. You must be crucified with the Crucified One, suffer with Him that suffered, that you may be glorified with Him that is glorified.- St. Macarius of EgyptHow many times have you sought to please God - and yet no matter how hard you try, you fall? And the same thing happens over and over again. The words of St Paul ring true for many people - as much as we seek to please God, we cannot. Why? According to Unseen Warfare, the number one reason is self-reliance. Instead of acknowledging ourselves as weak and trusting in God, we trust in our efforts alone. This book thus seeks to challenge and change the struggler's methods in battling for their salvation.There are four main methods suggested in this book -(i) Do not trust in yourself but in God alone(ii) Pray with warm hearted, humble prayers(iii) Be wary of the evil one and his traps at all times(iv) If you transgress, quickly turn to repentance but do not despair.The book elaborates on each of these four points and gives solid advice on how to conquer your passions. In addition to this, there is a separate section devoted to prayer, where suggestions are made on how we should accustom ourselves to pray with all sincerity before God.This book has drawn a certain amount of criticism from some reviewers. One reviewer (astonishingly) admits to not having actually read the whole book, and yet feels he is in a position to describe it as being \`not really Orthodox'. This, despite the fact that it was re-written by two Orthodox saints precisely for the assistance and edification of Orthodox Christians. Furthermore, it has been approved by Mount Athos. The reviewer appears to believe that man is saved by faith alone. Yet, how do we demonstrate our faith in God? Through works. And what are those works? Repentance and the fulfilling of God's commandments. That is the essence of this book. It gives us the \`spiritual weapons' needed to show our faith in God through our works - through amending our lives to live in accordance with God's laws and in accordance with the way God has intended us to live. As we read in John 14:23 \`Jesus answered and said unto him, if a man loves Me, he will keep My words: and My Father will love him, and We will come unto him, and make Our abode with him.' Indeed, if your belief is such that you think you only need \`faith', without any form of self-amendment, then this book is certainly not for you. If on the other hand, you wish to at least attempt to follow Jesus' commandment when He says \`he who wishes to be My disciple, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me', then read this book as it teaches us the methods by which we deny ourselves and follow the Lord with faith and trust in Him alone.One final note, this book has been excellently summarised by Fr. Jack N Sparks into three short books, written specifically with the layman in mind. These books, published by Conciliar Press are:Virtue in the Unseen Warfare;Prayer in the Unseen Warfare; andVictory in the Unseen Warfare."},{"Title":"Unseen Warfare: The Spiritual Combat and Path to Paradise of Lorenzo Scupoli","review":"Every Christian is faced with a battle with an unseen foe.

I am still in the process of reading the book, but I find many of the concepts within it unorthodox. Despite the editing that was done by SS. Theophan and Nicodemus, I am very aware as I read, that this is the work of a Roman Catholic, not an Orthodox writer.Constant references to our total depravity (very strongly implied), God being \\"offended,\\" an emphasis on the Passion (kissing the wounds of Christ), and God allowing us to fall into sin to teach us a lesson; these are some of the Latin teachings that permeate this work.\\"...There is nothing He (God) loves and desires to see in us more than a sincere consciousness of our nothingness...and that nothing good can ever come from ourselves, whether a good thought or a good action.\\" (p.82)According to Bishop Kallistos, \\"Orthodox do not say, as Calvin said, that man after the fall was utterly depraved and incapable of good desires...the image of God is distorted by sin, but never destroyed.\\"I know men and women that are even atheists (and I pray that they come to the truth), but I know from experience they are capable of some good thoughts and actions.There are many examples of men and women in the scriptures that were found pleasing to God by their own actions, for example, the Centurion that asked the Lord to heal his servant, and the Lord stated, \\"I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.\\" )Luke 7: 1-9)In defense of this work, even some Orthodox works, those that originate from a monastic source, often over-emphasize man's depravity. It comes with the territory.I am no Orthodox scholar, and I am glad that this work has assisted so many in their spiritual struggle, but I have read many Orthodox works, and as I stated above, I am very aware as I read this, that much of it comes from a non-Orthodox mindset.May Christ have mercy on me, a sinner."},{"Title":"Unseen Warfare: The Spiritual Combat and Path to Paradise of Lorenzo Scupoli","review":"See Peterprint 's comments in this 2-star review section.

I had never heard of Nicholas Berdyaev in my life, but the identification of his ideas with Freedom in God led me to give this little book a look. Berdyaev was a Russian who embraced Marxism in his youth before turning to the values of Orthodox Christianity; he rejected Russian Communism in the wake of the Bolshevik Revolution, and he was in fact exiled in 1922, eventually settling to live and teach in Paris. This discussion of his ideas helps elucidate some of the differences between eastern and western Christianity, serves up an interesting take on Russian Communism in its post-World War II incarnation, and proposes the interesting idea of a New Middle Ages as being a good thing.Berdyaev practiced a somewhat mystical sort of Christianity, entrenched in the conception of the God-man. Religion was merely a social phenomenon telling believers what to believe; Berdyaev disliked the hierarchical structure of the Church and concentrated on the unity of Christ and man, believing that man should in fact work toward the end times when he would in fact become God. He criticized western Christianity for its obsession with sin and the need for salvation, and he yearned for the return of man to a life centered around nature and communion with God. A Christian Humanist, he looked back on the Renaissance, Reformation, and Industrial Revolution with disdain, tracing the origins of the detachment of humanism from Christianity to those times. He criticized modern society for its compartmentalization of religion, arguing that God should be at the center of all things. He criticized capitalism for its emphasis on the accumulation of wealth and power, but he actually saw Russian Communism as the culmination of the bourgeois and capitalist mentality, describing it as a system of government in which the individual was subsumed by the society as a whole.Berdyaev longed for a New Middle Ages, a time when men would once again return to God to find true freedom and meaning free of the corrupting influences of money and power and the unhelpful symbolism of the Church hierarchy and thus establish a society truly built on love and genuine communion on a wholly spiritual scale. Author E.L. Allen criticizes Berdyaev for failing to recognize the potential of democracy to provide the kinds of personal freedoms he felt were crucial to establishing a personal communion with God.This is a short little book, but it contains some very interesting ideas on both capitalism and Communism, an unusual criticism of Communism from a former Marxist, and a bold take on the future society Berdyaev longed for. His mystical take on Christianity is interesting, and I found his insights into the breakup of Christianity into its western and eastern Orthodox forms surprisingly informative."},{"Title":"Under the Apple Tree","review":"&quot;Under the Apple Tree&quot; by Lilian Harry is a really great book.

He wrote in the Preface to the First (1955) edition, \\"The essays here collected deal with a variety of subjects, but in all of them the author will be seen at grips with problems belonging to the same order.\\" (Pg. 7)Although he deals with Ranke, Carlyle, Michelet, Macaulay, Sorokin, and Berlin, Arnold Toynbee is a particular focus of his. He summarizes Toynbee'sA Study of History: Abridgement of Volumes I-VI, \\"To survey history as a whole, to discover trends in its movement, to seek out its meaning---Professor Toynbee is not the first to undertake the attempt. He joins the company of St. Augustine and Bousset, Condorcet, Hegel, Marx, Buckle, Wells, Spengler; nor is he the least among them... Toynbee lives with the Bible, and its texts lie scattered thickly over his pages.\\" (Pg. 109)He argues, Toynbee \\"selects the instances which will support his theses, or he presents them in the way that suits him, and he does so with an assurance that hardly leaves room for the suspicion not only that one might quote innumerable others with which his theses would not bear company but especially that those cases he does mention can be explained or described in a different way so as to disagree no less completely with his theses.\\" (Pg. 116)He points out, \\"In the theoretical development of his system Professor Toynbee poses a dilemma: a civilization is either in growth of it is in disintegration... one is surprised at his leaving open the question as to the state in which we find ourselves.\\" (Pg. 140) He concludes, \\"this prophet [Toynbee] usurps the name of historian and... I regard his prophecy as a blasphemy against Western civilization.\\" (Pg. 202)Geyl's critical look at these historians will be of great value to anyone interested in the philosophy of history."},{"Title":"Debates with historians (Meridian books)","review":"In zijn in 1942 te St. Michielsgestel opgetekende en later door hemzelf geannoteerde autobiografie, toont de auteur zichzelf zodanig dat de belangrijke vraag gesteld dient te worden; willen wij dit eigenlijk wel weten? Een onmiskenbaar, misschien onbedoeld gevolg van zijn openhartigheid is dat Pieter Geyl zichzelf voor het nageslacht presenteert als een enorm zelfingenomen, betweterige en arrogante man, met een welhaast ziekelijke geldingsdrang. Maar waarom is deze autobiografie dan toch zo'n waardevol boek?Het genre van de autobiografie brengt als het goed is, wil het niet tot hagiografie vervallen, met zich mee dat de auteur ook de minder glansrijke kanten van zichzelf de revue laat passeren. Zo beleed bijvoorbeeld Augustinus zijn losbolligheid voorafgaand aan zijn bekering en beschreef Rousseau onder meer hoe hij zij vrouw en kinderen aan hun lot overliet voor een relatie met een adelijke dame. Idealiter komen ontboezemingen de geloofwaardigheid en de leesbaarheid van het levensverhaal ten goede. De vraag is of Geyls amoureuze opsnijderijen, kleingeestige veroordelingen van anderen en verbazingwekkende gebrek aan zelfreflectie dit effect hebben.Pieter Geyl is een belangwekkende figuur in de twintigste-eeuwse Nederlands historiografie. Met generatiegenoot Jan Romein bepaalde hij het gezicht van de Nederlandse geschiedschrijving in de jaren direct na de Tweede Wereldoorlog. Geyl verwierf zich in de jaren vijftig internationale faam met zijn Debates with Historians waarin hij polemiseerde met grootheden als Ranke en Michelet en eigentijdse historici als Toynbee en Sorokin. Voor de oorlog had Geyl zijn sporen al zodanig verdiend dat hij, in 1940 als vooraanstaande Nederlander, door de Duitsers werd genterneerd in Beekvliet bij St. Michielsgestel.Dat Geyl de publiciteit en politiek activisme niet schuwde, mag een understatement genoemd worden. Als correspondent voor de NRC en later hoogleraar in Londen, bleef hij een vinger aan de pols houden van hetgeen zich in Nederland afspeelde, zowel in de wetenschap als de politiek. Het belangrijkste politieke engagement dat Geyl in deze tijd aanging, was dat van het Groot-Nederlandse en Dietsche gedachtegoed. Dit streven dat zich, uitgaande van de idee dat Vlaanderen en Nederland een culturele eenheid vormden, inzette voor het samengaan van beide vond in hem een van de belangrijkste pleitbezorgers. Geyls anti-Belgicistisch activisme werd hem door zowel de Nederlandse als de Belgische autoriteiten niet in dank afgenomen.Deze kwestie verschaft een mooi inzicht in een aantal opvallende kenmerken van de persoon Geyl zoals hij zichzelf presenteert. Ten eerste springt een aantal omissies in het oog. Voor een zaak die zo bepalend was voor zijn latere carrire, blijft hij, althans in dit boek, nogal onuitgesproken over de precieze beweegredenen voor zijn vurige enthousiasme voor de Groot-Nederlandse idee. In het verlengde hiervan is het op zijn zachtst gezegd opmerkelijk dat Geyl zich, in alle oprechtheid naar het schijnt, regelmatig allerlei momenteuze ontmoetingen en besprekingen niet meer kan herinneren. En voorbeeld hiervan is dat hij in de late jaren twintig nota bene een persoonlijk onderhoud heeft met Colijn over een geschil betrekking hebbend op de moeizame verhouding tussen de havens van Rotterdam en Antwerpen. Geyl, die zijn grote betrokkenheid bij deze zaak aangeeft en de diepe indruk die het op hem maakte beschrijft, besluit met de teleurstellende mededeling 'Resultaat (van de bespreking, bvdb)? Weet ik niet meer.' Deze vergeetachtigheid is niet incidenteel en betreft geen herinneringen van een stokoude man die tachtig jaar leven probeert terug te halen. Geyl was begin vijftig toen hij gebeurtenissen beschreef die van redelijk recente datum waren. Naar aanleiding van dit voorbeeld dringt de vraag zich dan ook op hoe ver Geyls Groot-Nederlandse politieke engagement eigenlijk ging.Het belang van deze autobiografie is gelegen in de vragen die het oproept, niet in de vragen die het beantwoord. De stijgende ergernis over hoe Geyl zichzelf voortdurend op de borst slaat en ieder ander persoon in meer of mindere mate (meestal meer) desavoueert, werkt bij het lezen van 'Ik die zo weinig in het verleden leef' als een page-turner van formaat. Geyls vaak stuitende en onkritische zelfpromotie heeft echter het effect dat zijn meningen en oordelen over gewichtere zaken iets ongeloofwaardigs krijgen. Wat was nou precies zijn belang voor de Groot-Nederlandse beweging? Hoe zuiver op de graat was hij in de affaire-Colenbrander? Hoe waardevol is zijn historisch werk nu eigenlijk? Bijna elke pagina maakt nieuwsgierig naar, om met Ranke te spreken 'Wie es wirklich gewesen (ist).' \\""},{"Title":"Light at the end of the tunnel ;: A study of the Teton Sioux Indian of North America from the mid nineteenth century to modern times","review":"Joe says \`How' to author with a similar viewSydney author Andrew Hogarth got a shock when trying to sell his book \\"Light at the end of the tunnel,\\" to a Double Bay bookshop.

'Phenomenal' is not a word I'd use to describe this. Sure, it sucked me in, but go try China Mieville or Chris Moore if you want some really good writing. 'Realistic' also surprised me--maybe try Jack Whyte or even Harry Harrison's Hammer and Cross series for more realistic historical fiction.If you've read Patterson's Alex Cross books, the writing style here is similar but different enough that it's not just a Cross novel set in the twelfth century. As with any collaboration, you don't know who wrote what, but seems that Andrew Gross contributed at least enough to the style to make it unlike the other Patterson stuff I've read. I'd have to say I like this a little better in terms of quality of writing.I might try another Patterson/Gross collaboration but I'll probably do what I did for this one--get it from the library.

I read THE JESTER on March 21, 2003 in one sitting, because I simply could not put it down.Reminiscent of Michael Crichton's TIMELINE, this novel is set in medieval times, and is flavored with anachronistic (but very believable) dialogue. Hugh is a wonderful character, who incites both sympathy and admiration, and the novel's villains give a whole new meaning to the word \\"monsters\\"--particularly the so-called noblemen, who seemed to harbor not a shred of humanity.Readers who enjoy a thrilling roller-coaster ride, complete with vivid imagery, heart-pounding plot twists, and semi-historical storytelling, will LOVE this book!

Hugh ends up leading a rag tag group of bondsman into a battle against their corrupt liege.I've recently gotten into the habit of reading book reviews about halfway through a book. So I check out B&amp;N.com to read both the professional reviews and those of lay readers. This book was not well liked. The reviews ranged from &quot;It sucked to &quot;it really sucked.&quot; For the most part people did not like this book.They had good reason. The book was not a good book. It's plot was predictable, it was filled with many glaring inaccuracies, and it's characters were not well developed. For example, during one scene Hugh lamented the possible loss off his best friend Odo during the siege of a nobleman's castle. While I felt for the potential loss of his friend, my main thought was, Who the hell is Odo? and why should I care more about him the hundreds of other laying dead?Now here is the crux of my problem. Yes, this was not a good book, yet I still enjoyed it. It was a fast paced, light, enjoyable tale that kept my interest the whole way through. Maybe it's just because I have been reading heavier books lately. Patterson has a simple style that is highly accessible.

After reading many of the reviews of this book, it is apparent that many Patterson fans want him to stay in the crime/suspense/mystery genre. It is also apparent that many have no desire for 'history-based' fiction. Consequently, I fear my review will be quite unpopular as I thought THE JESTER was an outstanding effort by Patterson. However, I must admit that I'm something of a Crusade/Arthurian junkie.Present Day...Dr. Alberto Mazzini, Director of the Vatican Museum is urgently called to the Musee d'Histoire in Boree', France. Renee Lacaze, Director of the Boree' Museum, has summoned Dr. Mazzini to analyze a relic, ostensibly a holy relic from the time of Christ. Ms. Lacaze informs Mazzini that the artifact was unearthed during the excavation for a shopping center when the excavation machinery opened a sarcophagus. Lacaze goes on to say that the grave belonged to a long-forgotten duke who died in 1098. This duke fought in the Crusades and was known to seek out relics from the time of Christ.Lacaze said, \\"The local lore, it always said a precious relic was here. Just never that it belonged to a duke. But to a man of far more humble origins.\\"\\"What sort of lowborn man would come into such a prize? A priest? Perhaps a thief?\\"\\"No.\\" Renee Lacaze's brown eyes widened. \\"Actually, a jester.\\"Southern France, 1096...The authors introduce you to their hero, innkeeper Hugh de Luc. He and his wife Sophie own and operate the inn in Veille du Pere, a small French village. This, during a time when land is only owned by nobles and the \\"lowborns\\" work the land and pay their masters the assessed taxes. Veille du Pere is under the power of a ruthless and cowardly noble, Baldwin, the Duke of Treille.Fervently desiring to be free, Hugh joins a thrown-together army to fight in the Crusades. Almost two years later, Hugh returns to his village to find that all the homes have burned and the village plundered by Baldwin's knights. It was said they were in search of a precious relic dating back to the Crucifixion and was in the possession of Hugh de Luc. Hugh also learns the knights kidnapped Sophie and murdered their one-year old son, a son he didn't even know he had.Disillusioned and fierily resolute, Hugh sets out to find Sophie and exact revenge on those responsible, an undertaking making him appear quite mad. During his search, Hugh takes on the \\"pretext\\" of a jester in an effort to infiltrate Baldwin's castle, where he is certain Sophie is held captive. During the ensuing weeks, Hugh becomes known throughout France, and NOT as a Jester.As I mentioned, this is an era I thoroughly enjoy and find fascinating. There are so many magical moments, characters and events. It is also one of the most Barbaric times in our world's history (in the same fashion as Braveheart). Patterson, and co-author Gross, manage to make this story magical. While most of the events and characters are based in fiction, the storyline manages to engross the history buff in me albeit one taking each sentence with a grain of salt. However, the research performed by Patterson/Gross was fairly prodigious as evidenced by the historical references provided.Bottom line, this is an enjoyable, well-written book. Sure, it is not historically accurate but then again, it is a work of fiction. I applaud Mr. Patterson for taking the risk of moving into unfamiliar territory and challenging himself and his readership. It is my hope we will see more of this type of work although I have no interest in losing the \\"Cross\\" novels for historical fiction.A great read. Open your mind and you'll enjoy this offering."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I believe that the mark of a truly great storyteller is one who can captivate and enthrall outside of his \\"genre;\\" and James Patterson has done that and more in The Jester.Set in medieval times during the Crusades, this is the story of a poor innkeeper named Hugh De Luc--whose life consists of simple pleasures...his village, his friends, his inn, and the great love that he has for his wife Sophie. All is well until Hugh decides to join the fight for Christianity and freedom--and finds only death, carnage and evil. He returns to his village several years later to discover that everything that he held dear had been stripped away from him; his inn burned to the ground, and his beloved Sophie abducted by the evil knights of his liege.This is truly an epic love story--of love lost, found, and lost again; only to be rediscovered in another. All I could think of while reading this story was what a wonderful movie it could make if done right!I've yet to read a book by this author that I did not enjoy. True Patterson fans will not be disappointed!!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Wonderful reading! In 1096, French innkeeper Hugh de Luc joins the Crusades in an effort to obtain his freedom from his nasty overlord Lord Baldwin. However, he finds the war not to be anything like he expected as he witnesses atrocities on both sides as they crazily trek for seemingly endless miles towards Jerusalem with no end in sight. Unable to cope, Hugh deserts.... He returns home with some treasures he took from the Holy Land only to learn that Baldwin abducted his beloved wife and murdered his son. Wanting to liberate his spouse and avenge his child's murder, Hugh masquerades as a JESTER to gain entrance into his enemy's castle. However, he meets a noblewoman, who he begins to love, which sidetracks Hugh from his quest. Meanwhile his foe seeks him out based on a rumor that Hugh brought back the holiest of relics. As his village is ravaged by Baldwin's thugs who search for him, Hugh starts a counterrevolution to destroy the noble or die trying....The JESTER is entertaining very colorful historical fiction that vividly brings to life the late eleventh century. The last books from Amazon that excited my interest were, 'Unconventional Flying Objects' by Paul Hill, 'Alien Rapture' by Brad Steiger, and 'Alien Agenda' by Jim Marrs. I highly recommend all these books and you should read the reviews.. I can't recommend them enough. Everybody I have lent them to loved them."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"If you picked up this book thinking you were going to get an engrossing mystery, you didn't read the front cover. This \\"historical novel\\" from Patterson was just what I expected. Brutally graphic, a plausible plot, characters that you want to remember, and a great way to spend a few hours of escape from current events. Patterson has a way with keeping the reader involved. While I will agree with another reviewer that the chapters were sometimes too short to maintain a good pace, it didn't keep me from being entertained. The desciptions of the difficulties facing the average person in that time period were perfect for this read. If you want to spend all your time with Alex Cross or the girls in the Murder Club, so be it. But if you want to take a welcome respite from the usual serial murderer that tends to permeate a Patterson novel, then pick this book up. You may just learn something about history while enjoying a good story."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I've read hundreds of historical novels and this has to be the worst. The book is set during the First Crusade - about 1100 A.D. - but contains dialogue such as &quot;Bug off&quot; and &quot;I guess I have you to thank for these duds [clothes].&quot; The period detail is thin, though not as thin as the characterization. Truly awful."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Hugh De Luc is an adventurous man so it does not come as a surprise to his wife when he goes off to fight in the First Crusade.Hugh, discouraged from his experience in the Crusade, returns home to find villages torched, dozens of towns people slaughtered, his home ransacked and his wife missing all by knights in search of a precious relic.Refusing to believe his wife is dead, Hugh sets out to find her and the only way to do that is to infiltrate the castle where he believes her to be by pretending to be a jester.How do I describe \`The Jester'...well, let's start by saying it's unlike anything James Patterson has written before; it's a historical action/adventure. I will list the good parts first; the pacing of \`The Jester' is fast, the action scenes are exciting and filled with brutal violence, and as always in a Patterson novel the chapters are short and punchy. Now, the bad things; the short and punchy chapters get in the way of the story developing in certain parts, the fast pace makes the story feel rushed at times, there is romance that gets in the way and parts of the book are laughable when meant to be serious. All this mixed together makes for an unsatisfyting read, one that is very disappointing considering James Patterson's previous novels. Readers of this type of fiction might enjoy 'The Jester' for Mr. Patterson's easy to read style of writing, but fans of his previous novels should think long and hard before picking up this one.Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"After the disappointing FOUR BLIND MICE ,I was looking forward to wrapping my chops around this monster of a book. THE JESTER is an interesting and highly entertaining departure for Patterson, again collaborating with Andrew Gross (2ND CHANCE).Set in 14th century France, Hugh DeLuc is a peasant whose life is changed when he returns home to find his village razed to the ground, his newborn son sadistically murdered and his wife raped and kidnapped. He sets out on a quest to rescue his wife and exact his vengeance, but in order to do so he must infiltrate the enemy castle to find her. To do this Hugh poses as a jester (ironically after he saves his own skin by laughing at his enemies), but he soon finds himself falling in love with the tyrannical King's estranged wife.THE JESTER is a novel of epic proportions, intensively researched, masterfully written with Patterson's trademark short chapters and the period and characters practically come to life on the page. This is also Patterson's most violent and gruesome work to date, with some truly unsettling scenes; which include violent rapes and infants being burned alive so it is not recommended to those of a nervous disposition. Moralists will find a lot to rant about here, but Patterson and Gross are simply showing the period as it was, warts and all; so those of you expecting passages including Shakespearian love sonnets sould steer clear. For others THE JESTER should be on your list of must read books for 2003."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Having read this book, whenever anyone describes something as being written &quot;like a bad novel&quot;, you will now understand exactly what the expression means.Had I not known the name of the author, I would have thought this to be the work of a singularly ungifted amateur - possibly in their late teens; if I had to read one more time how something had &quot;lanced&quot;, &quot;stabbed&quot; or &quot;flashed&quot; through the main protagonist's body or mind, I think I would throw up.The practice of hack writers hiding behind the huge letters of the name of an established author on the cover (Tom Clancy, you have a lot to answer for) may bring in money for the aforementioned author, but it sullies his reputation as surely as if he had written it all himself, instead of just suggesting the outline premise and laughing all the way to the bank. What a shame that his fans are crying all the way to the trash can.Badly done, Mr. Patterson."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Pulp romance with beautiful maidens??...an outlaw in the forest whose name is \\"Shorty\\"?? This is the Crusades?? Wait, there's more...one jester to another before a gig, \\"You'll knock em' dead, lad.\\" (Really, on page 183). I threw in the towel on page 296. Two-thirds of the way through and I could not go on.Save your money on this one. There are too many good books out there to waste the time to read a bad one. If you're looking for really good fiction about the Crusades, check out Zoe Oldenbourgh...I read her fiction twenty years ago and remember it still. I won't remember James Patterson past bedtime!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Patterson and co-author Gross have certainly crafted an unexpected offering, set literally 1000 years before Alex Cross, Lindsay Boxer, and the gang come along. A French innkeeper, and our leading man, Hugh de Luc, leaves his wife Sophie and his hometown to seek ultimate freedom from his life of servitude. He joins the Crusades in 1096; then we wade through many chapters of violence and gore as men on both sides of the argument die brutal deaths. Using laughter to save his life, and precursoring his role as a Jester (hence the title) through much of the book, Hugh returns home (actually as a deserter) only to discover his wife was abducted by the evil duke. He sets out for revenge and eventually assimilates into the staff of the evil lord. He is helped along by a noblewoman named Emilie, itself an unlikely scenario, only to stir feelings in both akin to his love for his own wife. This lack of fidelity (although not consummated until after his wife's ultimate death) seemed incongruous with the undying love expressed throughout the first half of the book -- yet these feelings rapidly transfer right onto Emilie with little further provocation.Before it's over, Hugh \\"the fool\\" leads a ragtag band of farmers and other common folk to overthrow not one but two fiefdoms, with such total success that he becomes the darling of the people and starts a movement toward the abandonment of the serf system.What's tough to accept out of all this is the odds against which this lowly guy survives and flourishes, his role in finding a cherished religious relic, the love affair with the noblewoman, his success against organized armies (and other evils), etc. While Patterson's usual story-telling abilities are in full evidence, the early-on gore and the relatively unbelievable premises we are asked to swallow, one after another, make for a quick but only mildly entertaining read. While we applaud the author's departure from the norm, we need about half of the unbelievable wrinkles removed to give this book a facelift worthy of a more serious look."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book. I've read most of Patterson's novels and this has to be my least favorite. It was completely predictable. There were two reasons I finished the book. One was to find out if my guesses were right, and they were. I was very dissappointed. The other reason was just plain curiosity. I wanted to find out how it ended.Also, I can understand being historically accurate with life during the Middle Ages. However, I had a hard time reading about children being killed and raped. Some parts are even worse. (Did we really need to know what happened to Hugh's son?) If you have kids of your own, be warned this isn't an easy read."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"The basics of the story is interesting enough, but the authors did not do a good enough job of conveying the feel of the period, whether in social/physical details or in conversations. Perhaps this book is an example of research-lite."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"While I thought I might be interested in a novel told during the time of the Crusades (I love period fiction), this one just seemed to get annoying. OK, Hugh is a wonderful person, looking for his wife. On a mission. He just caused the death of too many people...people I didn't even have a feel for. Maybe that was the plan! The only thing that held my interest was the Jester's tricks and jokes he played on the high commander. Those insults caused a slight chortle!After reading historical fiction like \\"The Dress Lodger\\" and\\"The Pink and the White\\", this just seemed a lame attempt at trying to tell a story with any credence. Patterson, stick to what you do best. FBI serial killer fiction. This was boring!Passed it on to a friend with a disclaimer!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"The Jester is a fast-moving adventure tale, undemanding but enjoyable, feeling more like a Robin Hood or medieval Indiana Jones movie than a serious historical novel. While it lacks any unambiguously fantastic elements, it's a pure good-versus-evil yarn of a literate and canny peasant who prevails by using his wits, charisma, acting talent, and street-fighter's combat tactics. There's even a hint of Nazgul or Sith Lord in the novel's black-clad Tafurs, especially in the battle between Hugh and Black Cross. Hugh, Emilie and the other good characters are so likeable, and the villains so self-righteous and cruel, that it's hard not to cheer as Hugh's search for his wife eventually turns into a full-scale peasant uprising with him at the head.Hugh's narrative is told in thoroughly modern language (\\"Damn, you're good.\\" \\"Professional courtesy.\\" \\"Knock 'em dead.\\" \\"scorched his own earth\\"), with occasional bursts of humour, and in chapters so short that the it feels as though the authors had attention deficit disorder. The plot is rather predictable, though not without some diverting twists and surprises on the way. The historical setting, though interesting, is mostly used as a backdrop rather than a real part of the story: while some of the characters are motivated by religious fanaticism, most seem very modern in their attitudes. Hugh himself is particularly cynical (even about himself), with scarcely a trace of superstition.If you want an authentic and entertaining history of the Crusades, watch the Terry Jones video. If you just want a fast-paced action-packed tale of an ordinary man taking a stand against zealots and tyrants, this is worth your time."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"did it seem to you that this book was very much like Ken Folletts , &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot;? Of course by far a simplified version. How about the wife situation? Lose one to tragedy but find another quickly. Did'nt that happen in both books? Ken Follett did a much better in depth story about that period of time. In fact I am surprised that Follett's is not a classic. The Jester was not one of Patterson's best."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This is my first Patterson book, and likely my last. The characters are standard stereotypes (boorish and overbearing nobles, saintly peasants). The plot is numbingly predictable. Rape, pillage and murder ensue whenever the author needs to move the story along, usually providing a reason for our hero to do some soul searching.The central character takes off on Crusade to gain freedom for himself and his wife - less than a week after another family is destroyed because their son went on Crusade (rape, pillage, murder). He becomes disillusioned by the cause (too much rape, pillage, murder). He decides to return home. Huh? His main reason for going on Crusade was the guarantee of being freed from vassalage, not religious fervor. But, you're not supposed to remember that. After an arduous journey, he arrives in his village to find that *gasp* the wife he left behind has suffered a cruel and horrible fate at the hands of masked riders (rape, pillage, murder of infant, arson). Our hero knows in his heart that these masked men are none other than the scoundrels who roughed up the other villagers - and sets off in pursuit. I gave up in disgust at this point.Patterson is supposed to be a good writer. Perhaps this was his one off book. I suggest reading one of his other books."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This book came highly recommeded by a freind. And boy does her taste in books suck. This story is so unbelievable. Don't waste your time. I wish I could get back that week of my life I spent reading this."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I like historical fiction and had at least moderate expectations that this would be an enjoyable story, given Patterson's acclaim. Well, I should have gone to the bookstore and browsed this drippy yarn before purchasing it online. Cardboard cutouts would have more depth than the characters in this story. As for the setting and time period, 10 minutes of internet browsing would give you what this novel offers. The authors have a nerve to suggest they relied on historical research...If Hollywood makes a movie out of this, then plot, character, and scene development need little additional work with this novel in hand. My recommendation? Save the ~$8 and get yourself or a friend a latte or something."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This is the first book by James Patterson that I've read. I like historical fiction but this book was so poorly written it was almost unbearable to read. It was especially disappointing because it was recommended by Book of the Month Club which is generally reliable. Don't waste your time with this book!!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This book is a strange blend of the quintessial James Patterson in format and pace with an entirely new type of story for him (as was the moving and enjoyable SUZANNE'S DIARY FOR NICHOLAS). This is an historical novel based in medieval times, with the Crusades and French serfdom as the backdrop. It appears to accurately capture the nature of the times, with townspeople barely scratching out an existence while dependent for protection on the whims of the local nobles and their knights.The central character is Hugh De Luc, an innkeeper in a small French village who leaves his wife Sophie to join the First Crusade to fight the infidels and free Jerusalem. The first section of the book graphically describes the hardships which he and his companions endured during their journey, and his lifechanging experience in Antioch which convinced him to end his journey and return home. Upon his eventual return he finds his village plundered and destroyed, the infant son previously unknown to him murdered and his wife kidnapped and believed dead. The remainder of the book involves Hugh's attempts to locate his wife (he believes that she is still alive) and mete out vengenance on those who are responsible for his son's death.While near death after an encounter with a wild boar, Hugh is befriended by Emilie and her mistress Anne from neighboring Boree, which Anne rules while her husband Stephen is away fighting in the Crusade. Hugh attempts to develop a strategy for infiltrating neighboring Treille, a walled city ruled by the evil Baldwin, who is apparently responsible for Sophie's kidnapping. Emilie has the idea that Hugh can use his intelligence and natural talent for comedy to pose as a JESTER, and thus disguised Hugh resumes his search for Sophie. As you might assume since this is a James Patterson book, at this point the plot complications and misdirection begin. Hugh soon discovers that in fact one of the souvenirs that he brought home to France is perceived to be of great historical value and the prize sought by the Black Knights still wrecking havoc on the countryside and its inhabitants in their search for it. The latter parts of the book turn out to be not only an historical action/adventure but a philosophical examination of the role of individual freedom and private property that eventually transformed the nature of arrangements between nobles and the monarchy and their subjects and led to the adoption of the rule of law versus the rule of force. Hugh assembles an army of his friends and neighbors to first confront Baldwin of Treille and later Stephen of Boree (upon his return from the Crusade), and combines his insights with the knowledge and skills that he learned during the battles in which he participated to overcome superior odds and eventually prevail. Yet the style of Patterson and his co-author Andrew Gross keep the pace very rapid and the story interesting and fast moving.There is an incredible amount of bloodshed, violence, vulgarity, and gore. These are obviously typical of the period and true to the experience of the Crusades, although much of the dialog seems much more attuned to our current patterns of speech than to the Middle Ages. The difference between the violence in this and some of Patterson's especially gory books is that it seemed essential to the plot and not carried to mindnumbing and gratuitous extremes. There is also the usual misdirection, although more obvious clues in some cases (such as Emilie's identity) than is usual for a Patterson story. In summary, Patterson's style and the short chapters and rapid pace of action actually hide the much more ambitious effort that this book represents. As an affirmation of the power of love and laughter, its overriding tone despite the violence is quite different from many of his other stories. And the fairy tale ending is very different from his usual conclusion, perhaps to offset this essentially accurate portrayal of the depressing nature of the history of the that time.So, if you are a James Patterson fan, be prepared for something very different but just as engaging as his best work. And I certainly agree with the comments of other reviewers that this appears to be a prime candidate for an epic movie, I just hope that they manage to make it more that an historical adventure, as the authors have done. It is a fast paced easy read, but somewhat longer and with a lot more to think about and enjoy than most of his books. So, if you want a detective story, look elsewhere; and if you want a serious historical novel with carefully drawn characters and slow paced action examining the time in great detail, you will also certainly be disappointed. But if you want a story to read on the train or plane, during a vacation, or while relaxing before bed, this is well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I am a big James Patterson fan and I knew this book was going to be something different, but I never expected it to be so unreadable.

The Jester was a pulp Western done up in Medieval armor written by someone who had neither a sense of time nor place of the late 11th century and a total lack of knowledge of the mores and social sensibilities of the period. He used every cliche possible in this sub-standard revenge, hidden identity, good guy-bad guy, star-crossed lover pot boiler.

The cover says something about a James Patterson, and his cohort Andrew Gross, but the diction is not much better than a 7th grader. I'll make the assumption that this is a junior-high school prank; sending in a story and getting published under another person's name. I hope Mr. Patterson isn't too offended.I had heard that this story was very well researched. Well, I guess if you Google \\"crusades\\" and skip past some embarrassing things said by president bush, you'll get a plethora of information you can use in a book. Like how people in the 11th century would say things like \\"sonofabitch\\", \\"sharpened to a tee\\", and \\"whaddaya do\\". I never knew they talked like that, but it is this realistic sense the author uses that allows the reader to suspend disbelief (even as it approaches the weight of a piano). But hey, I don't begrudge the kid. He writes fairly well for a 7th grader. Very well skilled for his vocabulary level, though I think he lacks talent for any sort of plot, character development or storytelling in general. But I hope he keeps trying.The only thing that really upsets me about this book is that I paid $4.99 for it out of a bargain bin. Sorry, but that would have been better spent on a Latte, and maybe some change left over for the parking meter. Alas, more's the pity.This will make a nice B-movie someday. I think it'll be one of those films that turns out better than the movie (by far) (very, very far). Even if it stars \\"Carrot Top\\" as our intrepid innkeeper. Hey, especially \\"Carrot Top\\"!

I only finished 100 pages and finally gave up. The writing was flat, the story was dull, the characters were uninteresting. Perhaps it would get better in the end, but I did not care to find out."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"The first time I heard the expression \\"gettin' medieval\\" was in the film Pulp Fiction. It's not a good thing; suffice to say it is not about chivalry, honor in combat or respect for a fallen foe. No, those were nasty times, those Middle Ages, the 13th and 14th centuries. It's a wonder that, between wars and the Black Plague, the species survived. However, our concept of real property and some of our ideas and practices of democracy arose from this era, so it certainly wasn't all bad. And literature! What a fertile field for stories lies therein. About the last thing one would expect, however, is for James Patterson to write a novel set during that era. That is exactly though what THE JESTER is.THE JESTER is another collaboration between Patterson and Andrew Gross. Gross quite ably contributed to 2nd CHANCE and again demonstrates in THE JESTER his shared ability with Patterson to keep things moving and interesting. The aim here is elementary in the idea, but difficult in the execution: keep the reader interested and keep the pages turning. Patterson and Gross succeed on both counts.The jester is Hugh De Luc, an innkeeper who the comedian Jackie Vernon would have described as \\"poor but poverty stricken;\\" in a moment of bad judgment, he joins the First Crusade. Sick at heart and disillusioned over what he experiences and witnesses, he returns to his village to find it laid to waste, his inn destroyed, his infant son --- whom he never knew --- murdered and his beloved wife, Sophie, abducted. The instigator of this carnage is a ruthless Duke who believes that De Luc is in possession of a priceless religious relic. De Luc, seeking revenge, disguises himself as a jester in order to infiltrate the duke's court, where he believes his wife is being held. He is aided in his quest by an enigmatic young woman named Emilie, who has more to risk by assisting De Luc than he can imagine. But that is not the only surprise that awaits De Luc. He soon finds that his quest for rescue and revenge will take him to places far beyond any he could have anticipated.THE JESTER will appeal not only to Patterson's regular readers, but also to those who, when the dust settles and the smoke clears, simply enjoy a good story. There is also, among the graphic descriptions of violence contained in THE JESTER, a real tale of romance here. Patterson again demonstrates that he is capable of doing anything --- and doing it quite well. And Gross's contribution to this process cannot be ignored. Further collaborations between these gentlemen will be most welcomed.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I am a great Patterson fan. As soon as he latest book is published I buy it. So The Jester is now sitting on my night table.It is a very different James Patterson book. Set in the 11th Century in France. I am a history buff so I find the book interesting. I must agree with the other readers in that the Patterson short chapters leaves something to be desired in this type of historical novel.It is not a fast paced read. If you are looking for Alec Cross in a Knights Suit this book is not for you."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"What a trip! Film and television actor Cary Elwes gives vibrant, exciting reading to this period thriller. Both Patterson and Gross have outdone themselves in creating an epic rife with danger, intrigue, and garnished with authentic details of medieval life.It is the 11th century when we meet Hugh De Luc, a poor innkeeper who, growing weary of oppression by the nobles, has joined the Crusades in a bid for freedom. Carnage, blood, and battle are little compared to what he finds when he returns from Jerusalem to his native French village. His son has been slaughtered, and his adored wife, Sophie, taken captive by a base villain in search of a relic from the Crucifixion.Assuming the role of a jester Hugh makes his way to the castle and court where he believes Sophie is held. If there is such a thing as the epitome of evil, it is found in those Hugh meets at the castle.Unknowingly, Hugh becomes embroiled in a series of events that not only alter his life but may even threaten the lives of the townspeople in his village.\\"The Jester\\" is a departure for Patterson who has repeatedly scored with a string of contemporary thrillers. His fans will relish it while first time readers clamor for more such adventures from this prolific author."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Though I do love mystery novels, I've never taken the mainstream route and given James Patterson a try. Now I understand why he is so popular. What makes this book special is the blend of nice historical setting with a smoothly compelling, easy reading style.The Crusades do not generally make for light reading. Our modern sensibilities grate at the medieval attitude toward infidels, and the practice of sending unskilled, barely armed innocents to be slaughtered far from home.Patterson's zippy style lightens 11th Century France to such a level that any fiction fan can enjoy this book. It felt like watching the movie \\"Speed\\"-momentum kept me turning pages, though I guessed at large chunks of the plot well ahead of their appearances.The hero, Hugh, is a thoroughly modern man struggling against medieval law and custom. He balks at the epidemic injustice inflicted upon peasants owned by noble lords, and first absents himself to the Crusades in an attempt at freedom.Of course, history reveals that the Good Lord did not smoothe the way for European Crusaders. Hugh's ugly experiences in the Holy Land only turn him back home to the loving wife he left behind. The horrors of war chafe even more than the bonds of serfdom.Back home, the nobles have been up to their usual evil ways, and Hugh finds his town and family ruined. Like Michael Douglas in \\"Falling Down\\", he's had all he can take and the rules of life no longer seem to apply. Hugh sets out in a borderline berzerker state to avenge his family, and, symbolically, all indentured people like him. A helpful noblewoman is the one to suggest that a fool-the jester of the title-might be an excellent pretext for infiltrating high society to gain access to those to whom Hugh's sworn revenge.The story runs quickly and is compelling. While not a complex historical to rival Clavell's \\"Shogun\\" or Iain Pears' \\"An Instance of the Fingerpost\\", a serious reader of historicals might find this a perfect beach or airplane book. There are no glaring or offensive historical inaccuracies to insult the sophisticated reader, though that delightful sense of being completely absorbed into another time is also somewhat less.I'm left with only one real complaint. The book opens in modern-day France, where an archaeological find has just been discovered in the grave of a jester. Though an excellent opener, the book never comes back to our time at the end, nor does it make any other use of the information from those first few pages. It feels like a clever hook was used to get us into the story, but the authors never bothered to tie it thoroughly in.As a devoted historical fiction fan, I jumped at the opportunity to read a pre-release copy of \\"The Jester\\" by James Patterson. I work in a bookstore, and being able to comment on Patterson's latest will be a great benefit to my customers. I do not regret the experience, and I would happily spend more time in future with some of Patterson's other work."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I disliked it so much I am actually taking the time to write my first book review on Amazon. Apparently Mr. Paterson and Co. used my 1976 World Book Encyclopedia in preparing this piece of ......historical fiction. The research, if any, could have consisted of no more than looking up \\"Middle Ages\\" and reading the two page World Book explanation. Lovers of historical fiction run and hide, blatant misuse of historical events, military terms, regional dialect, names etc etc. Even if you have absolutely no knowledge of history, the story is so far fetched it borders on the absurd. For the simple minded only, it would make a great blockbuster movie. I wish there was an option to give it no stars."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Someone is using James Patterson's identity: either that or he's been channeling a 12 year-old girl.The early Alex Cross novels like \\"Kiss the Girls\\" and \\"Along Came a Spider\\" were rather pedestrian thrillers, but at least they had enough plot and characterization to keep you involved. Since then, his writing seems to be dumbing-down at an alarming rate. Patterson has always been lazy enough to use exclamation points and italics, rather than sharp prose, to convey tension: but in \\"The Jester\\" it's gone right over into annoying. Each conflict is delivered with such OhMiGod! breathlessness that I thought I had burst in on 7th grade girls IM session. Example: \\"He thought &lt;something> might happen! And it did!\\" How many times can you read that?Speaking of which, who is going to read this? It's too simplistic to be a thriller; too poorly researched to be \\"The DaVinci Code\\"; and too gratuitously bloody to be a romance novel. When I say simplistic, I mean that improbable situations and implausible escapes pile up like a Saturday morning cartoon. Plot developments are not merely telegraphed, they're headlined in 24 point bold. Background is wedged in so jarringly that you can almost hear the editor saying \\"You must establish this fact for later!\\" This is the kind of story where you want to reach into the page, grab the wooden staff Hugh carries, thump him with it and say: \\"Wake up! We all figured this out 200 pages ago!\\"Read this if you will, but don't buy it - or you'll be wearing the Fool's hat."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"An atrocious piece of work that should have never been published, I keep wondering if I can get my money back! Its a shame that a good author(s) had to steal from other books to write a novel. The biggest victim being \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" by Ken Follett from which the red haired jongleur, noble women falls for a commoner comes. Then you have the \\"Robin Hood\\" story from which comes the niece of the king, crusades, bad sheriff, and bad knight's part. Then believe it or not, \\"Brave heart\\" from which the popular revolt instigated by a peace loving commoner who speaks Latin and organizes the masses to avenge his slain wife come from. And finally American sitcoms for phrases that are so out of place and imaginary scenes among other goodies. Both authors should be ashamed of themselves. Too bad the system does not allow for a 0 star rating."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Avoid this like the plague unless you have a VERY high tolerance for anachronisms. They fill this novel to such a point that I wanted to throw it across the room. I like playfulness and satire, but I wouldn't characterize this as either. A waste of money and time."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"How some of the other reviewers say they could abandon the book midway through is beyond me. Sure some of the jokes in the book are old, but hey they were new back then so what would you expect?If you like reading of Mid-evil times or just want a fun read pick up this book and enjoy it for what it is.The only thing I didn't like about the book was the prize drawing insert with the grand prize being a trip to France. Ummm sorry but I think a trip to Iraq sounds better."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I love historical books but this was !like reading Danielle Steele, very trite."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Didn't The Danny Kaye Movie &quot; The Court Jester&quot;have a similar story line."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I picked up this story hoping for historical fiction, that is, insight into another era using a storyline as a tool to stir interest.What I found was --- blah. Predictable storyline, no character development, an egocentric \\"hero,\\" 7th grade bathroom humor lacking any subtlety, and no more insight into history than one gathers as general knowledge through movies.Where is the author that can write a true historical fiction on the middle ages, with the same depth and insight as found with Pearl S Buck and China? Please tell me!However, if you're looking for a lot of brutal violence, template romance and tiresome \\"sex\\" jokes, and only care to spend 2 minutes per chapter, here is your book!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I loved this book, a great entertaining, page-turner book.I've come to the conclusion that many people who write reviews either don't read the books or have undergone a lobotomy.It's amazing, really.Comments like \\"predictable...\\" Predictable! Did you seriously read the WHOLE book? Did you come to the ending of the book? How can you, in your wildest dreams, say that's predictable?

However, I do read his books because he sure knows how to tell a story. This time, The Jester, really beat my expectations ~~ it is a fun story and who cares if the story is not historically accurate? It's fun and keeps you guessing throughout the whole book. It is a page-turner and you find yourself rooting for Hugh and the other serfs in this book ~~ you'd find yourself guessing the answers before it comes about ~~ and sometimes you're right, and sometimes Patterson gives you a surprise.If you are looking for a more accurate historical fiction book ~~ then don't get this one. If you are looking for a good read with a good plot and suspense ~~ get it. Patterson may not be the best writer ~~ but he sure can tell a good story. Also, you can tell that it's Gross that wrote the book with Patterson telling the story because it's written neater and crisper than other Patterson books. I am a snob when it comes to my reading tastes, but this book sure is fun!4-14-03"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"As an historical novel, this is a deplorable attempt. As an entertainment, it's so fake, falsely cheery, and insincere that it's barely readable. What in heaven's name has happened to James Patterson lately, anyway? His \\"letter\\" novels have been not bad but not nearly as good as the Alex Delaware ones, and now this??!!?"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"When I buy a Patterson book, I expect to read a Patterson book.In the beginning and page after page, I waited for and expected the REAL story to start. No such luck. Instead, I got a cross between Danielle Steele and Tolkein.I hope my pal Patterson isn't losing it. Four Blind Mice was bad too."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This is a great story.Patterson doesn't sugar coat the Dark Ages, which is the setting for this entrancing story which sounds as though it could have been lifted from the newspapers of the era -- had newspapers existed then.It's not a book for the squeamish. He writes of the rapacious terror the Crusaders brought to the Holy Land in their attacks on the Islamic world; if anyone wonders \\"Why don't they like us?\\" -- this book offers a compelling answer. Some of his characters may seem unreal, but from what I've read of the Dark Ages the general setting Patterson uses is totally authentic. It was an era when wild animals roamed at will, when during the winter wolves preyed on people even in cities such as Paris; and when such animals offered kind mercy compared to the cruelty of people to each other.Patterson makes life sound brutal, grim and often capricious. He paints a chilling picture of the total madness of Christian fanaticism inspired by fictional artifacts such as \\"relics\\" said to have an association with Christ. If you've ever wondered about the madness that religion can inspire, this book is a gripping insight into the reality of our past.Okay, that's the dark, authentic, frightening side of Jester. But the book is much more, it is also an account of the nascent demands for personal freedom, dignity, and the rule of law that applies to everyone --- not merely to the nobility and clergy. Peasant uprisings were a fact of the era, and Patterson masterfully explains the motivations that led people in their search for freedom to challenge everything they had been told by the church and the nobility.\\"A man's allowed to dream every once in a while,\\" an older and wiser jester tells Hugh De Luc, the main character who also becomes a jester. Patterson is masterful in using a jester as his central character; in an era of rigid social structures, this (and the mistresses of a King) were about the only people with fluid social mobility.It's a masterful story of men, and equally courageous women, plus the people they inspire, making dreams of freedom come true. I wouldn't be surprised if Patterson or his researchers used an actual incident, then wove his story around historic fact.If it sounds like the same spirit that inspired the American Revolution in 1775, it's because Patterson taps into feelings that are very basic and real in all Americans. Maybe, some day, he'll do an equally inspired book about the motives that made American farmers challenge the world's mightiest empire in a bold assertion of their own freedom.It's a basic conflict involving, in Patterson's own words, \\"what we know as the law\\" and \\"the courage to stand up ...\\" Or, to quote Augustine who said, \\"Remove justice, and what are kingdoms but gangs of criminals on a large scale.\\" If this book sounds authentically medieval, and realistically modern, it's because Patterson skillfully explores basic issues that apply today as they did a thousand years ago.My only quibble is his ending. Although Patterson tells a superb story, he doesn't seem to know how to create a reasonable ending. It's always some \\"deus ex machina,\\" which in this case is totally unnecessary. In this case, it doesn't really spoil the book -- it's like meeting a sand flea on an otherwise perfect day on the beach.But, it's not a book for the squeamish. He doesn't overdo the blood and gore, or the brutal cruelty that was so often commonplace and routine at the time of the Crusadses; but, it will upset the tender feelings of sensitive souls. He is brutal, honest, frank and realistic -- without any of the familiar movie-screen excess.So much the better. It's a slice of authentic Dark Ages life. As an added bonus, he adds a list of 15 historical books for anyone interested in further doses of reality. Like Louis L'Amour in The Walking Drum, Patterson has written a first-rate introduction to our past."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Versatility is no longer a prized quality in writers ;maybe it is the demands of marketeers or a public desire for predictability but it is now by no means common for writers to move dexterously between genres in the way such emimnent storytellers as Conan Doyle and Gore Vidal were wont to doThus I should imagine several eyebrows were raised when the name of James Patterson was attached to this historical novel set in 11th century France immediately after the failure of the Crusade lead by Peter the Hermit .The tale is narrated by Hugh DeLuc ,the eponymous jester .He goes on the Crusade and on his return finds his wife abducted ,the son he never saw dead and his community ransacked and pillaged .These depradataions are the work of his liege lord ,Baldwin and Hugh vows revenge and to liberate his wife from Baldwin' s castle .He is helped in his task by a young and sympathetic noblewoman ,Emilie ,This is not the only plot strand however and the book also deals with the depradations of the Black Cross organisation which is raiding and pillaging the countryside -they are seeking a precious religious artefact believed to have been brought from the Holy Land .The plot strains interweave when it is revealed that Hugh is the unwitting owner of the object being sought .Hugh organises a revolt of the local peasantry aganst Baldwin's tyrannical rule as they put lives and souls on the lineThe book is not short on action with scenes of pitched battles and single combat being plentiful and the usual characteristics of Patterson's books are present and correct-short ,punchy sentences and chapters ,plus a driving and propulsive narrative .My primary criticism of the book is that it makes little attempt to get under the skin of the period or to convey a real sense of \\" this is how it was way back then \\" and while the authors cite historical sources it is not clear to me where they have utilised themThe underlying theme of the power of religion to motivate acts of terror is still pertinent today and the book is never less than lively and entertaining .It is not a major piece of historical fiction but it is a lively read and will give readers a good time especially if they can ignore some wooden characters and flavourless dialogueGood escapism"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I am a tremendous fan of Patterson and have never been dissapointed in anyof his writings. This particuliar book was so different then any of his that I have ever read and it spoke to me that this man is very versatile in his writing. He captures your attention immediately in this book as well as all of the other novels he has written."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I was hestitant to read, didnt know if i was up for medieval times... but let me tell you this was probably one of thewonderful stories i have ever read... knights, maidens, castles, honour, religious relics, the crusades and most importantly a story of undying love... what a read! I actually cried at the end... i will bring you sunflowers every day of my life!Must read!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"The Jester is a good book. It's one of those books you pick up, read it, enjoy it, and then don't think about it a whole lot afterwards.I generally like historical fiction because I feel like I learn a little about the period being written about. It was nice reading a little blurb saying that James Patterson and Andrew Gross checked their work with a history professor. It lets me know that while the book is obviously fiction, it does portray the crusades, France, and the life of a serf accurately.However, the story telling is trite yet over the top. If I were to give a word to describe the text, dialogue, and scenes, I would say cinematic-which isn't necessarily a good thing. When you think cinematic, you think predictable. But, as I wrote above, it is entertaining-entertaining as the Mummy movies are entertaining.The Jester is about a man named Hugh. Hugh has a wife he loves dearly. They both run an inn in a little French town. The time is 1096 and people are being recruited for the Crusades. Hugh goes to fight so he can free him and his wife from servitude. During the battle for Carthage, Hugh has a life altering experience and deserts the army along with a staff he took from the dead hands of a priest.When he comes home, it is two years after he left for war. Upon his arrival, he learns his wife has been taken. Hugh then searches for her, fights, and finds unexpected-yet predictable-love in the arms of another woman.There is mystery and suspense in this story. There are also villains with no redeeming qualities. James Patterson definitely has trouble writing three dimensional characters.Do I recommend The Jester? Yes."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I found this book very enjoyable...

It was very fast-paced and gripping, just like his other series. I really enjoyed this."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"If you know the work of James Patterson, you know his style: short, telegraphic chapters, powerful and noble characters, direct plots. His mainstream work, the Alex Cross series, is like that. Patterson writes mostly police fiction - good police fiction at that - and when I found out he had written an historic fiction book, I became immediately interested.But there are some problems with this book. First of all, it seems to be a joint work. Books that are co-written by two authors always feel like some kind of sham - at least to me. Unless both authors are very well known, like Stephen King and Peter Straub, for example. \\"The jester\\" is not the case. Who is Andrew Gross? At a first glance, it seems like Patterson has only \\"lended\\" his name to improve sales. Well, maybe this is not the case, because I was able to identify at least some of Patterson's dry, direct writing style in the text.The biggest problem with \\"The jester\\" is not the plot, which is not original, but simple and appealing - Hugh, a deserter from the Cruzader Army, goes back to his native village to find his wife and newborn son murdered by the merciless landlord, and now Hugh wants revenge. The big problem about this book is that the setting is great, but misused. The characters speak like twenty century people. The story doesn't feel mediaeval. Never. It seems Patterson and Gross - or Gross and Patterson - thought of writing a Middle Ages book using only the background and peopling it with modern characters - and, except from the main character, Hugh, I don't remember the name of any other.That's \\"The jester\\": shallow, fast-paced, unauthentic. Yet, it's good entertainment. Go figure.Grade 6.0/10"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"For me this book was too much of a departure for James Patterson. It's not bad...but just not up to his usual standard. I found the whole idea of a jester battling against lords etc...just too silly and far fetched. Anyway all I will say is don't buy this if you like the serial killer/thriller stories that Patterson does so well."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"If you're looking for the typical genre of James Patterson bypass this book. However, if you're looking for something a little different that will take you to another time and place, this is the ticket.

The Jester takes a very different turn on Patterson novels as it is set in the days of knights and squires, the drawing of swords and crossbows, and the people are a God-fearing lot. This book is quite graphic and I found a lot of the killing of women and children a little disturbing, but a great book nonetheless. You follow Hugh De Luc through his journeys and battles to avenge the kidnapping of his wife and the horrible murder of his infant son. It's a great read (although it does take a little while to get into it)....took me about 150 pages into the book to start to really want to see how it ends."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I have read most of James Pattersons work and really enjoyed The Jester.

All this for a very famous artifact which seems to bring Hugh luck throughout the book. In the end I was not pleased with the disposition of this artifact, but I guess it suited the story. Not one of my Gross favorites, and it is he whose books I'm trying to read at the moment. It was a first book after all, even with a \\"brand\\" name co-author.

However, although it started out kind of slow, the last third of the book moved along quite well."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"The first events of this book move exceptionally swiftly. All within about 50 pages, our &#65533;hero&#65533; Hugh deLuc&#65533;s village has been attacked by a group of Knights, he trundles off to the crusades, becomes disillusioned by the horrific acts being carried out in the name of God, and returns, only to find his wife abducted by a group of marauding knights, to punish him for leaving for the crusades with a band who were not the local Duke&#65533;s men. These Knights, tunics daubed with black crosses, were also searching for something very valuable. A Holy Relic more valuable than anything else in the Kingdom&#65533;and they come to believe that Hugh might know where it is.So Hugh sets off to Tours - to infiltrate the castle where he believes his wife is being held, and rescue her - dressed only as a mere jester. However, that is still only the beginning of this sprawling historical adventure&#65533;You must hand it to the authors, this is undoubtedly a rip-roaring adventure story. The historical detail &#65533; whether correct or not I cannot say &#65533; certainly adds colour to an already ebullient tale, and the characters are a vibrant and entertaining bunch. The only one with any real depth at all, though, is Hugh, but that matters little as the story moves so fast that creating fully developed characters would likely be a wasted effort, because the reader wouldn&#65533;t have time to appreciate it anyway!In true Patterson style, this lightning-paced book is packed full of short chapters (there are 150 plus of them here, and roughly 100 more pages than most of his novels, which is good to see, as several of his recent books have been growing slimmer and slimmer&#65533;) and the pages flick by as if blown by the breeze. The quality of the prose is also getting better, closer to that of his first Cross novel, but I expect much of that is down to Gross.Patterson fans are likely to be very pleased with this. Even though it is almost instantly forgettable, it has all the action of his thrillers, plus its set in an interesting time period which the authors utilise well. Certainly, read it, if only for the wonderful escapism it provides."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Reviews here for The Jester have been either \\"loved it!\\" or \\"hated it!\\" Sad to say, I'm in the second camp. I have read a number of Patterson's Alex Cross books and always enjoyed them; at least they were decently written. Not so this dreck! I don't know who Andrew Gross is or what his relationship to Patterson may be, but he is definitely getting the better part of the deal.The Jester barely qualifies for the beach. Although it's presented as a historical novel, don't expect much. The main character is gone and back from the Holy Land by page 75. The writing waffles between stilted dialogue and anachronistic neologisms. Maybe twenty medieval references are sprinkled in (but inadequately explained), along with such Old French slang as \\"Whadaya mean?\\" and \\"c'mon.\\" I mean, c'mon!The book seems like juvenile fiction, except for the rather sizeable amount of profanity, sex, and gratuitous violence. I kept expecting an N.C. Wyeth illustration on the next page. Robin Hood with an R rating.Funny how something like Harry Potter is considered children's literature and we grownups get garbage like this."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"The mood and scene was often interrupted by none period dialouge and vugarities as this super healing hero zoomed from one adventure to another. This story would have faired better if it had been published as a comic book.It reminded me of Kevin Costner playing Robin Hood and sounding as if he was talking to some friends on 42St.The co-authurs should take a cue from, to name just two, Ellis Peters, Simon Hawke. When doing a period piece; stay there."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I had never read anything before by James Patterson...and based on this book, I never will again! Perhaps his contemporary novels don't grate on the nerves quite so jarringly? I had picked this book up because I'm interested in the Crusades era, and thought that this one sounded interesting from the description and the glowing reviews. What a disappointment. The story is set during the Crusades, but the characters act and speak in contemporary ways. The medieval setting is as shallow and unbelievable as a painted backdrop for a high school skit. The plot barrels along at breakneck speed, so I suppose if you want something quick and diverting to read on an airplane, this might be adequate. However, if you want a fascinating book that immerses you in medieval times with realistic characters...this isn't it."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I would like to be frank and honest, I really love Patterson. Not because of his writing, it because he knows how to capture the imagination. I think its great that Patterson went a different direct than his normal genre of writing. Among friends, when discussing Patterson novels, we have a saying of normal Patterson, which is mostly detective/suspense or weird Patterson, which is out of the norm for us. This book is out of the norm. I feel in this book that he's just a great storyteller. Even though, I feel that some of the slang and words used weren't authentic of the time era. I imagined someone sitting down in front of an audience telling a story through his owns words. The story beings with archaeologists finding a relic from the past and with this relic a historical fictional story unfolds. The time era was in 1096 with the main character Hugh de Luc feels he must fight for freedom of his people. He leaves his wife behind and his quest begins. Through out the book Hugh is faced with pain staking realizations and no matter what had happened he had a lot of passion and heart. He had true beliefs in the goodness of things even though horrible things had happened to him. He continues to press on and the strange thing was that the thought of giving up never crossed his mind. Even though, there were many people around him giving much doubt, he still believed!! I felt Patterson (with some help of course) captured the true essence of that. Now, if an author can do that he is a great writer within his own class!!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I like historical fiction, and I was deceived by the editorial review. This book would do for an early teenage boy audience, if it had less graphic descriptions of gore, violence, and sexual actions. The editorial review pointed out that one could learn about medieval life from this book. All I could learn that they often had sex (in various ways), many of them enjoyed sadistic torture, murder and rape, and that contemporary ladies were not offended by the outpouring dirty jokes jesters indulged their audiences. Indeed, much of the book consisted of nothing but these three components, and heavily loaded with foul language. The plot was simple-minded, and far from being original. The punchline (the identity of Lady Emilie) was obvious well ahead of the \\"revelation\\". The style of the book hits a new low. Most of it is written in the first person, as if the book was written by Hugh de Luc, the Jester/Inn-keeper. Well, he might have written it, because it does not read like anything written by a professional writer. The reason I know it was not written by Hugh de Luc is that he would have been less contemporary in his \\"insights\\" and jokes. Oh, yes, the jokes. I knew most of them - or at least a variation of them. It seems that there is nothing new under the sun, and the same jokes make (some) people laugh for over a thousand years. Or is it perhaps (?) the other way around, and the authors waste pages on borrowed contemporary jokes dressed in a jester's costume? The book was supposed to be a page-turner. To make sure it happened (and not to exhaust the limited attention span of a certain segment of the reader population) the chapters were very brief. To be sure, one could write a page-turner also by captivating the reader, and keeping him/her engaged with excellent story-telling and style. The short chapters are poor substitute for literary quality. Some of the chapters were not written in the first person. These chapters were disperesed throughout the book to describe events the Jester could not have known, and were written by \\"the authors\\". The mixing of the two viewpoints was not confusing, but was an easy way to escape the difficulties inherent in telling the story from the viewpoint of the main character. I was not convinced that this mixed form of storyline works well, but it certainly was not stylish. At least that's a consistent feature of the book.I can't believe that this book was intended to serve any other purpose than to cater to the least common denominator in order to sell more copies and to make more money. In fact, I found \\"financial incentive\\" attached to the pages of the book to promote it among my friends. Unfortunately, the book's trashy values ('values' may not be the right expression) just make a negative dent on some developing readers' aesthetic concepts. I am happy to decline the financial gain. Knowing my friends, I could not recommend this book to any of them. I would lose their respect for good...I took this book to the beach, and although I thoroughly despised it, I forced myself to read it from cover to cover. That way, at least, I could honestly write my opinion about it.I would strongly recommend anyone against wasting money on this piece of trash. Some commented that this book was prime Patterson. If this is prime, how bad are the rest? I think I read two books by him, when I read The Jester. The first and the last. I just can't see myself spending on any of his books."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I never thought of myself as squeemish, but after only 100 or so pages I had to put the book down in disgust. How many more babies will be killed in this tale? It's not only the death of infants and young children, but the gruesome, heartwrenching detail in which they are described! Enough!! I definately would not recommend this book for other mothers."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Did too many authors spoil the book? There is excitment and the telling of jokes(poorly).He includes two of the best jokes ever, and he ruins the punch line. This is not a historical novel even though it should be. It does take place during the Crusades , but it easily could be any place, anytime. This is not to say it is timeless , but a waste of time.If you want historical fiction then read Turtledove or Connie Willis. If you want excitement read Cussler. I will say that there are two surprises in the plot that are excellent( one is very obvious, the other is not).Do you think I liked this book? Patterson fans will probably buy this book anyway. If you are new to him, this will be the last you read.I don't believe in telling you the plot, in case you are foolish enough to buy this book. It is easy to read and read it in one sitting on a plane, If I had a parachute, I would have stopped reading and jumped. I never throw away books, I save them forever or give them to someone. I made an exception in this case , since I do not know anyone that I dislike enough to give the book."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"...so I went to Medieval Times and was thoroughly disappointed that the meals were not larvae filled, the characters did not REALLY speak Middle English, and the jousts were fake.WAH!It's funny how most of the low scoring reviewers were looking for immersion in the Middle Ages or a study in the Crusades... And HOLY COW!... You mean a FICTION story was unbelievable?! NO WAY!I'd better go back and watch \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\" again.. I hope Spielburg didn't take any liberties while portraying the 1930s and Nazi Germany. And where DID Indy get that special Fedora that never fell off. All of the haberdasheries I've visited said that it must be a fraud.If you want historical fiction... it's not here. Go learn Middle French and read some dust covered tome and let us know how it turned out.If you're looking for originality... it's not here. I dare you to find some ANYWHERE... The reviewer who mentioned that this ripped off Robin Hood and Braveheart... go back and find the original stories that THOSE were ripped off from... and then again, the ones that those EARLIER stories were ripped off from.You'll find that most of our stories are based on archetypes which have existed for centuries, if not millenia. Patterson takes his turn on the story-go-round, and makes a damned good go of it.I have read this book before and am now listening to it on CD during my commute. I am as entertained now, if not more so.So... RELAX! Enjoy the ride.Well... back to my stained glass-making class. My insistence on historical accuracy has been very bad for the levels of lead in my blood!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"\\"The Jester\\" was the first book I read by James Patterson and I have been a fiend ever since. I saw this book in a store and picked it up because of my interest in medieval times. I've heard of him before because of his books that ended up on the big screen. This novel was so addictive that I read it all in one night. As soon as I was done, I told everyone I knew to give it a read! I also joined the James Patterson fan site.I recently ran across \\"The Jester\\" at a nearby library. This time it was in audio cd format. I couldn't resist. I listened to it within a few days while driving to work. I believe there are a couple of different audio versions. Mine was narrated by Cary Elwes(actor from \\"Twister\\", \\"Liar, Liar\\", \\"Saw\\", \\"Glory\\") whose British accent made it so real!I highly recommend this book, especially the audio cd, to anyone and everyone! Patterson will take you through the ultimate medieval journey....page by page...young squire!!!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I thought this was a great book by Patterson (as always). The chapters were short...but sweet. It was almost impossible to finish the end of a chapter and not start a new one. Definetly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This is my favorite book -by any author. I have not read any other of Patterson's works (though I hear they are great reads!) as my family feels content is unappropriate...I was refered to this book by my friend -It is her favorite book as well!- and have since read it 6 times in the last month. I love it."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I love this time in history, I was suggested by a read to read this book, I am usually opticmistic about reading a book on someone else idea, but found this to be excellent."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"The Jester, was definitely a different book, but it was interesting. I couldn't put the book down. The plot was different, about during the roman days. I recommend reading this book to all James Patterson fans."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I couldn't put the book down and read the whold thing virtually in one sitting. I don't advocate or like it when anything bad befalls the innocent, young and babies specifically. However there probably is truth to the infanticide of the times and in fact our own times e.g. Iraq. This was not an escapist book for me and the overt brutality was disturbing because it is probably all too real."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"No long dissertation just hope he will get back to what he does best and this isn't it! First Patterson writing I haven't completed and enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"A book which is different from his others, but still one I could not put down.I also recommand &quot;Tales of the Axe&quot; by Ross P. PSuty"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"James Patterson has done it again... I have lost 3 days of sleeping time...Great book...easy to read and got me to travel way back. When will the next novel come out?"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I loved this book. I am not a huge Patterson fan per se. Oddly, I prefer his non-Alex Cross novels (i.e., When the Wind Blows), so I had reserved hopes for The Jester. Others have already given a synopsis, so I won't go into detail; however, I must admit that I could not put this book down. I read it over three nights. Each day I couldn't wait to get home from work so I could start reading again. I read about 2 books a week, and I don't often come across a book that does that for me. If you're hesitant because of the book's subject matter, don't be. While some research was obviously done, this is a &quot;thriller,&quot; not a historical. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I enjoyed this book. As a busy mom, with not alot of time to devote to endless chapters (&quot;Mom, can you help me?&quot; &quot;When I am done with this chapter.&quot;), I found his quick pace and short chapters enjoyable as well as the plots and the jokes that accompany it. Just an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"One of James Patterson's best. Wish that he'd write more like this. It really points out that several rulers of the medieval Europe terribly abused their power and that, in general, most people worked for a bare living, if that.We also see that churchmen often colluded with the rulers in mistreatment of the people."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I absolutely loved this book! I've read lots of historical novels and thought this one was one of the best I've read. Sure, I know that some of the expressions used were not spoken during this particular time period but heck, look past it and just enjoy the story. There was a lot of action and suspense and really liked all the \\"good guys\\" and really hated all the \\"bad guys\\" just like you should in an action packed novel. This is a departure from the usual Alex Cross novels but I felt James Patterson did this very well and hope that he does more in this genre."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Best of all books written by James Patterson. When I started I did not think that i would enjoy it, but I could not put it down."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Hugh de Luc was raised by a traveling band of entertainers called goliards. In one village he meets the love of his life. He marries and settles down with Sophie. Then one day an army of crusaders passes through the town. The leader promises freedom for all those who join his crusade.To win freedom for himself and Sophie, Hugh joins the crusaders. Two years later, he becomes disillusioned with the violence and misery of the crusades. Hugh returns home with a few meager possessions to find that his home has been destroyed, Sophie has been taken, and the son he didn't know he had has been murdered by knights of the local lord.Hugh vows to find Sophie and avenge his son.In the process he becomes a court jester. He also learns that he supposedly possesses a valuable relic. (Not the Holy Grail - whew!) But he does not know what it could be.As the tale unfolds the authors portray interesting characters: commoners, knights and nobles. Hugh undergoes incredible sorrow and fantastic joy. And the reader experiences a nice entertaining story.This book was a nice easy read. The authors' style was to use numerous short chapters. Most chapters were only three or four pages long. For me, it made the book easy to read because I like to finish chapters when I put my books down."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I've read all of Patterson's books. This is not one of his psycho killer hunting books. I enjoy his work but usually find most of his books very disturbing, yet I need to see what happens next. \\"The Jester\\" is my favorite book that he has written/co-written. I read the book straight through in a day, I've read some of his books that have literally taken months for me to get through. I wish he would write more books like this. It is much more of a love story than anything else, but not a romance novel."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Being a big fan of James Patterson, this book was really good! I love all his work! He never fails to entrall me in his books!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This book really had it all for me--mystery, surprise, history, romance--did I leave anything out. I don't understand the low ratings by some readers and wonder if it isn't due to the fact that this is a different subject than what Patterson usually writes. I had not read a Patterson novel so had nothing to compare. I typically enjoy historical fiction and am grateful that Gross teamed with Patterson to offer this enjoyable novel. Hugh became a very believable character challenging the system boldly giving him hero status. I like to root for the underdog. I was a little disappointed that he could have feelings so deeply for another before his first wife was even in the ground as I expected more from him. I hope these authors write more like this one."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"this is my favorite book by james patterson! it grabs your attention right from the get-go and it never makes you want to put it down. if you like any book of james patterson then give this one a chance and you wont regret it."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I'm actually leaving this for my near 16 year old son. He has been trying to slog through this book and asked that I write this review to warn others. A veracious reader, there have not been many titles of which he has complained. Had this not been recommended by the librarian supervisor of his volunteer position at our local library, I think he would never have stuck with \\"Jester.\\"Please don't think the reason for his lack of interest is a lack of literary maturity. He is quite versed in popular fiction, as well as classic literature.There, Scott's warning has been issued."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I thought it was a great book. I've been a fan of Patterson's but just recently (past year). So I still have a lot of his older novels to catch up. And this was completely out of the box for his style but even though at the first 50 pages or so in my mind I was thinking, ughhh I am not going to like this. I actually stayed up until 3 a.m. finishing it because I became so enthralled with the character, Hugh and his quest. Sure, it was a bit far fetched at times, but it is a fiction novel meant to entertain not educate us on Medieval times. It wasn't my favorite of his but I have been disappointed in his novels as of recently so I was hesitant but I was pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I loved this book!!! it was quite a change from Patterson's usual novelsI felt for hugh when his poor wife and son were murdred and the revenge he seeked . The battle scenes are straight out ofBraveheart . if you love historical fiction you will love this book ."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I loved this book, the story had a great flow and gave the reader details of the time period with the story, rather than having pages of dull dry details of what life was like in the middle ages.The battle scenes are well written and the story makes you want to keep going to find out \\"what happens next\\"I think that those who do not like this book are the ones who are fans of the mystery style of Mr Patterson's work.This book could easily becime a movie.I hope he writes another of this style - I will be first in line for it!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"If you expect in this book a thriller like The Da Vinci Code you will be very disappointed. You have to read this book like a novel, or better like a love story which doesn't have anything to do with reality. I'm pretty sure that JP didn't make any investigation to write this book. He just wrote a novel to entertain his readers and he made it quite good. Don't expect to learn something out of this book, just sit down, read and enjoy the book. It's worth every word in it"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Although this is off Patterson's usual beaten path, it is a wonderful read!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I just read a great book called \\"The Jester\\". When I found out itwas a period piece set in France during the Crusades I didn't thinkI would enjoy it, but I really liked the book enough to read it allin two nights. It's a different kind of book for Patterson, but areally good one.At first it starts out with these archeologists finding somethingthat was buried underneath were they were building a strip mall.Then they start telling the story of the Jester.At first the Jester was actually an innkeeper along with his wife.The innkeeper was raised on the road and learned many tricks. Hecame to a town in which lived the woman he intended to marry, hecame to visit her each year on his travels until one day he made heragree to marry him.Together the innkeeper (he is not truly a Jester at this point) andhis wife run the inn and they are incredibly happy, except for thefact that they are unable to have a child. One day a band oftravelers come by, they are on their way to the Crusades. Theinnkeeper wants to join along with the travelers, but his wife holdshim back.Well, later on the same night riders come through town, they areknights from the lordship Baldwin, the town is under his rule. Theriders wanted to know about the travelers from the Crusades and whohad joined along with them. The riders wreak havoc on the littleFrench town. The innkeeper is inspired to join with the Crusades.The innkeeper dreams of being free from Baldwin's rule and he feelsthat the Crusades will help him do just that. Even though he is nota religious man he thinks that the fighting on the side of theCrusades is the side of the right, though he soon finds out thatthey are just as blood thirsty as the Turks that were fighting. Hebecomes disgusted by all the horror and blood, he deserts and makeshis way back home.The innkeeper had been gone three years and when he returns he findsonly more horror. More riders came through the town after he haddeserted, his inn had been burned to the ground. His wife had beenbeaten and raped and then dragged away. Also, he learns even morehorror because he had impregnated his wife on his last night thereand they had a son. The son didn't live past two years because oneof the riders threw him into the fire that was the inn.The innkeeper promises vengeance and wants to bring his wife back.It is a fool's quest but he goes on anyways. It is a story of theweak trying to overcome the strong. I won't tell you anymore aboutit, so that I don't go too far and ruin the ending, but it just getsbetter from here."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Yeah, I read this last year, in seventh grade. I was 12. It was my favorite book. Does that say anything? Probably not, since its 1:15 in the morning and I'm not thinking clearly.Anyway. My mom knows I love james patterson, so she saw this book in the library and made me get it. BUT. I prefer thrillers set in a more.. modern time, I guess, so I didn't really want to read it. But I did because I had nothing to read. and I definatley didnt get bored with it like I thought I would.It's amazing, because when certain characters died, or in certain scenes, I got chills, because this book is so well written. I don't really understand how anyone can say this book is bad.(I kinda dont like the sex scenes, ya know, cause that makes it slightly less 'chilling.' but I guess thats some kind of kid thing.)SO what I'm saying if I'm a kid and its my favorite book, I dont see how any full grown person could possibly not like it. and my point is go read it."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I wasn't sure I'd like this book, but I did, and a lot! It dates to 1096, in France. It really was a page turner though and added adventure and romance and passion into the whole mix. I was intrigued with the description of events and the time line the book was done in. It really pulled you back in time and painted such a vivid and realistic picture. I feel like I know what it could have been like to live there with lords and lieges and dukes.I definitely recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"The Jester, while not a literary masterpiece, was still not as bad as some here have portrayed. This was what I usually call a &quot;supermarket book.&quot; I get books like this from grocery store shelves when between better books, and want something that is neither heavy nor a prolonged series like I normally read. The best I can say of this book is that it was entertaining, and took little concentration to complete rather quickly. The plot was the old tried and true David and Goliath story, with some Robin Hood thrown in for good measure. Too bad it was telegraphed like a punch from nearly K.O.'d prize fighter. One reviewer recommended leaving this one at the airport. I disagree. Pick it up in the airport, just leave it on the plane at the end of your flight, so someone else can pass the time with a little light reading. If you're looking for historical accuracy and character developement, read P. O'Brian; if you're looking for mystery, read Christie or Grafton; if you're looking for suspense, read King....don't look for these things here."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I heard so many bad things about this book, I almost didn't read it. I found it at our local library and read it in two days. I liked the book, some of the battle scenes were a bit bloody, but I thought the story line worked and the characters seemed real. I probably would not recommend buying it but look for it in the library."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Badly written and uninteresting, The Jester is not the page-turner it's advertised to be. It's actually kind of stupid and left this reader, at least, saying who cares. Patterson has disappointed me with his last two books. One hopes he can find himself again."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"What the book is; is an enjoyable, fun read. Hugh can be inspiring in the classic role of the underdog out to right wrongs. Baldwin and Stephen are classic bad guys with absolutely no redeeming traits. The whole concept of a holy relic is so symbolic on so many levels. Hugh's 2nd love is a classic \\"love conquers all\\". The book is fast paced (most of the chapters are only 3 pages long). It's full of action. It's just a fun read.The book is not a historically accurate historical novel. I doubt that most of the events in the novel would have occurred. I know there were peasant uprisings throughout history, but they were rare. The fact that a ****warning plot spoiler ***** king's daughter would fall in love with a pesant, marry him, and have dad's blessing is highly unlikely. *****End of Plot spoiler****So if you just want a fun read, please invest the time. If you're looking for the incredible detail of say a Penman, just walk away.My star ratings:One star - couldn't finish the bookTwo stars - read the book, but did a lot of skipping or scanning. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection or search out other books by the authorThree stars - enjoyable read. Wouldn't add the book to my permanent collection. Would judge other books by the author individually.Four stars - Liked the book. Would keep the book or would look for others by the same author.Five start - One of my all time favorites. Will get a copy in hardback to keep and will actively search out others by the same author."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I liked this book and found it entertaining to read. I felt it was refreshing, and while it touched on many of the horrifying events of the time period, it also took us into the daily lives of the people who lived it in a way that made you smile.I learned much from it that I did not know. I read some of the other reviews that claimed it was historically inaccurate but when I checked sources I could find no real inaccuracies.Even the placement of the holy relic (the lance) that the story talks about COULD have been where the book placed it. Although the lance is claimed to have been seen after the story ends, it is currently unaccounted for.I agree with another review that said that the prologue of the book was never tied in at the ending. That bothered me a little, otherwise I probably would have given the book five stars."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"The Jester was an enjoyable read. It sagged in parts and lost some tension in the end, but it was overall a fine novel and an interesting gaze through a window in time. Patterson's usual modern detective novels are well-known, but this historical fiction genre really reaches people. It is vivid and engaging. Give it a try!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Jester is unlike any other Patterson book that I have read, and I am quite a Patterson fan. The book is a love story that takes place in Europe during the Crusades. It has some real sad points in the story but the main character, Hugh, triumphs in the end and the reader is left with a happy feeling. It is a very easy read that did not seem to totally occupy my mind. One of the other reviewers mentioned that it seemed to have been written by an \\"adolescent\\" and I have to agree with that thought. I will give this book a three star rating and recommend it, especially now that it is out in paperback."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I found this book to be the best of Pattersons books thus far. I enjoyed the departure from his current-day surroundings to ones that are from the time of the crusaides. I felt, however, that he could have been a bit less repetitious in some aspects. For example, the Jester's frequent lamentings for his wife gets tiresome in its often rehashed detailing. And the Jester's forboding that he is going to die with each encounter has a bit too much melodrama. But, overall, I enjoyed the book and have recommended it to friends and family."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I saw this book and thought I would give it a try since I enjoy historical fiction. What a treat! I agree with some of the other reviewers that the language is modern and the story doesn't have a tremendous amount of depth, but what a page-turner! I loved it and couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it for someone looking for an exciting quick read."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I tried to finish the book but just couldn't. With so many good books to read and so little time, it just wasn't worth it. I am really surprised at all the 5 star reviews. I have read all of Patterson's books and this one and Beach House are definitely the worst."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I am not much of a fan of books that deviate from the author's typical style, but I was so surprised and genuinely LOVED this book. The characters were well developed, and the Sophie-Emily-Hugh &quot;love triangle&quot; was captivating. Jester combined the best of Patterson's writing: mystery, suspense, great characters, and at times heart-wrenching emotion. I can't rave about this book enough!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"You can see from other reviews the gist of the story. I just wanted to comment that the narration of Cary Elwes in the audio version was unbelievable and gave this book life. Of course, some of the humorous parts seemed funnier because I was picturing the Princess Bride, but he made the story play out like a movie. I'm pretty sure this would be one of the best books I've read if I actually read the hard copy version, but with this narration - it is definitely one of the best I've read (or listened to). It will make your commute fly-by!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"On more than one occasion, James Patterson has wrote with Andrew Gross. &quot;The Jester&quot; has a classic storyline; a man is searching for his lost love. On his return from the First Crusade, Hugh De Luc finds his son murdered and his wife kidnapped by a duke. Hugh becomes a jester in the duke's court in hopes of finding his wife. The book does have a few flaws. Throughout the story, the characters' use of language is unnoticeably...modern. Even with its flaws, together these authors have created another novel you can't put down."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This book is totally engrossing. I listened to it while commuting in my car and it made the time fly by.I'm a Patterson fan and wasn't sure I'd like a historical novel, but the story is wonderful, full of great characters."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This is several hours out of my life that I want back! I kept reading it because I've read all of Patterson's books, but this is such a departure, and so badly written, that it was a complete waste of time. You could see the &quot;plot twists&quot; coming a mile away, and it just dragged ON and ON. Ack. Skip this one."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I'm a loyal Patterson fan, so I bought and read this book without knowing anything about it all. It took me about 3 sessions over 2 days to get through it. Not exactly high literature, but it was very entertaining. A good story and interesting characters made it a real page turner. True, it is quite violent (but not much worse than other Patterson novels), but come on, it's medieval France. What can you expect? That wasn't really a very gentle time or place in.My only complaint, as with most Patterson novels, is the ridiculously short chapters. Sure it makes for an easier read, but the number of one and two page chapters in this book was a bit extreme. I find it disruptive, especially when a single scene that should fill one chapter ends up taking up five or six."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I'm appalled at the reviews. Even the bad ones. Has the term hero lost all meaning? Forget the errors in history and the language, what about the age old term hero: champion, defender, guardian, etc. Here's a short synopsis of what I took from this book. The village is being preyed upon by the villain. He puts out his demands, and if they aren't met people will be grossly mistreated or killed. The champion steps up to the plate and vows to keep the village safe from the villain (because the villain has already done his worst and left his victims alive). Then the hero decides to run off to the Crusades. When he returns, not ony is his wife taken, but the villagers are grossly mistreated and/or killed. There was a deadline to be met that was set by the villain, which the hero had vowed to meet. The hero showed his true colors and reneged on his vow AND left his wife (the most beautiful woman in all the land) totally unprotected. He didn't even have the forethought to ask someone else to vow to protect her. That's because there was no one. Everyone in the village had already been abused, so he left them all unprotected.As he goes searching for his wife and tries to solve crimes and mysteries while playing the fool, he falls in love. Although he still thinks of his wife, the new object of his obsession slowly takes over and his wife becomes more or less an afterthought. When he finds her, she has become the object of the most deplorable and inhuman conditions, but hey, he's in love with someone else now. Eventually the story ends with him living happily ever after with his new love and their new children. The author should at least have had the hero's fingernails pulled out or had him flogged.

I read a lot of Dan Brown and James Patterson mystery novels. This was very different but very welcome!!!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Hugh De Luc and his loving wife, Sophie, peasant vassals under their evil liege lord, Baldwin, Duke of Treille, scratch out a meager living as the owners of the local inn in Veille du P&egrave;re. The papal inducement of a promise of freedom from the grinding servitude of feudalism proves too much to resist and Hugh joins a rag-tag army of Catholic crusaders marching to the Holy Land to retake the city of Jerusalem from the infidels. In the presence of horrific carnage and violence, Hugh undergoes an epiphany of sorts during a battle encounter with a kindly Turk soldier who spares his life. Realizing the futility of what he is doing, Hugh deserts and returns to France only to discover that his infant son has been murdered, his home and inn have been burned to the ground and Sophie has been kidnapped and imprisoned by Norcross, one of Baldwin's bullying minion knights - or so he thinks!With \\"The Jester\\", Patterson and Gross have achieved something very special indeed. Using the setting and background of medieval France and the Crusades, they crafted a finely polished veneer and laid it on precisely thick enough to provide an exciting, believable and entirely unique cover for what actually lies underneath - a tale that is, in fact, 100% modern high-speed thriller. For example, Hugh's skilful adoption of the guise of a jester and his adroit entry into Baldwin's castle is, by any other name, an undercover infiltration operation into the enemy camp! The relic from the Holy Land that Hugh doesn't even realize he carries and that causes so much death around him, could have been, in a more modern story, a piece of microfilm with some critical information worth millions to the holder! Despite so many of the plot pieces being so typical of this type of novel (I'm sure that some would say trite) - weak underdogs rallying to the strength and moral courage of a new leader; a tender scene in which Hugh's wife dies in his arms only minutes after he has found her; newly found love providing a reason to persevere; a sex scene just before the battle with a charging enemy - they are put together in such a fashion as to be irresistible!I'll succumb to a clich&eacute; myself - \\"The Jester\\" was a rollicking great read and I enjoyed it immensely. Somewhere between the next Alex Cross and Women's Murder Club novel, I sure hope that Patterson finds time to give us another \\"historical thriller\\"!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"2 starsThis novel is light reading for fans of medieval history. It is a fairly interesting read, by and large, but contains little of substance or historical accuracy. This tale of a simple innkeeper turned crusader turned court jester and then leader of a peasant army goes very fast and I'd be surprised if it was not turned into a movie; indeed, if it had already been set to film, it would star Erol Flynn. There is some fairly OK romance, some details on the crusades and 11th century French feudalism and some medieval swordplay and battles, but nothing extensive. Good triumphs over evil, fairly predictably. The perspective of life as a court jester is a new one, not quite Robin Hood, but definitely not Arthur Pendragon either. The evil doings in this book by the knights and nobility are pretty atrocious (really faint-hearted readers may be offended by the images of violence, torture and sex, which, if they were in a movie, would get an \\"Unrated\\" rating). I question whether 11th century lords really exercised such complete power over life or liberty of their serfs. The French feudalism described herein seems much more akin to Japanese feudalism and I doubt medieval European aristocracy would treat the lives of their subjects/tax base so casually.I have two items of significant criticism with this light but fairly entertaining novel, aside from its cursory nature (it could have stood an extra 100 pages of details and description). First is the whole premise that the duke would know of the whereabouts of the relic and know to track it back to Hugh. Indeed, if he knew it was in Hugh's possession, why did his marauders commit outrages on other towns and slay the several knights in those small hamlets? Perhaps they were looking for other relics? The book is not clear on this point. There are several moderately clever plot twists relating to this relic, though, but an obvious, not-so-clever \\"twist\\" about the main love interest.The second fault I had was the fact that its authors chose to make every fourth page or so the start of a new chapter. Out of the 467 pages of this novel (perhaps 10-20 of which are title pages or blank), its authors have managed to squeeze out ONE HUNDRED FORTY-EIGHT (148) chapters. That's right, folks, each chapter averages only three pages. This makes light reading go by even quicker and doubtlessly assisted its authors in churning out more pages more quickly (and more profitably), but before long it gets a bit old to be switching chapters so fast. If you have a full day of traveling with stopovers at several different airports, I bet the average person could finish this book before arriving at his or her destination; I'm a fairly quick reader and I finished it in less than five hours. I find it pretty amusing that the \\"spotlight\\" reviewer referred to this book as a \\"monster\\" of a novel - it's nowhere close to War and Peace, a James Clavell novel or even a Tom Clancy book in length, much less in complexity. It's definitely more than a magazine article, but probably a faster and easier read than any novel the typical high school student has read for English class; in fact, it would not surprise me to find that most of the five-star reviewers are either in their first several years of, or not yet attending, high school. Also, contrary to what the \\"spotlight\\" reviewer states, the novel is set at the end of the 11th century, not the 14th and the local nobles, not the king, were the tyrannical parties.Overall, it's moderately entertaining, but few people will be satisfied if they shelled out the extra dough and bought the hardcover version rather than the much cheaper paperback. This book is definitely more Red Heat (Schwarzenegger and Belushi) than Doctor Zhivago, and more Xena than Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"For all of you that are yapping about it not being acurate and blah blah, who cares? It is a wonderfully creative story full of twists and suprises. It does not have to be acurate.. It is fiction, meant for entertainment and I really enjoyed it. I cannot believe that people are getting mad about this book. It has to be one of the best books that I have ever read.If you can look at a book of fiction for entertainment value instead of non fiction fiction, and want a book that will keep you reading non stop, this is the one for you! The the last 6 words of this book will just move you.. It did me. What a wonderful ending. This is a great work of fiction. Don't read it if you don't like adventures in a medival setting."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"To be genuinely moved by a book is a rare thing for me; in all the years of reading and the hundreds of books I've read, this one was one of a handful that has touched me deeply. First of all, it has everything anyone could want from a book: action, adventure, drama, comedy, romance and tragedy. It is perhaps the most complete novel I've read since Dances With Wolves. The writing was fluid and concise; the plot was full of twists and turns. The characters are unforgettable--the heroes lovable and the villains intensely hateable. It is a story that has the romantic appeal of Robin Hood or the Three Musketeers, yet more human, as none of those others suffered the things Hugh De Luc did. This story grips you from the start and never lets go,allowing very little breathing in between. It is admirable to see an author break from tradition; shows courage, and I think more should do so. Patterson goes way out of his element of Alex Cross crime thrillers; and I am eternally grateful that he did."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I have to admit that when I started reading this book, it began like his mysteries/thrillers. Then it jumped back to the time of the Crusades - involving a court jester, his life and how he gets revenge for the death of his wife and son. This was definitely a different change for Patterson, but his writing is so well done that I could stop listening to this (I got the book unabridged on cassette). The reader was excellent and literally brought the story to life. Patterson is wonderful with his research and weaves all the aspects together beautifully. This is a must for any Patterson fan, even if you aren't a fan of &quot;medieval&quot; mysteries."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"The story was a welcome relief from James Patterson's latest efforts. The narrative moved along and the characters seemed more interesting. The novel is in the same spirit as Pillars of the Earth by Jeffrey Archer, being set in the time of the Crusades."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I love James Patterson and have read just about all of his books, but this book is by far a huge disappointment! I labored through the book, skimmed most of it, found it predictable as well as horribly written. I am not a huge fan of historic fiction and decided to read it through the end anyway, to see where it would do. Unfortunately, it went nowhere. The descriptive violence was gross, the story lacked continuity and cohesiveness, and other parts of the story seemed to have been pulled from somewhere else.This book is just not worth reading - read Patterson's other books instead!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"What a disappointment! I found this story highly overrated. It could have been written in a hundred pages. It's simply the same bloody, gorey scene over and over. It's also very predictable. The &quot;Jester&quot; is a likable character, but not likable enough to save this dreary story. Patterson needs to stick to his usual genres."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I just finished the Jester and loved this story. I needed a wonderful hero right now and Patterson and Gross have given us one in Hugh. I had doubts about this book when I first purchased it, but all of my doubts were put aside in the first few chapters. Another wonderful book like all of Patterson's works. I haven't missed a book of his yet and won't in the future."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Known for his terse, simply worded mystery novels, Patterson deviates greatly from the norm to pen this historical tale of romance and deception in eleventh century France. With a first person account of poor innkeeper, Hugh De Luc, Patterson probes the force behind a relic of the crusades and the loss of lives when greed consumes those who desire this relic.Leaving behind his young wife Sophie, Hugh journeys east to join the crusaders in their quest to quench the Turks. With the passage of two years until his return, Hugh discovers that his wife is missing, and a band of marauders murdered the son he never knew. His vengeful path leads him into the arms of Lady Emilie, a lady in waiting to Anne, wife of Stephen of the duchy of Boree. Training as a jester, Hugh travels to Treille to confront Lord Baldwin, the man he holds responsible for Sophie's abduction. With his wit and charm, Hugh infiltrates himself into Baldwin's home as a jester and subsequently leads the people of his hometown to defend their property.Mystery fans beware, for the only mystery element present here lies in the discovery of Sophie's tormentor and the knowledge of the relic that Hugh doesn't even know he carries. But his fast-paced tale, devoid of eleventh century language, proves true to Patterson's quick plot summaries and enigmatic characters."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This is a rather unhistorical historical romance. Set in the period of the early crusades, to which the principal character is attracted for not wholly understandable reasons, and in which he performs in a somewhat confused and confusing fashion before returning to France where he finds his world in shambles, while throughout he somehow manages to entangle his life with the aristocracy.All of this is a framework for a boy gets girl romantic plot, and is designed, despite the gore, as a &quot;feel - good&quot; tale. But it could not happen and even if it did, it should not have happened; it violates plausability.Historical fiction owes something to the reality of the history.Yes knights were professional killers, yes the crusaders behaved like louts, yes there was a trade and lust after relics, but this is a stretcher. More accurate detail would be welcome.A little example: what was the status of inns and innkeepers at this time? Virtually non-existant, I would guess. And the results of a peasant uprising such as climaxes the tale would be far different. Consider the fate of Wat Tyler in England 350 years later.But we can guess the outcome in this story. All the clues are there early. I will not spoil it for you, but when you see the beast coming over the hill and think, &quot;No! It could not be an elephant!&quot; remember, I told you, &quot;It is!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"The Jester is a book you can not put down easily.

Others, however, realize very quickly that this book makes them want to, in an example of the carefully researched language of medieval France taken from the book, \\"puke their guts out\\". I am in the latter category. It's Hollywood-ized historical fiction, written with an eye to the forthcoming script. How convenient that these simple French peasants from 900-odd years ago talk like modern-day movie characters: \\"Whaddaya do?\\" \\"You have a specialness, Hugh...\\" Specialness??? I can see the movie trailer now, with lots of fire and explosions and dirty but attractive peasants fighting courageously.If you want medieval historical fiction that really is historical, and well written to boot, try \\"Doomsday Book\\" by Connie Willis. Nominally sci-fi, it is about a time traveller mistakenly sent back to medieval England circa 1348, just before the arrival of the Black Plague. Interesting, challenging, chapters more than three pages long, and very different from The Jester."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"If you're only familiar with the Alex Cross Patterson novels, then you'll hardly believe this is by the same author.A lot of authors find a niche that they are good at or drives home the best sales for their publisher, and very rarely stray from that formula. Here, Patterson takes a chance, and delivers a terrific story.Hugh is a protagonist that you are certain to root for, and while the story itself may not be historically accurate, somewhat farfetched in terms of the obstacles that Hugh overcomes, and ends somewhat predicatably, this is a story of human survival that will tug at your heart strings.Sit back, relax, suspend belief for awhile, and drift off to a thousand years in the past....."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Jester reads like a Spielberg film and it's a pity the filmeister hasn't thought of making this story into an epic.This is not typical Patterson far and I would guess Patterson fans might be put off by a period piece, but this is one great story.Proof?

Proof enough."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"How bad can a book be.....truly bad.

Over-blown plot line and silly hypothesis."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"It is hard to fathom that this book was written by the same James Patterson of Alex Cross fame.This book is a contrived tale about a man who becomes a Jester to find his wife (other reviews will tell you more).

James Patterson is usually one of my favorite authors, but I can only read about so many dead children before I just have to stop. I am only halfway through, but am giving up the ghost.

Although I liked the short chapters and the plot concepts were good, it severely lacked significant detail and persuasion. I was looking for something in line with Ken Follett's great historical novel, Pillars Of The Earth, and I was disappointed with The Jester. I'll take a long, leisurely, detailed fiction any day as opposed to this so called &quot;page-turner&quot;."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I like Patterson's books, but this one did not cut it for me. It's set up in France, in the Middle Ages; and tells the story of a peasant who embarks in the Crusades to come back to his house -- burned to the ground; his wife missing. He subsequently becomes a Jester to find her, and get her back.While this was written in the usual fast-paced style. I found the story boring.Maybe this time, Patterson write about a world he doesn't master well. Or the main character is just too plain. I don't know.For example, I bought the book because I was looking to be somehow enchanted by the crusades part. It turns out there was no mystery in it -- just blood and guts. While I was hoping for a real adventure; I ended up reading a story that felt too matter-of-fact.I actually could not finish the book . . . too bad!If you want a fun Patterson book, read this one insteadHoneymoon"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This was surely a switch from Patterson's usual books.

Seemed out of place for the times."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This book was recommended by a friend who knows I enjoy good, well-researched historical fiction (try Michael Jecks Templar books for an example). I enjoyed it very much until some very far-fetched and historically inaccurate bits at the end. The premise that the king would even contemplate his daughter marrying a peasant I could overlook (as it follows typical Hollywood fiction), but two glaring facts show that the author is no genuine historian. One is the jester writing a letter (at a time when commoners had no schooling), and the second is the mention of the trapdoor when the girl is about to be hanged. This is a very modern invention and shows the Hollywood version of history can be applied to the written word not just to film."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I thoroughly enjoy \\"The Jester\\". This was on of those rare books IMO anyway, that grabs your attention from the first sentence and keeps you riveted to the final word.I'm a fan of history and the middle ages and the characters that Mr Patterson and Mr Gross introduce you to in this book are so completely likable, other than the bad guys who you will truly dislike and want to see get their come ppance, you can pick your friends and enemies of today that these characters remind you of.I enjoy stories that are told as fiction but that have much truth interspersed throughout. I could really feel myself as Hugh back in the 11th century.I have been a mild fan of Mr Patterson's previously but The Jester sets him apart as a wonderful story teller that I'll now look much more favorably on."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"A different slant on Medieval literature but I was not really drawn in like I was with his other books. I enjoy thrillers and I did not find that it really meets the criteria for that genre. More of a romantic fiction."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This is one of those wonderful books which grabs you immediately and doesn't let go . . . and then, when you have turned the last page, you wish you were still in the middle.The characters are alive and well-rounded. The historical adventure through the Crusades is thorough, bloody, honest, and powerful. Hugh De Luc an innkeeper who becomes a crusader, jester, warrior, leader, spy, et al. He is enchanting, and his character grows through loss and reward, pain and triumph.By far, one the best historical fictions on the market."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Unlike most of James Patterson's works, &quot;The Jester&quot; falls far short of a good read. In a change of pace, James Patterson has attempted to portray a medieval setting of civil turmoil, but the narrative is sadly lacking both in suspense and substance, so powerfully utilised in his Alex Cross series. &quot;The Jester,&quot; rather than possessing the same well-constructed character as James Patterson's earlier offerings is curiously one-dimensional.The lacklustre plot is comparatively simple- A simple peasant has his wife stolen while he is away on a crusade, upon his return to the village his is understandably angry. What follows is a stereotypical mess in which he adopts the role of a Jester to infiltrate the castle of Blois in the hope of finding his wife.An interesting initial premise is marred by a well-worn storylins, and the absence of a suspenseful narrative so well constructed in James Patterson's earlier offerings culminate in an uninspired offering that cannot compare with other books in the canon."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I'm glad I didn't look at the reviews for this book earlier otherwise I may not have bothered reading it. I bought it because it was reduced and I was mildly interested in the idea of a peasant posing as a jester to seek out his captive sweetheart in a hostile noble's court. I'd never read a James Patterson novel before this and although I gather it isn't a typical effort I expect to be looking for his other titles during my next visit to the bookstore. Reduced or not.First of all I don't read a book in order to find fault with it, as some of the reviewers apparently do. Yes the chapters are short and maybe the story is historically ambiguous and what if it is all totally implausible: what is important is that it's fully charged and has so many twists and turns it'll keep you spellbound till the end. Sure, it's not the most challenging book you'll ever read but if you indulge yourself in this unlikely fantasy you may end up realising the most important thing to take from it is the simple entertainment value a good story can bring.If not for the gore I would suggest it would make a good childrens fairytale, not that I'm complaining there, I'm used to books by King, Cornwell, etcetera."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I doubt that any research at all had been done about the 11th century that this book is supposed to have pictured.The plot is too boring and monotonous.I just cannot understand why so many people - judging from the number of reviews - bought this book.Spend your money on Michael Crichton's timeline instead."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"...Steven Spielberg movie script.

We were completely engrossed - so very, very entertaining. Since our trip was only 6 hours or so, we still had more of the book to go. Now, we can't wait to get into the car to listen what happens next to Hugh. We talk about Hugh and his adventures like he's a member of the family. I don't want this book to end. I always love a story about people rising way above their circumstances by way of a good brain, and a great heart."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"No matter what James Patterson's prior experiences are, he cannot be called a historian.I finished this book with a distinct feeling of disappointment. This is my first Patterson book, and I was expecting far more than I got. I enjoy Patterson's writing style and the short chapters and &quot;train of thought&quot; organization of the story are an interesting change of pace.However, the author has hurt himself immeasureably by not taking the time to research the history of the time in question. He has villagers in southern France building stone buildings in less than a month and has battles fought against castles where the besieged don't use the military tools that any decent castle would have at their disposal. He places artifical hooks in the storyline and uses obvious ploys to move the plot forward. Another thing that annoyed me was his constant use of the first person intermingled with third person. It was as though the author couldn't be creative enough to use foreshadowing and innuendo to achieve what he wanted to convey.Patterson seems to race through events without giving much depth to the story and I found the overall experience to be vague and well intentioned, but with no real texture to grab onto. He could have take lessons from Ken Follett's epic &quot;Pillars of the Earth.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"It is apparent that James Patterson must have had little to do with the writing of this book. It is obviously not his style and is written on about a 4th grade level. This is a real shame, since at one time he was a truly powerful literary force. His partner, Andrew Gross, must be working overtime so they can rake in the bucks..........very poor effort."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I really enjoyed \\"The jester\\". It has a lot of violent scenes (that's why I don't want to rate 5 stars, I would rate 4.5). But it is simply terrific!!!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"To put in perspective how prolific a writer James Patterson is, his bio states that in 2005 he had five consecutive books on the New York Times Bestseller List. FIVE. The man knows literary hooks and how to deliver. THE JESTER showcases Patterson doing what he does best: Towing the reader to the top of his tale's hill and lettin' her rip. Just like an amusement park ride, THE JESTER is fast, fun, sometimes a little jerky, may give you a knot in your stomach, and will be over quick, possibly wondering, \\"What just happened?!\\"The book reads like a blur, UBER-fast paced. Though Patterson gives colorful enough imagery to let one's imagination fly, he doesn't waste a good deal of time setting up things like relationships or motivation. THE JESTER lives in a very black and white world. Good people are good. Bad people do bad things to the good people and deserve to be drawn and quartered (and with a good dose of satisfying indignation, often are). Patterson jams his hero into innumerable impossible-to-get-out-of cliffhanger situations, then provides that miraculous opening through which the adventure can continue (a few of which may induce an eye-roll or two). There's just enough intrigue to keep the reader turning pages, and when the chapters average 3-4 pages apiece, one can have a hard time not wanting to peek around the corner and find out what happens next.The language of THE JESTER is probably about a 3rd to 4th grade reading level, also making for swift reading. Don't confuse that assessment with early elementary subject matter. There's a healthy dose of guts, battle, torture, and plenty of phallic references. (It evidently was some sort of midieval pastime to insult each other's \\"members\\", as nearly every character takes up that mantle with gusto.) The dialogue of THE JESTER is, however, surprisingly clever. There is almost always some witty repartee flying around (penile jabs notwithstanding), that certainly raises the THE JESTER's entertainment value.James Patterson (with Andrew Gross) has spun another fast-paced, fun yarn, light on substance but full of zesty flavors. THE JESTER makes for good escapist reading and comes recommended for those on a quest for an easy to digest adventure."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I have been a fan of James Patterson for a long time, I started reading his horror/romance novels (Kiss the girls/Suzannes Diary for Nicholas). This is a little bit outside the box for my tastes and it sat on my shelf for a long time. Just out of sheer boredom, I picked this novel up and started reading. I couldnt put it down! For everyone who is a fan of James Patterson keep this in mind, its a mixture of the horror/romance novels in one. It will keep you flipping the pages just as any other book he has written. You will not regret purchasing this book."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I can't understand how anyone can not love this story. It's so rare to find a 1st person story of someone from the middle ages. The story doesn't have that typical stuffy historical and academic detachment that books on the middle ages have. Hugh, the hero, swears and makes fun of himself and daily hassles living in the middle ages. Yet, he turns out to be a stunning courageous leader, without giving too much up. I couldn't put the book down after reading through the first few pages."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I loved the premise and the central character. This book feeds into my obsession with the holy fool who becomes a kind of sacred king. Like Robin Hood, he is an outlaw who defends his people against injustice. For me, this is powerful stuff. Where this book loses points is with the conventional fairy tale ending which diminishes the book's impact. It seemed to me that Patterson and Gross didn't really know what they had, and missed out on the full potential of their concept."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I read The Jester by James Patterson, a few years ago, when it had originally been released. I had always been a long time fan of historical fiction, mostly from the Medieval Ages. What I needed, though, was a real kick start into first to propel me back into reading, and I could not have picked up a better book. You know how sometimes they say, \\"The teacher makes the class?\\" Well, for me, this book was it.The Jester is an adventure like unother. The story takes place in 1096, shortly after Pope Urban II has called on the crusades to rescue the holy land. Through the eyes of Hugh de Luc, we see what life was like then. It was not pleseant at all, but he was content with his life. We and his wife have their own inn, where they are friendly with everyone in their town. What bonds them all, is an overly oppresive Lord.After Pope Urban II promised that all men who took the cross and went to the holy land would be given riches, and released of all sins, Hugh de Luc saw this as a great opportunity. How bad could it be, right? So when the crusading army marched through his village, he joined up. Over the next few months and years, we see Hugh go to war, and experience the carnage. At one point, Hugh comes to grip with the holiest of all relics.After abandoning the army (from the hell he experienced) Hugh made it back home to come to an even greater shock. With men on his tale, his wife in prison, and much worse for their son, Hugh departs on a path of vengence.The Jester is an amazing epic and tale, and really a lot of fun to read. The historical side is not too much, as we are more focused on the adventure Hugh goes on, but we do see what life was like in the times, the Holy Land, and the different kinds of people.I highly recommend \\"The Jester,\\" to anyone looking for a good, face paced read, and looking to have a good time."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"NOTE: This review refers to the unabridged audio cassette version of this book.It was interesting to read the greatly varied reviews of this book. It seems that how you rate it depends in part on your expectations before hand.Many of you are apparently familiar with Patterson's other books and were expected more of the sameand were disappointed when you didn't find it.Luckily, I have never read any of his other books and I came to \\"Jester\\" with no expectations along that line. I picked it up because it was cheap and I needed an audio book. Judging from the cover image and the blurb, I assumed it was one of those \\"DaVinci Code\\" clones, with some ancient religious relic wrecking havoc today.I was very happily surprised to find a richly drawn historic novel full of action, suspense and romance. In fact, I loved the book and I grew to care about the main characters. The writing was good, although without any great literary pretensions.That is not to say it was without faults. If anything, it leaned too heavily on the romance angle and I half expected to hear some over-baked \\"Harlequin\\" type hyberbole along with the sometimes graphic (though never vulgar) sex scenes. And the protagonist was SO good and SO lucky (I mean, would anyone really be able to survive everything from the Crusades to a wild boar attack????) that I thought he should be addressed as Saint Hugh.In the audio version, there were two additional weaknesses. One was the use of strong Welsh and British accents for the main characters who are, after all, French. I am glad they didn't opt for phoney French accents, but it was disconcerting nonetheless.The other, albeit even more minor, distraction was that the narractor called off each chapter number and, given that there were more than 140-something chapters (some very very short) this quickly became annoying.Still, when the only faults you can find in a book are such minor ones, that says a great deal about the book!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This book was one of his best.

I either like his books alot--- The Womens Murder Club mysteries, \\"The Honeymoon\\", \\"Beach House\\", and my favorite \\"Miracle on the 18th Green\\", or I don't--- like the Alex Cross books. Most with a co-writer are very good.Jester was fasinating with amazing characters and a story that kept you wanting more. A fast and very interesting read. Thanx for the help. Andrew"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This is definitely Patterson's best book. The Woman's murder club was good, but this book is even better and a little bit off his regular murder mystery's. I really enjoyed this one. Patterson is definitely an easy read, and so it is hard for me to really enjoy his books compared to other's that I've read, but this one was truly entertaining."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I loved this book. It is not your typical Patterson murder mystery and I think that is why I liked it so much. Ill admit, my friend recommended it and I was hesitant. I had to force myself to read the first couple of chapters, but once I got into it, I couldnt put it down. Plus it has a nice romantic love story inside the mystery and suspense as well. Give this book a chance, you wont be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN . I LITERALLY READ IT IN 16 HRS .IT WAS THE FIRST PATTERSON BOOK FOR ME AND HAVE SINCE READ A FEW MORE .I WISH HE WOULD DO MORE LIKE THIS ONE .

I have read that he is a very prolific writer and then soon realized that he co- writes many of his books.The opening of the book was a disappoinment, it led me to believe that there would be an interesting ending, unfortunately it turned to a bit of a sappy one.Overall, the book is an enjoyable read. It tries to blur the line between history and fiction. However, at times it seems that this book was written hastedly and rushed to publication to capture on [ASIN:1400079179 The Da Vinci Code]] phenomenon.Best to borrow this book and not take this book too seriously."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I could not get past the violence--after first 50 pages or so I tossed it... not a book to read given today's world events... only lesson to learn is that we have not yet gotten civilized enough to stop the bloodshed for a holy cause...

But I am going to make an exception here, because my sister insisted. So here goes.....This was an &quot;okay&quot; book. Very fast reading, a good story, but just does not quite make it as a &quot;good&quot;book. I would not call it a historical novel, although that is what it is described as, I never really felt like I was reading a story from another time period. The story could have been placed anywhere in time and be told the same way. The setting didn't add anything to it. I heard Mr. Patterson talking about all the research he had done, and I don't feel like the reader benefits from that at all!So, read it, maybe from the library, or a friend's copy, maybe even wait for paper."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I am nearly finished with this wonderful book and so hate to see it end!

Years ago ( 15) I read it and finally found it again through you."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Medieval, fast, average is how I would sum this story up in three words or less. James Paterson use sparse detail, a lot of dialogue and not a whole lot of plot. It's a Porshche without the wheels. Fans of fantasy can find lots better. Fans of Patterson's thrillers may not be aware that there are other fantasy thrillers Stanek's Elf Queen's Quest comes to mind as a fast, great read and you don't have to read his other novels to get into the story. Fans of graphic violence, however, won't find what there looking for. Jester does deliver that, and a bit more than I fully expected. I'd wager dimes to dollars we'll see a Jester movie sooner than you'd think as that's what the book seems a primer for. The book did get me interested enough to try Patterson's other novels. I've got one I'm going to start this weekend."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This is truly one of the best books I have ever read. It only took me 4 days to read, I couldnt stop turning the pages. This is a book for people who are into romance, action, and fantasy all packed into one. I recommend this to all."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"The story of love and war in the middle ages is so engrossing that you won't be able to put it down until you finish it. Hugh, the innkeeper goes off to fight in the Crusades but is disillusioned by the bloodshed and violence he experiences and goes back to France. He unwittingly brings home with him a holy relic that brings bloodshed and misery upon him, his family and his village. His simple plan of vengance leads him to romance and danger as he discovers the evil plans a nobleman has in store for him."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Definitely a surprise! I had no idea what I was getting into when I started this book. All I could picture in my mind when the main character \\"Hugh De Luc,\\" came to be, was Mel Gibson leading his army of common folk in the movie \\"Braveheart.\\" That in conjunction with a \\"Romeo & Juliet\\" love story, brings you, \\"The Jester\\". It was a let down for me, especially after Andrew Gross and James Patterson co-authored \\"2nd Chance.\\" In a positive note, the book was very easy reading and the story was easy to follow. In my opinion, this does not fall into the top 5 for James Patterson novels. I love his novels and have read every one of them. This was just a total surprise, kind of like \\"Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas,\\" a book which I thouroughly enjoyed. I guess I'm just to used to the Mystery and suspense that Mr. Patterson is known for and when a book like this shows up, it is as I stated above, a surprise!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This was my first James Patterson book and I loved it! Impossible to put down, Jester torments you with it's realistic portrayal of life in medeival times and the Crusades. I recommend this book to everyone who likes historical fiction. I guess some people did not realize that this is not strictly a murder mystery like Patterson books seem to be, but it is much more interesting than that! This book has war, violence, romance, and beauty. It is a poignant and epic classic."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Some of the reviewers on here. Jesh!! I wonder when the last time or even if they've ever sat down and just read something for the fun of it. If you're gonna analyse this book and compare it and state how historically inaccurate it is, save all the rest of us the pity we feel for you and skip it. But if you're considering buying this because the cover looks interesting and the title sounds intriguing and hey, it's James Patterson here, okay? If you're looking for that rare book that will keep you up all night and turning pages until the very end, sacrificing sleep, then this would be highly recommended for you.Hugh De Luc, a commoner, an innkeeper, in medieval France sets out on Crusade with visions of freedom from serfdom and better life for himself and his family, only to return to an inn burned to the ground and his wife missing, presumed dead by his fellow villagers. Unable to accept the demise of his wife and hearing that he had become a father just after leaving, only to hear his son had been killed in the fire, Hugh sets out to find his love, his wife and avenge the death of his son. But he sets off in the wrong direction, finds himself mauled and close to death, but rescued by a beautiful noble born lady, and then apprenticed to a jester so that he might gain entrance into the hall of the Lord &quot;he&quot; thinks has taken his wife. He finds her but not where he thought, and becomes along the way a leader of the poor and downtrodden while in possession of a holy object he is unaware he has that he brings back from the Crusades. Leading a revolt agains't tryanny and winning where not thought possible. There are knights here in this book with honor and many without. There are battles and loving and romance and adventure and humor too. I read it in two days and I'd just like to say to Mr. Patterson and Mr. Gross who co-authored this book, &quot;Thank You, for a very entertaining read&quot; It was great! If it was historically accurate or not, I don't care. Heck I love fantasy and none of that is historically accurate and too if it's fiction doesn't the writers get to take poetic license? Want a good book that sucks you in until the last page? Read Jester."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"There's actually more grotesque violence here than in authentic medieval epics. The characters and the plot are unbelievable and unengaging."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"James Patterson keeps going downhill. Andrew Gross as his co-writer does nothing to help. Roses are Red was the last Patterson novel that was halfway decent. Violets are Blue was horrible, but The Jester is even worse.I love historical fiction, especially if it is well-researched and authentic. This book is neither. The anachronisms and especially the modern slang make this novel a boring and poorly-written piece. It's never explained how these medieval characters determine how the artifacts they bring back from the Crusades are authentic. You are supposed to have faith, I guess.For a well-researched and page-turning medieval action thriller, get Michael Crighton's TIMELINE instead of this dud."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I am an absolute fan of James Patterson and have read every book written by him. As with many popular authors, once they reach a certain popularity level, where every book published hits the Top 10 list just by association of the author's name, Mr. Patterson has begun to publish absolute rubbish all in the pursuit of more money. I suspect this was a book written very early in his career, before he became true story teller that could mesmerize the reader. The writing is horrible! It is truly a shame that popular authors continue to dupe their avid fans by publishing poorly written works. Older works should be advertised as such and be less expensive to purchase. As an fan, I probably would have ignored any bad book reviews and taken the chance on reading this. However, I don't think I will ever pay full price for anything he publishes again - provided I can bring myself to waste good time as well as good money!!

You just cannot help but notice the similarities between the book and the movies. The writers simply merged both movies and changed the names of the characters and some details. After the first half of the book, I knew exactly how it would end. I however give the book credit because of its unconventional use of really short chapters, and it historical overtones that made it much easier to read and consequently quite interesting."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"A terrible novel.

A man disguised as a jester to take revenge on a powerful feudal lord. But the writer is not able to create tension or any believable character. It is like we were expecting all the time to the point when we can understand why someone wrote this book.I am not talking about the historical accuracy, probably the writers have done a lot. It is only that we cannot see it, at least I cannot.There is not real adventure on this book. The writers seemed to have wrote the book in a week. Because is so fast...But also there is nothing on it that makes me feel any empathy with the characters. They are all grey. Even the villains are boring.All seems so cliche.

I don't know what his co-author contributed, but I hope they collaborate again, and soon."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This book's subject matter had so much potential.

I am prompted to write a review because I found it insultingly bad. The writing doesn't even approach a 4th grade level. Each chapter consists of only two or three pages. And there are dime-store romance novels on the market that capture a historic setting better than \\"The Jester.\\" Does \\"What flashed through my mind was...\\" strike you as an authenic phrase coming out of the mouth of a French inn-keeper in the year 1100?If you want a great historic fiction set in the middle ages, you must read Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth.

I was not that worked up about the casual nature with which Patterson and Gross treat the historical realities until I actually finished the book and read the acknowledgements which state that they made 'extreme efforts' to be historically accurate. Puke.The book was pretty weak. I agree with one reviewer who likened it to reading a movie script. It moved along at a brisk if unlikely pace with little character development.I found the characters to be ridiculous. Every commoner has a heart of gold and every noble man is a lecherous jerk? Give me a break. Try to offer some complexity. Please.This book received two stars from me only because if you are looking for a brain dead book to read on vacation this fits the bill. It is entertaining and it does move along. Just don't expect great literature."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I read the first 150 pages of THE JESTER and, deciding that I'd already wasted more than enough of my time, put it down. This is an awful and absurd novel that no reputable publisher would have touched were it not being shoved down their throats by a best-selling author. I was taken in by the attractive book jacket and the misguided Publishers Weekly blurb featured in the NY Times ad. It's been many years since I've read a James Patterson book. His earlier work was fairly interesting. Though marred by terribly misogynistic scenes (e.g. in KISS THE GIRLS the villian sticks a snake into a woman he's torturing and in POP GOES THE WEASEL a couple of female corpses are found in an apartment, one with her tongue glued to the other's private parts)and silly plotting, the books had a pretty high energy level that kept me reading to the end. But, although he's still employing his short chapters, which are wholly unsuited to historical fiction, Mr. Patterson -- with the assistance of Mr. Gross -- manages to be both inauthentic and dull this time out. For outstanding historical fiction written by a thriller writer one should turn to Ken Follett's masterful PILLARS OF THE EARTH and steer way, way clear of Mr. Patterson's latest effort."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"James Patterson is one good author whom i've frequently heard around in certain circles, whence i never immediately noticed that I have one of his thrillers entitled SHE HOW SHE RUNS while reading this great medieval novel - wherein the main character have chosen to look for a holy relic just to pacify the tyranny that their townsfolk suffers under the hands of a very cruel government, only to find that upon his return his allegiance to the governing kingdom would be tarnished by its betrayal of the pact they've been given.Hearken from this scenario- the novels already enticing pace runs to gradually build up from there even more.Seldom would a book grab your attention that'd make it on the level of a hard-to-put-down category. This undoubtedly levels to shack itself that way.The paperback includes an excerpt of the author's upcoming novel. Note however that the paperback edition goes with two different covers - the difference is in the bloated print-out of the cover's name for the author - the one with the grey edition has a picture of James Patterson on the inside back flap cover of the book while the white one has not. How did I found out is because I replaced the first copy i bought and replaced it with a more mintier conditioned copy only to find that its the white one. Hence I got me two copies of the same book .. *doh!*The novel is written in the format wherein the lead character narrates the story, and yet there are portions wherein we are granted a narrative at some points that are outside of the lead character's perspective. I guess this explains which parts are written by Patterson and those by co-author Andrew Gross (-me thinks... presumably that is) with Patterson doing those which are narrated by the character and Gross had the ones which are plain narratives outside the confines of the lead characters' scope.It's best that the reader should just lay back and allow the plotline to run its course while reading the novel - without raally having any idea about what's to come up next on its storyline. And it beats the retard-like ambitious farce of the DA VINCI CODE (which is soon to be out as a major motion picture starring the ever-faggy Tom Hanks)- this one's a great hell of a fabulous ride."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"The &quot;hero&quot; of this novel, Hugh de Luc, begins as an innkeeper in rural France of the Crusades, who abandons his beloved wife Sophie and unborn son to join an ill-conceived and bloody attempted crusade to rescue Jerusalem from the Turks. He gets as far as the fortified Antioch, since he has no knowledge of geography or history and doesn't know how to fight, and returns to France to find wife kidnapped, newborn son killed, inn burned, various savage tribes of returning crusaders fighting each other for unnamed relics of the Holy Land. After about 250 pages I became so bored with the gore I flipped over to the end to see what they were fighting over, since it is usually the Chalice or a piece of the actual Cross (as in &quot;Millenium&quot;, the cryptic former TV series), to discover it was -- the alleged sword that pierced the side of Christ. It must have had more magical powers than Excalibur. At least the Knights of the Round Table did not slaughter every man, woman, child, and animal in France."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I like historical fiction and had at least moderate expectations that this would be an enjoyable story, given Patterson's acclaim. Well, I should have gone to the bookstore and browsed this drippy yarn before purchasing it online. Cardboard cutouts would have more depth than the characters in this story. As for the setting and time period, 10 minutes of internet browsing would give you what this novel offers. The authors have a nerve to suggest they relied on historical research...If Hollywood makes a movie out of this, then plot, character, and scene development need little additional work with this novel in hand. My recommendation? Save the ~$8 and get yourself or a friend a big latte or something."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"it would be a comic book. Shallow characters, beyond belief."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I was looking for a good history-based novel to read on vacation. What I got was neither good or history-based. The plot is very predictable, the characters talk like 20th century cops, and the whole thing is just too cheesy. A mixture of Robin Hood, Ivanhoe, and Cindarella, with all the charm and novelty stripped away."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"If you can be satisfied with a book that offers only a fast-paced plot, this is the book for you.Despite the action, I did not enjoy this book. The events in the story were too convenient to ring true, from the fate of main character's wife to the family connections of his new love. I have a major complaint with the rescue scene at the end, but won't explain and spoil the ending for you if you intend to read it. If you have read it, ask yourself this--considering Emilie's family connections, would Baldwin really have chosen the action he planned to take? If Anne had wanted to stop him, wouldn't it have been smart to let her family know of his plans???Also, the dialogue makes no attempt whatsoever to be historically accurate. While medival English would be a little difficult to read, the modern diction used by the characters is disingenuous."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I love James Patterson. I've read dozens of his books and am never disappointed. What I picked up Jester I was expecting to read another quick exciting book. I didn't know what it was about maybe if I had then I would feel differently. James Patterson has stepped out of his box with this novel. I was having to remind myself that this was a Patterson otherwise I never would be guessed. The time and place, holy crusades, surfs and lieges. I will say that the book was just \\"alright\\" for me. Had I known what I was getting myself into I may have been better preparedness enjoyed the story a bit more. Also,it is very violent, graphic and gory."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I thought I would really like this as I like many different types of books. I did not hate it, but it was just so so for me.This is a story of a fellow who is an inn keep. He has a wife and is living in the lands of a tyrant who does not treat his subjects well. When a crusader comes through collecting people to fight, Hugh stays home. After a bit, he finds he cannot stay and must find a way to help his village be free of the tyranny and oppression they currently live under. He is gone two long years and returns to find his village savaged while he was away. He has lost a child and a wife. He believes his wife is still alive and sets off on a quest to find her. All he has is a staff he carries with him. It is a momento of his fighting in the crusades.Along the way he is injured and taken in and his wounds are tended. He is allowed to stay and learn a trade (jester) to possibly assist him in his goal of locating his wife. He excells and manages to find his way to the Duchy where he believes his enemies are and his wife is held.Many things happen and there is peril along the whole way. He fights, he rescues, he is rescued. He finds that many villages are being razed in the hopes of finding an acient relic. Many actually, but one is prized above all. He keeps encountering danger and eventually finds himself the head of a revolt of thousands against the oppression and tyranny.I could go on, but it would take too much time. It is a fast paced read. Partly due to there is always some action going on. Partly because Patterson books are filled with notoriously short chapters (some a page long). Which really lends to the books being a great deal shorter than they appear sitting on a shelf.In any case, this one probably will appeal to many who enjoy a bit of historical romance type with the formulatic outline for that particular genre (over mystery type genre). I found some of the convenient contrivances overdone. This dude was the luckiest man alive, while also being one of the most unfortunate.I say, for true Patterson fans, this one may be okay when nothing seeming better lying about. For those unfamiliar with Gross or Patterson, but like a historical romance, I find many of those type will enjoy to greater degree than those who are used to Patterson mystery/suspense/thriller type books.Christine"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"There is little to no personality in most of the characters, they are developed little beyond simply being what their archetype (the hero, the beautiful maiden, the greedy duke, etc.) would be expected to be, with the possible exception of the protagonist who, since we're told the story from his point of view, lets us see his struggle with belief in God while fighting in the Crusades. Still, the personalities of the characters in the story are not particularly interesting.No attempt is made to make the dialogue resemble eleventh century dialect, it is written in modern speech, with most of the Jester's jokes sounding like the sort of things you'd hear at a Renaissance Faire.I mention those two paragraphs at the beginning, because as long as you can get past that, the book is a very fun read. The focus is not on character development or historical accuracy, the focus is on the action and plot progression. The story moves very fast, you're never left waiting for something to happen.The story itself is fairly straightforward: the good guys are clearly good and the bad guys are clearly bad, no attempt is made at moral ambiguity (generally something I view as a fault, but something I can accept in light reading), and the story consists of watching to see what new terrible thing the bad guys will do to the good guy's loved ones to fuel the conflict and then watching the good guys prevail.The book plays heavily the themes of corrupted power and authority, and how power affects the common man's life. The book seems like it wants to say something about religion, but throughout the book it seems content never to clearly endorse or condemn it one way or the other.Basically, if you're looking for a deep read, you obviously won't find it here; if you're looking for a light, fun read then The Jester is a good choice."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This novel is really unlike anything else James Patterson has written. It starts off slow and I nearly quit reading it, which would have been a huge mistake. The story follows Hugh through an incredible adventure that both entertained me and touched me."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This was the first Patterson book I picked up, and I must say I loved it. Action packed, good vs. evil, and fast paced. The only historical inaccuracy that even bothered me was that Sunflowers were introduced to Europe around the 16th century.But it was a good solid book- excellent choice for a plane or just relaxing on the beach."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"If you can get over the fact that \\"The Jester\\" is not your typical James Patterson book then you will enjoy it. Yes, the history is not 100% factual but remember you will find it in the fiction section of a book store. The book has its twists and turns which keep your interest all the way to the last page. The main character, Hugh has his ups and downs as do most of Patterson's lead characters. So sit down in a comfortable chair, or recline in bed and enjoy a different Patterson novel."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"THE SETUPIn 1096, young innkeeper Hugh de Luc joins a Crusade army, but deserts and returns after two years of hardships to find his inn burnt down and his wife abducted. Hugh immediately leaves to search for her. In the meantime, a squad of \\"black knights\\" are scouring the region looking for a relic stolen during one of the Crusades. That's the setup.CAVEATSThe story is written in what I can only describe as \\"6th-grade-level Oldish- English\\"---a choppy stilted style liberally sprinkled with archaic English words, meant to sound \\"old\\". As such, the novel is bereft of descriptive details which would require more complex sentences and a broader vocabulary. Moreover, the audio version is narrated with a British accent, even thought the characters and setting are French.The first third of \\"The Jester\\" is bland, trite, and \\"undistinguished\\" (using pseudo-British understatement). It is pleasant enough, but does not rise above the level of juvenile fiction (with the caveat that the gratuitous violence, explicit sex scenes and raunchy jokes exclude it from juvenile fiction shelves). Nevertheless, the dialog contains many jarring modern American idioms.The first third is so \\"undistinguished\\" that (judging from other reviews) many readers simply give up by the half-way point. I won't say that doing so is a mistake, but that is clearly the reason for the disparity between positive and negative reviews. The last third of the novel is almost sufficiently gripping and exciting to redeem the first two-thirds.I second the suggestion of another reviewer: If you like the historical setting, \\"common folk\\" characters, etc., then read Ken Follet's masterfulThe Pillars of the EarthandWorld Without End--both of which are vivid, authentic, engrossing-- filled with intriguing historical facts, and well plotted with marvelous characters. \\"The Jester\\" is shallow and amateurish in comparison.VERDICTIf this was a first novel by an author still in his/her teens, then perhaps 3 stars. Considering the of proven ability of the authors (i.e., they are capable of much better), and perhaps placing unfair stress on the last third of the novel, two stars is generous."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I've read numerous reviews on this book. Those that hated the book REALLY hated it and those that loved it REALLY loved it! :)I will say that was far as a historical accurate book, \\"it ain't!\\" But who gives a rats butt. The storyline is riviting and original and is a pleasure to read. I'm a fan of Patterson and was not expecting this type of tale and after reading it would LOVE to see more books written by Patterson and Gross with a similar feel.The characters in the book I feel were developed well and were very believable.If you could care less about historical fact and correctness then this is a GREAT story and one I would like to see transferred into a film.Book Rating: RWould like to have seen a lot less of the foul language and sexual references as I feel they didn't lend anything to the story but for myself were more of a distraction."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I loved 'The Jester' by James Patterson. It included adventure, revenge, love, heartbreak, history and information on objects lost and sought after surrounding the life of Jesus Christ. My only non-glowing comment is that the use of contemporary foul language didn't fit the context of the book. I've no problem with profanity in books persay, but every time I read a foul word, I felt like Christopher Reeves in 'Somewhere in Time' when he looks at the 1980s change in his pocket while living in the 1800s."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Ordinarily I do not like the author to depart from his/her norm, but Patterson succeeded in rekindling my interest in the Middle Ages and the crusades. Very picturesque - felt like I was there."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"After the first 2 chapters, you're hooked. A good entertaining read. A most interesting lead character in this book."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I have listened to many of Patterson's books and this is one of the best! Though a bit on the bloody side, it kept me continually interested and involved in the time period and story line. A touch of romance, lots of &quot;honor&quot;, action and challenges and a wonderful narrator that adds the perfect accent to the words.Highly recommend this audiobook!!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"James Patterson's brave step away from his normal murder mystery novels (hope Alex Cross will be coming back soon) is in a way a great success on the other a bit tame. The action pieces I feel as though I can actually picture them and the blood and dramatic descriptions are quite gruelling. But I feel Patterson should stick to what he is in my opinion the best murder thriller author around."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I kept waiting for the story to pick up. Instead, it got very repetitive in its action scenes and quite crass when there was no aspparent need other than to add spice to a story that needed something. All in all a disapointment."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Just when you thought you could never enjoy anything as much as Alex Cross, Mr. Patterson has done it again. I couldn't put it down. I don't usually read historical romances or the like, but I had to do it because it is J.P. I don't want to give anything away about the story, but from the very beginning you believe the characters and find yourself thinking that you know how it will end. You don't know anything. This is not a silly romance novel."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"As is James Patterson's style, THE JESTER's chapters are brief, the language unadorned &amp; the story packed with action, intrigue &amp; dastardly deeds!For a modern day mystery/thriller writer, James Patterson's take on the Crusades &amp; life in serfdom France while oddly modern, is a rousing yarn that crackles with humor &amp; pathos, philosophy &amp; passion, foul deeds &amp; good."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I really loved this book. I was hesitant in buying it because I was so used to his other books which aren't historical but this book really grabbed me. Even my husband read it and loved it! I hope these two authors collaborate on more novels in the future!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Simply put, couldn't put it down. Full of pace, appealing and appaling characters, an irresistable story that never quits, (did i mention, pace???) and above all, laughter and warmth. You will root for Hugh de Luc in his sweeping tale until the last page. Patterson transfers pitch perfect to the Middle Ages, and with the deft hand of his co-author Gross, give you something special you will want to read again. Patterson fans wilkl not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"After being pleasantly surprised by the Beach House I decided to see what Patterson's historical medieval novel would be like. It was just as good as his other work. Now I'm not really into the Crusades or what France was like nearly 1000 years ago but I couldn't put The Jester down.Hugh de Luc is an interesting character who the story follows. Not knowing what he has brought back from the Crusades he finds his son has been thrown onto a fire and his wife kidnapped. This is the ultimate vengeance novel and has enough twists and surprises to keep you going. The character of Emily's identity is a bit predictable though.If you're into the Crusades or medieval novels you will love this book. If you love Patterson's Alex Cross series, other crime novels or the Beach House you have to at least give this one a try. I mean there are killers and sick twisted evil characters in here as well. This is a sensational book."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I only wrote this review to rebut others posted here online. A really good story, one worth reading. I got the unabridged CD version, and it filled two prerequisites for me - fast-paced and long. Enjoyment of history is probably needed for full enjoyment."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This book is NOT what James Patterson is known for in terms of the setting, but at the same time has the suspense he is known for. Like other readers I had trouble getting into the first part of the story, where Hugh is going on the Crusades, but once I got through that it was great. The Crusades were a necessary setup I think and having read other historically based fiction, it could have drug on much longer, but thankfully did not. I did not find the ending expected, though I started to guess at some of the \\"secrets\\", but I couldn't guess all of them. I loved that Emilie was NOT a helpless damsel in distress. It's about time! But then again I think Patterson is known for his strong female characters (Lindsay Boxer, Kate in Kiss the Girls). I think this book is well worth wading through the beginning history and getting to the meat of the story: Hugh's time as the Jester."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Wonderful story of justice and injustice inflicted on all, love lost, love found, friends found and lost. Loyalty, bravery. Its quite an adventure. But first you must begin, you'll step back in time 1300 years!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This is the first James Patterson I've read, but I will read more. The book was exceptional. I was attracted to the premise as a medieval historian and was gratified by the attention to historical accuracy. Patterson did a wonderful job of mixing a modern tone and pacing with a rich historical context. It is a thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I'm not sure what book of Mr. Patterson the other reviewers were reading, but &quot;The Jester&quot; may just be the book that makes the current &quot;The Cat Who...&quot; series read like real mysteries. This book is filled with absolutly no plot, no story line, and its only reason for appearing in print must be that ignorant people will buy anything published by certain authors. If you don't believe that, consider James Michener's last group of &quot;best&quot; sellers. Pap is Pap, no matter who writes it."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"OK is about all I can say about The Jester. I have loved James Patterson's previous novels ( I have a shelf just for him!)and being a Medievalist I was totally anticipating a wonderful book. Sadly, I was disappointed. The violence is almost too much to bare at times. The basic story behind all of the gratuitus violence, rape and murder has promise. But frankly, after wading through the atrocities mentioned I was just trying to make it to the end of the book.If you are an avid fan of James Patterson as I am, go ahead and get the hardback. If not, wait until the paperback or borrow from a friend."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I must ammend my previous review!! I ditched the book after the first 100 pages because of the vivid descriptions of childrens murders. After reading the reviews here however, I decided to give the book one more try, and I'm so glad I did! What a fun book with a nice message and great characters! Still not for some mothers, but if you can &quot;skim&quot; through the childrens' gore you'll be hooked!!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"See storyline above.From the front cover to the final page, this is one exciting, enjoyable and entertaining story. I do like adventures from the Middle Ages. At times graphic (as the Middle Ages are known to have been) and at times like a fairy tale, you'll feel emotions ranging from hate to love. I think Patterson and Gross have written one of their best.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I thought it was a well written story that generally has you rooting for the good guys. I found myself reading larger chunks at a time the further I got into this book, which is always a good sign. Gets two bookmarks up on my rating system!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Ok...you have read the plot of the book...no sense in restating it again. This was the first book I have read by Patterson and/or Gross and I enjoyed it from start to finish. It took me only 3 days to finish it. The story moves along quickly and it is an easy read. Yes, some people criticize it for the characters being to simple (all noblemen are evil while commoners are good), however, not all stories have to be deep and complex to be entertaining. This book entertains! If you enjoy stories/movies about that time period (such as King Arthur & Camelot, Robin Hood, A Knights Tale, \\"Timeline\\" by Michael Critchon), then you will probably get a kick out of \\"The Jester\\"."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book! All fans of James Patterson will enjoy this historically twisted novel. I love history as well, and it really brought to life the Crusade and the Middle Ages. History buffs &amp; Patterson fans alike will enjoy this winner!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I shant bother to tell you what the book is about......other reviewers have done that. I just finished this book five minutes ago, and the last hour has had me 100% enthralled. I hated to finish this book-- I love Medieval stuff and this is one of the best books I've read of that genre.So many folks criticize authors when they stray from their \\"niche\\". I truly love ALL of the Alex Cross novels, but I think Mr. Patterson is an incredibly talented writer no matter WHAT he does. Cross novels are more of a \\"quick\\" read, but his others have more substance, in my opinion.Put yourself in his place, in a matter of speaking. Let's say you like to cook. You're FABULOUS at Italian food. You want to spread your wings and try a little stir-fry. Yes, it's different than what you usually cook, but a good chef is a good chef.I've loved all of his non-Cross books.....\\"Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas\\" had me crying, and \\"When the Wind Blows\\" was my first Patterson read, and still my favorite. This man has an incredible imagination. I bought \\"Miracle on the 17th Green\\" for my husband, an avid golfer. I do NOT share his love for golf, but truly appreciated the book and my husband's passion a bit more for reading it.This is one of the few Patterson books I would want to own. It's a wonderful story. Give it a chance; perhaps you too will get as caught up in Hugh's adventure as I did. I'm not sure what Mr. Gross did as co-author, but they make a grand team.HERE YE! HERE YE! James Patterson still reigns as my favorite author!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Initially, I didn't know if I could read this book, because of some of the violent acts toward children (I'm extremely soft-hearted). Although, some of these acts needed to be there to make this book such a great story. Every time I thought the book could have ended, another great aspect of the story arose. I read nearly the entire book in two days! I was completely absorbed! I couldn't put it down. Five of my friends read it and also felt it was excellent! Very different and VERY good! I too have yet to read a book from this Author that I did not enjoy. I'm with Reviewer Danna of New Castle/ DE, I'm a true Patterson fan and was not disappointed."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"It's really hard to believe that this is the same James Patterson behind the Alex Cross series. The writing style is completely different (although that may be due to the influence of his co-author, Andrew Gross), and compared to the Cross novels, extremely simplistic. But that does not detract from the story being told, which is in its own way just as full of suspense as any of the Cross books.The plot has already been described in other reviews, so I won't rehash it here. I will say that despite its style the book is extremely well-written and the story is quite easy to follow. There are no sudden revelations, except at the end. But that revelation is somewhat far-fetched, even though hinted at throughout the book - and that, plus the simplistic writing style, and the fact that Patterson and Gross use modern idioms thoroughout the story, prevents me from giving \\"The Jester\\" a five-star rating."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"so disappointing! Unlike the other readers, I actually finished the book because it was such a quick read. I was totally unimpressed with the attempt at an historical interpretation of these times. It had the potential to be a fascinating tale. A textbook would have kept me more interested."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"In the prolog, a precious religious artifact is discovered in downtown Bor&eacute;e, France during an excavation for a shopping mall. An expert from the Vatican arrives on the scene to determine its authenticity. The reader is left to wonder what is this newly discovered artifact and how did it come to be in this place. The story begins in the year 1096 and tells of the amazing adventures of an ordinary innkeeper during the time of the Crusades and the time after he returns to his home. This is not a detailed historic novel. It is a fairly interesting lightweight read. The pace is fast and is spurred on more by the wonderful characters than by the story line. Every once in awhile a word or phrase would pop up that seemed odd.... too modern for the times. That was a small distraction. There is quite a bit of violence throughout this book, but that is a reflection of the medieval times. This story was a little reminiscent of the movie, Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade. There was violence in the movie as well, but Indy used a gun most of the time. So much neater than all those swords, arrows and axes."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"The Jester is the story of Hugh de Luc, a French peasant/innkeeper who, after deserting from the crusades, returns home to discover his wife has been abducted and a evil lord Baldwin and a villainous gang of thugs on the loose. I listened to the audio version of this novel, and while I enjoyed it, I thought it was overrated and rather predictable. The material (except for the hero's jesting), was really nothing new. The novel read like a typical romance novel, with long excessively gory and violent parts added for shock value (James Axler eat your heart out). The violence, while objectionable, didn't further the plot more than to make us hate the 'evil bad guys' even more. (As if we needed the negative reinforcement, after the opening scene.)The characters were stereotypical, the saintly peasants and 'evil sadistic rich men' and the sociopath \\"I'm so eeeevvvvillllll\\" knights impaling and committing all sorts of hideous crimes, made me wonder when Vlad the Impaler was going to be showing up. Unnecessary. Also, Hugh's transformation from humble peasant to a knight-hunting commando was really far-fetched, and had my eyes rolling.Overall, I felt this was an average read, with some likeable characters, and plenty of superfluous gore. I would have enjoyed it much more if Hugh remained true to the premise of the book and relied on his wits and Jester skills to bring about this novel's resolution."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Great book! The book sucked me in from the start. I actually felt like I was there with the vivid scenes. A lot of people had a hard time with the violence, but I am afraid that is the way the world was back then. The hero is also great in his adventures. I loved it and hope that he decides to write another in the this era."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Actually the best Patterson I have read. It is easy to read, but very enjoyable. You actually really get into the characters and the time period. Don't know how accurate it is, but it was quite convincing. Makes me want to read more about the Crusades."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"James Patterson has written many books about many things, some good some not so good. This is a very good read. It will not earn him an award, But it is not worthy of only one star. I have read thousands of books, many so bad I could not finish them. This is a good book IF you like the time period at all and have an open mind. There is adventure, love, humer, intrigue and action. Also the story is different. I never found myself thinking I had read this before. I would recomend this book to anyone who asked."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Sometimes all you need is something to tide you over. Dinner is in an hour but your stomach is rumbling away so you nibble on a cookie, chow on a candy bar, suck on a ring-pop. The food might not be the greatest and a couple hours later you've probably forgotten you had it. But it did the trick. It took care of your hunger for the moment.James Patterson and Andrew Cross's new book Jester is little more than the bag of nuts you get on an airplane to keep you going until your next layover or until you reach your destination. You wish your flight had a meal served on it, but are happy to at least have the snack.Jester is an exciting tale of love, wars against royalty and quests for religious relics. While the tale briefly begins in present time, the true story begins in 1050 A.D. when Hugh De Luc watches people head off on crusades. He holds himself back from partaking in the religious battles at first, but when a second opportunity arouses, he is unable to keep himself from going to war. He leaves his wife Sophie at home and fights for the freedom he feels is right.When Hugh returns home he finds that his decision to join the crusades has affected his whole villages and his wife, who has been taken captive. Going on about the plot might actually make the book seem less appealing and more dime-store-romance-novel-ish... But essentially that's what it is, with only a fraction of the smut.Patterson and Cross do a very good job of writing an entertaining story that keeps you turnings the pages. With no less than 153 chapters in only 452 pages, Jester is broken up into bite-size chunks easily accessible to anyone. The book is flawed: while the book begins in the present, we never return to the beginning characters but instead end still in the time of the crusades; the plot is much too predictable.When you want a nice easy read though, perhaps on a long flight where you just want to be distracted from the crying babies behind you and the coughing passenger besides you until your next layover or until you reach your destination, open the Jester. You might not remember much about the book when you're finished, but you will enjoy the read."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"It's been ages ago I've been reading books. But when I took this book in my hands, I couldn't stop reading. I just had to keep on reading. I finished it within a week, however if I had to count the hours, it would be only a day.In short, The Jester reads very easy, and yet is very captivating.Someone wrote in his review this is moviebook, and indeed it wouldn't surprise me if this gets onto the white screen. The story just asks for being filmed."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This is the second Patterson novel I have read (the first being another co-authored story, \\"The Beach House\\").I've come to the conclusion that Patterson is the most brilliant literary hack alive. His chapters are short, his pacing lively. If you aren't looking too closely, his plots are exciting and adventure-filled. But once you start looking closely, you begin to see the glaring plot holes and incredibly poor writing evident in every line. The characters are so paper-thin they make teen romances seem deep by comparison.Everything about the writing is just poor. It reads like the first draft of a novel, like he just put down the first words that came into his head, not the final version.But if you don't pay too much attention and are just looking for a fun read on the beach on a lazy summer day (I read The Jester in three days), the book is a lot of fun."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I've read all of Patterson's books including the Alex Cross series and this ranks as one of the greats. It is a story of the reluctant heroism of the common man, triumph in the face of tragedy, the encouraging power of loyal friends, and the ability to love again.Hugh De Luc is a lowly innkeeper who joins the Crusade with his mind filled with the ideals of war and the cause behind it. However, reality brings with it disillusionment and sorrow as his friends are slaughtered. No longer filled with innocence, Hugh leaves the Crusade to be with his love and wife, only to find his inn destroyed, his wife taken away, and the infant son he never knew murdered.With vengeance in his heart, Hugh seeks revenge. Apparent that the only way to get close to the murderers is to become a court jester, Hugh begins a path toward the final confrontation. Along the way, others join his cause and his quest becomes a battle cry for the entire country.The story was extremely fast-paced like all Patterson novels. This combination of Errol Flynn's Robin Hood, Danny Kaye's Court Jester, and Mel Gibson's Braveheart was thoroughly entertaining and is a must read. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I love James Patterson and have read just about all of his books, but this book is by far a huge disappointment! I labored through the book, skimmed most of it, found it predictable as well as horribly written. I am not a huge fan of historic fiction and decided to read it through the end anyway, to see where it would do. Unfortunately, it went nowhere. The descriptive violence was gross, the story lacked continuity and cohesiveness, and other parts of the story seemed to have been pulled from somewhere else.This book is just not worth reading - read Patterson's other books instead!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Where to even begin with this one. I have to admit that I read this book with a sense of wonder....I wondered when the \\"historical\\" part of this purportedly historical fiction would kick in, and I wondered where the writing talent had gone. Supposedly set in Medieval France around the time of the First Crusade, the reader would have been better served had Patterson and Gross created an entirely fictional universe. Although they include a list of sources at the end, I had to ask if they bothered to consult them since the medieval world their characters inhabit is like something out of a really bad Hollywood movie. In fact, The Jester would have been perfect fodder for a 1930s Saturday afternoon serial starring Buster Crabbe as the title character. This might not have been so unfortunate from a literary standpoint had the characters and the plot been in the least believable. The latter at least moves along quickly, sometimes at breakneck speed, propelling the characters from one unlikely situation to the next. The former are clich&eacute;s out of central casting: the virtuous low-born hero, the villainous noble(s), the simple and good-hearted villagers, the high-born love interest ad nauseam. The dialogue is laughable and riddled with anachronisms, the writing is clumsy, and the ending is as ridiculous as it is predictable. If you're a diehard Patterson fan, or if you want a beach book that reads quickly and requires little or no thought, The Jester is perfect. Those looking for good historical fiction are urged to pass this one by."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This book is one of those books that you can't wait to read every day! The idea behind the story is outstanding. I would fully recommend The Jester to anyone who wanted a good action/thriller."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"As a lover of historical fiction, especially anythingset in the Middle Ages, I was eager to read Patterson'sventure into this genre. Now that I've finished it, Imust say, &quot;Stick to mysteries, James. You're out ofyour depth here&quot;.A few factual errors don't bother me. The occasionalanachronism I can forgive. But this book is full ofboth. Equally important, it is too under-researchedto convey the feel of this past world to the modernreader, which good historical novels always do. Oh,he makes a stab, but it's mostly based on a cursorylook at the history books and a thesaurus. Just hiscomments about re-building an inn and the furniture ofan 11th century castle reveal his ignorance.If the book had presented vivid and *original* charac-ters in a surprising, twisty and unprecedented plot, itmight have been worthwhile. But other than the 'jester'angle, everything had been done before and better. Worse,I could predict almost all developments down to the final'surprise' of the origin of the hero's love interest.Please. A best-selling writer should be able to dobetter."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"not a typo...just another example of what passes for readable literature these days. Any fan of historical novels will be seriously disappointed. Any fan of good writing will wonder what the fuss is about. Fair for a beach read and better than watching a reality show on t.v. but don't expect much from this one."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I bought this book about three years ago and haven't had time to read it along with about 25 other \\"downtime\\" books. I opened it Saturday night and finished it Sunday night -- it kept me enthralled throughout. I was surprised to see so many negative reviews. I understand that the authors did not use period-correct langauge, but several authors use that tactic in order to keep their readers pinned to the pages. Hugh was a great everyman hero -- the battle passages were great as were the jester's jokes at the courts he performed at. This was my 1st James Patterson novel, too, so I can't compare to his other works.I thoroughly enjoyed Hugh's story and hope to pass the book on to someone else who will appreciate it."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"It's very similar to a bag of chips in that it looks like it has a lot of substance, but when you open it you find it is full of a lot of empty space.I've recently stumbled upon the Saxon Chronicles by Bernard Cornwell, so perhaps my opinion of this book is skewed. Anyway, if Cornwell is the master of historical fiction, then Patterson is still in Middle School.His writing fails to convince me that I'm reading a story about the Middle Ages. The jargon was possibly fit for late 19th early 20th century, but he made no little to no effort at developing actual medieval characters (outside of the fact they wore armor and fought hand to hand with swords and farm tools).I gave the book 2 stars because there was still some entertainment value and I don't regret reading it. I recommend this book for those of you catching a flight across the Pacific. You don't want to wast a good amount of free chill time at the poolside on this one. It's defintitely better read if you're stuck with nothing else to do.Finally, if you want an outstanding historical non-fiction book, seek thee out Bernard Cornwell. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This was a great departure from the Alex Cross novels that I have come to know and love. After reading Cradle and All and being a little shocked by how James Patterson is not only locked into mystery novels, I was again, a little apprehensive to start a book like Jester. However, it only took reading the first couple of chapters to get me hooked.This book was great. The detail and insight that Patterson has and his ability to tie facts in with fiction is what makes him a great writer. This book held my attention and anticipation to the very end. A must read for readers who love Patterson, thrillers, historical fiction, or all of the above!!Timothy Lassiter, author of Three Degrees of Separation and The Devil You Know"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Known for his murder mysteries, Patterson and co-author Andrew Gross decided to try something new and have given us a fun, fast-paced adventure set in war-torn medieval Europe.Hugh De Luc is a happily married innkeeper until he heads off to fight in the Crusades. The gruesome fighting and wanton disregard for life change and sicken him so he deserts and heads home only to find his wife taken captive and his infant son dead.At this point, Patterson is on more familiar ground. Hugh De Luc must find out who did it and try to bring him to justice. Unfortunately, medieval customs and laws interfere with that search. Throw in some religious relics and a menacing group of French knights who believe they are condemned to hell and you have the indgredients for a fine book.Patterson's descriptions of medieval life ring true, although the ending may not have worked out so well in a real medieval scenario. Nevertheless, it was lots of fun and a big improvement over the Women's Murder Club series.I give this one a grade of A."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"'The Jester' tells the story of a inn keeper turned crusader that finds he doesn't have the taste for the Crusades and leaves the Holy Land for home. When he returns to France, he discovers the Inn he and his wife, Sophie, had built has been burnt to the ground. Worse, he discovers that his wife has been carried away by rebellious knights. Seeking revenge, Hugh (the inn keeper) sets off in a fury weilding only a staff he picked up during the crusades. A fair lady attendant of the wife of a local baron rescues him from trouble and sets him up with the pretext of the role of a Jester to further his plot...James Patterson teams up with Andrew Gross to bring us this novel. Readers of Patterson's other works, such as the Alex Cross series, will be familiar with the usual plot twists and short chapters that make his books page turners. However, although this book is set in the eleventh century, and the bibliography of sources the authors used suggests they did they research, it doesn't have the ring of historical accuracy. The story seems to have been modernized for current tastes, with the most notable example being the language.Overall, the book is enjoyable. The plot is not entirely complex, and in a few points, somewhat predictable. My biggest gripe is that the authors would have us believe Hugh would be surprised to find that his wife was missing and his inn burnt down after the book starts with a scene of Knights doing just that in Hugh's presence when others had left for a \\"people's crusade.\\" The language is frequently coarse, and there are some highly explicit sexual descriptions and violent encounters. I wouldn't recommend this novel for young readers, but older readers looking for a quick read should enjoy this."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I have very rarely picked up a book, taken it home and stayed up all night to finish it. This occurred with the Jester. I found this to be one of the best books I have ever read. The action was intense, the brutality of the times was depicted with a very human reaction. This book was beautifully written, I felt all of Hughs emotions, suffered with his losses and laughed at the bad jokes....he was really a good Jester. If you enjoy period stories, want to meet a character with heart, determination and an abundance of love and loyalty, pick up this book and meet Hugh DeLuc and the many wonderful (and not so wonderful) people he encounters in this wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Patterson steps back 900 years to deliver an epic tale of lords and serfs in medieval France, during the times of the crusades. Our hero, Hugh, is a commoner who seeks the promise of a better life by joining the crusade (which he doesn't believe in). He comes back disillusioned, seeing the horrors of a war that makes no sense to him. He also discovers his wife and child are missing, sending him on the his real journey across France. He finds love, treasure, and starts a revolution within a couple of duchies ruled by despot lords. Patterson spices up the tale with plenty of ribald humor. As with all of Patterson's books, it is a page turner and a quick read."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"...and that's saying a lot. I can see on the surface where the Jester might turn some people (even Patterson diehards) off. A love story, adventure, mystery all wrapped in the setting of the Crusades? This is definitely a departure for Patterson and if you go into this expecting Alex Cross I can see where you'd be disappointed.That being said, the Jester has slowly become one of my favorite Patterson novels to date. I say slowly because I have found that this story has stayed with me much longer than a Cross novel. This is the type of story that is allowed to stew in your mind and grow with time. I highly recommend the Jester.Hugh De Luc plays the key role in this novel. An innkeeper with adventurous ambition, Hugh leaves his family and home to pursue riches in the Crusades. The Crusade story line does not dominate and should not scare away the casual reader. The setting merely sets the stage for Hugh's acquisition of a relic that's value is unknown to even him. Upon Hugh's return home he finds his village in shambles and his family presumably dead.This sets in motion the key storyline of the Jester as Hugh goes in search of those responsible for ruining his life. A David vs. Goliath revenge story unfolds with Hugh resorting to any means necessary to get close to those responsible for his pain, even resorting to taking up the role of a jester. Here is able to gain the trust of those responsible and devise a plot worthy of the pain he has endured. Along the way Hugh gains allies and uncovers truths beyond his imagination. Patterson's imagery and detail pull you into the story as you root for Hugh in his own personal crusade.Patterson and co-collaberator Andrew Gross tie everything together in a climatic final battle, discovery, and of course a Patterson plot twist. The plot twist can be seen coming and came as little surprise to me. While fault could be found in this fact, I still found The Jester well worth the time. Patterson's trademark rapid pace keeps the pages turning and suspense mounting."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I have always loved James Patterons' Mystery series, old and new, but this topped those but good! Mystery, intrigue, history, romance, comedy... The man made a masterpiece of combining all emotions that make us tick into one fascinating story. Just amazing!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Hugh De Luc is an innkeeper in Veille du Pere, a village in southern France. The year is 1096, a time of dukes and nobles. A time of servants and jesters.Lord Baldwin and his knight, Norcross, wreak havoc on the people in Hugh's village. Rapes and murders occur and no one can do anything about it.Hugh feels his calling is to join Raymond of Toulouse in the fight for freedom. He leaves his beloved wife, Sophie, to embark on his journey to the Holy Land.Only after his return from brutal battle does he find that his son has been murdered and his wife has been abducted from their village. Hugh knows who's responsible and he vows to bring his wife back to their village.Along the way, Hugh meets a maiden named Emilie. Lady Emilie actually saves his life and takes him back to her court, the castle of the King of France's cousin. She knows he will not stay long, he is in search of his wife. But she offers to help Hugh with his mission.Her idea is simple - Hugh will become a jester to get inside the court and free Sophie from her captors. Her plan, he soon discovers, is much more difficult to carry out.What no one knows is that the real evil lies far deeper than a court wanting to destroy a tiny village. And that evil is linked to the most holy relic known to man.Hugh, once a simple innkeeper, is about to take on the biggest challenge of his life. Many lives will be lost, loved ones, dear friends, fellow soldiers - all for him and all because of him.James Patterson brings a new twist to his thrillers. This time, he takes readers into the historical fiction genre with a very detailed, and sometimes gruesome, account of one man's struggle to break the system to become free.Patterson has taken a detour from the Alex Cross series as well as the Women's Murder Club books with this novel. This is a refreshing take on a genre that is often lacking when authors try to recreate these times.The Jester is not a feel good tale of lords and ladies. The image of violence is vivid and the language is strong. The work he and Andrew Gross have created is a thriller all the way, with an added mix of love, hope and determination."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"To say the least I loved every page of this novel! Wow! Entertaining, funny (I've used some of Hugh's jokes already and they get a laugh!) tragic, a little romance thrown in, what a perfect combination. At first I was a little disappointed that this was a work of historical fiction based on the time of the crusades (even though I like historical fiction, when I pick up something by James Patterson it is for modern mystery suspense) Silly I know, but I didn't really read the back cover, I just love James Patterson so his name on the cover was enough for me to purchase this book. I originally thought it was some terrific serial killer/mystery suspense ( the usual fare with James Patterson) Boy was I surprised! This was a fantastic read. A real page turner. But you need to open your mind to something different from James Patterson. If you loved Braveheart, Robin Hood or The Pillars of the Earth (Ken Follett) then why hesitate with this fine novel? Just because it isn't the usual mystery you have come to expect from James Patterson, doesn't mean this doesn't have mystery, very bad and sick men, thrills galore, exciting battle scenes, heroic rescues, a band of merry men. This story has it all. I'm beginning to sound like the Princess Bride here! But, it is just that good. Just try it you might like it! That's what my mother always told me when she knew something was good for me and I wasn't quite a believer! But, mother is always right. Anyway, if you love historical fiction than this is just the perfect book for you! Trust me! Buy it!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"My apologies to all you James Patterson fans out there. I know I am about to inflame many of you with what I have to say. The truth is, I've read several of his books now and have to say that there just isn't much substance to them. They feel trite and contrived and not particularly clever when compared to other writers in the genre. I always think I should enjoy them but I am always left wondering where the \\"rest of it is.\\" It feels like eating nothing but whipped cream for dinner when you really want a burger. It looks great and sounds like a good idea but you're left wanting something else when you're done."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I JUST RECENTLY READ THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH ANMD I LOVED THAT , BUT THIS BOOK WAS ALSO OUTSTANDING IF NOT HISTORICALLY ACCURATE. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A HUMOROUS NON STOP ACTION ADVENTURE IT DOESNT GET BETTER THAN THE JESTER. OUR HERO IS AMAZING AND WOULD MAKE A FABULOUS MOVIE HERO, I HOPE SOMEONE PICKS UP THE RIGHTS AND MAKEs a movie. PICK UP THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"There's nothing new in The Jester, but it could have been so much more than it is. The plot - commoner takes on the corrupt and cruel nobility. The characters - returning crusader searching for lost wife, possessing a relic of inestimable value he doesn't know he has; evil, self-serving lord; romantic young noblewoman gives up everything for love; courageous peasants. The setting - medieval Europe. But somehow Patterson failed to inject any life into this story. His prose is ordinary, mainly descriptive, somewhat jarringly written in 20th century American vernacular. Italics scattered upon every page clue the reader in to points that the author feels are important - it might be possible to get through the entire novel just by reading the italics! Hugh, one of the least charismatic main characters ever written, nevertheless manages to enlist the entire region into his rebellion.Despite these flaws - The Jester clearly is not great literature - the story is compelling enough to make the novel worth finishing. Not good history but a decent enough beach or airplane read."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"In James Patterson's novel \\"The Jester,\\" Patterson spins the tale of Hugh du Lac, a village surf who fights in The Crusades, loses his family, becomes a court jester to exact vengence, and eventually leads a battle to win his freedom.I did not care for this novel at all. The dust jacket makes this novel sound like a Grail quest mystery and it really isn't. It's a historical drama about the struggles of one man to exact revenge against those that wronged him. The characters were a bit cookie cutterish, the plot was slow, and the ending was very anti-climactic. Patterson is much better at mysteries and my advice would be for him to stick with what he is good at. \\"The Jester\\" was just not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This is a reasonably well told story about an innkeeper who goes on the Crusades to buy freedom from serfdom for himself and his wife. The story is very slow to open, with the Crusade portions almost enough to make me abandon the book entirely. Once Hugh got back to France, things rolled a little easier storywise. Unfortunately, it has more of a fairy tale feel than historical fiction/thriller, and some of the subplots were completely beyond your normal &quot;suspension of belief&quot;. If you're a stickler for accuracy in historicals, this one will probably grate on your nerves. Logic is tossed out the window if it serves the authors' purposes. It's not the worst book I've read this year, but it isn't the best either."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This book was great. I loved it. I loved the history in it as well as the characters. I just couldn't stop turning the pages. A definite winner."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I too wholeheartedly agree with the five star ratings given to the most refreshing piece of writing to bare James Patterson's name in a long time. I was hesitant myself to start it as the title implies a Medieval setting, which is not my cup of tea. But, after reading Timeline, this too proved that my judgement was wrong. The writing is indeed excellent and the characters colorful and realistic. The story as well was brilliantly conceived. Only one thing bothers me though. This book very inconsistent with Patterson's recent work. I came to the conclusion quite a few books ago that his focus of late is to crank out a book a month to keep the cash coming in. There could be no other excuse for his last &quot;out of genre&quot; foray (When the Wind Blows), which far and away was the worse novel I have ever read (including that crap Koontz writes). That one fared so poorly that I am convinced that he should stay close to his element. Even the last Alex Cross novel I read (Four Blind Mice) was so ill-conceived and hastily slapped together that for the first time I really didn't care at all about the Cross characters and was in no hurry to finish the book. No, I believe all of the credit should go to Andrew Gross, who I would bet penned the entire novel using merely Patterson's short chapter style and name recognition. Patterson hasn't written this well since he was hungry and I don't believe he ever will again. Good work Andrew!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This book is a big departure for Patterson. Stanch fans of Alex Cross will not care for this book. However, it is far from being a masterpiece. The characters are not well developed and the situations are unreal and contrived. Still it is a very good &quot;beach book&quot;. Fast paced, entertaining, and not too taxing.If you like this book, you should read the Brother Cadfael series by Ellis Peters. They have a great feel for the period and are, frankly, much better stories. Start with &quot;A Morbid Taste For Bones&quot; and follow the series for an absolutely wonderful series of books."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I am surprised with some of the bad reviews on this book. Perhaps the story-line, or even the crusades, may not be for everyone-but to call it &quot;aweful writing,&quot; I think is taking it a bit too far. I actually found this to be a wonderful story with excellent writing. Hugh De Luc, is a memorable character that inspires hope and compassion. This is my first book written by this author (James Patterson)-and no, it won't be my last. I was interested in &quot;The Jester,&quot; and with the bad reviews I felt I was taking a chance getting it. However, I am very glad I did!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"A fun read, really engaging. Patterson, known for his suspense thrillers, takes a new stab at the world of fantasy. Based during the time of the Crusades, we follow a man searching for his long lost wife. This book also forces us to realize the strength of the bonds of love, and how we should never let a challenge get the best of us. This is a great read and takes you to a place outside of the real world where you can escape the stresses of your own life."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Hugh de Luc may be the first (and only?) French hero. Then again, this is a work of fiction. In all seriousness, this is a fabulous David and Goliath story. The story has rich characters and is wonderfully written. A close second to Crichton's &quot;Timeline.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I was very reluctant to read this book and left it in the cupboard for around 2 months before I decided to read it. I was very unsure about the fact that Mr P and Mr G were trying something new and was worried that it would be a very weak book.I started reading it on Tuesday morning and by Wednesday night, to my partners delight, I had finished it.It was FANTASTIC. I loved the book so much. They really made the characters leap off the page and become a movie playing in your mind. It was soo amazing. You actually went through the emotions with the characters and once I had finished the book, although I was glad with the outcome, I was also sad that I wouldn't be reading any more about them.10 / 10. Again I marvel at your genius!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"James Patterson has to be the most addictive novelist that I've had the pleasure of reading. His books suck me in and I'm right there the whole time, as if I had been written in myself. In the month or so that I've been reading his books, I've read most of them. A few I'm still waiting on.When I first started reading \\"The Jester\\" I was thinking that I may not like it, it's a bit off the beaten path for Patterson, but after I read the first few chapters, I couldn't get enough.Once again, Patterson has proved why it is that he's a bestselling author. I will be recommending his books to everyone I encounter for a long time to come!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This book combines solid historical backdrop and great storytelling ability. The jester, a humble man made great by passion and needs, rises above his own renenge. He shows his townspeople that freedom must be first claimed and then defended.A colorful medival story with love, the crusades, villians, a dwarf and of course a hero."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"James Patterson takes his first stab at historical genre with co-author Andrew Gross in a medievial tale set in 11th century where an impoverished inn-keeper Hugh De Luc decides to fulfil his destiny in joining The Crusades to Jerusalem. Patterson's punchy style sets the frenetic pace of the tale and pitches the massacre with action and violence. He arrives back to discover his wife Sophie and son kidnapped by black 'faceless' men. Hugh battles his way in search of his wife and leads the townspeople to revolt against two oppressive dukes. Little did he know that Filled with doses of humour and warmth, Patterson's characters shine with wits and intelligence regardless of the genre. Though the history in the book comes across as fleeting, it is nonetheless an entertaining romp galvanized with energy."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"i LOVED THIS BOOK.

This one..not so much. I found it to be almost a child/teen novel. Maybe they flet they could compete with Harry Potter in that venue, but I don't think it works."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"can only be achieved by a writer such as Patterson. At first glance it seems like the old 'good against evil' theme. But this novel goes deeply into the history of the times; miles and miles of research, I am sure. And exquisitely done. The characters are alive and real and the stylish writing makes it so easy to follow along in the JESTER'S footsteps.Love of his family, slaughtered while he is off on the quest of what could only be a myth,lead him on the search for the villain that has caused his gut-wrenching pain and lead us down a path of blood, murder and mayhem....and would you believe laughter? How skillful of Patterson and Gross to intertwine so many emotions and episodes and end up with such an entertaining story.I found it mesmerizing and somewhat enchanting. A wonderful book companion that did not put me to sleep, but awakened many deep feelings and tickled my funnybone at the same time! The ending is masterful and I hope you will get to enjoy Hugh, the JESTER, who feels that 'to make people laugh', while still accomplishing all that needs to be done, 'that is the thing..that is what it is all about'. Laugh, cry, suffer, love, yearn for,lose love and find anew, along with our JESTER hero and you will have a great time."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"THE JESTER is a magnificent thriller about what really happened during the often romanticized accounting of the Crusades. Hugh De Luc, an innkeeper who joined the Crusades in a fit of patriotism, returns home to find his son murdered and his wife missing. The man he was fighting the Crusades for is the guilty party. Knowing full well the penalty for going against his master, Hugh rushes out to find his wife and avenge his son. A compassionate lady of the court finds him after he has been wounded and gives him a sound plan for his mission. In a breath taking rush through moldy palaces and dank dungeons, Hugh brawls and battles his way into a major revolution against the ruling lords.It is a long, but one-sitting kind of book. Once you pick it up, you can't put it down until the very last thrust of Hugh's sword.Reviewed by Alice Holmanof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Okay, first off: This book was unlike any thriller I've ever read. And believe me when I say, I've read many. The plot was highly intriguing, especially due to the 3-page prologue which hooked me in the beginning. But I must say, Patterson overdoes himself with the gory description. I don't like to do this but, as I read, I would strike out the gore with a dark pen. Even for an action story, methinks he went a little too far. As far as the comical stories, suspense, pacing and plot development: this book is a winner! The profanity isn't all that bad, either.PLOT: Hugh de Luc, unbeknownst possesser of a priceless Christian artifact, finds himself pursued by a nobleman who has kidnapped his wife and ravaged his village. He must gather the strength and will-power to lead his people to victory against a strong and indomitable foe, while searching for his first love...PROS: Fast-paced, action-packed, good story, sometimes humorousCONS: Too much gory detail (from time to time), profanity (I'm conservative about that)"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I've listened to two of the eight cassettes in this book, and I've finally decided to stop. I'm too bored to continue. I borrowed it from my library, and there are several people waiting to listen to it. Too bad that I can't warn the other patrons to forget it!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I usually enjoy Patterson but his one was just not able to hold my interest. It is still sitting here half finished. Maybe one of these days when I run out of reading material I will finish it."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"In The Jester, James Patterson is taking a totally new direction from his best selling previous novels, which were mostly intriguing suspense novels. My favorite novel by James Patterson is Kiss the Girls a gripping page turner about a pair of psychopathic serial murderers, one on the east coast and one on the west coast who were friends and compared notes. Kiss the Girls was also made into a movie and with the benefit of having my favorite actor(Morgan Freeman) and my favorite actress(Ashley Judd), playing leading roles, was my favorite movie of that year.Well in real life there's only so many serial killers around(one or two a year I guess) and since the market had been saturated by Patterson along with Thomas Harris, John Sanford and numerous other serial killer writers, it was time to look in a new direction. Patterson and Gross not only changed they're direction they went back in time to the late eleventh century and the age of the 1st Crusade.I am, somewhat, a student of history and having read a couple books on the vague but terribly interesting history of the Crusades, I believe the setting for this story seems well researched and very accurate.Now, in addition to being accurate about the setting I'm afraid it is also accurate about brutality and inhumanity of the age as well. If your looking for Damsels in distress and Knights in shinning armor willing to give their life for their beneficent liege lord, go buy King Arthur instead. In this book you're more likely to be killed at the hands of your maleficent liege lord.In fact, as Kiss the Girls had two predators. The Jester also has two main bad guys(two Dukes) and a cast of hundreds of other cruel murderous supporters. These local bad boys used to randomly rape, murder and burn villages in the name of the Duke. And of course that makes you feel good as our hero manages to infiltrate and turn the tables on these evil characters.But it's not that easy, and our hero goes through hell on earth, first venturing off to the Crusades for two years, where he barely escapes death numerous times, while seeing friends get massacred. Then going home only to find out his Inn (Hugh was an Innkeeper)had been burned down and his infant son, which he didn't know he had, had been thrown in the flames and his wife Sophie taken away by the marauders, to who knows where. The consensus among the villagers was that she was dead, however Hugh felt she wasn't and so he starts out on an odyssey of rescue and revenge.Along the way, Hugh manages to get gored by a boar, saved from slow death by the beautiful noble lady in waiting, Emilee, subsequently tutored in the ways of Jestering by her friend, Norbert, so he could infiltrate his perceived enemies court and thats where I need to stop and you need to read the book.I will say this though. There is something Hugh has that he picked up in the Crusades that others want. That is behind all his troubles when he returns. You could ultimately draw parallels between this story and Spartacus but the ending is happier.How does this book compare with Patterson's other books?, Well, I think kiss the Girls was better and Along Came a Spider but I liked it better than the other five or six I read, one or two of which were downright silly. One problem I had with the book was, that while certain events were suspenseful the ultimate end was transparent to me. Because of that this book is slightly below *****, rounded back up."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"James Patterson made a great transition to the Middle Ages. His plot and character development were well thought out and very interesting.This book is 180 degrees from Patterson's detective novels. However, he is a master at weaving a story that keeps the reader interested.The one enjoyable trait that Patterson has is to provide insight both from both sides. I felt like I was inside the head of both the villians and the Jester.I purchased the audio unabridged version of this book. It was very well done."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I love James Patterson and all of his books. This one was quite different from anything else hes written.

I could not put it down, there were times my heart was literally pumping to find out what was about to happen.However, I have to agree with some of the negative reviews here regarding the historical research. I seriously doubt they used &quot;modern terms&quot; when cursing and calling names. I can't count how many times the F word is delivered in a totally gratuitous manner.All in all this book WAS a good read, however, I would have been more impressed had the authors spent more time recreating and AUTHENTIC medieval setting. I felt as if they were a couple of gangly pimple faced teenagers throwing the F word in for a grin from their peers. Such attempts were poorly placed, and I was a little embarrassed at the adolescent attempt to curry favor. Such drivel is beyond the level that Patterson has before this time attained.B"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I had never read a James Patterson book before, but I picked up The Jester based on some pretty good reviews. And at the beginning of the novel, I wasn't disappointed. I was taken in by the evident exhaustive research that brought the time period alive. I felt for the characters' frustrations. And the tale of the Crusades was vivid and believable.And then things fell apart for me. As soon as Hugh returns to his village, the whole story started sounding like a Movie of the Week, rather than a story of historical intrigue. Too many convenient coincidences, too much of a 21st Century mentality thrust upon a 12th Century setting. By the end of the novel, I was rolling my eyes in disbelief, thinking, &quot;This would have NEVER happened!&quot; It seemed that the second half of the book was nothing but a lot of hackneyed plot twists and half-baked &quot;surprises&quot; that I could predict from a mile away.I finished the book, only just.

It is a shame that after citing all these history books they will sit and write a book without a factual check.For those who have no idea what I am talking about: Turks got into Asia Minor (Anatolia) in the year 1071 and they were no where near the first Crusaders. They might have been in the Muslim armies fighting against the Crusaders but calling the Muslims \\"Turks\\" is a grave error for these authors who claim to write according to historical facts.I am great fan of historical novels but this book definitely doesn't fall into that category."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I was skeptical of the Jester as I started reading it, but I did enjoy the story and it left me wanting more at the end just as his other books have.

One thing I do need to point out is that they never said they found the lance in the jester's grave - it was because of the stories that it was mentioned that it belonged to a jester (it was found in the duke's grave).Also, if you are complaining about 2-3 page chapters, then you are not familiar with James Patterson's books - most of his books are written that way and for me, it keeps me turning pages - you keep saying, &quot;oh, just one more chapter&quot;, but then you end up reading more."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Poor innkeeper Hugh returns from the First Crusade tired of battle and looking forward to retirement from war, only to find his son dead and his wife Sophie has been kidnapped. Hugh has no time to recover from conflict; he must infiltrate the duke's castle and court to find his beloved, only to discover an underlying evil which will change his life. Highly recommended, The Jester, offers the reader fast-paced action and drama making for an involving historical fiction piece."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"As an avid Patterson fan, I picked up Jeter with glee. I was not expecting War and Peace and my expectations were fulfilled. I did find , however, a most enjoyable read. Patterson & Gross made me care about the character Hugh (the Jester), which is more than I can say about many more 'learned' novels. I found the historical aspects of the novel quite accurate, even though liberties were taken of behalf of the story. I was reminded of the Danny Kaye movie, The Court Jester, which has a similar plot. I could see a younger Steve Martin playing Hugh and Alan Rickman as one of the evil nobleman. I hope they make the movie. The novel was highly entertaining and those that berate it are just being overly critical.If you want an engrossing story that keeps you turning the pages,this is it. The historical setting is great and it gives you some insight about the period and its horrors. Perhaps our video-game wars have made us insensitive to the reality of killing other people. In any event, regardless of your politics, I would highly recommend this novel. I hope there are more Jester adventures."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I like historical novels. I had never read a book by this author, but thought I would chance it, given the subject matter. I may never finish it, though, because the writing is awful. The dialogue is especially bad. I would guess that it is written for, or by, an adolescent. Pass it up."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"The jester is an entertaining book while at the same time extremely forgettable. We follow the Jester Hugh as he tries to lead a revolt against royalty, find true love, and preserve a religious artifact.Every thing about this novel is formula driven and there are no surprises. Even the historical detail wasn't that fascinating because it was so narrow in scope. This story could have been set in the 21st century and it would have worked just as well (with a few modifications). This book is more in-depth that some of Patterson's efforts and the characters aren't as dumb as Alex Cross has become. Read this if you have the time, otherwise, don't."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Strange things are afoot with James Patterson's writing. He was once one of the greatest suspense novelists in the game, his books rivaling those of Sandford, Cornwell, and Grisham. Today however, quality has taken a backseat to quantity, and the suspense simply isn't there. His new \\"partner writing\\" trick is not serving him well, and all apprentices should be fired immediately. As for the whole premise of the book, it sounds like something out of a bad romance novel you'd see in the Harlequin section at Wal-Mart. This man is supposed to be writing detective stories, not books about men gallovanting across the countryside looking for their lady.The Jester begins in a small French village in the early days of the Crusades. Our hero, Hugh leaves his wife to join the fight against the nobility. In the first 100 pages of introduction, he meets several semi-interesting souls, who stay with him throughout the book. When he returns home, he learns that his wife was kidnapped by the evil right hand man of a king. In order to get her back, he sets off toward his castle. Along the way, he meets a young woman who aids him on his quest. With her help, he infiltrates the fortress where his wife is being held under the guise of the court jester.Weighing in at nearly 500 pages, the novel is far too long. The descriptions of every last minute detail are not needed, and take forever to get through. This could be forgiven if the storyline were not so completely predictable. Roughly halfway through the book, a light bulb goes off above the reader's head, and the story turns out just as everyone expects it to.Do yourself a favor and pass on this one. If you insist upon reading it, get it at your local library, it's not worth the paper it's printed on!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Noting this book on the NY Times bestseller list, the setting captured my imagination. I sent for a copy and was surprised and disconcerted by the number of modern slang phrases liberally used throughout. The first person pov was well suited to the mood of the story, but he sounded more like a petulant adolescent than a full grown man. The obvious author switch was also jolting, as their styles jog from chapter to chapter scarcely allowing the reader to catch up. I read &quot;Just Ella&quot; by Margaret Peterson Haddix right after finishing Jester. I was struck by how much better this juvenile fiction piece was written. It is about what happens to Cinderella after the ball. My advice is to save your money and buy the Haddix book."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I picked this book out from the library to read over vacation and I thought it was great. I loved the settings, characters, plot, everything! I highly reccomend this book."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"This is the first book I've read by Patterson, and it's unlike the others he's written, I'm told. If you like historical fiction, you'll love this book. It's also a page turner! The only thing I didn't like about it was the very graphic descriptions of fighting, killing, murdering, etc. The characters are very memorable and it gives a good insight into what it might have been like to live in the year 1096!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I'm not sure why a lot of the ratings are so low on this book. It does start out slow and kinda dragged on for the first 50 pages but after that it was full of suspence, action, and intrique. I suggest reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It was a treat for me to open this book and read it every day. I felt like it was a gift and a surprise every day. I loved the story, the characters, the whole mideval thing. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"if james patterson insists on letting other people write his books he should at least give them some free reign. maybe someone can take it into a less predictable direction. Except for \\"The Beach House\\" and \\"First to Die\\" all Patterson's books are basically one plot with the same hollow characters."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Patterson did some research and put together a story that I thought was a page turner. I have read all his books but I have to say this one, in my opinion, is one of his best. This is not the usual Patterson read, but this book shows how diverse a writer he is.I will say one thing, this book is not for the squimish type. So if you do read \\"The Jester\\" expect a lot of blood and guts and then some.I highly recommend this book to all of the Patterson fans."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I have read many of Patterson's law enforcement thrillers, and much historical fiction. This attempt by Mr. Patterson and Mr. Gross lacks the imagination, suspense, character development, and detailed historical landscape that comes so brilliantly to the likes of Umberto Eco, Iain Pears, and Michael Faber. The Jester is, quite honestly, BORING, predictable, preposterous, and uninspired. Patterson's Hugh De Luc is not the least bit original--he is stale. The development of this main character lacks direction and never really changes. How tiring is it to read, every time Hugh is in a jam, \\"I knew I was going to die\\"? In spite of the tragedies that befell Hugh, he never truly garnered a sympathetic emotion from this reader. The foreshadowing in the early chapters is obvious, making each page thereafter bromidic. The plot can best be decribed as \\"moth-eaten\\", though I won't detail the formulary to those who may still be interested in reading this book (they will know it within a few pages anyway). Of the hundreds of terrific reads in the genre of historical fiction/suspense, Patterson's latest is certainly not one of them. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"Although I have never read any books by this particular author, the concept of the story was very interesting to me. Like several other reviews, I also felt the child slayings at the start of book were almost enough to put it down.I was dissapoionted at the lack of time spent on the developemnt of the main chatacter's &quot;pretext&quot;, as a Jester.I did feel the last 100 pages were the best and most interesting.This story is a very quick and average read."},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"In 1096, French innkeeper Hugh de Luc joins the Crusades in an effort to obtain his freedom from his nasty overlord Lord Baldwin. However, he finds the war not to be anything like he expected as he witnesses atrocities on both sides as they crazily trek for seemingly endless miles towards Jerusalem with no end in sight. Unable to cope, Hugh deserts.He returns home with some treasures he took from the Holy Land only to learn that Baldwin abducted his beloved wife and murdered his son. Wanting to liberate his spouse and avenge his child's murder, Hugh masquerades as a JESTER to gain entrance into his enemy's castle. However, he meets a noblewoman, who he begins to love, which sidetracks Hugh from his quest. Meanwhile his foe seeks him out based on a rumor that Hugh brought back the holiest of relics. As his village is ravaged by Baldwin's thugs who search for him, Hugh starts a counterrevolution to destroy the noble or die trying.JESTER is entertaining very colorful historical fiction tale that vividly brings to life the late eleventh century. The tale strips away the romanticizing of the Crusades, laying bare a vicious war. The characters engage the audience whether they are an everyman like Hugh forced into heroics or a vile villain like Baldwin. James Patterson's myriad of fans and anyone who appreciates an enjoyable medieval tale will want to read this delightful novel co-authored with Andrew Gross (see SECOND CHANCE).Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Jester","review":"I was pleasantly surprised, that Patterson wrote quite an intriguing historical yarn, and I think he captured that century well. It is a time when the Knight Templars startet building their famous gothic cathedrals with holy geometry and holy geomantic in France, when they amassed fortunes coming back from the Holy Land. The jester has his own agenda of course, and his fight has merits. A very well written novel.

Pack the car with baggage, food, and the kids. Head for fun and relaxation. But first, prepare for the hours on the road. Make the most of the time with Joy Ride; Faith-filled Fun &amp; Games for Drivetime by Jacqueline Lederman. The games, discussion starters, and Bible challenges will enable you to interact happily with your children. As an added bonus, even you may learn new information (Oh yeah - it might be a good idea to bring your Bible along on the trip.)For ease of use, the author has indexed activities by interest, trip destination, and topic. Plan to stick this paperback book in your glove compartment before you leave on vacation."},{"Title":"Joy Ride! #1 (Heritage Builders)","review":"During family car trips, children are notorious for asking the perennial question, \\"How much longer until we get there?\\" Now whether you are shuttling kids to a soccer game or on a long cross-country car vacation with the family, here's a valuable resource to turn your hours on the road into a valuable learning experience.JOY RIDE!, FAITH-FILLED FUN AND GAMES FOR DRIVETIME by Jaqueline Lederman (Tyndale House Publishers) is a part of the Heritage Builders series. Targeted for all ages of children, this book is packed with ideas. As the author writes, \\"The goal of this book is to provide families with a good Christian growth resource for use in the car.\\" The information is divided into three sections: games, discussion starters and Bible challenges.The travel games help children learn new information and also use creative thinking to stretch children spiritually. As for keeping score, the author suggests you do what works for your child. If scoring and prizes motivate the child to play, then use it. The discussion starters contain several sections--jump start (to set the scene for discussion), speeding up (follow-up questions to continue the discussion), look at the map (a Bible verse to bring it into the conversation) and travel plan (the personal application section where children relate it to their lives). The final section, Bible Challenge, has three levels of difficulty: Easy, Moderate and Hard. No matter which type of question, the answers are included in the book and everyone in the family can increase their Bible knowledge from these challenges.The author includes a caution in the introduction to this book, \\"You are wise not to make every trip in the car into a Bible learning time, and not to make every game or discussion end with a pointed moral lesson. Use your drivetimes to develop your relationships with your children and find out how they are doing, how their friends are, what they're up to, and so on.\\"This tool has potential for overuse but can be invaluable for every family with the right balance.

As I first opened it I noticed it is very colorful which is a great thing and the guide was very helpful. The only cons are that it is very thin with 112 pages. I was dissapointed at how short the secrets section was though. Overall, I'd say any Joe fan that needs help to beat that hard boss or just to read it for fun should pick it up because it is very colorful and detailed."},{"Title":"The Person Reborn","review":"In the person reborn one finds the remarkably clear understanding of both the human psyche and soul that Paul Tournier has gained from a lifetime of experience as a practicing psychiatrist and disciple of Christ Jesus. A must read for Christians in the field and anyone who is fascinated by the gray area between religion, belief, and the mind."},{"Title":"Elizabeth Appleton","review":"ASIN B000NXI7EU - Elizabeth Appleton (nee Webster) is the wife of John, a rising star among the faculty at Spring Valley, a college in Spring Valley, Pennsylvania. Elizabeth comes from a wealthy family while John... John does not. She's just in love enough to give up a lot to be with her husband and he's more than enough in love to want to support her without her family's money. Elizabeth's sister, Jean, arrives for a visit and is caught up, by several characters, on the goings-on about the small college town. It is partly through those tellings, and where those stories naturally lead, that the reader gets taken back to the beginning of Elizabeth and John's courtship and brought all the way to the current day.John is being considered for a promotion that would, for the most part, be the first important \\"win\\" of his life. Elizabeth, meanwhile, has conducted an on-again off-again affair that frees her to be more than someone's wife and that appeals to her intellectual side. Still, she knows that she's not going to be leaving her husband any time soon - unless, that is, he happened to have something of his own, some important \\"win\\" that would give him some esteem and self-esteem. Everything you'd expect from a romance novel set in a college town is here: politicking and back-stabbing, gossip and jealousy.Not everyone is going to love this book. If you're a romance reader, especially of modern romances, you have a certain expectation of sex scenes that will not be met here. Here, for example, is the first sex scene between young Elizabeth and John:'The moment had come and there was no more to say. He got up and sat beside her on the wicker sofa. He kissed her and they stretched out together. He put his knee between her legs and she caught her breath in the new excitement. Soon he had his unresisting hand wherever he wanted it to be, and she whispered to him, \\"I can't stop now. John, I can't stop. You have to do it, but be careful.\\"\\"We have to take a chance,\\" he said.\\"All right, all right we'll take a chance,\\" she said. \\"Yes, let's take a chance. Oh, my darling. It is over for you?\\"\\"Yes,\\" he said.'Seriously, that's it. Of course, the book was written in the early 1960s, long before steamy sex scenes became widely accepted. The setting of the 1950s-1960s works the other way, too. A reader in, say, their 40s, will actually have to pause to let this sink in: These characters are your parents' age. A reader in their 20s might have a really hard time thinking that these characters are their GRANDparents' age. The book, read now, certainly makes me look back at my family tree with a different notion of who those people were before I came along.It's well-written, risqu&eacute; for the time and, most of all, heartbreaking. Author John O'Hara makes it very tough to root for one particular winner, which keeps you in suspense because no matter how things turn out, whether or not John gets his \\"win,\\" you know that someone is going to lose. It makes you want to read the last few pages the way you might watch a gruesome movie scene - with your hands over your face, peering cautiously out between your fingers.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"Teens Can Bounce Back","review":"Do you worry about teenagers today? News headlines blare with teen tragedies from small towns to major cities.

Sometimes a young person just needs to know that someone else has made it through what he or she is facing. Teens Can Bounce Back provides that heart-to-heart encouragement. This book can be a perfect graduation present or every day faith lifter."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"This is a golden classic piece of children's literature that EVERYONE should read at least once, and this text is quite good.In this story, the Polynesian boy, Mafatu, who has always been afraid of the sea -- a serious handicap for a child who lives on an island, and amidst a people who worship courage -- goes forth, alone, with only his pet dog and albatross, in a stolen canoe and makes his way to a deserted island to prove his courage agaainst the sea creatures, the animals on the land (wild boars, for instance), and the sea itself. And, overshadowing all, is Mafatu's one terrible discovery -- the island he is currently on is a sacred ritual meeting place for cannibals!Can Mafatu prove himself, construct a new canoe (his old one was lost) and flee before the dreaded \\"eaters-of-men\\" return and exact a terrible revenge upon him for profaning their \\"motu tabu\\" -- the Forbidden Island?---There are a few typo's (very few, and very far between) -- a \\"runtogether\\" word on occasion, for example, or the word \\"galaxies\\" spelled with two \\"l\\"s (\\"gallaxies\\"), and the like. But otherwise excellent.My main complaint with this Kindle version -- and the reason I only gave it four stars instead of five -- is that apart from the front and back covers, THIS BOOK IS NOT ILLUSTRATED in any way whatsoever.In PRINTED versions, there are at least two possible sets of drawings for this book, depending on which illustrator is doing whichever printed version you have (I believe one set was done by Mr. Armstrong Sperry himself); both sets are REALLY excellent; and neither one is included in this Kindle edition. While this probably accounts for this Kindle edition's extremely low cost, it is a definite trade-off -- I would very gladly have paid a LOT more in exchange for a full set of illustrations.Overall, though, a truly excellent value, and I do recommend its purchase!"},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"The book was enjoyable.

You haven't, I'm going to tell you a summary and what I think about it. There was a boy \`'Mafatu'' that went out to the sea with his dog ''Uri'' to proof his courage. He went there because everyone thought he was afraid of the sea. On the way he lost his knife, and almost lost his dog, when he got to the island he found another one. But there weren't any people. He had to fight lots giant animals. He had to hunt his food and take care of his self, and when he went home he would proof his courage. I think that it is a good book because it shows people that you should face your fears, and not be afraid. I think he was scared to go out to the sea alone. I know I would be scared. It didn't matter how old he was, he still tried to face his fears. I think this book should be graded a 5 because I think it encourages us to not be afraid any more. To face what were scared of. If you are a person that wants to proof your courage, than you should read this book. That is what I think about this book."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"This is a book about survival.

It's just like Robinson Crusoe and Swiss Family Robinson. Those were both good books. Now I read this and I thought Robinson Crusoe and Swiss Family Robinson is better.

He can't contact anyone. So he is stuck on the island and he has nobody to talk to and nothing to eat.One day, he meets a guy named Uri. He helps him find food and shelter. They worked together and so they found a bunch of birds one day because one of the birds the kid remembered from his tribe place. Then, one day, people found him because he started to yell and scream and they took him back to the tribe's place. They were happy that they found him. The Tribe Leader was happy to see him the most.

It also told about how Mafatu had courage and how he was brave and strong after his mother was taken by the sea. This book was full of adventure.The best part of the book was when Mafatu found the statue on the forbidden island. He was walking through the woods and was surprised to find this statue in the middle of nowhere.The two story elements that were the most vivid were the theme and the characters. The theme was cconguering your fear. Mafatu needed to face his fears of survive on his own. He was successful throughout the story. The author did a good job of describing Mafatu and the people he met. I was able to see in my mind what each person looked like."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"I was introduced to this book when my teacher read it to the class when I was in grade 2 or 3.

Say what you will, but it made me bawl my eyes out, and I was 15! Obviously, it was below my reading level, but that's no reason not to read this book.

This book has a good moral but too much foreshadowing. You can easily guess how things will work out. Also, what's with the cliffhanger at the end? Is Mafatu dead, unconscious, or just exhausted? Sperry just cuts it off and gives some background information. I'm just unimpressed by this book and I don't recommend it."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"This book, which was first copyrighted in 1940, is still a good coming-of-age adventure, except for ONE BIG PROBLEM: racist imagery. The people the young South Seas islander hero must outwit and outrun in order to return to his homeland are terrifying \\"blacks,\\" \\"savages,\\" \\"eaters-of-men.\\" This stereotyped characterization might have been acceptable to some in 1940, but society has since come to realize the harm it can cause to Black children's self-image and other children's attitudes toward Black people. To ethically introduce this book to a child requires either blacking out offending words (!) or prefacing and interspersing the reading with lessons in sociology and history, and even then, there's no assurance that damage won't be done. Why take the chance when there are so many other good books out there?Newberry-awarded books engender such trust.

There was nothing in it you could relate to. You couldn't tell if the main character was in the stone age or if he was an Indian. The author made the story line very flat and un-entertaining. If you like books on survival, I might reccomend it, but it is nothing compared to books like _Hatchet_."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"This book is sOOoOoooOoOoOo boring...I practically fell asleep~!!!

It was plodding and it only got a little bit interesting at the end. And I can't believe Call it Courage got the John Newbery Medal~!!! That is so not right.

As he approaches the edge of manhood, his fear prevents him from winning a place in his community. Realizing their indifference to him, he sets out to sea alone in his canoe, taking only his dog and a few tools. That night he is caught in a storm, in which he loses his paddle and all his tools, and he washes up on an island where cannibals are known to live. He builds a shelter and canoe and chooses to survive; while living there he kills an octopus, a boar, and a shark, and faces the human terror of ritualistic cannibals, barely escaping with his life. At the end of his journey he returns to his village having proved himself a man.The story is set in a mythical Polynesia, but is written in a European voice: at one point the author describes a canoe caught in a current \\"like a millrace,\\" a term which is decidedly foreign to this island culture. The great weakness of this book is that the tribal societies which provide a backdrop for the story are caricatured: The tribal fishermen represent noble savages, living so close to nature that they become \\"ill at ease, charged... with an almost animal awareness of impending storm\\" (3). Conversely, the cannibal tribe represent a class of wordless, brutal primitives -- dancing with oiled bodies, beating drums around fires and stone idols, wailing, and shouting with guttural voices. Mafatu appeals throughout the story to Maui, \\"god of the Fishermen,\\" and repeatedly challenges his nemesis Moana, the Sea God. Sperry's Maui, however, hardly resembles the Polynesian trickster named Maui, and the Moana of the story is only a personification of the sea (In some of the languages \\"moana\\" does mean sea or ocean.)No one having read this book should believe they have learned anything about the real Polynesia -- it is no more a story about Polynesia than Little Red Riding Hood is about the European forest. Notwithstanding this, if a reader can accept that Call it Courage is a lesson not in history but in moral courage, they may benefit from the moral example this hero represents. Although Mafatu is limited by his youth and inexperience, he faces great dangers and survives, facing down one fear after another. By making critical choices under pressure, and by refusing to succumb to the elemental, animal, spiritual and human forces arrayed against him, he finally wins his victory. This coming of age is an accomplishment any young boy can aspire to."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"I really liked this book because it was about a boy that wanted to change is life.. that wanted to take a chance and face his fear of the sea.. although at first it didn't go very well, it was all worth it in the end. It kinda makes you look at your life and fears that you have and makes you want to face those fears and over come them. but in another way it makes you want to never give up on what you are trying to accomplish at that point in you life.. and to never give up, becasuse it will be worth it in the end. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone, because it teaches you a good lesson in your life and i really listened to it, and i hope that anyone that reads this book will listen to it to. I liked that he had a bird that followed him around and a dog that never left his side, it's like the dog had an idea in his head that he was suppost to stay with him and never leave his side, through thick and thin.. kinda like a friend, but only he couldn't talk back. i think that this book deserved the newbery Medal award, because it was really good."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"A South Pacific hurricane nearly killed Mafatu, a Polynesian Island boy, when he was three. Currents from the impending storm had carried the canoe that his mother navigated out to sea, where the hurricane-sized waves capsized it. Clinging to the outrigger pole, Mafatu's mother managed to fight off sharks and dehydration long enough to reach a coral reef after several days adrift: \\"At hand lay a cracked coconut; the woman managed to press the cool, sustaining meat to her child's lips before she died\\" [p10]. Ever since, Mafatu was afraid of the sea.This book was originally written in 1940 and is illustrated by the author. It's five chapters are subtitled \\"Flight\\", \\"The Sea\\", \\"The Island\\", \\"Drums\\", and \\"Homeward\\". It is a Rite of Passage story where Mafatu is teased and taunted by his mates because of his fear of the sea. Eventually Mafatu can no longer tolerate the jeers nor the silent contempt that his dad holds for him, and he sets off in a canoe with his two pals - a dog and albatross, to run away from the island of taunts.Out in the Pacific Ocean, a storm and its currents grab the boy's craft taking it on an unknown course while its waves rob the craft of its stores and supplies. Mafatu and his dog, Uri, are battered at storm's end and the albratross, Kivi, must step up and guide the gang to land - The Island. Exploring the island, he discovers it is used by the \\"eaters-of-men\\" to make sacrifices to a statue - he had landed on Forbidden Island!The remainder of the book is about how Mafatu comes of age while learning to survive and be resourceful. When he and his dog eventually return to their home island with the eaters-of-men in hot pursuit most of the way, they return (thanks to Kivi's navigational assistance) to a see a cold father no longer cold and jeering villagers no longer jeering. Mafatu, the Stout Heart, has proved he has earned his name."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"Call it Courage was written by Armstrong Sperry.

Great choice for the narrator."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"A great adventure book, of a young man who suffers a tragedy and then conquers his worst fears. He is an islander living a simple exhistance, when his fishermanfather is killed by a shark. After that he is afraid of the sea and deemed useless by the villagers that live off the sea. He gets lost on a deserted island and must learn to fend for himself. The villagers all assume that this clumsy boy could not make it one day on his own, but he does very well indeed. His Robinson Crusoe-like adventure is one that folks like us could not survive, since he was more prepared than we could ever hope to be since his people lived off the land and sea already. By the way, in 1972 the Walt Disney studio made a very very nice live action version of this for their weekly tv show and you can do a search for the vhs version and get a used copy here at Amazon."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"Mafatu, whose name means Stout Heart, is a 12- year-old Polynesian boy living on the rocky atoll of Hikueru. As a child he watched his mother drown; ever since he has been a prisoner of the understandable terrors of his maritime environment. Worse still, his fear of fishing has embarrassed his father, the chief, for all the village knows that his son is a cowawrd. Desptie his nimble fingers and quick mind, he seems fit only for woman's work, yet his heart burns with shame at the vicious taunting of the other boys and his father's humiliation. He longs to redeem himself in the eyes of his people and earn the his father's pride.This book has been a classic tale of survival for over 50 years, yet I had not heard of it until I found a Pb version. It read swiftly, albeit with little dialgoue. I wish the author had gone into more depth about how Mafatu fashioned the tools he neded to survive on the small island. It was interesting to learn about the man-eaters and their most sacred taboo: scacrifices to a monstrous stone idol on the Forbidden Island. The island that saved his life after a gruelling ocean voyage could prove his deathtrap.This slim volunme is appealing because it presents a young boy with a clearly-defined dream: to return in triumph as a brave warrior to his people. He has to clarify his goal and work out the details of each step in the process, but the arrival of the cannibals is ill-timed. He must face and conquer his fears of the ocean; he reveals the spirituality of this Pre-Columbian people by praying often to Maui. When threatened by elements of the sea, he hurls challenges to Moana, whom he feel has been stalking him since he almost drowned at the age of three. I admrie his courage to defend his faithful canine companion and the many times he must overcome real terror at his own physical peril, to achieve a greater goal. His will to live and ingenuity are a great inspiration; this story shows that even pre teens are capable of great achievement."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"Call it Courage is about a young boy named Mafatu.

The author did not do a good job explaining the part about Mafatu's mother. He could have told were she was born what she looked like and her hair color.

For shelter he builds a hut of bamboo and in case he needs a quick get away he starts building another canoe.

My favorite part was when he was on the deserted island and he had to fend for himself. I liked it when he set a trap for fish, made a knife and found a spear, killed a big shark and a boar and an octopus. This took place in the middle of the story. The setting is on an island near Australia. This story is encouraging because Mafatu, the main character, developed all kinds of courage. Read the book and find out how."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"As a boy, I dreamed of adventure. I ran through the woods fighting imaginary enemies, carving bows and arrows, erecting lean-tos and tents. I loved the outdoors, with all its beauty and danger. \\"Call it Courage\\" was one of my favorite books as a preteen, capturing these dreams in exotic and hair-raising fashion.Mafatu is a 15 year old boy, whose name means \\"Stout Heart,\\" and yet he is anything but courageous. After a harrowing experience in his early years, he fears the sea and endures the ridicule of his father and his island people. Determined to grow up, Mafatu sets out with his dog, Uri, and an albatross, named Tivi, to face the wild sea and all that it contains. In a canoe, he rides the waves, survives a hurricane, and finds himself on another island where the eaters-of-man seem to come for their dark dances and rituals.As Mafatu becomes a man himself, he knows his time is dwindling before the eaters-of-man return and threaten his survival. If he is to be victorious, he must conquer his old fears and despair, fighting creatures of the deep, as well as those who walk the earth. In so doing, he has the chance of being accepted by his people back home--or going down in story as the fearful one.The writing is descriptive, timeless, and beautiful. The characters are few, but rich in portrayal. The settings are unlike most we ever read of in books, and in rereading this, my heart once again raced as Mafatu faced the hammerhead shark, the wild pig, the giant octopus, and the angry ocean. This book is a classic, and for good reason."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"I just stumbled upon this book and I was absolutely blown away as I had never heard of this book before. I even got my father to read it and he loved it. This is a book for all ages and something for everyone to love and appreciate."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"Like the majority of other reviewers, I was struck by the excitement and adventure of this story. While the exotic setting surely plays its part in drawing the reader deeper into the tale, it is also the underdog nature of the story's main character, Mafatu (Stout Heart). The reader will surely identify with the inner nature of all humans to challenge the personal fears that we hold within us. Mafatu actualizes these challenges in his conflicts with the sea, personified in the Tahitian sea god, Moana. With his two animal companions, Uri, the dog, and Kivi, the albatross, Mafatu sets out to overcome his fears, to grow into a new and mature person. Young and older readers will learn much about Polynesian cultures and even learn some Tahitian language. There is also a spiritual part of this story which has often been overlooked by others. Mafatu constantly prays to and gives thanks for his survival, well being, and growth to Maui, the Polynesian god of the fishermen, who like the Greek Prometheus is responsible for giving fire to humankind. In the end, with the help of his animal friends, he is able to courageously and ingeniously overcome all of the internal and external challenges and thereby rightfully claim his meaningful name.One caveat is that the \\"eaters-of-men,\\" i.e., cannibals, are made out to be black, irrational and dangerous. While the story is simply a story that was first published in 1940, some youngsters may come away from the story with a distorted view of race."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"Call it Courage by Armstrong Sperry is the story of a boy named Mafatu who was afraid of the sea.

It is very predictable and I would recommend it to younger kids."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"Call it courage is a well thought out book. It is about a boy name Mafatu. His mother died in the sea because she did not listen to the fishermen&#65533;s warnings to her. His homeland called him a coward because he was afraid of the sea. So when he was feed up with the teasing he left to prove himself worthy and gain respect from his father. You will have to read the book to find out what happens to Mafatu during his journey. I would recommend this book to people that love the sea. Keep in mind that about 2 chapters out of 5 are about the time he was in the sea. But it was adventurous. You used for shadowing to guess what would happen. One thing I did not like about the book was that the boy always won his battles. He needs defeat to so he does not think he can win every battle or obstacle he comes to."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"The book I read was Call it Courage. It was written by Armstrong Sperry. My favorite part was when Mako and Alfa got stuck on the island. The part that was the worst to me was when Mako was made fun of. My favorite character was Mako. He was brave and had courage when he challenged the shark and got stuck on the island. The story took place on an island. I learned that if you are scared of something you should face your fear. I would recommend this book to a friend."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"The book i read was called The Thief by Megan Whalen Turner. This book is set up for the midieval times because they dont use guns very often. Instead they fight with swords and ride horses. I like this book because it was very well depicted by the author, and thats why I gae it five stars. The plot of the story begins shortly after telling about the main character named Gen. gen gets into trouble when he bragged about stealing the king's seal and gets chained up to a wall in the prison.The magus comes and asks Gen if will come with him to steal a valuable item. Oh yes and Gen's faveorite thing to say is &quot;I can steal anything&quot;. Well they set off to Attolia the neighboring country in wich the item was hidden. Gen almost ges killed once but the magus and his traveling companions take him to Ediss the neutral country between Attolia and Sounis. Well i don't want to to ruin the book far anyone so I think you should read this book yourself so I don't ruin it for you all. Well i hope you like the book and an interesting fact is that this book won a newberry award in 1997."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"The book Call it Courage by Armstrong Sperry is so boring that it actually takes courage to turn the page. Although a short book, it feels like eternity in written word. The story plot of Mafatu the boy who was afraid, and his \\"wild\\" adventures on maneating island, is so slow, and barely grasps attention. Instead of an urge to read all the way to the end nonstop, you are greeted with an urge to throw the book at an unexpecting person, then stomp all over it. I pity those who attempt to read it."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"This book was the dumbest book I have read.It made me mad how poorly this book was made. ... I can't beleive the bird would follow him to the canibal island. This book was just a waste of time. ... I did not like the kid's name (Mafatu). The dogs name being(Uri) the dumbest name I ever read. ..."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"This book was awful. In it, a boy named Mafatu runs away from his island home to prove he is brave. He lands on some island somewhere, and from then on it is a total yawn. However, it _is_ better than Island of the Blue Dolphins, though that isn't saying much."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"This book is not exciting. But I felt that CalL it Courage had some good ideas. This book had some boing ideas and needed to tell more about his characters. let me tel ou a little about the author. I think that the author should tell more about Mafatu's mother, becausee ifArmstrong Sperry told her name and maybe what she looked like it might have described Mafatu better. Armstrong Sperry should have told more ideas about all his characters. He could have at least given specific hair and eye color. Some parts of this book were exciting and some were not. Like the prt when Mafatu kills the octopus and save his dog. Now this book was not a book that a lot of people would like to read. If you want action in your book do not read this."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"I think this book was very intersting. The boy thought he could not do anything because he was scared of the ocean. If I was a person in the story, would of thought well, I'm scared of something too,so it wouldn't matter to me if he was scared of the ocean. If I were him I wouldn't of let all of those people make fun of me. He was very courageous to kill that shark, i don't think I could of done that! If i were a person who got to pick the greatest books ever, one of them would Be &quot;Call It Courage&quot;"},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"A suspenceful book that was very exciting but was short and not in detail in the best parts."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"This book is simply a classic. Its about a kid who proves he isn't the wimp his whole village thinks he is. He becomes a true man and wins the hearts of his whole family. Great reading for an Middle School student, though, not very captivating for adults."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"I first read this book while in the third grade. Its imagery stuck in my mind for more than 25 years, so I recently picked up a paperback version and re-read it. Mafatu's adventure -- and the point behind it -- were just as I remembered. And I saw in retrospect how his example taught me early on to confront my fears head-on. I was afraid of heights, but have mastered rock climbing. I was shy, and got involved in theatre. This is what children's literature should be!"},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"Mafatu was known as The Boy Who Was Afraid,so he went off to an island he had lots of adventures.He found out that the Eaters Of Men had come,he had to escape!!!Uri,(his dog) and Kivi,(hs bird)went along with him throughout the journey.Horror,curiosity,action,all in one!!!"},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"When Mafatu was a small boy he almost drowned in the sea.

So he runs away to a nearby island and when he came home his tribe was proud of him"},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"This is an exciting adventure of a boy who tries to find peace in his soul. Ever since Mafatu's mother died in a great Hurricane he has been terrified by the sea. He has long been tormented by the other people on his island, despite the fact that he is the chiefs son. Mafatu lives on a small island. Being afraid of the water is not a normal thing at all for those who live there. He is scared that the sea god named Moana will kill him, like his mother. Fed up with his father's great shame he decides to take on the ocean. He sails away and runs into a very big storm, but he suprisingliy survives. When he lands on an island he finds some people have inhabited them. These are called the eaters of men. In other words they are canibles. After a while he eventually escapes and heads back to his own island. This book was okay but it was pretty boring especially for its number of pages. I wouldn't greatly recomend it unless you are a great reader and you like adventure."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"This book is about a young boy named Mafatu that has lost his mother to a terrible sea accident. Ever since he has feared the sea. Due to this is is constantly being made fun of. While the other boys are out in their canoes he is helping make nets back on land. Mafatu decides to run away and face his fear. He takes his dog Uri and sets off to sea. He lands on an island and here learns what it takes to conquer the sea and has wonderful adventures that help build his courage. I enjoyed this book and it was very easy to read."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"This short book by Sperry (1897-1976) won the 1941 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. Mafatu, a Polynesian boy of 15 years old, has an intense fear of the ocean. At the age of three he was nearly killed when his mother drowned. Now he must conquer his fears. He goes off on his own and finds the courage within him. The story (probably for ages 9 to 13) starts off on the island of Hikueru in the Tuamotu Archipelago east of Tahiti at a time before European ships and missionaries had arrived. Apparently, Sperry, who had traveled throughout the South Pacific, based his story on an old and true Polynesian tale."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"Robert Heinlein once wrote that &quot;Courage is not the absence of fear--it is the conquest of fear. The man who is truly fearless is not courageous. He is also a fool.&quot; Young Mafatu, a Polynesian islander, fears the ocean. This is something akin to a cowboy fearing cattle. His fear causes him a great deal of discomfiture and makes him an object of scorn and ridicule.Sperry tells the story of how Mafatu (which means &quot;Stout Heart&quot;) faced and conquered his fear. I read the story some 40 years ago as a young child. Although I wasn't really searching for anything other than the subject matter for a book report, I came away from &quot;Call it Courage&quot; with something far more important than a long-forgotten grade.Simply, elegantly, Sperry explores the nature of courage and helps the young reader to come to a better understanding of that most misunderstood quality."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"The story of Mafatu's adventure on the isle of the eaters of men is unforgettable. Some 30 years ago I first encountered this book in my elementary school library and it remains vivid in my memory. It is the story of a young boy, Mafatu, who lives on an island yet fears the sea that killed his mother years ago. Mafatu decides to face his greatest and deepest fear--the sea--and sets off on an adventure, ending up not only conquering his fear of the sea but successfully confronting such life-threatening challenges as a hammerhead shark, a sharp-tusked wild boar and, finally, angry man-eating islanders. It is the kind of story where just when you think things can't get worse, they do. But Mafatu finds out that he is able to overcome every challenge and returns to his home island in triumph.Mafatu's story should be required reading for children preparing to face a world every bit as dangerous as the open ocean and filled with hazards no less serious than sharks and cannibals."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"call it courage is one of the best books for any person who likes a good short book.The book is about a young boy named Mafatu his name maens stout heart. Everyone in the village he lives in thinks he is scaredbut he fces his fears and proves his courage in the end. When he battles feirce storms and wild man eating people on a strange island.If you are interested in this book you will have to read it yourself."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"Call It Courage is about a boy named Mafatu that lives on an island called Hikueru. Mafatu's father is the cheif of Hikueru. All of the boys on the island went on fishing trips out in the sea, but Mafatu never went fishing. He was afraid of the water. When he was three years old his mother took him out to sea to look for sea urchins. While they were out on the water a hurricane hit and his mother drowned. Mafatu overhears some boy's talking about him, so, accompanied by his dog, Uri, goes out to sea to try and prove himself.I liked this book because it was descriptive, so I could easily picture in my mind what was going on. I liked it also because of the intensity in the storms. There are many adventurous parts to this story. I hope you like it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"At least in me. I read this book in 3rd grade or so, and loved it. Its more or less a Robinson Curose for very young readers. It follows a young boy as he leaves home to prove himself in the Islands, and how he uses his skills and brains to prevail against all odds. This was one of my favorite books growing up, and encouraged me to learn as much in the way of practiacl skills as possible, even if it wasn't cool, or was somehting that boys arent supposed to learn. Hey, cooking, laundry, and sewing come in handy when you go to college.And I'm not really 12, I just didn't want the review to be in my name.If that violates the amazon terms of service, please just remove this review, I do not wish my name published. Thank you."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"I read this one when I was a kid, probably around fourth or fifth grade, and I loved it.This is really an incredible story, predating Castaway and Life of Pi by sixty-some years, and still remaining a solid story for today's readers. Mafatu is a boy of about twelve living on the Polynesian island of Hikueru, who has lost his mother to the sea and is deathly afraid of it. One day, to conquer his fear, he sets out himself and winds up a castaway on a volcanic island.The thing that fascinated me as a child reading this was Mafatu's ingenuity -- the construction of the outrigger canoe, the making of his clothing and food, teaching himself to hunt and build and survive. While I wouldn't have wanted to be so far from home, in some ways I wanted to be him, experiencing that world half a planet away. TV shows like Survivor have nothing on this.The ambiguous ending (I prefer to think it's a happy one, but that is by no means clear) is a satisfying, if bittersweet, wrapup to one of the greatest, most intense, most incredible adventure stories that any child could ever enjoy. This is highly recommended, both to children who want something a little different to read and to adults who want to remember what it was like when that treefort in the backyard was a gateway to an entirely different world."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"Mafatu is the name of the main character, these means Stout Heart.

He spent his days making tools and sewing nets. He was considered a disgrace to his father and to all fishermen. When the time came for all practicing fishermen in his town to prove themselves worthy to supply thier family and town, all of Mafutu's friends were ready to go. No sooner did the fishermen set off then did Mafutu realize that challenging the sea would be the only way to get his father's and the town's respect.

While setting up camp at the island, Mafutu new that this would be his chance to prove he was not a &quot;wimp&quot;. From that day onward Mafutu spent everyday making tools, a canoe, and a fine warthog tooth necklace, much like the one of his brave and respected grandfather. Mafutu new that if he could get back home with these three things the taunting days would be over.After a couple of days on the island, Mafutu realized that this was no ordinary island, it was a canable island. He had to leave as soon as possible. He packed up his food, tools, and his beautiful necklace into his wonderfully crafted canoe and set sail for home. On his journey home, winds and waves came out of nowhere and challenged Mafutu more than ever. Using his fine craftsmenship he was able to steady the canoe and &quot;conquer the sea&quot;. He reached home with a beatiful canoe, necklace, and tools.

One of the things I liked most about the book was how easy to read, learn and apply the lessons are.If you read this book you'll sell more, build better and deeper relationships and feel more confident than you ever have no matter what the business setting. I consider myself very well versed in business etiquette but I was amazed at what I didn't know about current rules.I can't tell you how many business situations I've been in where people simply had no concept of proper etiquette.In reading the book, I learned many things and will definately be more prepared and appropriate as a result. I had no idea for example that if your fork fell on the floor at a restaurant that you should leave it and ask for another rather than picking it up and asking for another. I also didn't realize what the appropriate thing to do was when a woman walks to the table in a business setting (you'll be surprised, your mom and dad may have given you bad advice).Jacqueline does an amazing job of covering every conceivable business situation and shows you how to handle each appropriately and with grace.If you ever go to business lunches, dinners, mixers, networking events, or interact with clients in any way I strongly recommend this book.

I found the tips on mingling and small talk helpful as those are not areas where I'm particularly skilled. The book also covers the classic \\"where to put your napkin\\" and \\"who pays for dinner out\\" bits of information that we sometimes forget.Since the book is so short, I wouldn't call it a comprehensive guide to etiquette - (see \\"Etiquette Advantage in Business\\" by Peggy and Peter Post for an enormous guide to etiquette) Also, it doesn't contain as much \\"office etiquette\\" (for those of us who live in large cubicle spaces in huge corporations) as I'd hoped (seeThe Etiquette Edge: The Unspoken Rules for Business Success).

Schwartz gives a compelling view of the reasons behind his clients'-and everybody's- polarized behaviours. He explains the multiplicity of the mind in a very logical manner and proceeds to show the techniques for entering and working with the internal family systems. Most importantly though, he speaks of his clients not as objects in a cold &#34;doctor&#34; like manner. Instead, he writes about his clients with a mix of compassion and professionalism. Client and therapist are of equal standing and competence. I often felt as though I were present in his practice watching him implement his techniques.

While I find the principles in here to be potentially useful for some clients, I am reluctant to use them due to lack of scientific support for the model. There have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or group studies of any kind comparing IFS to either a wait-list condition, a placebo \\"sham\\" therapy, or other empirically-supported interventions. I question why I should choose IFS, which hasn't been validated, over another treatment that has been well-validated in the literature when treating clients. Thus, while potentially useful, I am more apt to choose a treatment that has been demonstrated to be useful via standard research protocol. If empirically supported interventions failed, then I may try IFS."},{"Title":"Internal Family Systems Therapy (The Guilford Family Therapy)","review":"Reviews posted here 13 years ago are harming contemporary consumers and need to be deleted by Amazon.

Buyer beware!"},{"Title":"Internal Family Systems Therapy (The Guilford Family Therapy)","review":"Internal Family Systems Therapy by Richard C. Schwartz represents the author's attempt at documenting a fascinating journey into the inner lives of clients. His model uniquely applies systems thinking to internal process, seeing our inner lives as yet another level of human systems. As I read this book, I was taken aback by how psychodynamics suddenly became coherent to me in a way that made intuitive and intellectual sense. Schwartz takes the reader through the development of the IFS model, and demonstrates how the therapy emerged from his interactions with his clients. He is successful in describing the step-by-step process of IFS therapy that is tied directly to the theory.The IFS model assumes that we all are &quot;multiple personalities&quot;, organized by a &quot;self&quot; that is compassionate, curious, and expansive. These sub-personalities, or &quot;parts&quot;, are all good and are with us from birth. They are kept in balance and harmony through self-leadership. When the self is threatened by trauma or devaluation from the outside world, the parts protect the self from harm; in doing so, they also lose trust in the self's ability to provide leadership and safety. In &quot;exiling&quot; the self for its own protection, these parts become extreme and polarized; the parts that were hurt carry the burdens of pain and suffering (&quot;exiles&quot;) that other parts (i.e., &quot;managers&quot; and &quot;firefighters&quot;) try to keep out of conscious awareness through various roles and operations. This becomes a recursive system which feeds upon itself to create symptoms when a person is under stress. These parts, which have been forced into extreme roles, are often identified by mental health professionals as symptoms or &quot;psychopathology&quot;. The IFS model assumes that the parts that have taken these extreme roles, when released from these roles, become non-extreme, valuable, and helpful to the person. The IFS model posits that through restoration of trust in the self by these extreme parts, the system's balance and harmony is restored. IFS therapy is a delicate, yet powerful process of restoring the Self in a position of leadership and of healing the wounded parts via the processes of &quot;witnessing&quot; and &quot;unburdening&quot;.After reading this book, I have witnessed Dr. Schwartz work with clients and have incorporated the principles in my own practice. My experience has been that most clients respond extremely well to the model and heal quickly. As a therapist, I have also grown personally and professionally. Dr. Schwartz has documented a major new innovation in the field through this book. It receives my highest endorsement!"},{"Title":"Internal Family Systems Therapy (The Guilford Family Therapy)","review":"Through personal application of the therapies described in this book, I found it to be profoundly enlightening. It shed bright lights on the origins of my own thoughts and self-talk. Experiencing the benefits of the therapies, seeing that they work, it provided the best form of teaching to me as to how it can be a valuable resource for helping one's self and for helping others. Having specialized in pastoral counseling while earning my Masters of Divinity degree, this book has done more to help me understand the multiple (and valuable) personalities all persons develop from childhood to adulthood and then how to use these therapies in a counseling setting. Its methods provide such a positive way of looking at ourselves, at other individuals, and at family dynamics. The concept of internal family systems therapy makes so much sense that I hope more therapists and counselors discover it, utilize it, and recommend it."},{"Title":"Internal Family Systems Therapy (The Guilford Family Therapy)","review":"IFS has been a godsend to me. As a victim of long-term, sometimes torturous sexual abuse as a child, I tried to fight my way out of my pain for decades. I bounced from therapist to therapist expecting nothing more than to find a few good coping techniques to get me through the rest of my life. But I FINALLY met a therapist who seemed to hold the key, IFS. We've been working with IFS for about 2+ years and the results I've enjoyed go beyond my wildest imagination. I've found a love of myself...part by part...that I can only describe as miraculous.If you are a mental health professional then please do yourself and your clients a huge favor by exploring this model."},{"Title":"Internal Family Systems Therapy (The Guilford Family Therapy)","review":"Richard Schwartz clearly explains his therapeutic model of working with sub-personalities (parts) in a way that empowers the client to lead their lives from their Self instead of having one or more of their 'parts' run the show! Although I have intuitively been working this way in a gestalt framework, his model gives many guidelines to make this process smoother and avoid pitfalls in this type of work. An excellent guide."},{"Title":"Internal Family Systems Therapy (The Guilford Family Therapy)","review":"I'm a therapy client whose therapist had been using IFS-based techniques with me for some time, though I hadn't known what the name for it was. While I could appreciate some of what she was doing, I was also pretty resistant to the whole premise that I should be compassionate and curious about \\"parts\\" of me that frankly I just wished would go away. In my previous experiences with therapy, I had been taught to distinguish between my rational, adult inner voice, and a vulnerable, emotional child voice, which seemed to make logical sense to me, but with this approach to therapy I was being asked to develop caring relationships with internal parts of myself that were angry or destructive or otherwise unlikeable on the surface, and frankly that seemed completely absurd.Despite my doubts, I stuck with it, and slowly things started to happen for me, and then when my therapist mentioned IFS by name, I found this book and all these pieces started to come together. Although the book is really a textbook for therapists, I found it quite readable as a client, and so many things began to make sense about what was happening to me in therapy, and what role I needed to play in the process for the technique to be really effective. Having a big picture sense of the IFS methodology was incredibly enlightening and helpful, and I've made all sorts of progress that I think would have been much slower had I not read the book.I think that the book would also be readable for someone who wasn't either a therapist or a client in an IFS setting, but there are limited examples and case studies in the book, so some things might be a bit vague and theoretical. Although Jay Norick's book on Parts Psychology is not as rich or intellectual as this book (and is not on IFS per se), it is a nice companion book in the sense that the Noricks book is strictly made up of case studies, and I found that it increased my comfort level with having all these named characters running around my head."},{"Title":"Internal Family Systems Therapy (The Guilford Family Therapy)","review":"This book gives a whole new way of looking at past family trauma that you might be carrying with you. It is definitely not the typical positive thinking believe your way out of your hurt kind of popular book. It can be a little dry at times but that's one of the reasons that I like it, is for a detailed systematic look at problems.One thing this book gave that others didn't was an ability to break my thinking and feelings into \\"parts\\". Each part is focused on protecting the self from things that are fearful but they go about it in different ways. In any event, breaking things down like this simplified some past problems and helped me resolve some old feelings.I wish Scwartz would write a sequel that would deal with specific problems for each chapter. This book gives an overview of how the system works and gives examples but it'd just be nice to be able to flip to a chapter on anger or depression.Great book but definitely takes time to process."},{"Title":"Internal Family Systems Therapy (The Guilford Family Therapy)","review":"I had been hesitant in buying this book, because I didn't like the title. It sounded too much like 'family therapy' to me, and had nothing to do with dissociation, parts, alters, or anything; but eventually after multiple recommendations I purchased the book.It was fantastic. It still is, I re-read it a lot. It helps to really de-pathologise dissociative disorders where parts or voices or alters or personalities (insert your terminology of choice here) are involved, and as a person with a dissociative disorder made me feel more empowered, gave me ideas to help myself further heal, and gave me a normalised structure in which to view my own parts. It is a validating and refreshing look at the concept now common with dissociative disorders, that suggests that integration of parts shouldn't be the goal; but concepts of co-operation, co-consciousness and compassion should be.I highly recommend it to anyone who wants practical case studies and advice as to how to address internal dissociative systems; and provides a successful model to look towards a healthier future."},{"Title":"Internal Family Systems Therapy (The Guilford Family Therapy)","review":"This is an overlooked work that should be on the popular self help as well as the professional's shelf. Dr. Schwartz has created an excellent synthesis of family therapy with traditional analysis techniques. The result is a simple, easily understandable but powerful framework for examining the individual psyche. While the writing style is dry and pedantic, the approach is brilliantly simple and easily applied. Without knocking the quick fixes of popular psychology, a lot of people should put down the best seller with the catchy title and read this book."},{"Title":"Internal Family Systems Therapy (The Guilford Family Therapy)","review":"I almost never write any of these reviews but this book was a game changer. I can say that of a few things in my life, specific books or events. If you are even thinking about getting this book, you will NOT be disapointed!! I have struggled through the years, as those reading this probably have also, this book helped me find a way to think of myself differently. Helped me to face those parts of me that need to be seen and heard, without the fear that they would \\"take over.\\" This book helped me take one more step in the long ardurous path forward."},{"Title":"Internal Family Systems Therapy (The Guilford Family Therapy)","review":"I've read all of Milton Erickson's books (well, except 2!), all of the NLP books, and some other things, and while I can say nothing but good about them in general, I think Dr. Schwartz's work is absolutely vital to understanding what successful therapy is all about.I don't necessarily agree with everything he says, though, and some of the techniques he uses are counterproductive. In particular, part of the IFS theory is that if you unburden a part and then bring it out of the past and into the present, then the part will be able to \\"grow up\\". However, in one Jay Early's books one of his clients goes through that process and then still shows the same trouble with the same part. My conclusion was that that part of the theory is wrong and that there must be something else that needs to be done to achieve the desired result. (later I found out what it was, too)Another thing that irks me about IFS is the insistence that the \\"True Self\\" is merely another kind of 'part'. His clients consistently describe it as being \\"different from other parts\\" or \\"just me\\", which should indicate clearly that it is distinct. As a result of this limiting assumption, none of the authors in the IFS crowd have bothered to explore or detail the aspects of the true self beyond a few words, which is far less than what it deserves IMHO.I highly recommend reading AH Almaas's works as an adjunct to IFS. Mr. Almaas's \\"Diamond Approach\\" strongly resembles IFS, except the emphasis is primarily on the 'true self' and not on the parts. The two complement each other in theory and technique like two sides of the same coin, and Mr. Almaas's work will answer most any questions you might have after reading this. I have yet to see anyone else who is aware of both, and I think it's a mighty shame that the two are unaware of each other, given how much each has to offer the other."},{"Title":"Nikon F (trilogy)","review":"Books can be time machines.The Nikon Trilogy is a series of three books devoted to the Nikon F camera. It covers the period from 1959 to 1973, the years of manufacture of the camera that changed the way pictures were made. Volume 1 deals with the Nikon F in great detail, describing each part of the camera body and the way that the camera evolved over the period of manufacture. The second volume deals with the lenses that were made during this same period for the Nikon F, and the third volume with the accessories that were available for the camera.As I read through the first book, with its listing of the years that variations to the basic camera were introduced, with related serial numbers, I recalled that up on the top shelf of a closet, my original Nikon F, purchased in 1961, was packed away. I stopped reading and pulled down the box from the shelf. There it was, Serial Number 6420249, manufactured, according to the author, Uli Koch, in the summer of 1960. I read through the sections on the frame counter, and the shutter speed indicator and the film rewind, carefully checking each description against my shiny old chrome-plated friend. At last I understood the cryptic marking &quot;EP&quot; on the rewind knob that meant the camera had been produced for sale in the Post Exchange, where I had purchased the camera.When I got to the section on lenses, not only did I find the production data on my 50mm, 28mm and 135mm lenses, but I also found the description of the 85-250mm zoom, the lens that my heart had ached for, but that I could never afford. And there was the 300mm lens that I had bought second hand when a stroke of good fortune in my career brought me a sum of money that I didn't have to carefully budget for the uses of my young family.When I got to the section on the clip-on external selenium exposure meter that I bought for my camera, the one that had broken and never been replaced, I found how difficult it was to remember the layout of the parts from more than 40 years ago, so that I could not recall if it had been a Model 1 or a Model 3. The description of the FTN Photomic finder, that introduced through-the-lens metering, reminded me of the break-through that I had with a difficult boss. Somehow, we talked about our cameras and learned that we both owned F's. He told me how wonderful through-the-lens metering was; I bought the FTN and found new joy in photography; and I found a new friend with whom I could share that joy.Undoubtedly, these books are aimed at serious collectors of a single model of a camera, and they will relish the small details that are contained in these books, including stories about how Nikon developed certain equipment for the Tokyo Olympics and of the battles of Nippon Kogako in Germany that forced the company to market its products in that country with the Nikkor label instead of the Nikon label. One may wonder if the author finds it so incredible that a company in the only country to have had not one but two atomic bombs dropped on it should call a metering system &quot;Photomic&quot;,so that, he suggests, the derivation is from the combination of photo and automatic. One can laugh good naturedly at the sometimes-awkward translation of the text from its original German to English.On the other hand, some can look upon these volumes as a chance to become reacquainted with a friend of more than forty years. When I finished reading the book, I pulled out the old carousels of my first Nikon years, and ran the projector, and wondered what had happened to so many of the people whose images I'd saved on film and in the recesses of my mind. As I read the books I vowed to find batteries for the FTN finder and take my Nikon F out one more time. At the same time, I knew that the day when I would have something to photograph and would forgo the chance of getting the kind of picture that my current cameras can capture so surely and easily would probably never come.And yet, as I looked at what was perhaps the first picture I ever shot with a camera labeled Nikon, I thought of those almost-lost years fondly and appreciated Koch's work."},{"Title":"Nikon F (trilogy)","review":"Uli spent years reseaching and documenting this 3 volume set on the Nikon F: the camera, the lenses, and the accessories. It is far and away the best work ever published in English on the classic Nikon F SLR, the first pro quality system 35mm SLR. Nothing else is even close. If you are a serious Nikon F collector, you need this 3 volume set to research your collection and to make the right decisions on what to buy, sell, and what to keep. You will learn of variations not even mentioned elsewhere. Extremely detailed, it offers much information simply not available elsewhere in the English language.

Some were message books, some are literary wonders but I believe this book really is the doctor at his most subtle witty best.Although all Seuss books are a joy to read aloud, this one is especially good (the list of injuries in an early fall the hero takes still comes easily to my memory) and it gets the point across that one cannot successfully avoid trouble without the preachy sentiment in the Lorax. I must have read the book hundreds of times before the sentiment finally soaked into my silly brain but the philosophy has been a guiding light ever since.I was lucky enough to meet the good doctor once, at a reception in San Diego. I was so overwhelmed by the circumstance, I could hardly speak coherently, much less make conversation. Although I forgot almost every other word in the English language (including my name) I did manage to blurt out \\"Solla Sollew was my favorite book in grade school!\\" I certainly did not create an admirable impression that day. But the doctor did and his book still does. Read it, enjoy it and take it to heart."},{"Title":"I had trouble in getting to Solla Sollew,","review":"This was not only my favorite Dr. Seuss book but probably my all out favorite book.

It has the most whimsically wonderful illustrations, wonderfully catchy text and rhymes and overall a great message for kids.The story has a nameless hero who narrates the action, he trips over, then gets bitten, and while trying to watch in front and behind gets attacked from above and below. He meets a man going to Solla Sollew (where they never have troubles at least very few). So he joins him on the trip - but things go very wrong indeed and when he finally gets there they have had a trouble and so the gate keeper is going to another town (where they never have any troubles at all).I think this (like Horton the elephant) has a sophisticated underlayer of humour which appeals to adults and children alike, The one wheeled wubble driver who blithely sits back and lets our poor narrater drag him and and the camel along because it is much more efficient for someone to pick the best path and have all the pain and the aches. The general who bravely pushes every one in to battle, and then instantly calls retreat, the door man to Solla Sollew who just walks away. They are all instantly recognisable in every day life as well as in caricature in this book.The illustrations are so whimsically lovely - the best is the billowy marshmallow pillows, but there are lovely flower like plants on the banks of the beautiful river Wah-hoo - which my children adore.I would recommend this book above many of the other classic Seuss works - it is a wonderful, funny, story and a nice message in it to instil in your children.

The format of a quest was as appealing to me as a youngster as it is to all of us in its many more mature formats. Like all Seuss books, it is a little wierd and twisted - I am not always sure that is a good thing, but I loved the alliteration of phrases like \\"the perilous poozers of pomplemoose pass\\". As many have noted, the plot of a character facing his troubles in stead of searching for greener pastures was clearly evident to me as a 4 year old. I learned from this book that there are key slapping slippards everywhere, and that troubles that seem large at first can be faced with determination and preparation.

I came across it recently while I also happened to be reading Campbell's Transformations of Myth Through Time.A young man, beset with the travails of life, sets off to find paradise. The premise having been set, this story is actually predominantly about his many encounters and experiences on the road to paradise -- how he gets conned, imperiled, left to the mercy of the elements, enlisted into a battle he has nothing to do with, lost and alone in a crowd, etc. Having risen to the occasion repeatedly, he arrives at (literally) the door to paradise a changed man. In the end, Dr. Seuss leaves open question of what paradise really is.This is an archetypal Hero's Journey.And there is another parallel. Campbell often talked about the danger of concretizing the symbols -- for example that there is a physical holy land, the place where your myth takes place, to which you as a human being must physically travel to touch divinity. The alternative is to recognize your myth as metaphoric, and to recognize that the divinity of your God is your own divinity, and to sanctify and make holy the land and the place where you are, etc. 'Solla Sollew' speaks to this theme."},{"Title":"I had trouble in getting to Solla Sollew,","review":"After years of quoting from this book to my children I bought it for Christmas this year.

Discouraged by these setbacks, he is all ears when a chap on a One-Wheeler Wubble comes along and says that there's never any trouble in the City of Solla Sollew, and offers take him there. The trip turns out to be very arduous and difficult. Finally at Solla Sollew, a new problem arises. From this experience, he decides to be more proactive in the future. \\"Now my troubles are going, To have trouble with me!\\"Like all of the Dr. Seuss books, this one is enlivened by hilarious creatures, dramatic and colorful illustrations, and a pleasant rhyming scheme that uses funny names to aid the rhymes.One of the most difficult lessons for people to learn is that we carry the seeds of all our problems and opportunities around with us. Simply changing the scenery may not be enough, if our old ways of thinking still guide us. If you are somewhat depressed and see no opportunity in one place, even in an earthly paradise you can still experience life the same way.Many people go through life looking for the perfect mate, house, and job, only to be constantly disappointed. In I Had Trouble in Getting to Solla Sollew, that voyage toward perfection can be quickly experienced and the lesson learned. Here is where a parent can make a big difference. You need to share some experiences in your own life where you lived this story, and share what you learned as a result. In this way, you can help you child in later years by providing an alternative perspective and reminding her or him or this story. \\"Are you going to Solla Sollew?\\" can be a shorthand way of encouraging your child to re-examine the purpose of the sought-for change.For an adult, the benefit from this story can be to help you consider whether all of the error-elimination you pursue is worth the effort. My clients frequently are interested in reducing their error rate. They may be starting, though, in an area with an error rate that is only one in ten million occurrences. And the area being considered may be relatively unimportant to the success of the organization. The same effort could instead make important improvements in some area where mistakes abound, results do matter, and perfection is an impossible dream.Decide what the problem is before you grab just any solution!"},{"Title":"I had trouble in getting to Solla Sollew,","review":"As a child, someone read this book to me only once, and I looked for it ever afterward.

Trying to avoid our troubles only leads to more trouble. The things we acquire and use to cope with troubles are more trouble than aid. Not everyone who offers to help actually helps you. People who depend on you can seldom be depended upon.

This may be the most enjoyable book I've ever read. Alas, he has too many other books to keep my appetite for Solla Sollew sated.Aside from the fun that is typical of Dr. Seuss, this book provides the foundations for critical thought that humans must develop to succeed. When offered the opportunity to travel to the city of Boola Boo Ball, &quot;where they never have troubles, no troubles at all,&quot; the protagonist &quot;does some quick thinking inside of [his] head.&quot; He foregoes this &quot;paradise&quot; in favor of his home land, the Valley of Vung, knowing full well he is likely to meet with many of the troubles he encountered traveling to Solla Sollew. Considering his disappointment upon arriving at Solla Sollew (where the prophecy of very few troubles turned out to be false) his decision was truly inspired. Bravo, Lad!"},{"Title":"I had trouble in getting to Solla Sollew,","review":"Adults and children alike can so relate to the little hero of \\"I Had Trouble Getting to Solla Sollew\\": many readers will have had moments of wanting to travel to a kind of paradise like \\"the city of Solla Sollew / On the banks of the beautiful River Wah-hoo\\"; many readers will relate to the beautiful illustration of the little creature dreaming that he was \\"sleeping on billowy billows / Of soft silk and satin marshmallow-stuffed pillows.\\" Readers will feel for the struggle fo this protagnoist, a classically illustrated Dr. Seuss creature, who longs to escape his troubles.In the end, this creature is able to resist the temptation to enter into further escape, declining the offer of the Doorman of Solla Sollew to seek out the city of \\"Boola Boo Ball / On the banks of the beautiful River Woo-Wall / Where they never have troubles! No troubles at all!\\" Instead, our hero turns to face his trials and tribulations, and readers admire and respect him for this.Escaping is a wonderful dream, and Dr. Seuss captures this with his vivid illustrations of the outskirts of the city of Solla Sollew. Yet facing one's hardships is courageous, and Dr. Seuss delivers this message beautifully."},{"Title":"I had trouble in getting to Solla Sollew,","review":"This is a little odd, even for Seuss.An unidentified thing, our narrator, is having a rough day. He trips, he gets stung... and every time he looks around to prevent it from happening again, something new shows up on his unwatched side!Finally he bumps into a man going to Solla Sollew, where they don't have troubles - or at least, very few.And this starts his whole troublesome trip. He was safer at home! He finally arrives, exhausted, only to find out that they've misplaced the key and he can't get in, and anyway their troubles in Solla Sollew are just starting thanks to the misplaced key, but there's an even more PERFECT place down the ways a bit...Not for our intrepid hero, though. He gets a big stick and goes home, deciding any troubles will have trouble with him first. This last scene may bother some parents because of the implied violence. Me, I'm busier wondering how he'll use that stick to intimidate a rock that trips him up.There isn't a very clear moral, if that's what you go for. Still and all, I like this one."},{"Title":"I had trouble in getting to Solla Sollew,","review":"This book is suitable with adults with its message that \\"the devil you know is better than the one you don't know\\", but for children it is just scary. The protagonist dreams of a better place, where he doesn't get attacked, and on his journey to the mystical place where there are few problems, he runs into more and more problems, some of them being violent, others of abandonment and betrayal and the pictures going with these scenes are scary for children. The ending of the book is not the fulfillment of the dream, but the return to the beginning, to the problems he knows. Maybe from an adult perspective it makes sense to tackle the problems at hand rather than to dream of escape, but children need the mystical place and a happy ending, which this book certainly doesn't have. The last picture is one of violence.I usually like Dr. Seuss books, but this book got ruined by the message."},{"Title":"I had trouble in getting to Solla Sollew,","review":"This is my most favorite Seuss book.

The main character is trying to escape from all his troubles, but in his effort to do so he only encounters more troubles and finally reconciles himself to effectively dealing with his troubles rather than trying to run away from them.

I have been an elementary teacher for the past ten years and every class I have read it to loves it and my own kids do also. It has colorful and funny illustrations and the words flow like a story-length poem. The moral of the story is basically that the grass isn't always greener, that no matter where you go there will be problems, so just deal with the problems instead of trying to find a problem-free place.

So begins an odyssey which, after more adventures than you'll find in any other Seuss, teaches the lesson that it's better to face troubles than to run away. This book captivated me on my 5th birthday (the year it was first published) and is still my favorite. The plot is more complete and complex than any other Seuss, and the moral is as valuable today as when I first read it. A side benefit is the striking use of color; the Dr. used a more subtle color scheme in Solla Sollew and it enhances the realism of the story. This, as much as any other, is essential Seuss."},{"Title":"I had trouble in getting to Solla Sollew,","review":"People won't want to hear this in a review of a children's book, but it's difficult to view the structure and tone of this book as having been inspired by anything other than hallucinogens.

In a well-fleshed out, approximately Renaissance-level setting, a well-to-do rancher's daughter, a disgruntled army officer, a lawyer who's more than he seems, and an exotic catwoman are thrown together on a quest for a power object which can defeat an evil tyrant. They're helped along the way by a hilarious near-forgotten fertility god, and hindered by a villainous comrade who has dire plans of his own for the rancher girl and her family.

This isn't a wildly original, groundbreaking work, but it's a well-constructed, satisfying read."},{"Title":"The ROSE SEA","review":"It's a pretty standard setup - the Tykissian Empire (a Romanalog) isinvading Tarin Tseld (Aegypt).

It certainly doesn't compare with S.M. Stirling's best work (I haven't read enough Holly Lisle to say how it measures up to hers) but it makes for pleasant light reading. The cultures are reasonably well worked out, the magic is believeable (in context), the primary characters are likeable (the villains come off just slightly flat, but this novel doesn't pretend to such weightiness that all sides must be equally fleshed out), and the writing is excellent. The most refreshing aspect is the fact that this fantasy world is not the usual quasi-Medieval setting. Instead, the protagonists are representatives of a culture which seems to be, roughly, Renaissance-equivalent, in both social structure (seems to be some antipathy between traditional landed elites and rising urban ones) and technology (mid-to-late sixteenth century firearms, with a few changes). As an added plus, the authors have even included some rather pleasant humour (the bit about the ensorcelled flask &quot;ever-full of fresh spring water, with little bubbles and a hint of lemon in it&quot; is a near-classic.)"},{"Title":"The ROSE SEA","review":"It's a pretty standard setup - the Tykissian Empire (a Romanalog) is invading Tarin Tseld (Aegypt).

Those who have been searching for a complete edition of Balakirev's music without the necessity of travelling to Moscow will be thrilled at these offerings from Konemann. Praise to Konemann also for including the early, immature Sonata, not so much for its performance value (Balakirev rightly considered the later 1905 Sonata the true version) but for the opportunity to see the evolution of Balakirev's style, much like comparing the different versions of Liszt's etudes. The book starts off, in fact, with a Liszt-style operatic paraphrase which is pianistically resplendent, and would provide a true gem of a neglected concert piece in a pianist's repertoire. The same could be said for most of the contents of these three volumes. It's wonderful to have a comprehensive collection of Balakirev's wonderfully idiomatic piano music, rather than the scattershot edtions generally available from Peters and Zimmerman. My only gripe is that certain minutia such as dedications and publication dates are left in the urtext cyrillic, thus promoting russian dictionary sales."},{"Title":"Piano Complete Work","review":"This passage comments on the last piece in this title. Islamey is one of the most skillfully-crafted masterpieces in piano literature with full root-chords, melodious chromatics, and varying flying arppegios all in one piece. Facinatingly difficult, it uses almost all the keys on the keyboard, from the lowest D flat to the highest F sharp. Only a brilliant composer with burning talent such as the Great Mily Alexeyevich Balakirev himself could produce such a work in the time span of only one month, and I recommend the discerning pianist should take a listen to it if they haven't.Legend has it that the original composition was so difficult that Balakirev himself couldn't play it as he had written it. I believe the version offered in this score is a modified one but it still contains many conflicting chords that sound too muddy if played as written. Islamey has been avoided by pianists and contenders in piano competitions as it is said to be too complicated and is considered to have 'died' many years ago.But I want to commemorate the legend once more: &quot;Long live Islamey!!!&quot;, and may this classic live FOREVER...Excellent!"},{"Title":"Diets And Why Most Don't Work","review":"Most diets don't work because they aren't 'personalized' to an individual's body and blood type: Diets And Why Most Don't Work explains the connection between blood types and the kinds of food the body needs to lose weight.

The premise of the book is as ridiculous as it is predictable; plot and character development is at best severely lacking and at worst nonexistent. The way the narrative jumps from one point to another without a coherent bridge makes the reader think the author is still asleep, just as he is describing in the foreword, and is dreaming all this. The arguments used to defend the Confederate point of view, although sincere, are so beat up it is hard to keep from yawning while reading them for anyone familiar with the subject. The only tolerable part of the book is Chapter 1, where the author argues the issues of the Civil War with his history professor, and the only reason it is tolerable is because the author does not overstep the boundaries of his writing abilities with his literary ambition, which he does from that point onward. College-essay style may be appropriate for a four-page chapter, but the entire book written like this makes for a slow torture of a read.No wonder Mr. Burch needed the services of a friend who owns a publishing company to have his book see the light of day. No self-respecting publishing house would look at it twice. I have only one question - doesn't the publishing company that produced &quot;Return&quot; offer editing services? I mean, reading about the South wanting to &quot;succeed&quot; from the rest of the Union pretty much sums up the quality of the book for me. Perhaps Mr. Burch should've contacted that history professor who gave him an &quot;A&quot; in the class and asked whether he had any friends in the English department who would've helped turn this joke of a literary work into something slightly more palatable."},{"Title":"Return for Confederate Victory","review":"Bradley Burch has conceptualized a fascinating time travel story. The characters are transported back in time to a farm in Alabama in the year 1847 through the use of a T. A. Edison device. The objective of the travelers is to change the outcome of the Civil War.Interesting concept, but not developed. The book is a quick read and not bad for a younger audience. Many concepts presented would make for interesting discussions in a middle school history class. I felt I was reading Mr. Burch's outline for the story and not a novel. Large time segments, as well as the logistics for spreading modern technology throughout the Southern states, were explained in a paragraph or two leaving me shaking my head trying to conceptualize what had happened!I would have liked to have seen more character development. For example, why did some of the travelers switch to the Union side of the conflict? I would have like to have read from the traitors' point of view their rationale for betraying their Southern comrades.In conclusion, an interesting, imaginative story, but in need of additional details and character development.

It's a tremendous resource. Just the other day, I needed to know some facts about the Uruguayan economy for a proposal I was writing. It's all here: economic policy and performance; banking and finance; energy and natural resources; key historical events; territory and population; demographics; etc., etc. etc.Suppose you had a question regarding civil aviation in Uruguay. The Statesman's Guide tells you:&quot;There is an international airport at Montevideo (Carrasco). The national carrier is Pluna...There are 60 airports (1996), 45 paved with runways, and 15 with unpaved runways. In 1998 Montevideo handled 1,470,000 passengers (1,198,000 on international flights) and 25,500 tons of freight.&quot;That's the level of detail you get on any question of national importance...for *any* nation in the world.

That stuck with me as a kid and it hasformed part of my reasons for reading ever since. I stillthink it is wonderful to \\"visit' places I have never been,and read about things I may never do. I will probably never get to an African country.Because of a friend in Botswana, I have read Norman Rush's highliterary novel Mating, set in that country. Rwanda thru books and a movie has been thrust on my awareness. I know South Africa from Michener through Gordimer and others.But nothing about Zimbabwe had I ever read or heard about since Robert Ruark's Something of Value. (The NYTimes reported last Sunday that this book was a major bestseller 50 years ago this week).Now, because of Lincoln's novel, I know about Zimbabwe, the sad unjust history, the sad present and ongoing problems.To an outsider, some of the problems seem intractable.(Again the TImes recently did a short piece on the rampant growing inflation and suppression of employment that could alleviate the problem a bit) And I have enjoyed a story of old-fashionedlove, modern Safari adventures---something I will also never do---well-intentioned human beings in tough situations, power, corruption and suspense, and suspense.This book is a fine one in the tradition of Robert Ruark and Stuart Cloete, human adventure stories set in \\"the dark continent\\""},{"Title":"Zimbabwe","review":"I bought the book because I have done a good deal of international hunting and the Rotary International in its last monthly magazine had a piece on Zimbabwe. I recognized the author by the photo on the cover, Lincoln Hughes being a nom de plume. The novel is written by an experienced hunter in Africa, Tanzania to South Africa, who has taken over 50 species in Africa, including the \\"Big Five\\". For a person interested in hunting the book is alsmost a primer on how to hunt on safari in Africa-what rifles and cartridges to use, the methods of stalking game, and perhaps most importantly, why and how the debacle of Zimbabwe of today came to be. The novel covers the era of Ian Smith to the fictional future, addressing the confiscation of land owned by white citizens, the famine, and the author's concept of what the future holds. The novel is written by a hunter who writes, not a writer who hunts. The style is closer to Hemmingway in \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" (describing a civil war from an earlier era) and the anthology \\"Hemmingway on Hunting\\", than Robert Ruark's \\"Something of Value\\" or \\"Uhuru\\". The prose is vivid, not for the faint of heat.The author of the Rotarian article also used a nom de plume--\\"Tendai\\", a Buddhist sect, and \\"Uhuru\\", freedom. Apparently, those who write of Zimbabwe and hope to return do not want the present regime to know who they are."},{"Title":"Zimbabwe","review":"This is an incredibly accurate portrayal of Rhodesian Africa set with a suspenseful theme. Better than Capstick! Makes you want to pack your bags and go on a safari."},{"Title":"Zimbabwe","review":"This is a fascinating work. It deals primarily with two dominant aspects of life in the Zimbabwe region, professionally guided big game hunting and the political/military unrest prevailing in that area for years. Generally the same characters play roles in both theaters. For hunters of various levels of experience, the detailed discussion of firearms, ammunition and its effects, and hunting methods brings back treasured memories. For the student of political science, it is similar to being a participant as regimes surface, compete, rise and fall, peacefully and otherwise. It kept me up past midnight reading it. I really enjoyed this book and recommend it."},{"Title":"Zimbabwe","review":"This is a tight, readable, and interesting story about what's been going on in this former British colony since given back to its people, but usurped by one of them.

You won't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Zimbabwe","review":"I purchased this on kindle after reading a number of positive reviews. Having had to stop reading this dismal book about two thirds of the way through, I'm bewildered at how anybody could give this novel four stars, or even two. As a positive, Hughes' account of African hunting is excellent and obviously drawn from first-hand experience. He goes into cartridge types, techniques, animal behavior, etc. and gives you a real sense of what being on a safari is like day-to-day. I could have read this for some time, but about a third of the way through the book it gives way to the horribly written plot and accompanying dialogue which is really some of the poorest I've ever read. About 70% of the way through, I figured this book wasn't worth continuing -rarely have I made such a decision.The storyline here is remarkably similar to Wilbur Smith's 'A Time to Die' (i.e. Zimbabwean Safari gone wrong, ex-Rhodesian army soldiers taking matters into their own hands, intertwined with corny romance). I rate Smith's book as one of my favorite Africa novels; it beats this one hands down.Smith's book also contains some decent descriptions of hunting, but those seeking more would be better off reading Hemmingway's 'Green Hills of Africa', or some of the great white hunter works by folks such as Frekerick Courteney Selous, than reading 'Zimbabwe'.Not recommended."},{"Title":"Granny and the Gay Guy","review":"This book is a must have for anyone who needs a &quot;just plain simple, old fashioned laugh&quot;!

The book is about the class structure of the Soviet Union, but the way the analysis is conducted makes it clear that the questions Resnick and Wolff raise about class theory are applicable to all societies, and their particular answers in the Soviet case yield fascinating insights that have not been understood this clearly before.Wolff and Resnick have written at length about economic theory and methodology, and this work shows their use of class theory and overdetermination. The nuance and sophistication of their analysis is remarkable; their prose touches on the ideals and tragedies of the Soviet experience, the promise and the betrayal of that promise. At the same time, they write with urgency about the successes of the Soviet Union, particularly in the one area that most economists have argued was their greatest failure: agriculture.This book is highly recommended for all students of economic history, the Soviet Union, and class theory."},{"Title":"Pioneers and makers of Arkansas","review":"My copy of Pioneers and Makers of Arkansas was very poorly done.

Rocchio refuses the simple, and simplistic, route of identifying negative racial stereotypes in film (a route that, as he points out, has governed previous studies of race and cinema). Rather, he explores the ways in which a variety of films--including The Birth of a Nation, Driving Miss Daisy, and Mississippi Burning--actively participate in the creation and circulation of racial discourse. This approach enables him to show that even seemingly &quot;positive&quot; depictions of African American characters (as in Driving Miss Daisy) can participate in the construction of racial difference and inequality. Rocchio does not, however, mean to suggest that film is solely a racist vehicle; he also includes readings of films--notably those of Spike Lee--that challenge or contest processes of racism. What's great about the book, too, is that it's accessible for students of film or for a general audience; it's not meant only (or even mostly) for film scholars, as evidenced by the straightforward prose and careful selection of footnotes. And the book's accessibility is particularly important since film, and the racial discourses Rocchio identifies in film, aren't confined to a particular segment of the population either."},{"Title":"Reel Racism: Confronting Hollywood's Construction of Afro-American Culture (Thinking Through Cinema)","review":"If you have not seen the movies the author writes about the book is hard to understand.

The authors have a romanticized view of subsistence farming and believe it should be promoted, its past association with famine and poverty escape mention. Trade per se, is an evil that should be discouraged in place of protectionism. Again there is a selective reading of history, the hyperinflation and instability associated with populism and protectionism gets no mention. Even when they toss out some laudable ideas about alternative energy sources, they oversell its virtues.Far worse is the outright disingenuousness of the authors. They drag out the tired canard that less developed nations were \\"forced\\" to open up and globalize. No nation was forced to lower trade barriers or join the WTO, they did so because they wanted access to foreign markets and credit, for better or worse. This is a phony argument because otherwise the authors would be forced to admit there are nations that are following their prescription: Zimbabwe, Cuba, Venezuela and perhaps soon Bolivia, to name a few. In truth they don't have a successful or worthwhile recipe for an alternative to the alleged evils of capitalism. It would be wonderful is some nation would anoint itself as the model alternative, all they have to do is close their economy from the rest of world.

It has succeeded brilliantly, and deserves very close study, whether or not you agree with the drafting committee's views.This is no extremist anti-corporate, anti-capitalist text, although it does clearly come to the conclusion that the vector of economic globalisation that we are on is neither inevitable, desirable nor sustainable. It is notable for arguing at the level of underlying principles and their practical consequences - it makes explicit the assumptions underlying corporate globalisation and questions them. This, in itself, is a valuable service as so much of the 'debate' in the media proceeds on the basis of bald assertion of essentially fallacious economic dogma.The report starts with a critique of 'corporate globalization'. The term itself is useful, because the term 'globalization' has become something of a 'Humpty-Dumpty' word ('when I use a word, it means exactly what I want it to mean, neither more nor less'). 'Corporate globalization' describes a process driven and promoted by the large global corporations which, whatever its other consequences, gives primacy to the benefits that will flow to global business.The critique identifies eight key features of corporate globalization:1. 'Promotion of hypergrowth and unrestricted exploitation of environmental resources to fuel that growth2. Privatization and commodification of public services and of remaining aspects of the global and community commons3. Global cultural and economic homogenization and the intense promotion of consumerism4. Integration and conversion of national economies, including some that were largely self-reliant, to environmentally and socially harmful export oriented production5. Corporate deregulation and unrestricted movement of capital across borders6. Dramatically increased corporate concentration7. Dismantling of public health, social, and environmental programs already in place8. Replacement of traditional powers of democratic nation-states and local communities by global corporate bureaucracies.'It demonstrates each of these propositions and explores who are the beneficiaries of application of these policies. One of the complexities of trying to follow the arguments of the pro- and anti- globalisers is that both use statistics, both from apparently authoritative sources, that directly contradict each other. It is almost as if the two sides inhabit parallel universes that operate in different ways. Suffice it to say that the report puts forward convincing arguments in support of its case.The critique proceeds to a devastating analysis of the impact of the World Bank, The IMF and the WTO, the three pillars of corporate globalisation, over the last four or five decades.The report then argues ten principles for sustainable societies, as a basis for identifying ways of realising these principles in the subsequent chapters of the report. It argues that these principles 'seem to be the mirror opposites of the principles that drive the institutions of the corporate global economy.'.One of the minor problems in the debate is that, whereas 'globalization' rolls easily off the tongue, 'the principle of subsidiarity' is neither easy to say nor obvious in its meaning. The report contains a chapter on the case for subsidiarity, and it is a strong one. The counter argument is almost entirely concerned with power. While there are many elements of conflict between corporate globalisation and the principle of subsidiarity - local control - they are not entirely antithetical. But the reach of the large corporates would unquestionably be reduced.You may or may not agree with the arguments in this report, but they deserve serious attention. They are well and carefully argued, they represent (in fairly sophisticated terms) the views of a growing number of people around the world who believe that current beliefs and institutions serve them poorly, and they show those who wish to promote change a path for doing so."},{"Title":"Alternatives to Economic Globalization","review":"A friend of mine who is involved with Rabbi Michael Lerner's Tikkun Community movement recently gave me a copy of Alternatives to Economic Globalization: A Better World is Possible. I'm not an expert in this field at all, but I found the book worthwhile and very accessible. (So accessible that I read the entire thing in a week!) The writers include Jerry Mander, David Korten, Lori Wallach, and many people working around the world in the anti-globalization movement.What makes the book really important is the positive solutions and alternatives offered. The authors offer real ways to put into practice the Tikkun Community's first and second core principles (interdependence and ecological sanity, and a new bottom line in economic and social institutions).I think other Tikkun readers, progressive-Democrats, Green party members, and thoughtful people everywhere---who want to see the world change from how it is now to how it could be---would want to read a book outlining specifics of how to create sustainable energy, transportation and food systems. And Alternatives to Economic Globalization does just that. I can't recommend this book enough (in fact I've already bought several copies to give to some of my friends)."},{"Title":"Alternatives to Economic Globalization","review":"This provocative text is the work of an impressive collection of luminary scholars, writers, and environmental activists, all of whom have something important to contribute to the issue of economic globalization and how it is affecting the environment. This distinguished group of authors, including Jerry Mander, Ralph Nader, David Korten, John Cavanaugh, and Lori Wallach, have joined in a collaborative effort herein to render what is likely the single most definitive and sober critique of the current state of globalization as well as the rising tide of anti-globalization efforts across the planet. As the culminating product of a three-year effort by the International Forum on Globalization, the book can best described as being both painstaking and muckraking, providing a series of ten core requirements which must be instituted to make democratic societies sustainable; among which are equality, human rights, local decision-making, and of course, ecological sustainability. In the narrative, each is addressed in terms of both how they are affected by the globalization process as well as what kind of strategies work to counteract these untoward effects.Moreover, the individual contributors offer a series of quite specific collective strategies for combating and limiting the extent of corporate domination, and also discuss various alternative systems in the critical areas of energy, agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing. There is also a lively discussion pertaining to modes of political action to deconstruct and even destroy the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well its predecessor and corollary institutions, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund or IMF. From the time of the creation of the post WWII international monetary system at Bretton Woods in 1944, through the institution of the World Bank, the IMF, and GATT, the rise of globalization has necessarily towed in its wake an increasing pressure both on the natural environment and the natural resources the corporate forces must dominate and control to continue its essential core function of international economic growth.With the rise of an organized opposition and a declaration of that organization's policies to systematically resist and counter the effects of the WTO, the anti-globalization forces around the world now have a formal manifesto for the systematic resistance to the forces of corporate sponsored economic globalization. Of course, given the fact that the existing corporate effort is so widespread, pandemic, and attractive to a variety of international corporate forces, any prospect for reversing the trend will be problematic indeed. Yet, given the potential for catastrophic consequences stemming from the movement toward the expanding influence of such global corporate enterprises, the authors argue that we would do well to try.This is an important book, one that arms the reader with an array of facts regarding what the so-called &quot;New World Order&quot; really means in terms of its potential impact on each us in every aspect of our lives, as individuals, as members of the local community, as consumers of necessary (and other) products, and as citizens of a nation and of the world at large. The scope of the change to come is immense, and it is obviously in the interest of each of us to better understand exactly what is at stake in terms of our lives, our freedoms as citizens, and our survival in a world increasingly endangered by reckless corporate activities that are destroying the biosphere. I highly recommend this book.

And it's nice to read a book that not only offers hope and solutions, but that goes beyond the 101 primers about globalization that are widely available. This book assumes you already know some of the issues and the problems that they create.The downside to this is that it's unlikely to be a book read by the people who most need to read it. While the information is laid out clearly, it's not very readable; at times, it's even pretty dry. Personally, I would have found more examples helpful both in terms of illustrating the points and in giving a human face to the problems and their solutions. It's one thing to know how Monsanto is shutting down x-number of family farms; it would be another thing entirely to hear the story of a farmer who lost his livelihood due to a ridiculous Monsanto lawsuit.So while it's nice to find something on the subject that's more challenging to read, I do wish it's something that the general public would be inclined to pick up and feel inspired by. The Forum has very, very important things to say about the future of work, the environment, and human life, but I'm afraid, given the format and style, that they're likely preaching to the converted."},{"Title":"Alternatives to Economic Globalization","review":"This book is heavily mis-titled.
