It is obviously this is a long term study done by William W. Tuttle, Jr. I found that his main goal in this book was to write an understandable book that documents the events that occured in Chicago in the year of 1919. In his book, it is apparent that he covered every aspect and perspective of the events that took place. This may be due to the fact that he not only focuses on the events that took place in chicago. but also on other similar events that took place around the nation. My only compliant might be that because of this the theme of the book at times seem recurrent and repeative. That aside, I would suggest this book to anyone interested in the history of Chicago."},{"Title":"Race riot;: Chicago in the Red Summer of 1919 (Studies in American Negro life)","review":"As far as I know, this is the only book on the subject, which is an absolutely fascinating one for me.

Still, this is a wonderful book, essential for anybody interested in Chicago history."},{"Title":"Race riot;: Chicago in the Red Summer of 1919 (Studies in American Negro life)","review":"\\"Race Riot\\" by William M. Tuttle Jr. is strong analysis of urban race relations in America. While the book focuses on the Chicago race riot of 1919 and the conditions that led to the bloodshed, it also provides a larger historical context of the WWI era, as well as the 1919 riot in relation to those of the 1960's. Considering this book was published in 1970, it seems an appropriate topic given the climate of the times and proves the old adage that \\"he who is ignorant of history is doomed to repeat it.\\"Tuttle was a professor at the University of Kansas, so he seems in a relevant position to write this book, given Kansas' role in precipitating the Civil War, as well as undergoing similar racial disputes that were common to the era and mid-western location. I would say that Tuttle remains true to his academic platform in giving a generally sympathetic cause and effect of the events that led up to horrendous racial violence, and refrains from any specific \\"finger pointing\\"; his approach is that of a true academic in that he seeks the objective truth, and through it a larger conflict that is relevant in race relations throughout America.Despite the subtitle which is \\"Chicago in the Red Summer of 1919\\", the main focus of the book is upon the racial tension between blacks and whites; he doesn't really explore the radical communist threat that had the government and hard line right wingers in a frenzy. Perhaps he used that as play on words, utilizing the word \\"red\\" as an association of the blood which was spilled in the streets of Chicago.This book is easy to read yet essential for anyone interested in race relations, as well as the WWI era. Despite the relatively short length of the book, Tuttle covers a lot of ground, from sociology to politics to labor issues, all of it tying into and culminating with the massive riot in July of 1919. Tuttle's main objective is to show the complexities of the issue; many people tend to simplify such things into pure hatred of others that they perceive as foreign or threatening. Tuttle shows the complex web without much bias, one that built and built until an all-out bloodbath was desired by both sides of the conflict. Though many of those involved believed that violence was the only solution, Tuttle shows that after so many deaths and injuries, a riot such as the one of 1919 did not occur in Chicago for decades. Even though there were plenty of incidents of racial hatred in the years following 1919, it seems that the torrents of blood had sickened the majority of both sides, and they realized that there must be another way of handling the situation.Tuttle's book starts with a bang, as he goes right into the riot in the second chapter, rather than writing in a purely linear format. I thought this gave the book a dramatic punch, similar to the way movie directors sometimes play with temporal progression. He gives brief mention to the \\"Red Scare\\" and the violent fear that it provoked in America, as well as the destabilization WWI had caused. The heart of his book is really an investigation into the sociology of the riot, using concise and interesting chapters to zone in on contributing factors that all added up to reach the boiling point of mass violence. Among them were the mass exodus of blacks from the south, both due to immigration shortages from Europe caused by the war, and employer's recruitment of blacks as cheap source of labor into the stockyards and industries, where the owners often used them as scabs to break strikes, which cause great hatred from the Irish and polish immigrants who competed for the same jobs.Turf war was also at the heart of the matter, as Irish gangs (mainly youth) drew \\"a line in the sand\\" at Wentworth Ave, across which blacks could not cross on the promise of violence. There was much outcry from the white community about \\"property depreciation\\", which is still a relevant topic in modern society. The Hyde Park-Kenwood Association formed to consolidate real estate agents and property owners into a pro segregation alliance that barred blacks from moving into certain neighborhoods. Often there was much hatred and prejudice involved in the decision to forbid black entrance into all white neighborhoods. The stereotype of blacks as criminal, ignorant, emotional all led to confrontation over civil rights. The fact that the mass influx from the south during WWI provided fodder for the racsists, as many newly arrived migrants were from the poorest areas of the south and were somewhat disoriented and unaccustomed to city life. It all boiled down the fact many lower class whites, among them Polish and Irish felt threatened by the exponential growth of the \\"black belt\\" between 1916 and 1919, as their turf and jobs were at stake. Though groups such as Ragen's Colts ( an athletic association that protected turf and were used by Chicago Democrats as election day muscle) did insite a lot of racial violence, not all Irish harbored hatred for the blacks, as after the riot the anti KKK stance of the Colts reminded them that they to had once been subjected to \\"nativist\\" hatred and bigotry.WWI played an important role in the black community in other ways; though many civilians moved from the south in response to the vertitable \\"eutopia\\" advertised by industrial recruiters (which proved to be far from the truth), blacks went to France in the hundred of thousands, with 42,000 seeing combat. Among them was the 108th Illinois, which became the 370th Infantry in the 92nd Division. When they returned home, much of the discipline and strength they learned in the service was spread to black community, as many veterans became model citizens. The flipside to this coin was the birth of a new black militancy, which had a deep mistrust of the police (for good reasons in 1919 Chicago) which only led to further senseless murders, yet was perhaps an inevitable response to intense pressure, often in the form of violence.There is also a chapter on politics, focusing on \\"Big Bill\\" Hale, the Republican who used his Ward 2 base of blacks to rise to the Mayors office, but was notorious for graft and corruption. He sounded very similar to Nucky Thompson on the show \\"Boardwalk Empire\\", in that he was the last of the \\"Lincoln Republicans.\\" This book provides a great multi angled perspective on a particular time and place, but is very relevant as the issue of race is still very debated today. Much of the same hatred and violence exist in urban areas, making Tuttle's book a valuable point of reference for the history of race relations and politics."},{"Title":"Race riot;: Chicago in the Red Summer of 1919 (Studies in American Negro life)","review":"Not only does William M.

I was comfortable enough to read straight through it in two sittings. The sidebar exercises were fun and informative. The gentle training methods used in this book work with the dog's natural behaviors, easing stress on both species. Not to be forgotten, the book was a lot of fun, too.Included in the index is a nice resource section packed with websites, mailing addresses, and telephone numbers of noteworthy organizations. There are even sections in the book that touch briefly on canine massage techniques and the possibility of telepathic communication with dogs.

Ahearn and Gathje define \\"ethics\\" as critical reflection on morality, which they describe as the construction of values, beliefs, and practices that order our life in society. They explain being good and doing right as two ways to think about ethics: being good relates to character traits, while doing right involves specific acts and duties.The book is divided into two sections, the first dealing with ethical methods and the second exploring such currently contentious issues as marriage, family and sexuality; war and violence; and stewardship of the economy and environment. Each chapter begins with several pages of background on the issue including an overview on the readings that follow. The readings represent a variety of sources. For example, material in the stewardship chapter is taken from scripture and the writings of Thomas Aquinas; John Wesley; the U.S. Catholic bishops; Gustavo Gutierrez, a founder of liberation theology; and Rosemary Radford Ruether, a leading feminist theologian."},{"Title":"Doing Right and Being Good: Catholic and Protestant Readings in Christian Ethics","review":"When I started at Lagrange Collage this fall I took my first religion class where we used the book Doing Right and Bring Good.

It is obvious to me that he truly experienced what he wrote upon. To him Intellection was not an abstract metaphysical principle. This is the miracle of true contemplative thought in the modern age._His emphasis tended more to the nature of what constitutes sacred art. That is why this volume is so well illustrated with both color plates, as well as, black and white images. His central message is that Tradition possesses a secret power that is communicated to an entire civilization; even in those arts and crafts whose objects include nothing particularly sacred. In a theocratic society, the humblest activity participates in heavenly benediction. In contrast, \\"sacred art\\" in the West since the Renaissance is essentially profane art with only a superficial religious theme._There are some thick, but important, volumes that you find yourself despairing that you will ever get to the end of. However, this thick volume of the essential Burckhardt (like its sister volume on the essential Schuon) is such a joy to read that you never want it to come to an end.

The language and ideas both sound archaic due to a radical loss of traditional forms and even degenerate customs to the point that what is old now sounds new. Burckhardt, I'm sure, would delight in such a circular manifestation of tradition. In a society where number has lost it's gender, where sacred art has lost it's object, and philosophy it's inner meaning, Burckhardt's plaintive sentences recall all of this and brings the perennial philosophy to bear in many of it's traditional manifestations. This philosophy, this perennialism is shown by virtue of man's loss of meaning when he attempts to abandon it, quite simply will not go away.

His world is the Pauline world. It is the world of the letter to the Colossians that declares the nature of Christ who is all in all. In Him all things consist. The very cosmos is held together by Him. He is the creator of the world. He also occupies His created world and does not live in a parallel universe. There is no one beyond God, in Christ, out there.Avery's argument is that most of our problems in understanding have come from the fact that the Christian Gospel has been occulted. That is the Gospel has been hidden. In addition to that, science has become a false religion. The two together have maintained a false equilibrium. The Gospel message has been hidden, and science has failed to speak the truth.Avery lays a portion of the blame for the hidden Gospel on our failure to declare what the true nature of man is. Unlike most theologians he does not see man as a bi-unity, body and soul, nor as a trinity, body, soul, and spirit, but as a quaternion, heart, soul, mind, and strength. He draws this understanding from the New Testament as a whole. He also draws it from the words of Jesus who said that we were to love God with all of our heart, soul, mind, and strength.Of particular concern to Avery is loving God with all our mind, which he believes has been underused in our modern understanding of the Christian faith. He is concerned that much of the occulting of the Gospel has come about because the Gospel has been hidden behind emotion. It has not been marched out into the light of reason and the mind where it can shine with its true brightness.His description of God is also Biblical. He describes God as I AM ONE LIVING. That means that God has an eternal existence, an undivided oneness, and is God of the living. He calls this the Domain Triad.The most fascinating section of the book is the section where he proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Christ is a hyper space alien. Not only that, Christ crowds out the very possibility of there being any other space aliens outside of Himself. He visited the earth from hyper space and by a cosmic operation set men free. The operation that He performed joined them to His death, resurrection, and ascension. The present place where we who have trusted in the Gospel now reside is in the third heaven at the right hand of God the Father. We are in Christ and He is in us. He is our all in all.The first section that I turned to was not the introduction. It was the section in which Avery recounts six conversations with people of various beliefs. When I first read this section I did not realize that this section formed the background for the entire book. It only became apparent later. His purpose is to communicate the Gospel in all of its truth and power to people like these. Alien Physics is written to provide a tool for discovering the truth of the Gospel.Even though there were a number of belief structures involved, in the people he interviewed, none of them comprehended that what Christ did was an actual physical operation that changed things forever. Neither could they understand that access to God's benefits was available now. The concept of Christ filling the entire cosmos was also foreign to them. Nevertheless all of these concepts are the Biblical understanding.Furthermore there was a wide spread belief in aliens from other planets among them. This is a concept that becomes impossible when you understand the Biblical concept of a creator who fills all in all.I must confess that, when I got to the section concerning Avery's having written a letter to Life Magazine, I stopped reading for several days. It seemed just too outrageous to me that he would write that he was a hyper space alien. Beyond that he wrote that he had the answers to the questions included in an article in Life Magazine.After several days I came back to the book. In the meantime I had become convinced that what Avery said was true. We, in fact, by our faith in Jesus Christ, have been joined to Christ. If He is an alien from hyper space, so are we. Paul said as much. The book of Ephesians states: \\"We are seated in the heavenlies.'' We reside in the third heaven. What does that make us? We are brothers of Christ. If He is an alien, who are we?Avery includes a critique of the book and the movie, Contact. The book was written by Carl Sagan. The movie starred Matthew McConaughey and Jodie Foster. McConaughey's character was a former preacher, and Foster's character was a scientist. Avery pointed out that both were unbelievers. Both failed to recognize the truth of the Bible. Both presented a false picture of the universe. They were looking for truth to come from alien intelligence. The United States government reproduced their error by setting up a similar scheme to Sagan's book in NASA-SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial intelligence).I first thought Avery's contact with NASA via \\"Life Magazine\\" was outrageous. I now see it as common sense. After all SETI cost the American tax payers millions of dollars with out a single result. Avery's letter did provide the answers at no cost to the tax-payer.In any case, I have not read a more provocative book in years. Indeed it is as he states as a chapter heading: \\"Heuristic Value of Alien Physics.\\" Heuristic means an aid to discovery. This book, Alien Physics, has aided me in discovering a God who is far greater than I ever dreamed.Pastor Ralph Ablin"},{"Title":"Alien Physics: The Physical Operation Performed upon the Cosmos","review":"The first thing that should be said is that unlike many books on a religious theme it does not give the usual \`Sermon from the Mount'.

I do not accept that God must exist, but do accept that it is impossible to prove that God does not exist. It is impossible to prove the non-existence of anything.Ron Avery and I have exchanged many emails over a long period on this subject, and I found the exchange to be most informative. I argued that his belief in God was founded on nothing more than faith, and as a \`scientific thinking man' I argued that this was hardly a reason for believing in anything. Ron replied that as a \`scientific thinking man' all my accepted facts and theories were also based on nothing more than faith. What nonsense I replied! However, he is right. Every axiom, every \`given', every hypothesis, starts with a basic assumption from which to begin, it starts with having faith in something. This came as a great surprise to me for I had argued with Ron that I had no faith at all and only believed in facts.How then could I now scoff at his faith in God when I have only the same faith in science?While on the subject of faith I have to admit that I had previously always associated the word with \`blind'. For \`faith read \`blind faith'. Since corresponding with Ron I now realise how mistaken this concept is. Faith does not require that you abandon all reason, judgement, logic, common sense and doubt, it allows all of these things, in fact it requires them. To accept a thing because you believe you must, is showing a complete lack of faith, you would have no reason to believe it, so how could you demonstrate faith in it? It is surprising what you can learn sometimes if you only open your mind and actually listen to people.I have now set the scene for giving a critique of Ron's book \`Alien Physics'. You now understand that I tend to be a logical thinking person that looks for hard facts. I am not a \`religious minded person' and I do not attend any church.

According to him Jesus Christ sublimated the cosmos and the devil was casted into the pit, has been released for a while and we are awaiting...The prohecies concerning Damascus and the splitting of the Mount of Olives came to my mind as two of a few that haven't been fulfilled. Avery prefers to focuss on a new celestial world (or sees the fulfillment of these symbolically).In a world plagued and obsessed by thoughts about alien invaders, costly space journeys and a division of science and religion this book breathes a renewed message of a world within."},{"Title":"A Photographic Atlas for the Microbiology Laboratory","review":"This atlas would be an excellent purchase for anyone interested in microbiology or for those students taking an introductory microbiology course (especially clinical/medical microbiology). The authors have included many common tests and stains performed in the laboratory, and contrary to what a previous reviewer has posted, this atlas contains many photographs that would be beneficial to those students having difficulty with bacterial identification in the lab. The authors have provided concise but relavent background information for all topics covered. There are only a few problems with the atlas. Aside from the fact that it is an unbound looseleaf package, for some the organization may leave something to be desired. Also, for those taking more advanced micro courses, the atlas may need to be supplemented with other material."},{"Title":"A Photographic Atlas for the Microbiology Laboratory","review":"I am an undergrad nursing student, and I can attest that this book is a great companion to microbiology lab activities. You can look up the microorganism you are viewing under the scope and compare what you see to the image the book displays. This is very helpful in this respect. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I do not care for the way it is organized. Overall, however, I would highly recommend this atlas to any microbiology student."},{"Title":"A Photographic Atlas for the Microbiology Laboratory","review":"I highly recommend that you don't spend the extra money on the photographic atlas if you have purchased the lab manual (Laboratory Theory and Applications) by the same authors. There is nothing special about it and it has all the same pictures that are in the lab manual.....If you don't plan on getting the lab manual then it is very interesting and I recommend it."},{"Title":"A Photographic Atlas for the Microbiology Laboratory","review":"I bought this as a first year medical student in hopes that it would simplify and better illustrate the complicated world of microbiology. In the end, it was a totally useless book. The pictures are average but really low yeild. If you are a med student trying to find pictures, I strongly reccomend you look elsewhere. If you are an undergrad and have tons of time on your hands, get it and waste a nice weekend or two. Otherwise stick to the assigned books. If you are a proffesor who has chosen this as an assigned book, shame on you!!!"},{"Title":"A Photographic Atlas for the Microbiology Laboratory","review":"This book is useless, it doesn't even come bound, it's just a bunch of sheets w/ holes in them so you can place this in a binder. The book isn't great because it is far from an atlas. It is more like a lab manual, explaining a little about the different lab tests. It basically has only one picture(in color)for different examples of each bacterium. Seeing as how it's an atlas, I assumed it to have lots of different pictures of each bacterium. Furthermore, it occupies alot of space with useless low yield info such as chemical structures. If you're buying this book for pictures of bacterium and virus, don't, because you can find comparable pictures on the internet. Also, not sure about this, but it doesn't seem that the authors are PhD's or MD's. They don't list a designation after their name, which may not matter to you, but I've found that most of the useful books are written by PhD's/MD's. SUmmary: Low Yield Book; Should not include atlas in the title because it is far from one.."},{"Title":"A Photographic Atlas for the Microbiology Laboratory","review":"A Photographic Atlas for the Microbiology Laboratory allows students to see results they might expect from an experiment. The atlas provides an good review of procedures and results that students may have already seen. The atlas helps beginning students have confidence that the results they are seeing have indeed been seen by others."},{"Title":"A Photographic Atlas for the Microbiology Laboratory","review":"This was a required text for my micro class. It was sometimes a little helpful, but it mostly didn't have the answers to my questions. It covers too much in too few pages. The only time that I really found it to be helpful was in reading test results. When I wasn't sure if, for example, my VP broth had really changed color enough to be a positive result, the large glossy pictures were nice. However, when I was trying to figure out colonial morphology, only about half the terms that we were supposed to know were covered in the book. Not so helpful. So, as I stated earlier, this book is helpful when it covers the information that you need, but I was never sure if what I was looking for would be covered in the book."},{"Title":"A Photographic Atlas for the Microbiology Laboratory","review":"This is an excellent book for the Micro student.

In contrast to many of the polemics and platitudes which are often offered up in popular debates, Masters provides a rich and complex description of interconfessional relations which were dynamic and changing. For scholars of the late Ottoman Empire or its minorities, this work is a \\"must read,\\" bringing into question much of the received wisdom regarding both the millet system and its breakdown. For those, who simply want to have a basic understanding of the relation between Islam and subject non-Muslims, one could hardly do better than his chapter, \\"The Limits of Tolerance.Apparently there is a paperback version of this work which, as of this writing (9/20/05), is offered directly from CUP but not on Amazon."},{"Title":"Teaching Black Girls (Counterpoints)","review":"This book is incredible!! Through extensive research, the author explores reasons for the success of black girls in school. The real-life accounts of the girls who were studied allowed me to make personal connections with the young women.

It includes contributions from several respected scholars on insight that are very thought provoking. It isn't a book that will deliver answers as much as promote more questions.My purpose for reading this book was to look at several different ways of explaining insight....what is it? How does it work? Where does it come from? Can it be taught or is it something we are born with? Is it tied to intelligence or is it an independent variable? This book helped me gain all of that and much more.The authors provide theories about insight that are well grounded in empirical research, including ties to organization development and social insight, where my interest lies. As an extra bonus, there were several pages of visual puzzles that can be used to test and promote the development of insight, that I will try using in my research."},{"Title":"The Nature of Insight (Bradford Books)","review":"This is not a book for the faint of heart. It's wordy, academic and scattered; the structure of the content seems to be an afterthought. That being said, if you're really looking for a deep and rigorous dive into the topic of how people generate insight, this is the book. It's incredibly rich in terms of information, and a welcome change from the low-grade crap that other books offer when they touch on this underexplored subject.

When I received this book, I opened it expecting anecdotes and little things to do in my daily living to help me get through my depression. However, the book focuses entirely on Christianity. Phrases such as &quot;The person who is depressed should ask himself what he is doing to make himself depressed. He may discover that he is living a lifestyle that is clearly against God.&quot; For those to which this statement applies, the book could be very helpful.

It was the right &quot;chemical&quot; medicine, from a great doctor, which saved my mental life. I would still be in a state of horrible depression, if i was waiting for Prayer as a cure.

The first one is finally treated only by correct &quot;chemical&quot; medication, which brings you out of the depression itself.

Mild depression, on the other hand, is treated by talking out your problem. A certain idea in your head is bothering you; after talking about it( whether death of a friend, husband, or loss of a job), a person over a period of time comes out of depression.

Depression is a crippling disease that requires treatment and therapy just like any other and anybody who has ever fought it knows this. What this book screamed to me as someone who is vulnerable to mild depression, is that people allow themselves to be depressed; That depression is an attitude, perhaps one I can wake up tomorrow and throw out the window. But the truth is, it is not. It is not something we imagine nor is it something we can forget. In fact, sometimes, we don't even have a clue what is causing it in our lives so how can we simply &quot;pray for it to end.&quot; I'm somebody who talks to God and prays for help with a lot of the challenges that come across my life, but even I know that depression is not something, which will simply go away with prayer.

Except for the scene where the protagonist whacks a bully across the face with the short length of a two-by-four, the only crimes committed are theft and fraud. Too character-driven to be a straight caper novel, BUSTED FLUSH is a funny and fascinating story about the shady side of human nature.In upstate New York, Dock Bass doesn't have a midlife crisis, he has a midlife awakening. To use a biblical expression, the scales fall from his eyes. He sees a discontented wife, a dishonest boss, and a bucolic past being wiped from the face of the earth by a newly-rich couple building a McMansion.Dock throws clothes, books and fishing tackle into his red '91 Ford pickup truck and heads for Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, leaving his wife and the local gossips to invent their own reasons for his disappearance.Dock has a letter from a Gettysburg attorney advising him of an inheritance. It turns out to be a small farm passed down to him through a series of relatives he never really knew. Dock decides not to sell the property but to move in and renovate the old farmhouse.Meanwhile, in Washington D.C., a star TV reporter named Amy is heading for Chicago to cover the baseball World Series. Amy, whose favorite person is herself with a Porsche Cayenne Turbo in second place, hates the assignment. She wants to go to Aruba to track a political scandal story. Her boss uses the carrot-and-stick approach: First, the World Series, then Aruba.By the time the Series ends the big story is in Gettysburg, where Dock Bass's renovations have uncovered the workshop of a young photographer/inventor/diarist who died in the Civil War. His parents sealed off the room just as he left it, and sealed it has remained since 1864.Among the contents are 223 glass photo plates which include seven candid shots of Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg, and a contraption called a phonautograph which seems to have recorded Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.Word spreads. Collectors, connivers, Civil War buffs, outraged Edison scholars and reporters come from all directions. Typical are a New York agent who tells Dock that \\"the whole idea of the Civil War is sexy\\"; a rapper named J'Makir Slim who has written a hip-hop number based on the Gettysburg Address, and two local phonies who have designs on the entire treasure trove.And then there's Amy. Once again, Aruba must wait. Her boss is a noted collector and he wants the phonautograph. He already has one but it doesn't have a cylinder with a recording of the Gettysburg Address. He sends the protesting Amy to Gettysburg with instructions to use her feminine wiles on Dock Bass and bring back the machine.Her feminine wiles get her nowhere with Dock, but she has more maneuvers than Robert E. Lee and wouldn't acknowledge a lost cause if it turned around and bit her. Then into this stew plops a turnip named Leona, who claims to be the real heir of the farm's previous owner.Dock is willing to turn it all over to Leona if her claim is legitimate. He tells Amy, \\"The pictures, the diary, the recording -- it's all about the Gettysburg Address, and everybody wants a piece of it. What they don't seem to realize is that everybody already has it. In a hundred and fifty years they haven't figured out what to do with it.\\"Still, the whole thing has a smell about it. Dock decides to call Leona's bluff and run one of his own, and that's why I stayed up most of the night to finish reading the book.I kept thinking of Paul Newman in \\"Nobody's Fool.\\" If Newman were 40 instead of 80, he would be the perfect Dock Bass, who is certainly nobody's fool. As it turns out, neither is Amy."},{"Title":"Busted Flush","review":"Everybody in Coppers Falls, New York has an explanation why Dock Bass left town, leaving his social climbing spouse and the realty job she pushed him into behind as he resents one and hates the other. In fact, no one is close to the truth why abruptly Dock, who enjoys fishing and cards with beer left town. Simply the letter from the Pennsylvania attorney gave Dock a reason and means to skip for he has inherited a farm in the Gettysburg area.On his new homestead that needs immense cleaning, Dock finds nineteenth century treasures especially valuable Civil War artifacts, but the prize is an apparent recording of Lincoln delivering the Gettysburg address. For someone who sought mellow, Dock finds he becomes the center of a storm with the media, treasure hunters, avaricious \\"friends\\", and his greedy wife.Using hyperbole to exaggerate traits, Brad Smith provides a biting satire on America where everything from the Blair House to the Lincoln Room to an Inauguration is on sale. Nothing is sacred regardless of what it might be as there is a price for everything as unassuming Dock learns during the shark infested frenzy. Fans of wild lampooning and historical buffs (while cringing with the for sale sign) will enjoy this sharp edged tale and ponder could Monica's dress be E-Bay bound?Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Busted Flush","review":"clever story with the cool guy, sexy lady and a boy from the civil war as a character. loved the read and without giving a long boring review- I will say it reminded me of a Hiaasan story"},{"Title":"Busted Flush","review":"A very interesting, well developed story, about re-enactors and a great historical discovery in Gettysburg that will rewrite history.I enjoyed it; however, the historical errors detracted from the story for me.

When I first started reading it, I have to admit I was little confused. The first chapter kept me in a fog as to what was happening, but my teacher just told me to keep reading and I'd understand. As I kept going, I realized she was right.This book is full of mystery and a great plot twist at the end. To all of those who haven't read it, I'll kept it a secret. But let me tell you, you'll be in for a shock when you find the REAL reason of Rebecca's death. You imagine her as a pure and lovely person and the truth makes your head spin. I also loved how the main character was left un-named. It kept you one step away from her, always wanting to know more information.I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars because occasionally, there were long paragraphs about the narrorator's fantasies that were just out of place and weren't of any use in the plot. But that aside, an amazing read. I recommend it for a rainy day mystery read."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"The reason the book is called Rebecca is because, even if she was dead from the beginning of the story, Rebecca is the only interesting character in it. That is not to say the book is bad, not at all; it's charged with suspense and mystery from the moment Mr De Winter brings home wife number two, a simple young girl with the personality of a rabbit, who as soon as she arrives to Manderley is intimidated by the memory of the incomparable Rebecca, as present in her death as she was in life. Terrorized by a creepy servant who idolized her former mistress, bit by bit the second Mrs De Winter reconstructs the past of her new family and, of course Rebecca's. In some parts the story becomes a little heavy, besides, I found the atmosphere quite depressing, but I think that adds to the story, that sense of dread that comes from feeling Rebecca's awesome presence all over the lives of those involved with Manderley. It's a very, very good book, and I'm anxious to see the movie Hithcock made based on it, only him could do justice to this kind of story. A perfect choice to read in a stormy night."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This novel places the reader in the setting of the English countryside and in the lives of Maxim De Winter and his new bride. I read this in college and have not gone a year since without reading it. I have my high school english students reading this novel also.

Even my sports minded husband has enjoyed it with me."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I have read it a thousand times and I am still captivated by the sensory details Daphne DuMaurier uses. I have been to Manderly, I have stood in the gallery hall, I have seen Mrs. Danvers- cold and angry and I have watched Mrs. DeWinter grow from a gauky girl into a woman. I have sometimes felt as if I were at tea with them in the library and I could almost pet Jasper's head.This is a classic literary work. It never ages and I give this book as a gift to special friends at Christmas and everyone of them has done the same.There will never be another story to parallel this."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I loved the exquisite language from an author of the past. The words, the sentence structure had me hanging on every word. If you like a mystery, it is definitely a must read."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This was required reading for a feminine gothic class and I loved it! The story is timeless and relevant in any century. The language isn't like it would be in a Jane Austen novel, so that makes it easy to read and understand. The writing and plot is scandalous. I would encourage any woman or young woman to read this novel over the swill (that shall remain nameless) that is being published now."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I had seen the film so many times that I decided that it was time to read the book. I enjoyed the book as much as the film. I am looking forward to reading more of Du Maurier's work."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book was recommended to me as &#34; The Romantic Novel &#34; to read. And as the Author says in the after word of the book, a reader can see it in two ways, romantic and thought provoking. I am one of the latter. It reminds one, that many years ago, a relationship was not just &#34; red roses and sunshine&#34; . That marrying into a certain social society was harsh. The book had a good twist, good story, was very descriptive and one got feel what the character went through.... Reading the afterword, gives one a better sense of what Daphne Du Maurier was accomplishing with the book."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I love this author. Great writing, great story. Thanks Amazon for a great price. I am now reading du Maurier's other books. She has that effect on the reader......"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This novel is one of my lifetime favorites. I havre read the book 3 times. I purchased this copy because my local library did not have a copy any longer."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"The book is well written and captivating. The author invites you into a world that is not well defined in time; you are ushered into a story told by an unnamed young lady who gets married to a rich man whose wife had fairly recently died. The main character, a shy and naive young lady, undergoes quite a transformation not only as she takes in her new role as a wife, but also as she struggles to meet the expectations for someone in her position. Her personal limitations are only a small piece in the puzzle that eventually reveals itself.The story varies in pace. At one point it really picks up and it becomes very hard to put down. I recommend this book; it makes for a good read."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"It took me awhile to actually get pulled into the book. It was overly descriptive for the longest time which made it quite boring in the beginning because there was nothing to sink my teeth into. It did turn into a really good story and the author did a great job using description to set the eerie tone and provide suspense from about the middle of the book until the end. The very ending (actually the last paragraph) was disappointing. It was abrupt and left me hanging.There was no life lesson or history lesson to be learned as there are in a lot of the classics, but it was a worthy read for its entertainment value."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I enjoyed the book, and it kept me guessing. But - did they live happily ever after? And what happened to Mrs. Danvers?"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I have been a big fan of the 1940 movie Rebecca by Alfred Hitchcock. It is one of my all time favorite movies. But I have not read the book. It is a very highly rated book written just before the movie in 1938.The story is that a young woman (who narrates the book, but is never actually named) marries a rich, older widower (Maxim de Winder). He brings her home to his estate where she is continually haunted by the first Mrs de Winter. This not really a ghost story, but rather the story of how the young bride feels compared to the other woman.It is a psychological thriller. There is no violence, no sex, no bad language, but just a feeling of inferiority and tension that drives the book. The gender roles of the book are dated. And at times I just wanted the 2nd Mrs de Winter (or her husband) to pay attention to what was going on around them. But on the whole it stands up very well after 70 years.Hitchcock was very true to the story, so if you are familiar with the movie you will be basically familiar with the book. The book and movie have very different endings. I am somewhat mixed about which I prefer. But both play out well and have their own strengths.Daphine du Maurier had three more short stories or novels adapted into films by Hitchcock, including his classic \\"The Birds\\"."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"A wonderful book about mystery and love, a love story between a man who is very powerful and a women who is not at all. A women becomes acquainted with Maximilian de Winter, and agrees to marry him, After marriage, the new bride realizes how important her husband's first wife was, Rebecca who is thought by Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper, to be the most beautiful and ladylike women. Rebecca apparently dyed from drowning in an accident. What follows next is an amazing tale of murder and intrigue and an ending that will keep you guessing till the end, and when it's over you'll just want more."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I read this book for our September book club meeting. The author's style of writing sends you back to a former time period. You actually see Manderlay through the eyes of the narrator. The eeriness of Mrs. Danvers comes through loud and clear. Even if you've read this before and seen Alfred Hitchcock's movie, it is still great fun."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Books like Rebecca remind me from time to time what quality literature really is. Sometimes I forget, buried under stacks of entertaining but often poorly written popular fiction.At first, Rebecca is strangely reminiscent of another favorite book of mine - Jane Eyre. The main character is a young, innocent, poor girl who falls in love with a rich older man. The happiness is so near, but the shadow of the man's first wife stands in the way of it. A family secret, a haunted mansion, a deranged servant, and a fire are also major players in the story.I've said it before, I personally don't mind borrowed themes, but only if done right. A talented writer can reinterpret and reinvent an old story, add new layers to it, and Daphne du Maurier does just that. The book is beautifully written, it is haunting, it is suspenseful.I also think it takes a gifted writer to make readers get attached to a character as insecure, jealous, and timid as the second Mrs. de Winter. Daphne du Maurier succeeds once more. The main character is very compelling and her fears are palpable. I found myself sharing the heroines insecurities (after all, why shouldn't she question her husband's feelings toward her if he treats her like a child, a pet and doesn't make an effort to let her know where he stands in regard to his first wife?), being scared of and intimidated by Mrs. Danvers, and taunted by the memories of the first (possibly superior) wife.Rebecca is simply a great book all around, deservedly a masterpiece of English literature and from now on - a new favorite love story of mine, to be treasured and kept near Gone With the Wind, Jane Eyre, Pride and Prejudice, Wuthering Heights, and The Thorn Birds."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Daphne du Maurier is one of the best novelists of our time and Rebecca is one of the best suspense novels of our era. This enthralling novel encompasses the very best of romantic suspense and murder mystery. The author succinctly shows us how perception and reality can be perceived as polar opposites and the consequences of misconstrued assumptions about others can lead to estrangement and confusion.Rebecca is the deceased, first Mrs. de Winter and when our narrator, the second Mrs. de Winter, arrives at Manderly she is bombarded with a house enshrined to the memories of the first Mrs. De Winter who, by all appearances, was the perfect wife and socialite - beautiful, intelligent. Her untimely death was a terrible shock to Manderly and the people who knew her. The second Mrs. De Winter feels she will never fit in but before long she realizes that all is not what meets the eye.The key players, from the brooding Maxim de Winter, the sinister Mrs. Danvers, the beautiful Rebecca, our story's narrator, and de Winter's haunting estate, Manderly, are so real and come alive as characters. The story is very intense and sets a hypnotic, haunting mood and keeps you turning the pages from the enticing beginning to the surprising end.This novel has it all, murder, mystery, romance, and suspense and it is one of the best love stories ever written. Ms. du Maurier has written one of the finest gothic suspense novels of our time."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Daphne DuMaurier, who is little known today by many modern readers, published her fifth novel, 1938's 'Rebecca' which went on to become of the most popular novels of all time. But, be it damned or hailed, 'Rebecca' is a novel that still stands today as an intricate work of deep set emotions, psychological insights and complex relationships among human beings during the course of one hopelessly doomed and failed marriage. It has been called a gothic novel, which is not far off, for the atmosphere of DuMaurier's Rebecca is something of sinister and cold, with Manderley as its forbidding crown and of course it's now deceased former mistress, Rebecca herself.Mind you, the novel is slow at first, taking quite a bit of time with a lengthy introduction, which as mentioned in any other review of this novel, contains one of the most well known lines in fiction, \\"Last Night I Dreamt I went to Manderley again', but the beginning creates a cold, depressing atmosphere that quickly turns into an interesting, if not odd, romance between a strange rich English man named Maxim DeWinter and the unknown protagonist of the novel who is never given a name, a ploy obviously done on purpose by Ms. DuMaurier herself. The story takes off then, and shoots into a new bold direction where the romance blossoms, Maxim and her marry and move to his big mansion called Manderley where a creepy housekeeper called Mrs. Danvers and the looming presence of a Maxim's infamous first wife torment the young new bride into a realm of terror and mystery.The book itself has quite a bit of controversy surrounding it. First off, Ms. DuMaurier was sued in court for the act of plagiarizing the novel but won her case, it has also been called a rip off of Charlotte Bronte's well known 'Jane Eyre' I have read both novels and although Jane Eyre stands today as a classic, it is not anything like DuMaurier's \`Rebecca'. First off, Bronte's \`Jane Eyre' stands as a testimony of one woman who stands up for herself and thanks to several wild twists of fate gets a happy ending. \`Rebecca' although, deals with a woman who once again, like Jane, marries a rich man who owns a creepy old mansion and has a secret about his former wife, is a different story. When reading \`Rebecca' I find that the novel deals more about marriage, and how it fails, and the things we do to keep it going. \\"We can never go back,\\" says the narrator at the beginning of Chapter Two, \\"that much is certain. The things we have tried to forget and put behind us, would stir again...\\" By reading that line, we can clearly see DuMaurier was writing about the demons we all keep locked away in our closets, the things that haunt us, torment us and obviously, in her heroine's and husband's case, ruin us. Jane Eyre, although dealing with demons, tends to focus more on the main character and deals with one woman's entire life, rather than a single time period. It also has a happier ending, where as \`Rebecca' doesn't. By the end we know that although they remain married, both characters are doomed to always be haunted, always be troubled and always remember what happened. They will never happy. They will go on living forever in a state of dull compliancy trying to escape the past. The marriage is failed in the end. It's a disaster. Rebecca will always haunt them. Always.I also believe that is this a very personal work for Ms. DuMaurier. There are tons of little one liners that seem to suggest she had a strong connection with her writing. \\"Happiness is not a possession to be prized. It is a quality of thought, a state of mind,\\" her heroine suggests early on. And, later, one of the characters suggests that there is almost nothing worse than a failed marriage. Maxim seems to think so, suggesting what happened between his first wife and him. It is said, that DuMaurier herself was unhappy with her own marriage and highly suggested in her biography as well as the dramatazion of her life in the BBC special, \`Daphne' which makes the claim that Daphne DuMaurier had two lesbian affairs. Whether this is true or not, I don't really know.Is \`Rebecca' melodramatic? At times, yes. Is \`Rebecca' a masterpiece? Yes. I would say so. And, although I claim DuMaurier as not only my personal favorite author, but as one of the best I have ever read from, I will say that \`Rebecca' takes the cake for her very best. In my opinion, it is her most personal effort, her most strong and powerful. I do suggest reading her other works, especially, \\"I'll Never Be Young Again,\\" and \\"My Cousin Rachel.\\" But, I will not lie, \`Rebecca' is not for everyone. I find it relatable, and insightful as well as a gripping emotional mystery. Give it a read, it is worth it, still. In the end, you can tell that \`Rebecca' in all it's glory, its power, and style is DuMaurier herself in its own special way."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Since I had always loved the Hitchcock film, I decided to read the book upon which it was based. For whatever reason--somewhat to the dismay of those around me at the time--this work brought out the (former) English major in me.At first, I thought the writing was laughable. For instance, I found the following statement highly ironic: \\"I have had enough melodrama in this life, and would willingly give my five senses if they could ensure us our present peace and security.\\" Eventually, I think I became so enveloped in the story that the chintzy style became secondary.I failed to really see the romance in this, though. Or perhaps, I should say that I did not see romance between individuals. The underlying theme of this book, I felt, was a lack of identity. The second Mrs. de Winter (whose name, by the way, is never revealed) was always comparing herself to the first Mrs. de Winter. She became obsessed with attempting not to disturb the life established by her predecessor. She had no spine, no opinions of herself. As for her \\"love\\" life with her husband, through most of the book she compared herself to her husband's spaniel. It wasn't until she began to learn the truth about Rebecca that the second Mrs. de Winter showed any character at all.Mr. de Winter was also plagued by a lack of identity. Come to find out, his reason for marrying Rebecca was to keep up this \\"ideal\\"of Manderley. He let his life be led by a lying, manipulative, though highly organized she-thing in order to maintain this facade of posh, idyllic country living. And, symbolically enough, once Rebecca had been destroyed completely and finally put to rest, that which she symbolized also had been destroyed.This novel is certainly gothic, but like I said, I failed to see the romance. It's a fairly quick, fairly interesting read (if you can get past the schmaltz). But, don't feel guilty if you just want to watch the movie."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I LOVED this book! It was recommended to me by a librarian for a book report. I absolutely fell in love with it. I never guessed the ending. If you like mystery and romance this book is for you. Du Maurier does a wonderful job with the unnamed nararrator. I feel as though I am in Manderley through her and the other characters."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Daphne DuMaurier's finest work of art. &quot;Rebecca&quot; was the most magnificent piece of work she did. The &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; was a great book also, but &quot;Rebecca&quot; just out does any other book she has ever written. This book was just a masterpiece. This mystery romance was just beautifully written and deserves a whole lot of acclaim."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I am 15 years old and read this book for the first time when I was 13. I loved it! It truely intrigues me. I have read it twice since then just because I liked it so much. I have already taken the PSAT, and I know I would not have known some of those words if it were not for reading Rebecca. I know I learned anywhere from 20-50 new words to add to my expanding vocabulary. All I have to say is:IT WAS GREAT!!!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"&quot;Last night I dreamed I went to Manderley again...&quot;, I was captured. Probably one of my top five favorite books, &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; being first. I simply loved this story and the way it is written. They don't write novels like this any longer. The words and sentences are more clipped and spartan nowadays, and while I can't put down a John Grisham novel I also couldn't put down &quot;Rebecca&quot;. And how many people noticed, I wonder, that the author never mentions the second Mrs. de Winter's first name, whereas the name of the first Mrs. de Winter, Rebecca, dominates everything! You must read it."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I read Rebecca when I was in high school. Since then I read this book periodically. There are very few writers who can write a wonderfully sensuous love story. Ms. Dumaurier stands out in that category. Her books have the right blend of romance and mystery. It is indeed a pity that this book is out of print on Amazon.com. Reading Ms. Dumaurier's books is a special treat for me and I try to savour them since there will be no more of these books."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I just finished reading this novel for the second time, and though I knew what was going to happen at the end, the magic was not lost. I admit the first two chapters do not grab ones' attention; but the rest of this wonderful novel is worth the wait. I am also aware that some found the extensive detail boring and unnecissary, but I felt that it only added to the suspense and entire flavour. I would recommend this classic to anyone."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"As a middle-aged male, I am probably not the typical reader of &quot;Rebecca&quot;. I raced through it in one weekend, careening through the many hair-pin turns that come one upon another in the last third of the book. The reviewers who complain of the slow pace of the first third should understand that the groundwork must be laid for the excitement to follow. I had to force myself to slow down so as to savor Ms. Du Maurier's enchanting descriptive writing style (being a gardener helps one appreciate the descriptions) . I must differ with all those who state that the main character remained un-named throughout the book. The main character was named... &quot;Manderley&quot;."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I loved this book. Despite the &quot;never-ending&quot; length, I enjoyed reading it. Because of Du Maurier's detailed descriptions of the setting, the reader will feel as if they had been sent back in time. Pay close attention to the facts of the story, because the ending is a 180 degree turn in a different direction! I gave the book four stars and not five because it is very long and some what slow to start start."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Daphne DuMaurier's novel, &quot;Rebecca&quot; was one of the best novels I ever read. She really knows how to describe the scene. I could picture the beautiful flowers she described. It went kind of slow when Maxim wasn't around, but that made me want to read ahead. I read this book in 3 days, I couldn't put it down. This book was assigned as a summer reading book, so I was surprised when I actually liked it. I finished it a week ago, but now I find myself reading it again. Also, the movie &quot;Rebecca&quot; with Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier was very, very good. They only changed it a little but besides that it was wonderful."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This has to be one of the best books I've ever read. I couldn't put it down. I loved it so much, it was such a magical story. Just when you thought you had it all figured out, DuMaurier adds a twist. This is a must read"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I think that this novel is about a lot more then romance and mystery. It is about the power of sex and how people use it. Rebecca was a women who was born with the knowlage of a mature adult. She spends her life expanding that understanding .DeMaurier gives you just enough glimses of her to tell you that the reasone that she is so powerful is that Rebecca has no soul. No one with a soul would do what she does to that horse at 16. She was also a woman who has an appatite for both men and women. This is not evedent untill you read the novel as an adult. It is also a very powerful exploration of the differences and the simmilarities betwene men and women.This is a very powerful novel and I recomend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"My mom brought me this book from a library, and it looked rather dull, so I never got around to reading it. Then I was bored one day, and remembered it. So I got it out and began my journey to Manderly. As many other people have said, it was a bit slow in the beginning, but it does get ever so much better, so for those of you who didn't make it all the way through, you really should try again. The book was extremely well written, and the plot was terrific. I especially loved the way the characters (mainly the un-named Mrs. De Winter) felt and thought in some of the same ways that I do. I haven't seen the mivie yet, but plan to, and I can't wait to get my hands on the sequal. This was a really excellent book, and I recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I do admit, I wasn't impressed with this book from the beginning. It was one of my mother's favorites, and she bought it for me one day and urged me to read it. The start of the story was rather slow and being a teenager, I need a lot to keep my interest. After the first hundred pages or so, I could not put this down! In the end, I had stayed up until five in the morning and could not fall asleep afterwards because I was thinking of this book so much. And then I got ready for school, and thought about it all day. If you are rather skeptical about this book, please just try it!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca keeps you in suspense, while you feel connected to the characters. Daphne Du Maurier writes it in the main character's view, but also explores many other character's aspects. When I was reading it, I told myself I would read one chapter, but then I would go on to read three or four chapters. I just could not put it down. It is definitely a classic."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I'm 14 years old and I read this book for a school book report. I usually don't like classics, but this one was really good since it was also a mystery novel and I love mysteries. This one was also a great thriller. The beginning was a little boring, but don't get discouraged 'cause it's worth the wait. I know other people who've read it and liked it so I really think you should read this awesome book."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I first read it when I heard my friends discuss about it during lunch time. I read it for a few times for I am only a teenage school girl and my comment of English is not very good. Anyway, I am really glad that I have pick up the book. It is the only book that kept me so well in suspense and the ending is so well set that I can not help reading it again and again. I know there is a reason for Daphne not to reveal the narrator's name. But it really set me wonder whether Daphne had actually a name for her in mind. The reason why I had given only 4 stars is because though this is a magnificient book, but it still could not surpass my favorite book, &quot; Gone with the wind&quot;."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I had to read &quot;Rebecca&quot; for a school assignment. I'm certainly glad that I did! This was one of the best books I have ever read, and I have read a variety of books! I have never read a book with so many plot twists that leaves you in suspense throughout the story. By the end of each chapter you find yourself thinking that you know the outcome of the plot when it is actually the total opposite. I can't wait to read &quot;Mrs. de Winter&quot; which I am planning on going out and buying it tonight. Be sure to read this book and recommend it to all of your friends!P.S. If you don't like romance stories or mysteries then you are just like me, but I think that &quot;Rebecca&quot; will totally change your whole perspective on romantic mysteries."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is the first time I know of, Where the main character is active but not present.

I think You should see Hitchcock's movie first &amp; then read the book, It will make the book even better."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book is one of the finest pieces of work that I ever read! I usually dislike to read long books or romatic novels but this one was too good to put down! I also saw the movie and it was excellent too! Teens, adults and even middle age children~ read it and you will love it!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is a FABULOUS book--except that for the first 200 pages literally nothing exciting happens. All that's going on is that Mrs. Danvers hates the girl (whose name we never find out) with an undying passion. Until I found out Max's deep dark secret, I almost fell asleep reading this. But after that it's interesting.Another aspect I didn't like was the lack of any kind of real relationship between the two main characters. They're married, right? And they kiss maybe twice. It's wrong. (In my opinion, anyway.) But I think it made for interesting Freudian analysis of Max.The back of this book insists that it's filled with romantic suspense, and it is. And it's even worth sitting through the first 200 pages."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I loved reading that book because it was very interesting. At the beginning I knew never how the book would end. In the middle of the story I had a completely different opinion of Rebecca than at the end, and that makes the whole story very exciting. When Maxim told his second wife what Rebecca was like, I could understand her. I could identify with her feelings at that moment and it was clear to me that she was still in love with Maxim. My guess is that Favell may have burnt down Manderley. The English is easy enough and you will understand it very well."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"An Interesting Novel The novel is very interesting. It's easy to read. What intrigues me is the fact that the author doesn't tell us the name of the new Mrs de Winter. The relationship of Mr and Mrs de Winter is very complicated because it isn't only a relationship of love."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I think that Rebecca is a very good book. It was never boring to read it, it was always so exciting because I never knew what the end would be like. In school we have also seen the film of \\"Rebecca\\" and I found it not so good as the book, because in the film the persons have sometimes had other character traits. For example Mrs. de Winters was a bit stupid, meek and weak there. But the film was good to understand some scenes of the story. I thought a lot about this book and I want to give praises to the writer, Daphne du Maurier."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"At the beginning of this book, I was very puzzled because there a lot of different characters were introduced. But if you go on reading, the rest is very interesting. Rebecca is a book you can read and understand even if you aren't an expert at reading English literature yet. A thrilling book of love and fear that I can really recommend."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is a thrilling story. I've read it willingly. It's not a nice story. Mrs de Winter has a lot to bear but it makes her stronger. I find that this book shows the power of love. Because without this belief in love Mrs de Winter would not have hat the strength to fight for her husband. The end of the story is hard. I thought that it would be a &quot;Happy Ending&quot; but that's only half the truth."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I found Rebecca was a very interesting book to read, it was very exciting and trilling. It was not very difficult to understand but it was also not too easy. I can recommend it to anyone who likes trilling stories."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is a wonderfully written story which was greatly enhanced by Jean Marsh's reading it. I was convinced that Maxim was mourning the loss of his first wife. What I shocker when the truth came out. The twists and turns of the plots in this book kept me jumping to all kinds of conclusions. I would have given this book 5 stars if it concluded with what happened to Maxim and his second wife; come to think of it, I don't think her first name was ever mentioned. Anyway, the book left me wanting more and if you read it, so will you."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"i started out thinking this was going to be an enjoyable but somewhat light gothic romance- the huge estate, the sadistic servant, the distant and brooding husband, haunted rooms and hidden meanings in even the smallest gestures.often we slip into our nameless heroine's imaginings of things that have or might happen, mostly rooted in her well founded insecuritiesthen suddenly, in a few pages, everything shifts. what follows is a very different, disturbing view of the world our characters inhabit. an impressive, spooky story."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I loved this book! If you can get past the boring beginning it is GREAT!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book is one of the best I've read. The description is brilliant, the plot clever, and the voices of the characters realistic. The only thing is is that it isn't a book you can read over and over."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is an interesting book about a young girl who is pulled form her comfort zone as a companion into the world of the rich and famous.

She loves it, but she feel that she is in the shadow of Rebecca, Maxim's first wife. None of the servants like her either. A boat wrecks in Manderly's bay and while they are checking for leaks they come across Rebecca's boat. There is a body inside! There is then an inquest into how she died.

It took me awhile to get into thought, but after a few chapters, I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"'Rebecca' is an intresting book, I read it very fast because I liked to know what Rebecca was like and why Maxim is so weird.The story about the storyteller's jealousy of a dead person and the murder is very thrilling, but, and that's the reason why I woulden't give five stars, I don't like the behaivour of the storyteller very much, I think she doesn't fight for her love, she never speaked with her husband, she gives up and thinks her marriage have failed, although her 'enemy' is dead."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I think the book Rebecca is very good! some passages are a bit boring, but only a bit.You understand what Daphne Du Maurier means and the story is very interesting. You think Maxim did love Rebecca but it wasn't true and you don't know at first what's wrong.In the part of the novel, Daphne Du Maurier made the plot quite thrilling! That was the part for me. The end is a bit sarcastic, but ok!!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I recommend the book anybody, who doesn't want to make a fault by searching a new novel to read. You will surely love the book. As I read the book for the first time I found the beginning a little bit difficult to understand, but after two or three chapters I began to understand the story and gradually I couldn't stop reading. What I specially like, is the uncertainty of what will happen. The course of the story always changes, every moment things can happen, that you would never expect. Another interesting point is that the book doesn't begin with the beginning of the story, but with the end. At the beginning Manderley burns down and the first person narrator want to tell us the reason.What I've very found exciting, was that I never expected, that Rebecca was as such person as she's at the end. I thought she was so lovely, but the truth isn't so.The only thing what I can still say is that you have to read this book. I found exciting from the beginning to the end."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is one of the BEST books I have ever read. When I read this book I got SO involved, it was like I was apart of the book in a way. Once you start reading it you can never put the book down. There is not one boring part in the book, it just keeps getting better and better. After reading Rebecca I highly reccomend reading the sequal from Susan Hill &quot;Mrs. De Winter&quot;, that book was great also, it tells you how the late Mrs. De Winter and Mr. De Winter end up and what happens and also a chilling ending just like &quot;Rebecca&quot;. I guarentee you will enjoy these two books."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"The fact that we never find out (or I never noticed) the protagonist's first name bothered me slightly, but the book is so good that I was able to get over that.

I found it a little hard to get into, but once I did, I loved it. It's full of mystery and romance. I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"WOW! What a great book! This was actually my first real &quot;Grown-Up&quot; person novel that I have ever read, and im only 14 yrs old! (well, technically, I was late into my 13tnh year when I read this, but you get the idea!) My mom actually reccomended this to me, as I had to read a book atleast 300 pgs. at length for a school project, but it hardly felt like it was an assignment!

Now that I'm in college and am taking an adolescent literature class, I have decided to reread the novel in hopes of greater understanding. It is very fascinating. &quot;Rebecca&quot; by Daphne Du Maurier is a mystery about a young girl who dies and leaves her husband widowed. The husband remarries and Rebecca begins to haunt them. The underlying part of the story begins when Rebecca's late husband, Maxim de Winter, makes his second wife, a lady who's name the book never mentions live in Rebecca's shadow."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Having discovered the incredible works of Daphne du Maurier long ago, I can only wonder why I had never read her most renowned and classic novel. Probably just as well too, because I'd probably not have appreciated du Maurier's exquisite mastery of suspense-building. Most of her novels are definite page-turners, keeping the reader firmly with grasp; this work not only grasps, it gropes!. Memorable characters, even if not particularly loveable ones. Dame Daphne left us with some great reading and this surely is indeed one of her best and probably one of the greatest novels of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"While the red 'satin' cover and the category of 'Romance Thriller' seem to be defining characters for Rebecca, it most certainly is not.The story starts with our unnamed the-soon-to-be Mrs. De Winter II, and Mr. Maxim de Winter, a widower of eight months following the tragic drowning of his wife Rebecca. The-soon-to-be Mrs. De Winter II is a paid companion to Mrs. Van Hopper, a fat woman more inquisitive and annoying than humanely possible. One day, the-soon-to-be Mrs. De Winter II is free from lunch duty since Mrs. Van Hopper is sick, and meets de Winter at lunch, and accepts his invitation to a ride in his car. So starts their friendship, until the-soon-to-be Mrs. De Winter II realizes that she is in love with him, her, a just out of school young thing, with a forty-two year old widower. So she is as surprised as Mrs. Van Hopper when he proposes to her right before she leaves; stunned, she says yes.She reaches Manderly, where her fantasyland quickly vanishes. From Mrs. Danvers, the sinister and loyal maid to Rebecca, to Rebecca herself, who seems to haunt the house with her presence, nothing is what it seems. Soon, Mrs. De Winter II finds herself looking for the answers behind the former mistress of the house.This is a brilliantly written book; however, the second half, following the scene in Rebecca's old rooms with Mrs. Danvers, goes by much faster, as the plot speeds towards the climax. This book is genuinely frightening at time; I myself stopped reading in the night because I was getting the chills. For those of you who are not looking for a sappy love story, this book is definitly a must-read."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Younger readers, I fear, are sadly unaware of Daphne Du Maurier's place in the book world. She was quite the significant and prolific author, and set the standard for the \\"gothic\\" romance with REBECCA. She was one of the bestselling authors of her time. Remember, this is the woman who also wrote THE BIRDS, another Hitchcock classic, as well as several other works that were made into films, including JAMAICA INN, THE SCAPEGOAT (with Alec Guinness), and DON'T LOOK NOW (with Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie). Unfortunately, I only see a handful of her many novels listed here on Amazon.REBECCA is one of the few, if not the only, of the many gothic romance novels of that era that survived as a \\"classic\\". The reason is the unique approach to the tale, the nameless new bride living in the shadow of her husband's first wife. And then there's the twisty ending, a reading moment that you'll never forget.Not all of her novels are gothic or even romance-- The Scapegoat is a great tale of two men swapping identities, Don't Look Now is a tale of true horror set in Venice, and one of my favorites, The Parasites, is a departure from romance, mystery, or horror, exploring the strange bonds between a trio of siblings. Her books may have SOLD in the 30's & 40's like Danielle Steel's do now, but you won't find that they are the same book over and over with different names!Du Maurier's work should and must endure -- buy what you can new, scan used book stores and garage sales for the rest of her treasures!If you find yourself loving her books, then also look for her autobiography, called MYSELF WHEN YOUNG."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is a story about a young woman who gets involved in a difficult affair. In the first part of the story, Mrs de Winter, who has married a rich, much older man, Max de Winter, writes about her life in her new home, the great Manderley. She learns the entire story of Rebecca, Max&#65533;s first wife. Then, her husband admits, that all this has been a lie. From then on, everything goes fast. Max is accused because of a suspicion of murder. By sheer luck, they succeed in escaping from the prison.In the whole book, there is not much tension. Neither at the beginning nor at the end. Certainly, there is some tension, but when the tension comes to a head, the book finishes very swiftly &#65533; without being finished.Another reason why I don&#65533;t like the book very much are the characters. The entire story is not contemporary at all. It&#65533;s boring to watch the rich people &#65533;count their money&#65533;. They are so impersonal, I can just watch what they are doing, I can hardly sympathise with them."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"&quot;Rebecca&quot; by Daphne Du Maurier is arguably one of the best books ever written.The presence of Rebecca is haunting and unforgettable. The shy, timid and unamed second Mrs. DeWinter is another wonderful character, although she is overshadowed by the commanding presence of Rebecca. Another worthy character is that of Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper who seems to keep Rebecca's presence 'ever alive'.Ms. Du Maurier's prose is simple and flowing, providing a spellbinding and haunting read.A permenant book by my bedside, &quot;Rebecca&quot; will be read over and over again.A wonderful read for all age groups, I truly reccomend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"... Though highly readable, I find the characters to be rather flat, and the plot a tad bit too predictable. It also has a tendency to drift, which gives me the impression that Dame Du Maurier had written this without really knowing where she was heading herself. On top of that, I find this novel to be far from atmospheric or brooding. Rather, the devices employed to create an eerie atmosphere eg Danny's skull-like head etc, seem to me to be rather contrived. Maybe I'm feeling this way because I have heard too much positive feedback prior to my reading, it's easy to be disappointed when the novel falls slightly short of my expectations. But one thing for sure is that this is not the best suspense thrillers I've read. I'll stick with Victoria Holt."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"What an outstanding novel this is. At the beginning we are mesmerized by the affection that Maximum de Winter and his personal secretary secretly demonstrate. Once he takes her back to his estate named Manderly, the reader does not exactly understand why Maximum acts so differently. The death of his former wife, Rebecca displays an odd behavior over the staff as well as Maximum and this perplexes the new wife as well as the reader. The unexpected twist towards the end forces you to read on. This classic is a treat for anyone who picks it up. I easily give it five stars and recomend it to both men and female."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Du Maurier makes the conflict and the plot mysterious and suspenseful while letting the reader into small amounts of detail giving clues."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Often marketed for teenaged girls, Rebecca is actually the last of the great novels in the Gothic tradition. The first of the great Gothic bestsellers, Jane Eyre, serves as template and inspiration for Du Maurier's haunting story of the triumphant power of evil. There is the ancient, enormous manor house, Manderly (Thornfield), the romantic, father-lover Byronic hero, Max DeWinter (Edward Rochester), the frightening servant with a BIG secret, Mrs. Danvers (Grace Poole), a lonely, orphaned heroine who sees herself as clumsy and homely, rather than innocent and lovely, the Narrator (Jane Eyre), the bildungsroman of the heroine growing into wisdom and loss of innocence, the great house as symbol of corruption hidden by surface beauty, the colossal and hidden past mistake made by the Hero, devastating fires, and love so passionate and enduring it overcomes unthinkable misfortune. Du Maurier was haunted by Bronte, it's clear, just as her unnamed character is haunted by Rebecca. Rebecca, whose name is everywhere, and the Narrator, whose name is nowhere in the novel. The skill to make such an odd twist of nomenclature is only one that Du Maurier practices in the tale of secrets, horror, love, and redemption. Or is it redemption? She leaves the question open just enough to bring you back to reading Rebecca time and time again, just as the name of Rebecca's sailboat, &quot;Je reviens,&quot; predicted.

In Monte Carlo, they meet an Englishman, a \\"landed gentleman\\" in his forties named Maxim de Winter, who is recovering from a personal tragedy. The older man and the younger woman strike up an awkward friendship. The young woman is happily surprised when Maxim suddenly and casually proposes marriage.After their honeymoon, Mr. and Mrs. de Winter return to his estate of Manderly. The young Mrs. de Winter finds herself out of her depth in a household dominated by the forbidding housekeeper Mrs. Danvers and haunted by reminders of the first Mrs. de Winter, the beautiful Rebecca, drowned in a boating accident. As she struggles to find her footing, the earlier tragedy refuses to stay buried. Mrs. de Winter will find that very little around her, including her husband, can be taken at face value. The dead hand of the past will reach out to threaten everything she values in the present.\\"Rebecca\\" is a superbly crafted thriller, told entirely through the eyes of the young Mrs. de Winter, against a lushly described setting of time and place. It is very highly recommended to fans of Daphne Du Maurier and to those looking for an exciting period piece mystery novel."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"As a non-native speaker of English, this was my first real English book ever (not something simplified or abridged) after I studied English for a few years. I was 17. My vocabulary was much smaller then. I remember that I plowed through the book with a dictionary. The first few chapters took forever. Even though I liked the atmosphere of this book and enjoyed the experience then, I thought it was just too much hard work and I would never pick it up again.A week ago, I saw this audio book on sale at Audible.com. For nostalgic reason I decided to download this book. This time, almost 30 years later, it is painless and enchanting.I guess I am never one to mind slow pacing. This book is not at all slow for me. One twist after another. I find the story more layered than I remembered. The elegant writing is also something I miss about most more modern books. The detailed description of the old-time England fascinates me. Even though I myself had always been self-confident, I remember the awkwardness and self-consciousness of youth, which made me sympathetic about the narrator's diffidence. The characters, good or wicked, decent or vulgar, all seemed believable to me. I am so glad I decided to re-experience this book. For a while, a long while, I was filled with rapture over the pleasure of listening to the beautiful words flowing like music.I would like to congratulate Ms. Anna Massey on her great performance with this book. Her voice was sometimes sweet, sometimes stern, always just right. She was not distracting, and sometimes even convincing when she played the male part. I am especially amazed how she played Favell. Such a nasty man.Today, I was sitting at a outdoor cafe on campus. I was eating my slice of Pizza, listening to Rebecca. I watched the fountain not far away, feeling the mellow sunshine. Trees swayed in the breeze. I felt life was beautiful.Edited December 21, 2010---------When we rate a book, do we rate it on how good it is, or on how much pleasure and satisfaction it brought us? I begin to feel confused. Rereading my own review, it seems that my rating was based on the latter, which is really a personal experience and does not seem to recommend the book itself. I wonder if this really is what a review is all about?"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I read this book years ago when I was in high school. I loved reading it again. I looked for years for a hardcover copy and could never find one. I finally thought to look at Amazon and sure enough there it was. I bought a used hardcover copy and it was in great shape and the price was very reasonable.I love that Amazon always has what I'm looking for."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Warning: spoilerA fantastic novel, that deserves a place next to \\"Wuthering Hights\\", \\"Great Expectations\\" or \\"Jane Eyre\\". Daphne Dumaurier's beautiful and rich writing style and amazing storytelling skills make this novel great fun to read. She handles the character development wonderfully well, in particular the overly sensitive and devoted heroine, the sinister housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, the despicable playboy Favell, and the gloomy and jaded Max de Winter.The novel works on many levels. There are some elements of the old fairy-tales Cinderella (servant-girl marries nobleman) and Bluebeard (forbidden room, murderous husband), but with a different, surprising twist. It's also a story of growing-up, as the nameless heroine matures from a timid girl into a strong-willed woman during her various trials. The author brilliantly disguises the characters' motivations, so that the true causes of things remain a mystery until about two-thirds into the novel when the main crisis unfolds. We then realise that the heroine, who sees things through the lens of her own feelings of inferiority completely misses the truth, which is to her a shock and relief at the same time.Not least, the lush, rich descriptions of the house and the surrounding Cornwell country-side, and linking of the natural elements with the mood of the story makes this novel a truly satisfying reading experience. You may not want to read another novel for a long time.Also of interest to readers would be Alfred Hitchcock's film Rebecca, which faithfully recreates the novel, with an outstanding cast."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"\\"Last night I dreamt I was in Manderley again.\\"And so begins a literary classic that, to me at least, is so riveting and wonderful that you have to read it again and again. And that's what I've done -- I have read it for the third time. First published in 1938 and set some time during the 1920s, this is the tale of a nameless heroine who has no idea what she's gotten herself into when she marries Maxim de Winter. At twenty-one, her future is uncertain, and she had settled for a life as a lady's companion to Mrs. Van Hopper, an American social climber. They are vacationing in Monte Carlo, and that's where she meets Maxim -- a dark, handsome, sophisticated and mysterious widower who is twice her age. When he pays her special attention and proposes marriage, she immediately agrees. She fell in love with him from the moment she met him, after all, and she had heard wonderful things about his English estate, the beautiful Manderley. Mrs. Van Hopper gives her a warning. She will regret it. He will marry her because he cannot stand to be alone in that house. But the heroine marries him anyway. After all, her new life will be a marriage to a handsome man who owns one of the most fascinating homes in England. What could possibly go wrong?No sooner does she arrive at Manderley than she discovers just how important the late Mrs. de Winter had been to the old estate. Everyone there follows things as though Rebecca, the late wife, still lives there. This is most evident with Mrs. Danvers, Rebecca's former personal maid, who takes an immediate dislike to the heroine. The heroine is afraid of the servants and of disrupting the order of the house and is soon consumed with jealousy for Rebecca. After all, she was a tall, dark, beautiful and vivacious party girl -- everything the heroine is not. What's more important is that Maxim still loves Rebecca. He is taciturn and brooding, and she is constantly afraid of upsetting him. After a disastrous fancy dress ball thrown in her honor, the heroine feels that perhaps it had been a mistake to marry Maxim. But, in spite of Mrs. Danvers's creepy attempts to frighten her, she will remain in Manderley, where nothing is the way it seems.What I love most about the novel is the narrative. Daphne de Maurier had a gifted way of drawing you into this dark, ironic and very sinister tale of secrets, deception and death. The nameless heroine (the author wrote that she hadn't given her a name because she simply couldn't think of one good enough for her) is young and nave and it shows. To me, it is frustrating that she has no name, especially since Rebecca, her rival in mind if not in life, is so prominent in the story that the book had been named after her. Then again, this gives a special emphasis to the fact that the heroine finds herself lacking in manner compared to Maxim's previous wife, so perhaps the not having a name works. I also love the gothic feel of the story and how well-woven it is. Twists and turns creep in from beginning to end. Even though I had read Rebecca twice before, it was like reading it for the first time. The narrative and descriptions are as vivid, Maxim is as enigmatic as ever, Mrs. Danvers still gives me the creeps, and the ending gave me goose bumps again. The novel felt unfinished, which is why the author wrote an epilogue that is included in this edition, but I kind of liked leaving things to my imagination, so I only read the first two pages of the epilogue and skipped the rest. Rebecca is one of those classics that you'd want to keep in your library for rereading, much like Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre and other gothic classics. If you'd like to read a novel that is similar to this one, I recommend Dragonwyck by Anya Seton."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is, hands down, my favorite book of all time. I first discovered it at 13, after my mom suggested it to me (it's one of her favorite books as well). I've read it several times since then, and each time is sheer pleasure, though I echo a previous reviewer's envy for those who get to experience Rebecca for the first time. I admit the book is not perfect, literarily speaking. It is also not a mystery in a traditional \\"whodunit\\" sense, nor is it a traditional ghost story. However, Daphne Du Maurier achieves something very few writers can do (and none as well as her): she creates a sense of atmosphere that pervades every word and all the space in between the words, and truly makes you feel as though you are there in the story. World War III could start while I'm reading Rebecca and I would not notice it. The gothic atmosphere stays with you long after you finish the book. I also marvel at how the main character is not actually a character per se but rather a presence--her ghost haunts all the characters and you the reader as well. Absolute magic."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Great plot, writing, characterization, mood, suspense aside, the book, written only a few years before I was born, pulls the curtain back on the way I looked at womanhood, men and marriage as a young girl--and how different it was even then to today. The heroine's shyness, her inability to speak her mind, her desire to live in denial of unpleasantness and do nothing about it echoes the way I recall thinking this is the way a woman should live--allow the men in my life indeed, allowing my interpretation of the words and actions of those men--to define what that life should be.And can you imagine putting up with Mrs. Danvers today? Or placing the flowers where Frith says the first Mrs. did?As a widow having married a widower, I know how unhelpful it is to try to bury the past--to pretend someone never lived while imagining just about every detail.But then, the heroine's overactive imagination drove the plot, and that device is what makes DuMaurier so good. Who among us doesn't create the reality we respond to?"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca by Daphne DuMaurier drew me in and made me feel like I was there with the characters. When I picked the book up I thought it would be about a girl named Rebecca, but I was wrong. It is about Maxim deWinter and his dead wife Rebecca, and how she still impacts him and his new wife. Another wonderful thing I like about Rebecca is that Ms. DuMaurier doesn't give a name to Maxim's second wife, so I can imagine what I want her name to be.The de Winters live at Manderly, one of the fanciest mansions in Europe. They held many parties with Rebecca alive, but now with the new wife nobody knows if there will be any parties at all. The de Winters try to have a ball, but their main housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, tries to ruin everything. She tries to ruin everything because she hates Maxim for marrying again, and hates the new Mrs. De Winter for marrying Maxim and trying to take Rebecca's place at Manderly. Will she succeed?Ms. DuMaurier describes all of her characters in such detail that I was able to receive a mental picture of what they look like. Hearing the thoughts of Mrs. DeWinter, I was able to tell which characters Ms. DuMaurier wanted me to like and dislike.I give Rebecca five stars. It grabbed me and I was able to see myself as many of the characters. I was also able to feel the emotions the characters feel, and it drew me in instantly, so much that I didn't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is a timeless classic.

It ended kind of abruptly, but that didn't bother me because the rest of the story made up for it!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book is on the list of my favorite novels. I initially read the book since I am a fan of mysteries. This book, although containing a mystery, clearly escapes the mystery genre, falling into the category of great literature. This novel can be read on several levels. Try reading several passages outloud. Du Maurier's prose begs to be read outloud."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"A shy poor girl is swept off her feet by a rich, handsome man who marries her and carries her off to his estate. Sounds like the end, doesn't it? No, that's how it starts. Instead of riding off into the sunset to live happily ever after, she finds herself in the role of great lady without any idea of how to pull it off. And then there is the matter of just how the last wife died . . . Miss DuMaurier turns our expectations inside out in a classic that was tailor-made for later film adaptation by Hitchcock. Wonderful for late at night, snuggled up under a blanket with hot cocoa. Arrange thunderstorm if possible."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"After the first two chapters, which are filled with ambiguous, ramblesome prose, readers (like myself) may be tempted to give up. But those who trudge through it will find themselves richly rewarded. Once the young, nameless protagonist marries the charming, wealthy Maxim de Winter and moves into Manderley, his sprawling country estate on the coast of England, the story leaps to life. Married life should be blissfully idyllic for the new Mrs. de Winter, but she finds herself entrapped by an overwhelming sense of gloom, overshadowed by the ghostly presence of Maxim's former wife, Rebecca. As events slowly begin to fall into place, Mrs. de Winter begins to suspect that there is more to Rebecca's supposedly accidental death than she has been led to believe. From there, the story unravels at a breathless pace, as the de Winters uncover revelation after revelation in the convoluted plot, finally unearthing the chilling secrets of Rebecca, what happened to her and why. The novel ends with a brilliant twist ending that will chill readers while offering a deep sense of poetic justice.REBECCA is a true masterpiece of romantic suspense. It succeeds on so many levels: with its vividly drawn characters, its hypnotic, haunting mood and atmosphere, and the underappreciated virtues of an intricate plot laced with all the twists and red herrings of an Agatha Christie puzzle, REBECCA is a classic in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"To give a synposis of this classic story would be repetitive. I will say I was suprised at how much I loved this book. I thought it would be good, but it turned out to be great. The story starts slowly, gradually building, until you just can't put it down. It is a mystery that turns itself on end. I don't want to give away the plot, but whatever twists and turns it takes, you still keep rooting for our shy little heroine.A previous reviewer commented on the abrupt ending. I thought it was perfect. Any more said would have overstated the obvious.I highly recommend reading this book. I think I will reread it.

It has its share of suspense and thrills, but nothing like I thought. This is a worthwhile read and great piece of fiction. I recommend it to all.I can't really tell much more about it without giving away details of the story. Read for yourself.....it's worth it and it won't take long!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"When is a romance novel not a romance novel?When it's a gothic suspense thriller fairy tale romance novel, such as Daphne duMaurier's Rebecca (Victor Gollancz, 1938, republished by Avon in 1971). The book's staying power can perhaps be best explained because it combines all the trashy, page-turning suspense of modern writers like Stephen King and John Grisham without the pedestrian prose that make King or Grisham such an insult to the intellect. Rebecca is well-crafted without requiring the same kind of concentration as a modern reader would employ when tackling the heightened language of older classics and it's fun without resorting to the formulaic styles of today's mass market paperbacks.The story is the first-person account of an awkward young maid who, while assisting her mistress on a vacation in Monte Carlo, falls in love with the dashing widower, Maxim DeWinter. Maxim marries her and whisks her off to his Cornish estate of Manderley, where the memory of his first wife, Rebecca, looms larger than life. While the shy narrator tries to fill the shoes of her sophisticated predecessor, Rebecca's presence haunts the foreboding mansion until the new, younger Mrs. DeWinter can find out exactly what became of Rebecca.For obvious reasons, Rebecca is considered an imitation of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre - a haunting mansion with its own name ruled by a mysterious master with dark secrets about his first wife. But, stylistically, the two are very different. The poor little anonymous narrator of Rebecca lacks the strength and conviction of Jane Eyre's titular heroine. DuMaurier's is a darker novel than Bronte's and her protagonist's final victory is dubious, at best. While both novels have gothic elements, Jane Eyre strives for realism; Rebecca is a sinister fairy tale, with its melodrama and stilted, exaggerated characters. And, of course, Jane Eyre is Victorian.DuMaurier herself was shocked at Rebecca's popularity, saying she had written the novel merely as a study in human jealousy. But her readership saw it differently. First dramatized for radio by Orson Wells shortly after publication, then adapted for film by Alfred Hitchcock in 1940, Rebecca remains duMaurier's best-known and best-loved work, trumping even her 1952 short story, The Birds, which was also made into a Hitchcock film and is more often associated with him than with its original author.What duMaurier didn't acknowledge is that this rags-to-riches Cinderella story may contain its own Oedipal influences. DuMaurier was born in London in 1907 to actor-manager Gerald duMaurier, the son of artist and writer, George duMaurier. Her mother a sophisticated socialite, the young Daphne was closer to her father and followed in the artistic footsteps of the paternal side of her family. In 1943, she married Major General Sir Frederick Browning, who had lost his beautiful and worldly fianc&eacute; in an unusual accident. The constant sense of competition between the narrator and Rebecca may reflect duMaurier's own feelings of inadequacy in loving men whose hearts were already given to women far above her.Beginning with her first novel, The Loving Spirit, published in 1928, duMaurier's work reflects her passion for Cornwall. Manderley is based on Milton, near Peterbrough where duMaurier visited as a girl, and Menabilly in Cornwall, where she eventually settled with her husband and raised three children. When Hitchcock filmed Rebecca, starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine, du Maurier's only complaint was that he changed the setting to America, cutting out entirely her beloved Cornwall.In 1969, duMaurier was made dame for literary achievement, credited with writing the first gothic romance of the 20th century. She died on April 19, 1987. Two sequels were later published with the blessing of the duMaurier estate - Mrs. DeWinter, written by Susan Hill and published in 1993 by William Morrow and Company and Rebecca's Tale, written by Sally Beauman and published in 2001 by Little Brown.So what makes Rebecca a romance? This is not a tale of passionate embraces or the love at first sight of destined paramours. The emotions that are heightened are those of jealousy, inadequacy, and self-doubt. The narrator appeals to the gauche, insecure little girl in all of us who is given to flights of wild fancy and fears of improbable disaster. That we never know her Christian name underscores her subordination to Rebecca, whose name dominates the cover of the book as well as every corner of Manderley. It gives the sense that the narrator's life did not begin until her arrival at Manderley, at which time she gained the name of Mrs. DeWinter, albeit the second, of course. It also gives the reader a sense of intimacy with the narrator, as if, perhaps, we are a dear friend for whom repeating her own name would be redundant and unnecessary.But if it's not clearly a romance, it is thoroughly modern. Rebecca has no truly moral characters in spite of its melodrama. All its heroes are deeply flawed and face ethically ambiguous dilemmas. Its villains, if viewed in the proper light, may be sympathetic and we're given a chance to identify with the baddies. Nor is the ending clean and neat. From its opening line - one of the more well-known in modern literature - \\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again\\", the narrator tells us that she is writing from a place of relative peace, but still running from what happened to her as a naive young bride. When the final revelation comes, 300 pages later, it's uncertain how the narrator will respond and, in fact, her response seems incongruous with the rest of her character (arguably the novel's only flaw). However, like the narrator, Manderley is a place readers will dream of returning to again and again."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"A long time ago, I heard a phrase that struck me as odd: &quot;They had everything -- money, power, love -- everything, except happiness.&quot; How could that be? The only answer I could come up with was health problems. A couple of years later, I read &quot;Rebecca&quot; and now I know.Maxim De Winter meets a shy, young, naive girl in Monte Carlo. After a very short courtship, they marry. The girl comes from a family of no distinction and previously worked as a companion. Maxim De Winter comes from a semi-aristocratic family. He has a lot of money and a house called Manderly. Manderly is a famous landmark and has even been featured on post-cards. After their honeymoon, Maxim and Mrs. De Winter come to his house which is haunted in every way imaginable by the memories of Maxim's first wife, the beautiful, intelligent, the darling of the society -- Rebecca.It is in this house that Mrs. De Winter finds herself very unhappy although she has Maxim's love, money and power... You just have to read the book to find the most shocking truth.This book is very dark, following in Gothic traditions. It presents very interesting characters...It is a novel to be savoured."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Much grace to the woman who loves a man who have loved enough before to pledge and vow himself to another. No wonder there is something that writer Susan Shapiro Barash calls the \\"Rebecca Syndrome\\" which got its name from this novel. A tale of suspense, love, pain, mystery, intrigue, and the machinations of plot that DuMaurier was known for. Read this and be swept away in the psychological stirrings and heart ache of a woman, a marriage, and a house where a man and a husband has less than a full heart to give back. Second wife ... second helpings ...second hand love ... no matter how much she loves him. The kind of haunt that is a phantom of a love triangle even in the physical presence of only two people. No .. you are not alone."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"There are very few novels that are followed by equally splendid movie versions. &quot;Rebecca&quot; is one of those few. Written in the first person, &quot;I&quot; (she is never given another name) marries wealthy widower Max De Winter. When she accompanies him to his estate, Manderly, she comes to suspect that he and everyone who surrounds him is still besotted with his beautiful, dead wife, Rebecca. The housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, almost drives her crazy with always comparing her to that eternal paragon of beauty and delight. The novel seems to be set in the 1920s or 1930s in England. It was released as a movie in 1940 by Alfred Hitchcock and won many Oscars. Laurence Olivier played Max and Joan Fontaine played &quot;I&quot;. Both the novel and the movie present marvelous elements of romance and mystery in a time period that is not used frequently enough for fiction. There is one difference between the novel and the film. Because of the rigid code of censorship existing then in Hollywood, Max is not as morally ambiguous in the film as he ultimately is in the novel. It makes no difference to me because I love both versions equally. I am not surprised that both have proven to be enduring classics. If you are feeling burned out by too many modern bad novels and even worse movies, try these two classics which have easily withstood the test of time."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book is one of the all-time greatest works of fiction, combining suspense, romance, and character development, all wrapped up in a mystery that is literally not resolved until the last page.Modern readers should treat this story as a period piece of sorts; American readers in particular should bear in mind the differences between British and American cultures, and also the historical differences (Rebecca was published in 1938), otherwise they are apt to find the story 'slow' or 'dull.'Like any great mystery writer, du Maurier throws out subtle clues in the first third of the story; about halfway through, she begins to resolve these clues, and from then on, the story races at full steam. *Don't let* the seemingly slow introduction stop you from finishing the book; patient readers will be well- rewarded when they see how brilliantly du Maurier sets up her surprises.The story revolves around the unusual marriage of the young, unworldly narrator (whose first name is never revealed, one of the book's charming idiosyncrasies)to the brooding 'landed gentleman,' Maxim de Winter. When she arrives at his grand country manor, Manderly (the house is perhaps the book's most potent character), she is immediately confronted by the other characters' feelings about Rebecca, Maxim de Winter's flamboyant late wife.Perhaps du Maurier's greatest accomplishment, character-wise, is the way she develops Rebecca, who is already dead when the main action of the story begins, and never really appears 'on-screen,' so to speak. Rebecca is very much alive in the memories of Maxim, the house servants, friends and family members, but most crucially, of her personal maid, Mrs. Danvers (and also of Rebecca's sleazy cousin, Jack Favel). It is Mrs. Danvers who becomes the greatest nemesis of the narrator, and who makes the frightened young woman feel utterly unwanted and unloved in her new home. If Rebecca truly does haunt Manderly, Mrs. Danvers is her conduit to the world of the living.After a treacherous episode that almost brings the narrator to the breaking point, a string of coincidences alters everything; the narrator learns the truth about what turns out to be a lot of mistaken assumptions. In the process, she herself grows into a far more confident person. The last quarter of the story is an absolute masterpiece, as the action takes one turn, then another, then another. And even when it seems that all the clues have been resolved, du Maurier saves one last whammy for the final page.I first read this book twenty years ago, and it made more of an impression on me than just about anything else I've read since. I re-read it from time to time, and gain a new insight with every perusal.In short, Rebecca is a wonderful, wonderful novel, and not to be missed. I can't recommend it highly enough-- read it, linger over it, enjoy it, and read it again. It's a true literary achievement."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This riveting tale of fear, suspicion, and love opens as the unnamed narrator reminisces about her former home, the grand English estate, Manderley. She had been young and shy, a lady's companion, when she met the wealthy recent widow, Maxim de Winter, fell in love with him, and married him in a matter of weeks. They returned to his home, where she was immediately overwhelmed with the responsibilities of running the house and dealing with her forbidding housekeeper as well as the memory of Maxim's first wife, Rebecca. She had been beautiful, sophisticated, and supremely confident, and the narrator felt lost and helpless in comparison. Her new husband was strangely distant to her, until a horrible secret was revealed that would change their lives and the very existence of Manderley.Daphne Du Maurier has crafted a wonderfully spooky story with remarkably little action, but a great deal of atmosphere and a steadily mounting feeling of impending doom. The ravishing Rebecca is never seen, and yet she is the main character, dominating the story with her passions and cruelty. Another main \\"character\\" is the great house itself, which is described in such fascinating detail that I felt as if I had walked its long hallways, descended its grand stairs, and had tea in the library. The narrator is purposely kept anonymous to contrast her with the larger-than-life Rebecca, and Maxim is a seriously flawed but lovable man.Anna Massey does not just read the story, she performs it, delighting the listener with her upper-class British accent, giving a different voice to each character. I happily recommend this audio cassette version of Rebecca to those who enjoy exciting tales of suspense, psychological dramas, and mysteries."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"A young, naive woman who is the paid companion of an obnoxious rich woman is taken along to Monte Carlo. While she smarts under the rudeness and gauche behavior of her employer, she meets the dark, handsome widower Max de Winter.What follows is a love story and a ghost story of a woman haunted by the powerful presence of the former mistress of Manderley. We never learn the name of the heroine as she marries Max, moves into the rigid but elegant life at Manderley and tangles with Mrs. Danvers, Manderley's fearsome housekeeper. What unfolds is not only a mystery but a story of obsessions and evil. The end is a shock.Du Maurier created an unforgettable atmosphere of decaying beauty, frightening spirits and horror mixed with love and death. If you haven't read this, I am envious. You get to experience it for the first time."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"It's all about Rebecca. She appears constantly in the mind of the main character telling the story, whose name you never learn, further burying her in the presence of Rebecca. The protagonist is a young woman who quite suddenly marries a man older than herself who was married once before. Maxim de Winter's previous wife, the last Mrs. de Winter, was Rebecca.Our young bride goes with Maxim to his great home, Manderly, which she loves, but it can not hide her from Rebecca's overwhelming presence. To her it seems Maxim is always thinking about Rebecca, whom everyone loved, who died in a boating accident just a year before. She feels herself being constantly compared to Rebecca; this is not what Rebecca would have done, Rebecca must have done it like this, Rebecca was taller, Rebecca was a social butterfly, Rebecca was very beautiful, Rebecca Rebecca Rebecca. She is 'nothing like Rebecca.'Having not been brought up in this type of life, she must get used to the grandness of Manderly. The servants, like one Mrs. Danvers who absolutely adored Rebecca; the people, who she must contact and talk to and who are constantly pressing her to hold the great dress ball of Manderly that Rebecca used to run; and the ocean, which stands as a constant reminder of Rebecca's tragic death, with its little boat-house that brings painful memories to Maxim.Although people must compare her to Rebecca, the poor girl makes it worse by exercising her very vivid imagination; putting words where none were said, and constantly imagining things that don't happen. She does not fit into this life, and Maxim isn't making it any easier. You feel very, very sad for her, as it seems it's quite impossible for her to be really happy.The quiet, depressing wave takes a turn when she makes up her mind to hold the dress ball. A cruel joke is played on her, and it seems she's at a worse position than before, but then something happens in the bay. Something is found, something to do with Rebecca, and you don't know what is going to happen to our little protagonist who may have her first chance at happiness.A very emotional and intriguing story, it goes rather calmly at first, then gives you a grand twist to end in a flourish. As you learn more and more about Rebecca, you start to wonder; about the presumptions the new bride makes about her, and the real character of Rebecca."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I've given this book four, rather than five stars because I haven't read many books which I thought were perfect. Even this one has its flaws (such as a rather pedestrian narrative style). But those flaws are minor in comparison to the truly compelling characters and gripping tale woven by Du Maurier. I only just recently read this for the first time and I was surprised to find that it was a much better read than I thought it would be. I love the Hitchcock movie and was worried that the book wouldn't be as good, but boy was I wrong! The suspense is chilling from the moment the new Mrs. De Winter arrives at Manderley. Du Maurier's greatest achievement is to have created a narrator who is so young and inexperienced that Rebecca (who of couse is never present in the novel) seems more alive than our heroine! In a way, the heroine (who remains unnamed, in what must be one of the master strokes of the novel) becomes more interesting as she, like Mrs. Danvers, becomes more and more obsessed with the dead Rebecca. The slight hint of a lesbian attachment between Rebecca and &quot;Danny&quot; adds spice to the otherwise conventional romance aspect of the novel. In fact, I found this story interesting as a tale of intimate relationships between women - even Maxim, the main male in the book fades into the background as Rebecca beomes more prominent in everyone's memory. I could not put this down and was glad to find that I liked it as much as the movie!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I picked this book up when I was in high school on a visit to my uncle's...and I couldn't put it down. I was captivated as I followed the uncertain steps of a young girl swept off her feet by a rich older man, then thrust into the overwhelming position of lady of the manor, a position previously held by a beautiful, confident woman that everyone seemed to adore. Everything was not as it first appeared, however, and the new bride had many shocking and horrifying surprises in store for her. &quot;Rebecca&quot; was a gripping tale that fascinated Alfred Hitchcock, and he chose this story to bring to the big screen. But even the Master of Suspense, in my opinion, could not do justice to this epic romance/mystery/thriller as written by Du Maurier. One of the most memorable books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is a mystery novel in which nearly every character makes false assumptions that lead to false conclusions. From the catty and gauche widow Mrs. Van Hopper to the suave widower Maxim de Winter, nearly everyone in Rebecca is wrong about something. For the nameless narrator, her incorrect assumptions are founded on Mrs. Van Hopper's gossip and build on each other until they have constructed a person and a past that never existed and a future in which every action and utterance have two meanings-the one that the narrator perceives and the real meaning.For example, Maxim's sister Beatrice tells the narrator that she is nothing like his first wife, the late Rebecca de Winter, who died in a tragic boating accident. The narrator accepts this statement and remembers it as she learns more about Rebecca. She feels herself to be plain, uninteresting, shy, and unsophisticated. By contrast, and by all accounts that the narrator hears, Rebecca was beautiful, fascinating, charismatic, and witty. Even Maxim's carefully diplomatic estate manager, Frank Crawley, tells the narrator, \\". . . I suppose she was the most beautiful creature I ever saw in my life.\\" Not surprisingly, the more she learns, the more the narrator needs to know about Rebecca-a first wife whom she cannot have replaced in the brooding, moody Maxim's affections.The narrator falsely interprets other people and what they say and do. The intimidating housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, gives her several hints that Rebecca was exacting and demanding in her management of the household and staff. The second Mrs. de Winter is also told how much Mrs. Danvers loved and admired Rebecca. The implication is clear; the narrator's only hope of coming to terms with the formidable housekeeper is to take charge. Instead, she decides that the best way to mollify Mrs. Danvers is to make herself unobtrusive and to let her have full rein over the household's management. Her na?vet? and self-effacing behavior give Mrs. Danvers a reason to despise as well as dislike her.Many, if not most, readers are probably misled as well. Rebecca's appearance and charms are described by several people in several places, and her name or initials appear on nearly everything she owned. On the other hand, the narrator is never described or named. Even when Mrs. Danvers calls her \\"Mrs. de Winter\\" over the house telephone the first time, the narrator responds with a denial of her new identity but without reference to her former one. \\"I'm afraid you have made a mistake. Mrs. de Winter has been dead for over a year.\\" Surrounded by Rebecca's belongings, Rebecca's servants, and Rebecca's friends and husband, the narrator sinks further into anonymity.There are few clues to the narrator's looks, other than that she has \\"lank hair\\" (compared to Rebecca's \\"clouds\\" of black hair) and that she is \\"plain,\\" according to herself. Yet Rebecca's cousin, Jack Favell, flirts with her and repeatedly hints that she is a fresh, attractive younger wife of the sort that affluent older men like Maxim often choose. The reader should also ask why Maxim does marry someone who apparently is so different from the first wife he adored.In Rebecca, passion seems as repressed as open communication, but sexuality is not far beneath the surface. The relationship between Rebecca and Mrs. Danvers is full of sexual overtones. While Maxim may be willing to replace Rebecca in his affections and his bed, Mrs. Danvers clearly is not. As a comfort, she clings to Rebecca's old bedroom suite and to her apparent contempt for men. Mrs. Danvers says of Rebecca, \\"She had all the courage and spirit of a boy, had my Mrs. de Winter. She ought to have been a boy, I often told her that.\\" Even Maxim says, \\"She [Rebecca] looked like a boy in her sailing kit, a boy with a face like a Botticelli angel.\\"The narrator also refers to herself as being like a \\"schoolboy\\" or \\"boy.\\" The incident at the costume ball and Mrs. Danvers' ensuing description of Rebecca begin the narrator's transformation into Rebecca, or at least a woman more like Rebecca-confident, assertive, and, later, sexualized. She tells Maxim, \\"I've grown up, Maxim, in twenty-four hours. I'll never be a child again.\\" With her new knowledge of Rebecca, she makes an offer to Maxim: \\"I'll be your friend and companion, a sort of boy.\\" It is this offer and admission that finally elicits the truth-a truth that was under all the cascading false assumptions, misinterpretations, and lack of communication.Rebecca is an outstanding mystery and character study that captures a world on the cusp of irrevocable change. Maxim's marriage to Rebecca seems to have been made in the old tradition; as his grandmother says, \\"She's got the three things that matter in a wife . . . breeding, brains, and beauty.\\" Their marriage is a contract in which each plays a role. In contrast, Maxim's second marriage is modern; it is based on impulse and emotion, and thrives away from the constraints of society and tradition. When Maxim and the narrator come to Manderley, they are bound by the past-Rebecca's past, as well as a past world in which they are surrounded by servants and constrained by a decorum that requires the suppression of communication and feelings.The world around them is changing, however. When a ship wrecks off the coast and a crowd gathers to watch the rescue and salvage operation, a tourist points out to the narrator how Manderley, and all it represents, has become an anachronism. \\"Those are nice-looking woods over there, I suppose they're private . . . My husband says all these big estates will be chopped up in time and bungalows built . . . I wouldn't mind a nice bungalow up here facing the sea.\\"From the memorable opening, \\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again,\\" to the well-paced unravelling of every false assumption and conclusion, Rebecca is an engaging, evocative, thoughtful novel that acknowledges the past before moving toward the future. The next time the night is deep and you can imagine both the silence of the woods and the roar of the sea, read Rebecca.Diane L. Schirf, 22 April 2006."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book was recommended to me several times before I broke down and read it. I am a lover of classic films, yet this is one that I had never seen, for some unknown reason. A good friend suggested that I read the book to truly enjoy the story to its fullest. And boy, was she right.Although not my usual genre of choice, this is a true classic. The main character, the 'second Mrs. Dewinter' is a simple girl, swept up in a romance with a rich widower while she is on vacation as companion to a pushy, well to do woman. She leaves her employer to marry Max DeWinter, not anticipating all this union entails for her.She is drawn into the shadow of Rebecca, the first Mrs. DeWinter, and fights to measure up, and to retain her sanity in Max and Rebecca's home, Manderley.Not helping matters at all is Mrs. Danvers, a maid of sorts, who was utterly devoted to Rebecca, and bitterly resents the appearance of this plain, uneducated, unrefined girl trying desperately to fill the void left in the house when Rebecca died suddenly, under mysterious circumstances.The second Mrs. DeWinter, never referred to by name, finds herself fighting to find her own place at Manderley, and in Max's heart, as well as seeking the approval of Mrs. Danvers and the other household servants, and Rebecca's friends and relatives, as she slowly comes to the realization that not all was as it seemed with Max and Rebecca, and the grounds of Manderley are the burial place of many secrets, perhaps better left undisturbed.This is a wonderful story, full of colorful and engaging characters, and one of the best of the more 'modern' classics in 1900's literature."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca is narrated by a timid young lady, barely an adult, who is left alone in the world after the death of her parents. Through fortuitous circumstances she meets Maxim de Winter, a wealthy widower and master of Manderley, a grand country house on England's coast. When this young lady - we never learn her name - enters de Winter's world, she is inevitably compared to Rebecca, de Winter's former wife. These comparisons, and the social demands placed on her in de Winter's world, accentuate her natural anxiety to the point that she begins to consider suicide. At the same time, a maritime accident reveals much about de Winter, Rebecca, and Manderley itself.This novel explores some popular themes, like the troubles of fabulously wealthy people. But popularity does not in this case imply mediocrity. Du Maurier has created some wonderful characters, including the nameless protagonist, who is surely the heroine of shy people everywhere. She also offers some pretty good plot surprises. Finally, and very importantly for me, she offers some nice scenes of English domesticity (shaking off the water after a walk in the rain, reading the papers in front of the fire, having tea in the library, and so on). Rebecca might be summer reading, but it is good summer reading."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca. Where to start. Rebecca is the late wife of Maxim de Winter and takes place for the most part on the Manderlay estate. The readers only meet Rebecca through the eyes of the characters. The story is masterfully told. Mr. de Winter takes another wife and brings her to Manderlay and because of all that the second Mrs. de Winter hears and sees and for that matter doesn't hear she is left to speculate her own purpose and existance in the shadow of the late Mrs. de Winter. The story builds slowly and steadily, and by the time you get wrapped into the story you are in so deep you just HAVE to finish it.Breathtaking prose. Great book."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book grabbed me and would not let me go until I had finished it! A fantastic story of love and murder. EXCELLENT!!!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"My favorite of Du Maurier's books (that I've read). The mysterious Max De Winter marries a woman much younger than himself, and takes her home to Manderley, his estate. The second Mrs. De Winter is surrounded by the overpowering memories of Rebecca, the deceased first wife of Max, and Mrs. Danvers, Rebecca's loyal housekeeper, who makes no secret of her dislike for the new bride. Suspenseful and haunting, it's a great read!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I finally had the time to finish reading this wonderful thriller! Daphne du Maurier's prose carries so many important details woven together that every paragraph must be savored. Her books are not ones to speed read. As with My Cousin Rachel, the title character is created out of the other characters recollections of her, her possessions and her history. Unlike Rachel, Rebecca's appearance doesn't allow for her to make any explanations or tell her version of the story. Both books end abbruptly but with Rebecca there's a chance for happiness for the protagonist."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I had to read this book my sophomore year of HS for English class.

They marry and return to his mansion, Manderley, where the girl lives in the shadow of Rebecca, his first wife.

And Rebecca was perfect. With the whole book set up like one big flashback, it keeps you wondering what happens next. Daphne du Maurier excellently uses foreshadowing to keep the reader in suspense as she follows the lives of Maxim de Winter and his second wife. It is literally bone chilling, and when the book is all over, the reader is left with a feeling that they lived through the book's main events alongside Mrs. de Winter. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"In the beginning of &quot;Rebecca&quot; it is boring, but do not let that deter you from continuing. The book gets much better after the first hundred pages. It is easy to empathize with the second Mrs. deWinter, practically a child bride, as she settles into her position at Manderley. Du Maurier creates such vivid characters that by the end of the book you feel as if you know them in person. Mrs. deWinter is awkward and introverted, Maxim is tempestuous and mercurial, and Mrs. Danvers is threatening and sinister. At times the book is slow but in some places (like the scene where Mrs. Danvers attempts to get Mrs. deWinter to commit suicide or when Maxim tells his wife how he killed Rebecca) you will be unable to put the book down. The book is poignant and suspenseful and by the end you will want to read the book all over again."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I had to choose a book from a list for a book report for English freshman year and I decided to read this one.

The feelings of the different characters are described perfectly in this book. The mysteries are breath-taking. Daphne du Maurier made the end perfect.

Every reader can imagine the very end himself.About the story:After the death of his wife Rebecca, Mr. de Winter goes to Monte Carlo to forget his past.

I found it very boring and also not very well written. Also the cover and the title were not very exciting either. When I continued to read I must say the story took another direction than I had expected and I was interested in how it would go on. A detail which I very much like in the story is that the narrator never tells her own name.Now as I have finished reading the novel I can say that I have also read better novels, but also some which were not so good. It's a very special book and a really curious story. But I think the readers have a good chance to feel as if they were in the roles of the characters. Sometimes I didn't agree with them but I could also follow their actions. I was surprised about the end, because I had never thought that it would end like that.I would recommend the novel to other people, but on the whole it's not a book for anyone who just wants to read a novel for pleasure because he has to think about what he's reading to see the strange motivation of the characters to sympathise with them and to understand the signs which the writer gives you! Then it's a good choice and it's worth taking the time to read! It's a really curious, exciting, poetic and sometimes a little bit cruel story!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I found this book interesting. At the beginning, I thought it was very boring, becaus on the first few pages nothing interesting happens. After reading on, the real story begins, and then it is quite interesting.

Daphne du Murier tries to incorperate the old-fashionedness of generations past while giving the narrator a &quot;modern thirties woman&quot; outlook. Characters and moods are very well constructed and although Du Murier uses the same words over and over to describe them, she makes them seems realistic. Another very wonderful quality of the novel is that the author has captured emotions so well- the feeling of fear right before awakening from sleep, the difficulty of trying to hide emotions from someone who is very well-known to the character. These are so masterfully done. I love this novel, and though some would argue at the periodness of it, the qualities brought out from the narrator are captured with the style and grace that only Du Murier can seem to do."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I concur with everyone else's high praise of &quot;Rebecca.&quot; For another book in the same vein, I suggest that du Maurier fans try Anya Seton's &quot;Dragonwyck&quot; (if you're lucky enough to find a copy!)."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"The story started out like a flash back.

When she told about how Mrs. Danvers treated Mrs. De Winter I could understand how she felt. This book also showed me how life was in a house like that. It showed how the head of the house kept charge of all the help.This book was really good and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good book.

Rebecca, again in my opinion, is her second best. I drank in every word; I couldn't put the book down. The incredibly spooky housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, who hated Rebecca, made my skin crawl. It was Mrs. DeWinters this and Mrs. DeWinters that; she never let Rebecca forget that, so far as Mrs. Danvers was concerned, the first Mrs. DeWinters was still a presence in that house and always would be. The most dramatic moment in the book, for me, was when the meek Rebecca, for the first time, finally stood up to Mrs. Danvers, looked her straight in the eye, and said, emphatically, &quot;I am Mrs. DeWinters now!&quot; I saw the movie before I read the book. It was surprisingly true to the book, and I thought Joan Fontaine and Lawrence Olivier were perfectly cast in the leading roles. I cannot recall the name of the actress who portrayed Mrs. Danvers, but she was superb! Actually, I would have liked to have given Rebecca 4 1/2 stars, but there is no accommodation for halves in the &quot;How do you rate this book&quot; box."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is one of the best books of the 20th century.

The new young bride soon finds herself intwined in a web of mystery and suspense. Classic gothic writing at its best.

The story is about Maxim de Winter, a rich man, who goes to Monte Carlo and who marries a quiet young woman there. He takes her back to his lovely country home, Manderley. But in Manderley there is still the goest of his first wife Rebecca who destroys the happiness of the couple.The author had a very good idea to start with the end of the story. Like that the book gets a special touch. But apart from that the beginning of the book is a little bit arduous and boring to read. But it becomes better and better up to the final scene which is very exciting which isn't a happy-end. The whole book is filled with emotions and unexpected expressions. The variation of feelings of the unknown narrator are descripped in a way which allows the reader to go into this person and to feel with her. The feelings change from love to hatred. The book also shows how soon that happiness can be destroyed and what it means to be compared with a perfect person the whole time even though the course of the book shows that there doesn't exist a perfect person without a mistake in the world. I think it the book would be better if the beginning were shortened and if instead of that the end were embellished and longer."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I did not particularly enjoy this book. The majority of it was overly descriptive. Most of the descriptions were pointless and went on and on to the point where I truly didn't care anymore and couldn't see the author's point.

I found the book to become somewhat intriguing in the last 100 pages. But it is a 380-page book so that didn't do much for me. And the ending seemed pointless to me, but that may just be because I had lost complete interest.

However, the ending was vague and even the epilogue left some questions unanswered. I don't like unknown, vague endings. There were some interesting ideas and two plot twists, but I didn't enjoy the book enough to recommend it. I wanted it to be over. The author spends a lot of time describing flowers and details. The heroine was never given a name, I will call her \\"H.\\" A lot of time is spent in H's mind, discussing things she was timid and fearful about and she imagined conversations that other people were having about her.CAUTION SPOILERS: I have never imagined anyone being as timid, fearful and nervous as H. She would hide from the domestic staff and wanted to avoid speaking to them. A guest would come and she hid behind a door so he might leave before speaking to her. She had no desire to learn anything or improve herself. After the crisis was resolved, H desired to change and learn things, but the epilogue showed she changed enough to care for Max, but nothing else. The couple just seemed to quietly float through the rest of their life together. She didn't change. One of the more interesting parts of the book was the evil of both Rebecca and Mrs. Danvers, who was in charge of the household help.Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: none.

Genre: historical romantic suspense and mystery."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"The beginning of Rebecca starts out, with the heroine, who's name we never learn, describing a dream she had about her old estate called Manderley. Manderley is where she lived with her husband, Maxim de Winter. Who, years before had married the heroine, and they both moved into Manderley together. Not long after the heroine moved in, she finds out from Maxim's housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, that she is nothing like Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, who had died a few years ago. The mystery of Rebecca begins to unravel, when a boat is found at the bottom of the cove with Rebecca's body in the boat cabin.To me, Rebecca started out as more of a romance novel, and turns into a mystery novel towards the middle. It starts out in the present with the heroine describing her dream about visiting Manderley, but it switches to the past when Maxim de Winter and the heroine first meet at the hotel, Cote d'Azur in Monte Carlo. When Maxim de Winter explained to the heroine the truth behind the mystery of how Rebecca died, I was shocked. I had didn't expect that Maxim de Winter would murder his own wife. However, when Maxim explained to the heroine that he killed his wife, because of having an affair, possibly being pregnant, and for never having a loving or trusting marriage, I thought that his reasons were justified but still wrong.I would recommend this novel to anyone who loves romance and mystery novels. Rebecca is thrilling, mysterious, and confusing at some parts, but in the end it all comes together. I loved reading Rebecca; it's a real page-turner that you never want to stop reading. Out of the many books that I have read, Rebecca was one of the best books I have ever read in my life."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I could write an entire review on my dislike for the main character, alone.

After the that, the plot picked up the pace and it became a halfway decent book. I would advise anyone who quits reading after one boring chapter not to even try this book."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is a classic, but its thrill comes from the suspense and, especially, certain twists. So once you've read or seen the whole story, you can never fully reexperience the fun. If you haven't experienced it yet, I strongly recommend you do so through the Hitchcock movie rather than the book. Do not read further. Go rent the movie.WARNING: SPOILER. Do not read past this point unless you already know what happens. . .The gothic suspense makes this book a deserved classic. Nonetheless, it left a sour taste in my mouth. In my view, it is not well-suited for contemporary sensabilities; the movie endures much better. The movie reviews tend to make much of the story that producer David O. Selznick forced Hitchcock to stay true to the book. However, several critical changes by Hitchcock make all the difference to the contemporary viewer. Warning, once again, my highlighting of these differences gives it all away.1) In the movie, Maxim confronts Rebecca, but does not actually kill her. In the book, he is a murderer. While that makes the outcome of the book a little more ironic, it robs the hero of any appeal to the contemporary reader. Adultery as justification for homicide may have been more palatable to readers 70 years ago, but Hitchcock was wise to make Maxim innocent.2) I couldn't help but understand the book to be saying that what made Rebecca so horrible, such a repulsive being, was not just her licentiousness but that she was a lesbian. After the marriage she told Maxim \\"what she was,\\" and the allusions continue throughout. The book suggests, essentially, that Rebecca deserved her fate for her sexuality. It's a reefer madness of homophobia. In the movie, Hitchcock at least makes infedelity, rather than sexual preference, the core of Rebecca's sin.3) Hitchcock allows Joan Fontaine's shyness to be understandable and allows her some growth in gumption as the movie progresses. Her utter helplessness from start to finish in the book grows tiresome as a portrayal of a heroine.4) Finally, the opening scenes of the book reveal that Maxim and the narrator have lives permanently and deeply scarred. They live in fearful seclusion. The movie permits a sense that they live happily ever after (albeit, not at Manderlay). A feeling I prefer to be left with (call me a sap).For an excellent, contemporary treatment of a similar story, that is how someone of DeMauier's skill might have written Rebecca today, readThe Thirteenth Tale: A Novel, which deftly avoids the flaws that plague Rebecca in the 21st Century."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I read this book before I watched the movie. I usually like reading books then watching the movie and almost always the book is better, but this time, the movie was so much better! It's probably because I absolutely hated the book. I read it as an assignment for my high school English class over 10 years ago. I chose to read this because my teacher recommended it since I really liked Jane Eyre. Ugh...bad idea! I understand that we all have different tastes in books, so if a spineless, meek, and boring main character is something you'd like then you'd love the book. I hated those qualities about her and the thing is, she never did get a backbone. The book didn't even get interesting until 3/4 in. If I didn't have to read this book, i would've given up on it. If you want to pass through all the boring parts, just watch the movie that was directed by Alfred Hitchcock. You'll thank yourself for it."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I read the book Rebecca, as a requirement for freshman year, and I have to say, if it were not for the fact that a huge test was looming above my head, I would not have touched the book. In truth, I had started reading Rebecca a long while back, but gave up due to the incredibly detailed, (boring) introduction on her current life without Manderley. So as my first note in writing a review, I'd like to mention nothing too spectacularly exciting will happen for the first 150 pages, so the most you can do is hang tight, and think of how cool it'll be when it skips to the traumatic experiences of Maxim and Rebecca.The story is well written, in appropriately florid speech, understandable only if you reread the section a few times. The characters are developed, though you find yourself annoyed with the narrator, as she is, Incredibly Stupid. Ofcourse, that's how they built the character up to be, but just as a forewarning, it can go from irritating, to aggravating within a few pages.Then, it amazes me that she doesn't mention a name. It is always &quot;The second Mrs. DeWinters&quot;, which also rubs against me the wrong way, especially when you are graded on how well you understand the book, and usually if you don't even catch the first name of the Main Character/Narrator, your comprehension is obviously at fault.However, the gruesome bits where they talk about the murder, will satisfy any morbid curiosity, and I really enjoyed the twist in the end."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Daphne du Maurier's REBECCA is my favorite book of all time -- bar none.The opening line is famous, but I didn't know that the first time I read it (I was about 14).I just remember the magic that began with the first line:\\"Last night, I dreamt I went to Manderly again. . . .\\"The girl is young, clumsy, exquisitely sensitive. Impoverished and alone after her father's death, she was employed by a wealthy and boorish social climber, Mrs. Van Hopper, and made her living as the older woman's companion. Maxim de Winter, handsome, fabulously rich, and the owner of Manderly, one of the finest estates in England, crosses paths with the women in Monte Carlo. As the girl falls crazy in love with de Winter, revealing herself as the most flaming romantic in all of British literature, she sees him like this:He belonged to a walled city of the fifteenth century, a city of narrow,cobbled streets, and thin spires, where the inhabitants wore pointed shoesand worsted hose. His face was arresting, sensitive, medieval in somestrange inexplicable way, and I was reminded of a portrait seen in a galleryI had forgotten where, of a certain Gentleman Unknown.And like this:Could one but rob him of his English tweeds, and put him in black,with lace at this throat and wrists, he would stare down at usin our new world from a long distant past--a past where men walkedcloaked at night, and stood in the shadow of old doorways, a past ofnarrow stairways and dim dungeons, a past of whispers in the dark,of shimmering rapier blades, of silent, exquisite courtesy.(I thought I was a romantic!)However, I never saw him the way she did. Even as a teenager, I thought de Winter was a male chauvinist pig if ever there was one, and to this day, I don't understand what women see in him:\\"So Mrs. Van Hopper has had enough of Monte Carlo,\\" he said, \\"and now she wants to go home. So do I. She to New York and I to Manderly. Which would you prefer? You can take your choice.\\"\\"Don't make a joke about it, it's unfair,\\" I said, \\"and I think I had better see about those tickets, and say good-bye now.\\"\\"If you think I'm one of the people who try to be funny at breakfast, you're wrong,\\" he said. \\"I'm invariably ill-tempered in the early morning. I repeat to you, the choice is open to you. Either you go to America with Mrs. Van Hopper or you come home to Manderly with me.\\"\\"Do you mean you want a secretary or something?\\"\\"No, I'm asking you to marry me, you little fool.\\"[Prick!]Then this:\\"So that's settled, isn't it?\\" he said, going on with his toast and marmalade; \\"instead of being companion to Mrs. Van Hopper you become mine, and your duties will be almost exactly the same. I also like new library books, and flowers in the drawing-room, and bezique after dinner. And someone to pour out my tea. . .and you must never let me run out of my particular brand of toothpaste.\\"[Prick!][Women certainly don't want male chauvinist swine as employers, but we accept them as husbands and lovers, because mostly that's all there is, so we have to make do.]The spirit of Rebecca herself -- the first Mrs. de Winter -- pervades the novel like a gathering storm, a painful presence for the young woman Maxim marries after Rebecca's death. Although du Maurier gave the second Mrs. de Winter an inner life of extraordinary richness and depth, the author did not give her a name. When I learned that she didn't havea name, I gave her mine, and she became me. I think she is simply every romantic woman who ever read this remarkable novel.Rebecca, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, is also my favorite film. Joan Fontaine brilliant as the second Mrs. de Winter; Laurence Olivier absolute perfection as Max. This film was released in 1940, so don't see it in a theatre filled with college students, because they will snicker in the wrong places and spoil the most poignant scenes for you."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"There are almost five hundred reviews on this book, so I have almost nothing to add except the following.This book is a romance/mystery written in a different time. The original publication date is 1937 or so. I have seen a lot of disappointment about the speed of the book, the main character, how the book paints women, etc. To those people, you need to understand that we haven't always been a society of people needing a \\"quick fix\\" or who even want to be spoon-fed, and books do not stay around as long as Rebecca because they are shallow. I rather suspect, having read Jamaica Inn, that Du Maurier intended for the heroine to be exactly as \\"mousy\\" as she is and that she intended there to be many questions left unanswered. The book is wonderful because even once a reader puts it down, he/she can sit and discuss it with others. Does Maxim really love the narrator or does he just want her to keep quiet? Was Rebecca the witch she was painted as or are we just getting a portrait of her third hand through the narrator (who got a lot of her material from Maxim)? Who really wins in the end? Rebecca? Maxim? And is justice really done?As you can see, the possibilities for discussion are endless, and that is exactly what makes this book so remarkable."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Among the hundreds of thousands of books that have been published - and even among the few hundred that might truly considered classic novels - there are only a relative handful that can be recognized by their opening lines. \\"Call me Ishmael.\\" \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\\" Not far behind such memorable openers is \\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again\\": the first sentence of Daphne Du Maurier's Rebecca.Manderley is the large English estate of Maxim de Winter, a home that has been in the family for many generations. As the story opens, however, it is in ruins and the narrator - Maxim's second wife - recalls how it got that way, making most of the novel a flashback. It starts in Monte Carlo where the narrator (who's given name is never provided) first meets Maxim. He is a forty-two year old man widowed for a year; she is a nave twenty-one year old who falls for him. The love, fortunately, is mutual, and they quickly get married and return to Manderley.Manderley is haunted by the ghost of Rebecca, Maxim's first wife. Not haunted in a supernatural fashion but rather a psychological one. The memories of her pervade the home and are kept alive by the stern head housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers. For the second Mrs. DeWinter, adjustment to married life is difficult enough, but Mrs. Danvers - who adored Rebecca - also has her sly ways of making things even harder. There are also secrets about Rebecca and Maxim that cause problems and which, when revealed, could be disastrous.Although I am not very fond of nameless narrators (it usually comes off as a gimmick rather than necessary), in Rebecca, it works. The narrator starts out as a girl with no real identity; it is only after she become Mrs. DeWinter that she has a chance to really blossom. And as a side note, it is also a classic movie, Alfred Hitchcock's one film that won Best Picture. Although seventy years old, Rebecca continues to be an enjoyable and accessible read, worthy of the title \\"classic.\\""},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Many aspects of this book reminded me of Bronte's classic \\"Jane Eyre\\" - a book so revered that its prequel \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" by Jean Rhys is also proclaimed a classic.Rebecca's plot is simple in the beginning. A May-December marriage of an eccentric and mysteriously quiet wealthy countryman (Max or Maxim) to a naive middle class early 20's woman who has little, if anything, in common with her husband or his crowd make strange bed mates. After a glorious vacation/honeymoon in Monte Carlo, the young wife's Cinderella story is encompassed by coming to his estate, his castle, his Manderley.But, Du Maurier's \\"Rebecca\\" is not to be judged by its simple cover. Rebecca - the deceased first wife of Max - we learn to know in great detail, including her medical visits and romantic trysts. The first-person-singular protagonist [second wife of Max] recites this story and never reveals even her name. We never hear her name. We hear Max describe her name as beautiful. But, we never know it - first or surname. Instead, she is like Rebecca, always referred to as \\"Mrs. de Winter\\", wife of Maximilian de Winter.As reading progresses, we learn more about the deceased Mrs. de Winter than the living Mrs. de Winter. This tale, told by the living Mrs. de Winter, explores more about the \\"others\\" who are rich. Du Maurnier teaches us how the rich are terribly low class and how the lower class living Mrs. de Winter is terribly elegant and debonnaire. The first half of the book we regard the protagonist as the poor little rich girl; in the second half she is the unfortunate rich maiden. She grows as we learn more about the deep dark mysteries behind the walls of gigantic Manderley. And, when we learn all there is to know, we learn what few others know. I would love to tell it all, but I cannot spoil this great twisting and turning ending. I can say that the ending is magnificent.This book has tremendous character growth created by dialogue. The evil maid Mrs. Danvers cuts through the young bride with carefully delivered, but polite, statements to Manderey's new mistress. A cousin of the late Rebecca -Mr. Favell - is perhaps Du Maurnier's greatest tour du force. Laced with preposterous statements and obnoxious intrusions, he is truly unlikeable - even to the reader whose own character may mirror such personality. And, the gentlemanly companion to Max, Frank Crawley, together with the Magistrate Colonel Julyan (in their inquest of Rebecca's death) are reminiscent to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Mr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes.I worried this would be a woman's novel. Maybe it is. But, for someone who does not usually read such novels, and enjoys them less, I loved this novel.At the end, I hit my Netflix account to see if there was a film adaptation. Drafting Alfred Hitchcock to direct a film adaptation is genius. Casting Sir Laurence Olivier as Max is double genius. I wonder if this is one of those rare times when the film rivals a masterpiece of literature."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Honestly, I wish they'd replace Jane Eyre with this book as required reading in high school. Rebecca is a gothic novel, somewhat reminescent of Jane Eyre yet far more interesting. The nameless narrator marries Maxim de Winter in what seems like a fairytale. But upon arrival at his magnificent country home, the narrator detects the ghostly presence of Maxim's deceased first wife. The book starts out a bit slow but quickly picks up the pace. Du Maurier (in my eyes) is the queen of description and suspense. Some of her descriptions of Manderley gave me chills. You feel as if you're right there with the un-named protagonist in the stunning estate that is Manderley. Manderley almost becomes a character in its own right. Du Maurier created characters you both love and hate and almost all characters are hiding something. This book will keep you up late. It's one of my favorite books of all time. Be sure to check out the Hitchcock film of the same name as well."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"A twentieth Century classic. The book takes the archetypal framework of Bronte's Jane Eyre -- mysterious house, brooding hero, and dreadful secret -- and makes of it a riveting, complex and timeless psychological story without ever drawing attention to the old bones being re-assembled. The book proves among other things that there are no real cliches when it comes to plot or spectacle. Profound characters, fresh insights, fine dialogue and keen observation can transcend the trappings of any genre. If you haven't seen the film with Joan Fontaine and Lawrence Olivier prepare for a treat. But read the book first. It's rich and wonderful. In fact, Jane Eyre and Rebecca may be the finest examples we have of what later became known as \\"the woman's gothic,\\" a form so popular that once its stylized covers were on every drugstore rack in America. Those days are gone, of course, as the purveyors of fiction satisfy a demand for greater variety and depth in their every changing audience. But Rebecca and Jane Eyre remain undeminished and powerful as ever. Basic truths are enshrined in both; and both unfold their unforgettable moments in beautiful language. Scholars and avid readers may want to see also the brilliant study of female literature, The Mad Woman in the Attic by Guber and Gilbert."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"On the surface, with its feminine title & book cover, Rebecca may appear to be a romance novel that begs the question: Is this really a classic? Well, upon further review after reading every page(and enjoying every one no less), I can irrefutably promulgate that Rebecca is, indeed, a classic which should doubtless be read -- and enjoyed -- by both sexes.Rebecca is nothing short of an archetype of the mystery/suspense genre. Written in 1938, it quickly became an instant bestseller -- and for good reason. In the paradoxical world of Manderley, where you feel a certain awe due to the fictional mansion's opulence and wonder coupled with a peculiar eerie malaise, Du Maurier has created a most bizarre character in the house itself.Her masterful imagery, deft characterization of the new Mrs. de Winter, the enigmatic maxim, the creepy but ingeniously crafted Mrs. Danvers, the decadent Jack Favell, the incorrigibly pompous Mrs. Van Hopper, the tacitly loyal Frith, and, of course, the character that, although deceased from the beginning, eerily pervades the already cryptic landscape of Manderley, as well as the book itself, from page one - Rebecca. Rebecca exists as an inscrutable mystery that begs us to press on and uncover the hidden truth as we enjoy superb prose all the while -- truly a most captivating read."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Oh my gosh!

Rebecca is about a young mistress (her name was never given) who is married to a widower name Maxim. Maxim's late wife, Rebecca, was loved and cherished by everyone~maids etc., and after her death a few things got a little cooky around the house.

I love the dark, mysterious atmosphere this book created from the first page to the last. Du Maurier is also very good at providing a detailed look at the setting so you can imagine it all in your mind like you're really there. I won't give away any of the plot, but it held my interest all the way through and wasn't predictable to me at all. I couldn't put this book down and when I finally finished it, I was sad to be finished.

I know the novel is, however, classified as a \\"romantic suspense.\\" I adored the atmospheres used. The old part of Manderlay was dark and frightening, it completely paralleled with the sentiments the main character held about Maxim's old life. While the new part of the home, where they lived, was bright and new.We are never prepared to see how Rebecca was, in reality.

This changed my views on this novel, or should I say, the audiobook.Why did the author name the novel \\"Rebecca\\" after the dead woman? Is this book always about Rebecca? To me, Rebecca had been referenced too many times by bunch of characters, including the narrator.Speaking of the narrator, she experienced relationships and personalities. The book had focused mainly on that. If I were an author, like du Maurier and (strangely) the narrator, I must have a reason why I titled the novel \\"Rebecca,\\" despite relationships and personalities after Rebecca's death.To be honest, I am siding with the snobby woman (Ms. van Hopper) about the narrator and Maxim's relationship. In her view, they have seen each other for one month and known each other not very well, and they have rushed into marriage. However, Ms. van Hopper had approved their engagement and marriage AND let the narrator go to be with Maxim.Why couldn't Ms. van Hopper arrange the narrator with the boy around her age? She disapproved the narrator and Maxim's relationship. Nevertheless, the narrator lied to Ms. van Hopper a lot, and she did not feel uncomfortable of hurting her a lot. In fact, she and Ms. van Hopper had acquinted each other very much, and they never gave each other chances to be close friends. If the narrator hadn't married Maxim, then Ms. van Hopper would have set her up lots of young men, and Maxim would have located Ms. van Hopper's location in New York.During Mandalay, the mansion owned by Maxim, the narrator fell into the preys of Mrs. Danvers, who strangely admired and unconditionally honored Rebecca all over Mandalay after Rebecca's death. Mrs. Danvers had used Rebecca's death to harass, abuse, and neglect the narrator throughout the novel. How is this supernatural or haunting?Throughout the novel, Maxim barely knew the narrator very well, even in marriage. He was not thinking of others (Mandalay, his reputation, marriage, Ms. van Hopper, the narrator and her feelings, and Rebecca) before himself, and I don't think other characters, even the narrator, were thinking of others before themselves. To me, these characters were very selfish, including the narrator and Maxim; even with Rebecca's TRUE nature, the living were very selfish. In fact, the narrator was more concerned of Maxim's love for the narrator instead of Maxim's overall feelings, especially during the costume party and the aftermath of the party.Also, even with Rebecca's true nature, I don't even know Rebecca very well, and I don't think any reader knows Rebecca very well other than Mrs. Danvers and Maxim themselves. To me, Rebecca is just a name..."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I can't remember how old I was when I first read Rebecca --about 11, I believe. Since that very first reading, this classic novel of suspense has occupied a place among the very small, very select \\"club\\" of my all-time favorite books. These are the books that I have read many times and will doubtless read many more times in my lifetime.So many reviews have already been written about this book, and so much has already been said that there's really nothing for me to add. Except to say that Anna Massey's narration is absolutely superb. She manages to do what so few narrators can --- she actually makes this book even better."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This was a great book. Daphne Dumaurier obviously loves the gift of words. She is very descriptive. I felt as if I were there observing the unfolding of the many twists and turns that this story reveals.I became impatient with the narrator at times, but I realized that She must be that sort of character in order to complete the story.A classic!!!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This concise book by Daphne du Maurier shows her as one of the English language's most stellar writers.In only a few chapters she takes us through a catastrophic story of love, loss and redemption through the eyes of a naive, but trustworthy, young narrator.It is tragic as all great literature must be, and yet hopeful.If you haven't read this novel, do so soon. It offers a grand story that is both modern and timeless."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I have not quite finished this book, but it offers twists the further you read. It was a little difficult to get into, but I am very glad I kept reading."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"DuMaurier's classic gothic suspense novel, the book she's best known for although I wager it's not her best (I have two others by her in my TBR pile, so we'll see). I remember reading this as a teenager, and always wanted to re-read it. Found a beautiful leather-bound edition at a secondhand bookstore, and it even includes a smattering of illustrations (I wish publishers still did that!).\\"Last night I dreamed of Manderley\\", that now-classic opening line, is as wonderfully foreshadowing as I remembered, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the story had lost none of its luster in the re-read, which so often happens. Things are often never as good as you remember, but that wasn't the case here. It still had the same modern gothic sense of foreboding and subtle malice, a delicious little shiver for the spine. Nothing supernatural here, yet a haunting is precisely what it us. Reading it as an adult, married woman as opposed to a 15-year old high school-er gave it a much different perspective, too.I'd forgotten that the first name of the narrator is never revealed, and you know her only as the second Mrs. deWinter. You never feel a distance in that, though, maybe because she tells the story in a first-person narrative, so it's as if you're reading her diary. \\"Rebecca\\" is the name that rings in your head, as it's meant to. The dead first wife of Maxim deWinter - the glamorous, famous and beautiful Rebecca, a haunting presence in every way. Then there's Manderley, the house of legend that is itself a dark and psychologically haunted character, very much imbued with a life of its own. Of course there's the unforgettably sinister Mrs. Danvers, who remains to this day a literary template for the classic evil housekeeper.I couldn't quite remember the specific details of the underlying mystery - that is, what really happened to Rebecca - from when I read it so many years ago, but as soon as I got close to it I did remember, and re-read it all again in wonderfully chilling detail.It would be intuitive to assume the narrator is based on the author, as many of those things tend to be, but I've heard that Rebecca's character is based on duMaurier herself, who was known to be a beauty in her day and a bit of a glamour queen in her own right, much sought after by the paparazzi and the buzz of many a social circle. She may have a skeleton or two in the closet as well - bisexuality, a love affair with a woman, and other salacious bits. She comes from an illustrious and fascinating artsy family of actors, writers, and painters, and I'd love to read a biography of her at some point.(Soon after finishing this I read the sequel written some years later by Susan Hill, long out of print but which I found at a library sale in Carrollton. It was faithful to the storyline and the character personalities, but for various reasons I didn't enjoy it quite as much. Might write a review for it later, if I get a chance. Now I'm reading a cute little mystery by Joanna Challis that features duMaurier as a young woman involved in a mystery that inspired the Rebecca story. Having fun with the whole Rebecca canon here.) :)"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"How about that for a chat-up line?When someone told me they called their daughter 'Rebecca' for the character in this novel, my curiosity was raised. It is beautiful. The story is of the mysterious and unsolved death of the first Mrs Maxim De Winter, Rebecca, and how her death is discovered, with far reaching consequences for an entire community. Mrs De Winter (the second one) got slightly on my nerves, but because she is so bland and neutral (and nameless!), she forms a perfect vehicle to narrate the story. Her gradual uncovering of the secret is our journey of discovery as readers. Her subsequent self-deception, however, does not fool the reader one bit.Of course this novel contains one of the most famous opening lines in literature: 'Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again'.Beware: if you don't like detailed and moody description, this is not the novel for you."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Once in awhile we have to do a throwback to a novel not of this century. Yes, we have to. But that's OK because this one is about one of my all time favorites: Rebecca by Daphne Du Marurier (1938). It is the only book I have ever stayed up all night to finish just because I had to know what happened. Since then I have read it several more times but this time managing to get some sleep in.Rebecca was inspired by Jane Eyre, written by Du Marurier in Cairo, Egypt while her husband was stationed there. This British author's bestseller was a surprising success and spawned several films, television shows, and other novels. However, as we all know, are almost never as good as the book, particularly since when the first film was made in 1940 and was required under Hollywood Production Code to change the ending in order to be shown. (Warning: Reading the Wikipedia entry will spoil it!)Since a big part of enjoying this novel is staying wrapped up in the mystery and suspense created, I won't comment on anything that might give that away. The basic premise is a young lady while working as a traveling companion for a wealthy widowed woman meets Maxim de Winter, a handsome gentleman who makes her his bride and takes her back to his estate, Manderley. The young lady is mousy and unsure, struggling at times with why such a man as Maxim would want someone such as herself for a wife. While the reasons become more and more clear as the novel progresses, the couple can never escape the presence of Rebecca, Maxim's first and deceased wife.Once at Manderley, the housekeeper Mrs. Danvers makes her appearance and continues to haunt, cause trouble and general nastiness to the young lady, as she was fond of Rebecca and refuses to accept her death. Mrs. Danvers earns her place in villainess history along side the Nurse Ratchets, Cruella de Villes and White Queens. She'll give you the chills as she sweeps along the long creaking halls of Manderley.The story is told entirely from the young lady's point of view, starting a little slow, but really picking up speed mid-way through the story as the intensity in which Rebecca penetrates their lives (with the help of Mrs. Danvers) from beyond the grave. Once I hit the last third, it became a novel that could not be put down as the mysteries begin to unravel.Because of the age of this novel there have been lots of printings, you could pick this one up at the library, used bookstore or chances are, borrow it from a friend, making it even that more attractive to pick up and give a try. This novel appeals more to women than men, I did get a male friend to give it a try, he liked it, but also referred to it as a very \\"feminine\\" story."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Very well written. Excellent descriptions. I could not put it down before I finished reading it."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"since my inherent proclivities lie in the romance genre, i have to admit that i was a bit frustrated with the scant attention given on the relationship between Max and the heroine (whose name, now that i think about it (duh), was never made known.) but all THAT aside, this novel expertly conveyed the pervading menace and darkness that surrounded Manderley. from the first page and literally to the last, the author still has the reader in her grasp, and you just can't shake off the feeling that something sinister has yet to come.the insecurities that swamped the young heroine were excruciating as she found herself suddenly thrust in the role as the second wife of Manderley's master and walking in the shadow of its colorful late mistress, the beautiful Rebecca. the heroine continually feels as if she is a guest, and an unwanted one at that, in her own house. it didnt help that from the onset, she received a coldly hostile reception from the housekeeper and Rebecca's zealous champion, Mrs. Danvers.the author masterfully unfolded the pieces of the details surrounding Rebecca's life and death, making the novel nothing less than a page-turner in a reader's morbid desire to know the truth. apparently the late Mrs de Winter was the life of the demesne, the incomparable hostess that their social group almost venerate--and no one can replace her in Manderley.but even as she fumbles through the social mores her new life demands of her and grapples with the emotional barrage of having Rebecca's spectre in her married life, the readers can still discern strength of character in our heroine. through it all, Daphne du Maurier showed why her name remains a veritable force in the literary world as she invokes malevolence and fear brought forth by deadly secrets, and the destruction that encroaches on the soul and spreads to everything around you. provocative and memorable, Rebecca remains a true classic."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"REBECCA!!!! That name is forever tainted now, labled as creepy because of this book. OH! I love this style, the gothic mood and sway of this novel was incredible! I also find it amazing that an author can so completely wrap the reader in the thread of her story, that we nearly forget that we don't even ever learn the main character's name! Miraculous! This story had me rivited, pages turning at a record speed. The characters, Mrs. De Winter, Rebecca, Maxim, Mrs. Danvers, they all are so well developed I was sorry when the story ended. SO GOTHIC, so watch out. The whether is unavoidably stormy all the time. But it's worth it all the way.

Why on earth would you spoil the book for potential readers by giving away the ending?? Barbara defends her actions......Bull! There is no defense!

I hope Amazon takes my advice and removes your review. If you have not read Rebecca, skip over her review."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"My family read this book for our Family Book Club. I must confess that we picked it without knowing anything about the book, other than what the back cover said. We didn't even know that there was an Oscar-award winning movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock based on the book.This haunting, gothic novel kept us on the edges of our seats. There were two points of the novel that took us completely by surprise...but looking back, it all adds up. This book was masterfully written; it is the type you might wish to read again and again.Comments from our book club:Mom: Didn't fall asleep once (a feat!). Thought there were a couple of parts that didn't make sense, but after discussion thought it was a good ending (great book to discuss in a book club for that reason).Dad: Thought Du Maurier's greateset talent was in character development; thoroughly enjoyed watching the heroine of the story as the plot developed.Me: Definitely one of the best books I have ever read. The plot twists were great. Imagery fantastic. The kind of book that I can't stop thinking about it. Immense fun.We will definitely get the movie to see what Hitchcock has done with this book."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I fell in love with this story when I accidentally caught the old movie version on tv one night. I bought the book and fell in love with the story all over again.Ms Du Maurier created some wonderfully vivid characters. The coldly distant Maxim, the lurking Mrs. Danvers, the timid Mrs. DeWinter (I LOVE that we never know her first name), and the ethereral Rebecca who starts off as a tragic figure and then....well read the book.The description of the house and the grounds and the boathouse were incredible. I felt like I was walking the same corridors as Mrs DeWinter. Felt her apprehension as she realized she could never live up to Rebecca and I will always get a chill when I think of Mrs. Danvers. She is right up there with Hannibal Lector in terms of creepiness, in my opinion.Rebecca is a great piece of literary fiction. So creepy, so chilling, so incredibly brilliant."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I was highly pleased with the content. The setting allowed for the stories characters to grow. Although, it has been quite sometime since I have read this book, I remember how involed I got as the plot progressed. REBECCA is a sensational book of character suspense. I really enjoyed reading REBECCA. I feel that if you have read Daphne Du Maurier's book you will want to read it again."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I really really liked Rebecca. I can't agree that the first half of the book was slow, because I have a really short attention span and if the first half of the book had been slow I would never have gotten to the second half of the book. I found it fascinating and involving from the beginning. And as I said before, it is creepy (almost gives the feeling of a really subtle ghost story-in a way I guess it is), tense, (because you really worry about the fate of poor Mrs. de Winter and Maxim) and frustrating (because Mrs. Danvers is so detestable and the narrator is such a wimp and lets Mrs. Danvers get the better of her over and over.) But it's readable and entertaining as well. I really reccomend it. Go for it."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This has got to be the best book I've ever read! It keeps you gripped to the end and then has an unexpected twist. I strongly recomend it."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I enjoyed Rebecca very much, which surprised me, since I prefer action stories and generally dislike books written by women. There were times when I wished more would happen, but the author's fine writing made up for any slow parts. I can see why this book has become a classic, and I heartily recommend it to anyone who appreciates fine writing. Daphne DuMaurier truly exhibits a rare talent for prose."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book is very good. I had seen the moie and enjoyed it so I read a copy of my grandmother's.

The first two chapters were the most boring things in the book, but I urge readers to keep going! I love the way that DuMaurier hides the secrets of Manderley until the day that Maximilian deWinter is forced to tell the truth to his shy and lonely wife! It's such a twisting and grueling plot-way before its time! Mrs. Danvers is also a diabolical vilaness, with her suggestion of Mrs. deWinter's dress at the fancy dress ball. Ohh! I can't get enough of &quot;Rebecca&quot;, and I doubt others will either!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"&quot;Rebecca&quot; is a very slow read in the beginning -- too much blabber about landscapes and flowers. But do plod through. If you can get through the first 80 pages you're in for a real treat. A timesless classic of love, jealousy, evil and murder. After you read it, see the movie starring Laurence Olivier."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I totally loved Rebecca! It was extremely well written.

Sorry!!!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is an interesting story, and Daphne Du Maurier used nice writing techniques to tell the story. But I find it completely moraless. I will not explain why because I don't want to wreck the story for anyone. Also why doesn't Du Maurier name the narator of the story, even when Maxim talks about how pretty her name is.

Fail to understand why the book is called a classic as it was not amazing."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book is full of unrealistic people and situations. For a start, the young woman narrator is never named. It is puzzling that no one ever calls her by her first name. In the beginning of the story she is employed by a rich American woman to speak to party guests and light their cigarettes. As she is shy and awkward in social situations, it's hard to imagine her in this role. For much of the book the woman and Maxim relate at a superficial level. There is not the close personal relationship you would expect between lovers. You have to wonder why Maxim did not divorce Rebecca instead of taking the drastic step of murder. This is most unrealistic. It is hinted that Mrs Danvers, the housekeeper who liked Rebecca, burns down the house Manderley at the end of the book. Maxim and his wife move to a hotel on a Mediterranean island. How come no insurance? The land must have been very valuable as well. There was no reason to leave England. It's unrealistic that a rather pathetic person like Rebecca would have influence from the grave. Possibly Daphne du Maurier wrote this book with her tongue in her cheek. With the house called Manderley she obviously had to get in the phrase \\"on the road to Manderley,\\" which she does, near the very end. Maybe this book is actually a spoof of low brow, badly written melodrama."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"It was good but some parts were slow and sometimes the main characters shyness got annoying. Other then that, it was very good. I would recommend it if you are a fan of gothic romances like Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I used 3 days to read this book and in this period, I can't help to stop reading. This opening is fantastic! Du Maurier used two chapters to explain the feelings in the Narrator after the incident. It's hard to follow, but I reccomand you to read the first two chapters after you have finished the book. At that time you will understand the meaning of it.By the way, I think Hollywood should do a revival edition of Rebecca after Hitchcock. It's worth to try! When I was reading the book, I always pictured that Gwyneth Paltrow as the nameless Mrs. de Winter, Edward Norton (with beard or moustache) as Max de Winter, Maggie Smith as Mrs. Danvers and Kevin Spacey as Frank Crawley. It is the brillant cast in my imagination. I was highly reccomand to do it."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I first read this book in high school, and love it as much -- if not even more -- 25 years later.

Not the best I\`ve ever read, but really good. I like the fact that in the middle of the booky you notice suddenly all is different from what you have thought.

I think the end of the book is also really good, because the whole book deals with events that have never happened when Manderley, Maxim\`s house, isn\`t so important for Maxim any more.

The author overindulges in minutiae to the extreme expense of a plot. I would have trashed this book after 100 pages had it not come recommended by a good friend. Truly, every character is insufferable - Maxim is an ass who treats his (2nd) wife as if she was a small child, the 2nd wife is utterly spineless, the elderly companion at the beginning is a pretentious bore, the housekeeper is a sadistic, controlling bitch. There really just isn't anything at all to like about this book, and I'm completely at a loss to understand why on earth people seem to rate it highly.

Even if the murder victim was a cruel, twisted person who was going to die anyway; its still not okay to murder them. I can't believe that we, as the reader, are supposed to sympathize with the murderer; and his silly wife. What decent woman would stay with a man after she finds out he's killed someone? I would be worried he might knock me off too. I find I could not even like any of the characters. I was actually rooting for the 'bad' guys in the end. The main character is weak, silly, and boring. I understand feeling inferior or lack of confidence, but she was ridiculous. And her husband was cold and condesending toward her. I thought the book dragged a little, but was well written in a technical way. But having to sit through the main character's constant paranoid imagination was torture. I kept waiting and hoping something would redeem her and her husband, but nothing happened. The writer introduces characters that are ultimately useless to the story, such as Ben, the'idiot'. And then the book ends abruptly. I guess I can't complain too much about it ending since it was an awful book. I read this because I had heard from a number of people about how great and suspenseful it was. Maybe I am desensitized; or I am just too simple to catch on to the 'suspense'. I do understand that it was written in a time where people certainly thought differently about things than we do today. But seriously, even in today's crazy world; its still not okay to kill people off. I would NOT reccommend reading this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I thought this was a pretty average book. It could have been a lot better. I didn't get into it after the first 150 pages because it was extremely boring and there were a lot of random things written in it that didn't need to be in the book because they didn't add to it at all. I skipped a lot of paragraphs and even whole pages because I couldn't stand how boring it was. But as it went on it got a lot better and I became much more interested. It was a good story and must have taken a lot of thought to write. But once in a while it was confusing and I sometimes had no idea what was going on. But overall, I think that I liked it because it really wasn't too bad and I would have given it a five-star rating if it only was more interesting in the beginning."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"It's a book.

I knew it was a \\"classic\\", but it always reminded me of Jane Eyre (as another reviewer said). I didn't care too much for old Jane either, but at least she had the guts to stick up for herself.The heroine (not deserving of a name)is 21 years old, but she keeps harping throughout how young she is. Twenty-one, especially back in those days, was not \\"young\\". At that age, most women were responsible and mature. Not this lady. She's a paid \\"companion\\" (go-for)to a bossy American woman, currently vacationing in Monte Carlo. The heroine is from England apparently, although never actually stated. Max de Winter shows up at their hotel, takes her out to sketch, she falls madly in love, he marries her, ignores her, and treats her like a child.When they go back to wonderful Manderley, his ancestral home, she's intimidated by the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, who her husband allows to lord it over his wife.Rebecca, his first wife, died 10 months prior to their marriage (or was she found 10 months prior, and missing for 2 months before that?). Anyway, Miss 21 year old, creates MANY imaginary conversations - the servants, the neighbors, everyone is talking badly about her and comparing her unfavorably with Rebecca. She has a good imaginiation, but she wastes a lot of time. She lives in her own head a lot.She's crazy about her uncommunicative husband (well, he is all she has), and she does things like sketch, take the dog for walks, and have tea. The marriage seems totally chaste. Only towards the end of the book, does the author mention that the husband actually has a bed in the heroine's room (because he hadn't slept in it).She does show a lot of insight towards Maxim's grandmother - now that she is old,what is she thinking, feeling? How was it when she was young?There is plenty of description of the grounds surrounding Manderley, but the descriptions of the rooms in the house are confusing. I couldn't get a feel for how the house was set up. There is also no explanation as to why certain rooms (Rebecca's) are so great - just great wallpaper, hangings, and a gold bedspread. Yeah, I can see it.SPOILER: After all her meltdowns over Rebecca, Maxim finally admits he killed her because she said she was pregnant by someone else (he couldn't bear a scandal - no divorce - all the neighbors would talk!). He had planned to kill her anyway, since he took the gun down to her little cottage.Now why would anybody stay with a man like that? He can't control his temper, cares overly what other people think, and is not bothered by murdering his wife. That's just plain stupid. And dangerous. He might kill her next. She better watch out.As for the \\"ending\\", it's abrupt and unsatisfying.Like Jane Eyre, this novel has a heroine who is poor (although Jane had more skills). The hero has a wife who has some mental aberrations (in Rebecca's case, she's cruel). The mansion burns down, and they all live happily ever after."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"As a femminist I should object to the way this book portrays womyn, but this book is just so darn good, who cares about the other stuff.Ever since I first read this book when I was around 9 or 10 years old, Rebecca has haunted me. Is she angel or devil, victim or vllian?Here's an interesting spectulation. Perhaps she was a Lesbian forced into marriage with a man. The book certainly makes it clear that Mrs. Danvers was in love with Rebecca. And when Maxim is telling the second Mrs. DeWinter his version of what Rebecca was like, he even says that Rebecca wasn't normal. And given the time this book was written, homophobia was completely acceptable, perhaps even, coupled with male pride, a justification for murder.The best thing about this book is the way Manderly is another character in the book. The presence and energy of Manderly are just as crucial as the humans in the story.What an incredible job Daphne DuMaurier does in creating her claustrophobic little world. A world, which in spite of everything is full of glamour and romance.How I long to have tea under the chestnut tree at Manderly on a perfect summer's afternoon! I think I'll wear my new summer frock with the flowers and that wide floppy hat...I wonder if Frifth will serve.And, of course, Rebecca is simply the most perfect hostess...Aren't the DeWinter's the perfect couple?What lies beneath the surface of Manderly? Read Rebecca and find out."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"You will like this book IF: You like well written stories. You enjoy real, not dippy, suspense. You adore books with surprise twists. You hate classics but read voraciously.This book IS a classic, but if all classics were like THIS one, no one would fail high school English anymore. The word choice is fantastic. The story evolves with such sophistication, it happens almost without the reader's awareness.

I give Rebecca four stars!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca captured me from the moment I open the cover. The detailed discription of every petal on the flowers, of every facial expression and what it relayed to the reader. The story swept me away with its interesting characters and twist and turns of the plot. As the book progressed I found myself not just relating to one character in the book but drawing from each a different aspect of life. When I read the last page of Rebecca I was yearning for more. Wanting to know what happened next. I literally read my copy to death. I had to resort to hard cover after going through so many paper backs they were falling apart. I have read a lot of great books in my years but none that stay with me as Rebecca does."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is a truly delightful classic that I can read over and over again. I have also watched the Alfred Hitchcock interpretation of the book, in his movie entitled Rebecca. You should see it! The movie captures all of the mystery, romance, and suspense of the book. Usually movies change the story drastically or just are not as good as the book. Hitchcock does the book justice! But anyway, READ THIS BOOK because it's truly engaging and beautifully written. You will not be able to put it down! One of my all time favorite novels."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"An assignment for my English Lit class at my highschool was to pick a classic to read. I brought home the list, and my mom told me I would LOVE Rebecca. She was right. It was hard for me to get into it at first, however, just because it was hard to understand. Anyway, I got a little furthur, and I could not put the book down. I absolutely loved it! It was developed into a very suspenseful mystery with a startling twist, and a little romance too. I could totally understand Mrs. de Winter, and I really felt for her battling in the shadow of Rebecca. I loved this book, and I am recommending it to everyone! Absolutely AWESOME!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"People rave on about Bronte, Austen and Dickens all the time. I'm sure that one day, Du Maurier will be up there with the best of them.

The way Du Maurier writes is so vivid that you can almost feel the craziness going on around you.If you liked Rebecca, I recommend Frenchman's Creek as well."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I like the trade paperback size, and I was surprised and delighted to find additional material at the end of the book: a letter from duMaurier about writing the novel, information about the real house that inspired Manderley, and the original epilogue from the novel.

Good writing doesn't date and Daphne de Maurier is a master at the art of gripping the reader in a finely-worded tale."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Daphne du Maurier has the talent to engulf you in her own mysterious world. With complete mastry of her own plot, she manages to captivate her reader till the very end of her book. I loved her books, and \\"Rebecca\\" is her masterpiece. I really couldn't put down the book until I reached the last page."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This review is for the reader thinking -'Yes, I know Rebecca is a classic, and the seminal work of Gothic fiction (where 'the' rhymes with 'tree', not 'duh'). But it a good read? And how does it compare with the movie?'It's been several weeks since I listened to Rebecca on audio CD, narrated by Anna Massey, and like its title character, the story haunts you long after you've finished the read.Why? Because the primary characters - Maxim, his brides I and II, Mrs. Danvers - don't so much interact, as haunt each other through the narrative. Their dialogue, on surface, is formal and prim, yet their conversions are dominated but chilling subtext - innuendo, suggestion, uncomfortable silence, discomforting looks. Their inner lives dominate each exchange, making Rebecca a wonderful, suspenseful chess game.Anna Massey's audio narration is spot on, capturing male and female characters equally well.The film is classic Hitchcock - filled with beauty and suspense. However, please read the book first! No film could ever capture the subtlety of these characters (although Olivier comes close). Also, the film includes some plot changes - demanded by Hollywood convention at the time - that detract from the story.I strongly recommended listening to the unabridged audio CD, but have no doubt Rebecca would fly off the written page too."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I read and loved this book as a teenager. I recently re-read it and loved it just as much. It's a wonderfully atmospheric read which is part mystery, part romance but not entirely either.The story is about a girl (she narrates the book, but we never learn her name) who is working as a lady's companion. In Monte Carlo they meet the taciturn Maxim de Winter, who recently lost his much loved wife Rebecca when she tragically drowned. She marries him and they return to his country estate, Manderley. Rebecca's presence can be felt everywhere: her belongings are still lying around, her clothes are still laid out in her bedroom and the staff follow the routines that she set. The new wife becomes obsessed with her predecessor, who seemed in every way to be her polar opposite: beautiful, glamorous, highly admired and very close to the icy housekeeper, Mrs Danvers. The book draws you in and I felt like I could completely identify with the heroine even while I was desperately wishing she would stand up for herself more.Just when you are starting to wonder if there is going to be anything more to the story, it takes a dramatic turn. The central mystery is resolved and it turns into a different style of book, almost a thriller - but still centered on the mysterious Rebecca.While it's clearly not a modern novel, it is in no way difficult to read (if anything, it's hard to put down). One thing that is interesting is that having been written in the 1930s, characters can react to events in a way that they probably wouldn't in a modern novel, even if it were set at the same time.The first couple of chapters are a little slow but do stick with it as you'll be hooked in no time - and then when you've finished the book you'll want to re-read them. This would be the perfect book to read curled up by the fire on a wintry afternoon."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Published in 1938, REBECCA was the third major work of novelist Daphne du Maurier (1907-1989), who was previously best known for the 1936 novel JAMACIA INN. Critical reception was lukewarm. Some accused the novel of being emotionally overwrought; others pointed out that plot was commonplace; still others described it as little more than a modern reworking of Charotte Bronte's JANE EYRE. But it was an instance in which the public was far head of the critics: it flew off bookstore shelves and quickly became one of the most popular novels of its era. It has never been out of print, and over time critical assesment has changed. REBECCA is now widely considered one of the great English novels of the 20th Century.The story does indeed have roots in the gothic romance novels of the 1800s and most particularly in Bronte's JANE EYRE. The narrator, whose name is never noted in the novel, is a young and socially inexperienced woman who meets, loves, and marries wealthy aristocrat Maxim de Winter. But there is an unexpected darkness. Maxim has been previously married. His first wife died in a tragic boating accident. Her name was Rebecca.When the second Mrs. de Winter arrives at Manderley, the great estate of the de Winter family, she finds it maintains a routine specified by Rebecca and enforced by housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who was Rebecca's servant. She senses Rebecca's presence throughout the house. She begins to compare herself to Rebecca and finds herself sadly lacking. She wonders why Maxim married her, a woman with no background, breeding, wealth, or beauty. Her intensifying insecurities not only prey upon her mind, they make her vulnerable to the manipulations of those on the estate, Mrs. Danvers in particular, who regard her as an unworthy outsider.But the second Mrs. de Winter has dangerously misjudged not only her own situation but the truth behind Rebecca's seemingly endless hold upon Maxim, Mrs. Danvers, and the estate. It has a darker basis than she suspects--and the great grace of the novel, which lifts it from the commonplace to the status of masterpiece, is du Maurier's ability to endow her characters with shockingly plausible life and to communicate the narrator's turn of mind through a delicately crafted yet amazingly powerful poetic narrative. From first line to last word, Rebecca rises like a ghost from the pages of the novel, as mysterious as the sea mist that so often encroaches on the lawns of the estate, as tangible as a tea tray by the fire--and all without ever once directly appearing in the novel. It is a remarkable literary feat.The novel, of course, was translated into an equally famous film directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine. Those who come to the book from the film will be surprised: although the film every effectively captures the tone of the book, it follows the story only up to a point, for the book's plot was not acceptable to the film censors of the day. But regardless of whether you come to the novel from the film or simply come to the novel cold, REBECCA is a brilliant work, and while she wrote a great many other fine works it remains Daphne du Maurier's great accomplishment, and indeed one of the great accomplishments of 20th century fiction. Strongly recommmended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"That famous line starts off the begining of Du Maurier's classic novel. The twenty-year-old female protaganist--whose first name we never know--is thrown into a whirlwind romance when she meets a much older man in a Monte Carlo hotel. He has recently lost his wife Rebecca, and is using his stay in Monte Carlo as a way to try and forget the past. Against her employer's advice, the unworldy and reserved protaganist becomes the new Mrs.de Winter in short order, and soon the couple return to his estate, Manderley.There, the new Mrs.de Winter expects everything to be perfect. Her illusions are quickly shattered when she realizes her new husband may still be in love with his dead wife, and seems to be hiding something from his past. Also, the Manderley housekeeper resents Mrs. de Winters presense for some unknown reason, and the west wing of the house is mysteriously not being used any longer. As the new Mrs. de Winter falls further and further under Manderley's spell she comes to realize that things are not always what they appear.Even though the theme of Rebecca may be a bit outdated in this day and age (my reaction would have been VERY different than the new Mrs. de Winter on learning the truth about my husband), this book definitely still stands the test of time. Slightly creepy and gothic, it's an interesting look into the lives of the wealthy and high-class almost a hundred years ago. Rebecca is like a fairy tale gone slightly wrong, for adults."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"DuMaurier's classic novel holds up some seventy plus years after it was written. I is a wonderful prototypical Gothic tale. As the plot twists and turns, the reader is left wondering what will happen next. The characters are well developed (even somewhat overdeveloped in the classic style). The author's ability to write then entire novel without ever using the protagonist's Christian name is an interesting variation.We read this for a book club. Some members had editions with an epilogue that was very confusing, conflicting and repeated a lot of information that is in the first chapter. After considerable digging on the internet, we found that this \\"epilogue\\" is actually notes used by the author in writing the book. To include this chapter without explanation is, in my opinion, a violation of the trust we place in publishers.Overall, this is simply a great book."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I never re-read books. How can I find time when there is so much I haven't even read for a first time? But I wanted to try and so I did with Rebecca. A novel I first read over 15 years ago. Funny how little I remember, including the climax and the surprise and bitter ending. The writing is superb, and I was inseparable from the book through the last 100 pages. The character development and depiction is one of the strongest traits of du Maurier, and it is no better pronounced than in the characters of Manderly - the estate, Mrs. Danvers, and Rebecca herself. Manderly being the ultimate beautiful estate, which becomes the unnecessary victim in this harsh story of murder, mystery and a fight for justice. Rebecca is as much alive as she is dead, and our narrator remains nameless throughout. Even on a second read, the book captivated me through and through, and I am quite happy to have gone down the pages one more time. Highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Daphne du Maurier's most famous book, Rebecca is told through the eyes of the young second wife of Maxim de Winter.

Daphne Du maurier is unquestionably one of the best novelists of our time. the whole setting and mood of the book is over shadowed with mystery and suspence and you get the feeling that all is not what meets the eye. the story starts to build the minute Max tells the unnamed story teller how he killed rebecca and how he hated her. after that, there is no relief from the building tension as the story reaches for the climax. but just as you think relief is in sight, Du maurier surprises you again, as the real climax does not manifest until the very last line. the heavy sense of irony is apparent in the very fact that the whole novel is based on a person who has been dead for a year. rebecca is truly a marvelous literary acheivement."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is probably the best book I have ever read.

REBECCA is a story seen through the eyes of a young girl who we only know by name as the second Mrs. DeWinter. She meets the charming, dashing and much older Maxim DeWinter in the South of France while she is employed as a paid companion. After a whirlwind romance they marry and he wisks her off to his hom e in Cornwall: Manderley. Manderley really is the main character of this gothic romance. The girl projects all of the insecurities brought on by youth and inexperience onto Manderley and the title character Rebecca. The most enjoyable part for me of reading REBECCA is the description of the house and grounds, the dishes and the bushes. Maybe Martha Stewart read REBECCA in her formative years. Daphne Du Maurier departs from the classic &quot;whodunit&quot; and is more concerned with the character of the place and the people involved. She shows us magnificiently how perception and reality can be almost diametrically opposed at times and the consequences of our often wrongheaded but very natural assumptions about other people and their motives. A wonderful read"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Spoilers WithinThis is an extremely well written and crafted story. At times it literally shimmers, in particular passages describing isolated moments in time. These brilliantly capture those momentary life fragments we want not only to preserve and treasure, but to constantly relive. Daphne du Mauriers' portrayals of the luxurious vegetation at Manderley resonate with sensuousness.Our narrator (whose name we never know - and I assume this to be deliberate?!), her husband Maxim, and the deceased Rebecca are the main characters - but I would say we feel mostly for our narrator. I kind of see Mrs Danvers as being Rebecca - or the ghost of Rebecca. There is a taunt tension throughout.Before I start to be critical I do want to emphasize that I enjoyed \\"Rebecca\\" immensely - the writing, for the most part, is enthralling. It was a pleasant reading experience.However there were aspects that irked me. I did find it somewhat long and stretched out. The self-effacing timidity of our main protagonist became overwrought about mid-way through the reading - one almost wants to shake her and yell \\"Get some back-bone girl, and stop blaming yourself for everything!!\\". And what a cold, uncaring fish this Maxim is! He has absolutely no radar for his wife's predicament.Until Favell appeared, the narrative was rather prudish - as if these people never took their clothes off. The last one hundred pages with Favell were a relief in providing needed humour and were a contrast to the first three-quarters of the book. The trial of the \\"rich Maxim\\" was a travesty of justice - the rich can get away with anything!The passages best summing up this romantic thriller (from page 244, chapter eighteen of my edition):\\"I could fight the living but I could not fight the dead... But Rebecca would never grow old. Rebecca would always be the same... She was too strong for me\\""},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book was written in 1938 so it seems very long winded for today's standards. The suspense is there and it holds your attention but at the same time, I just wanted the author to get on with the story already."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I had heard so much about rebecca but never really considered reading it .Finally irritated by all that i heard ,i picked it up and couldnt put it down ( it's true.. my sister even yelled at me)This is a reallly awesome book as it stresses on characters really well.The name of the protagonist ( caroline) is given just once in the whole book( which is kind of exasperating) but adds to the period drama the best part is that the characters are entirely convincing.They are extremely well drawn especially those of Maxim deWinter , Frank and of course, Rebecca.Even Small characters such as Ben, Bee and Favell do great justice to the intense plot.Most of all, the transformation of the new Mrs.de Winter is truly reviving.This book will keep you in susppense because it will take turns when you least expect it to and leave you yearning for more. Dont miss it! i recommend Jane Eyre and Pride and prejudice too!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"\\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderly again...\\"With that opening sentence, Rebecca offers an addicting and engrossing journey into the mind of our unnamed heroine, slowly tortured by her new marriage to Maxim DeWinter, a man twice her age, and haunted by his dead first wife, Rebecca--whose body was never discovered. She finds herself living in Rebecca's shadow and haunted by the mystery of the woman's death. She is and always will be the SECOND Mrs. DeWinter, something the sinister housekeeper, Ms. Danvers, will not let her forget.Rebecca is a novel of mystery and passion, a deliciously dark psychological tale with a brooding atmosphere and unbearable tension. Daphne DuMaurier has crafted an exceptional masterpiece of romantic suspense, one of the best books of the 20th century and possibly the best book in the romantic suspense genre. Highly Recommended!!!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"One of my teachers recommended this book to me; when she had told me about the plot of this story, I fell in love with it immediately. I could feel how mysterious the story would be even by hearing the outline. I have enjoyed reading Rebecca and enjoyed the feeling of love the author gave me. The story is about a shy young woman, after she marries the mysterious Mr. De Winter, lives under the dark shadow of his first wife, Rebecca. She always felt that people are comparing her to the lovely woman, Rebecca; even her servants did not treat her very kindly. As the story moves on, Mrs. De Winter begins to recognize Rebecca&iexcl;s personality more and more. Throughout the whole story, I always had a mysterious feeling about &iexcl;Who is Rebecca?&iexcl; when I was reading through, I really wanted to know more about this great woman.

I'd recommend it - and definitely would trust the site with a used book."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Based off the amazon.com description, I thought I had a pretty good idea of what this story would entail.I was wrong.Daphne du Maurier threw out some shockers with Rebecca. Where I got the idea there was an actual ghost involved, I have no clue. Maybe because it was written in 1938.It took me about three chapters to get into the story and then came page 264. What I read on this page may have been the greatest shock of my book reading life.After page 264 I read for 4 hours straight, forgoing dinner because I HAD TO FINISH. I was still in shock after I finished it.Without giving too much away (because you should really read it), I'll say just a few more things:I wanted to punch Mrs. Danvers in the face the entire book (I hated her character almost as much as Dolores Umbridge from Harry Potter)I thought the development of the new Mrs. de Winters was fantastic (she annoyed the heck out of me for quite a while)I'm a fan of BeatriceI'm still in shock at the turn of events. Days later, writing this review..my brain is thinking \\"Wha?\\" Talk about a good story. Usually I can predict the basic story line. Not this one folks. Not this one.Read it!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is one of my favorite books, I never tire of reading it. I read it once in High School and have been a fan ever since. I wish it was available as an e book though."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I heard about Rebecca from a friend. I googled it and found it intriguing. I borrowed it from my local library. The book is very interesting and written in a very good way. It will keep you hooked to it. I finished last half of the book over one night. Although the book is old, the story line is very interesting. A girl working for a rich lady meets a wealthy man, Mr. De Winter, and marries him. Rebecca is Mr. De Winter is deceased wife, who died drowning in water. On arriving home - a big mansion named Manderley - the girl finds that everyone such as servants, neighbors etc in Manderley talks about Rebecca and held her in high regards. The girl compares herself to Rebecca and overtime gets depressed. This is about 60% of the book. After this the story takes a turn, few divers finds drowned body and boat of Rebecca. Mr. and Mrs. De Winter get engulfed into a several emotional and legal problems. Several mysteries now unfolds slowly with every page and readers understands many things that were not clear in the first part of the book. I will not go into more details and be a spoiler. Writer explained nature in details in few places. I found it boring, but it is very personal. Other readers may like it or despise like me.Overall, I enjoyed this book and recommend it, and give it a four star."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Another book I'm sorry I put off so long. Any lovers of Jane Eyre should add this to their \\"to read\\" list, as they are similar in style and storyline. An unnamed female protagonist becomes swept up in a whirlwind romance with Maxim De Winter, a man desperate to forget the tragedy that befell him some months before the book started. They meet in Monte Carlo and are quickly married, though our unnamed woman must continue to work to come out from under Rebecca's shadow. The setting and the tone are perfectly balanced between overwhelming and lovely, with just enough of a hint of creepy. The ending packs a pretty good twist that satisfies.There isn't much in the way of red flags. There is a little violence, though the description of Rebecca's demise is not explained graphically. No cussing and no sexual situations fit with the time period."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is a flashback about a nameless young woman who becomes Mrs. de Winter and how she fares at Manderley. In her flashback, the heroine meets Maxim de Winter in a hotel at Monte Carlo. She is a paid companion to a Mrs. Van Hopper. After courting for only two weeks, Maxim asks her to marry him; she accepts and they go to Manderley, his home.Once at Manderley, the heroine finds out how Maxim's first wife died, or so it seems. However, the heroine is intimidated by the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, who was very fond of Rebecca when she was living. The heroine learns about Rebecca's beauty, charm, grace, and reputation, all of which seem impeccable. She believes that she cannot live up to Rebecca's legend and that Maxim is still in love with Rebecca.One day when a ship runs aground in a cove near the Manderley home, divers surveying the wreckage find Rebecca's boat with her body in its hold. Rumors spread like wildfire. Maxim is forced to tell the heroine the truth. (Spoiler Alert. The succeeding paragraph has been removed for that reason.)The heroine is relieved to find that Maxim never loved Rebecca. There is an inquest, causing Maxim much anxiety. (Spoiler Alert. The succeeding paragraph has been removed for that reason.) Despite much hardship, Maxim is exonerated. On their way home to Manderley, Maxim and his wife cross a ridge just miles from Manderley and see it in flames. The story ends intimating that Mrs. Danvers was responsible.This story is so beautifully worded that the words flow through the mind and over the tongue like smooth water.At first the beginning of the story is confusing, but everything quickly falls into place.The unnamed heroine is so easy to identify with, as she seems to embody every thought of naivety and well meaning intention.The values of loyalty, honor, and love stand stronger than the forces beyond the grave. The elements of revenge, duplicity and fear are woven throughout the story. A way to cope with fear is evident in the unnamed heroine's story, causing it to be a story not only of resolve but of courage and triumph."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I purchased this for my granddaughter's required summer reading and also read it myself. It's a great romance in the old style with enough twists and turns to keep the reader guessing."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"\\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderly again.\\"The beginning of this classic is really the ending, an epilogue as an introduction. The dark mood, the sense of dread that is established in the dream sets the stage for the entire novel.For anyone who may not be familiar with the story, the narrator (who is unnamed) is a young woman who goes from being a companion for an obnoxious wealthy American woman vacationing in Europe to becoming the wife of Maximilian de Winter, an older, wealthy mysterious man whose first wife, Rebecca, died the previous year. The two women couldn't be more polar opposites. While Rebecca was outgoing and gregarious, the new Mrs. de Winter is shy almost to the point of being antisocial. Rebecca commanded attention; new Mrs. de W craves anonymity. Rebecca feared nothing; new Mrs. de W fears everything, including the memory of Rebecca.This is one I wish I could read again for the first time. Knowing the ending as I read it again I missed the real sense of mystery that grabbed me so before, but the writing is close to perfect. I've said it before about some of the classics, but I love the language. It isn't the same as in Jane Eyre or Pride and Prejudice since the setting is 1930s England rather than pre-Victorian, but du Maurier paints images with her words as well or as better than any author I've ever read.There were things about it that, reading it as an adult, didn't affect me when I read it before. As in Jane Eyre, I cringed a little with the idea of a young woman marrying a much older man with such obvious secrets that no one will talk about. I tried to set this problem aside and enjoy the story for what it was, but it wasn't easy. It was a difficult balance between the wonderful writing and a twenty-first century perspective on so obviously a dysfunctional relationship. I think this quote of Maxim from Chapter 16 aptly illustrates his patronizing opinion of his wife as well as the degree to which he prefers her to remain ignorant of his past: \\"A husband is not so very different from a father after all. There is a certain type of knowledge I prefer you not to have. It's better kept under lock and key. So that's that. And now eat up your peaches and don't ask me any more questions, or I shall have to put you in the corner.\\" I guess if you're a forty-year-old man married to a twenty-year-old girl in the early twentieth century, you can say things like that.***Spoiler Alert*** It also bothered me tremendously that when the narrator finds out her husband shot and killed his first wife her response is to help him cover up his crime. Call me overly sensitive, but how does a woman in any century find this acceptable behavior in a husband? ***Spoiler Alert and Sermon Over***I realize, of course, that this was written in a different time and that it is a mystery, and while the major problem I had with the relationship between Maxim and Wife #2 made me uncomfortable, it is still a classic worth reading. She does achieve a significant amount of maturity by the end of the story...which is in the first chapter...and I was glad to see that. I have sometimes criticized others for judging people in the past by today's standards, so I want to give both Mrs. de W #2 and the author the benefit of the doubt and encourage you to read the story as the thriller it is meant to be. I would also highly recommend Alfred Hitchcock's 1940 movie version with Sir Lawrence Olivier and Joan Fontaine."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I'm a shy girl myself, so I really felt like I could relate to the main character of the book. I could understand the paranoia she felt, her over-sensitivity of what others thought of her, and her feelings of not fitting in. I believe the major points to the story was was to show how the main character finally gains complete confidence in herself and confidence in her husband's love for her.One of the most memorable quotes is when the main character realizes how foolish her fear of people was:\\"I wondered how many people there were in the world who suffered, and continued to suffer, because they could not break out from their own web of shyness and reserve, and in their blindness and folly built up a great distorted wall in front of them that hid the truth.\\"To tell the truth, it was hard for me to get past the first chapter or so, but once you finally get to the main story it becomes much more interesting. Right when I finished the book, I actually went back and read the first chapter and finally understood how it all came together."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book is about a young bride's obsession with her husband's dead ex-wife. When the twenty-one year old narrator meets Maxim de Winters, she falls head over heels in love with him. Some reviewers have complained that the storyline runs too slow in the beginning. I couldn't disagree more.The beginning of the book is a journey to expose the readers to the depth of the narrator's love for Maxim. She loves Maxim so much she mourns every minute she passes with him because it will soon fade away. Even as they sit, talk, or walk together, she is thinking there goes a minute with him I can never relive again. She imagines (and she imagines the worst possible scenarios often!) that years later she will look back on the moments as a distant memory and he won't even remember her.I imagine some readers may not find the narrator particularly appealing. After all, she is painfully shy, excruciatingly self-conscious, and utterly pessimistic. Normally I would find these qualities in a heroine less than desirable, but again I believe she was written this way not only to identify the readers with the intensity of the love she feels for Maxim, but also to show how that love changes her.The narrator's life with Maxim begins with doubts. Her first introduction to Maxim de Winters is that he is a widow who just can't get over his deceased wife's death. When he proposes to her when they meet in a hotel in Monte Carlo, the narrator is stunned but naively believes Maxim and her will soon begin a fairy tale life together in his beautiful estate by the name of ManderleyManderley proves to add to the narrator's insecurities. Not only are there constant reminders of Maxim's former wife everywhere, but the young bride almost begins to lose it imagining how her predecessor strolled down the same long halls, sat at the same desk, used the same phone. To make matters worse, Manderley's housekeeper, the creepy Mrs Danvers, expresses an immediate dislike of the new Mrs de Winters and she takes every opportunity to add to the narrator's fears and insecurities.When I least expected it, a bomb was dropped and the novel took a turn I could hardly have expected. All the casual comments that seemed like useless chatter begin to make sense until the truth behind every mystery is revealed. I didn't really care for the abrupt ending. I feel there should have been a few more chapters, but it was still a wonderful read. I was so enthralled by this book, I actually set my alarm for 6am when I only had a few chapters to go so that I could finish it before my daughter woke up. When the pieces start to come together, there is no way you will be able to put this book down."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"A young woman of 21, the \\"paid companion\\" to an elderly woman, meets Maxim de Winter, a man of means, while vacationing in Monte Carlo. After the two spend the week driving in the country, de Winter proposes marriage to her at the moment of her leaving. She accepts and they and make their way to a new life at de Winter's Cornish estate, Manderly. But, very soon after arriving, the young woman realizes that filling the shoes of Maxim's former wife, \\"Rebecca,\\" will be a daunting task, both in that she has not been groomed in the world of riches, and that her husband may still be in love with his former wife, in spite of the fact that she is dead.The heroine in this classic novel is barely ever mentioned by name, except once she becomes \\"the new Mrs. De Winter,\\" thus suggesting her insignificance without his association. Du Maurier's prose paints the anxious, tormented inner thoughts of the new wife of de Winter, who constantly feels inferior to her predecessor, and the earlier wife's \\"presence\\" is keenly felt through her overpowering artifacts remaining at Manderly, as well as though the memories of those who knew her. It is in the contrasting of the \\"modest\\" new wife and the terribly confident and ever-popular Rebecca upon which the novel draws its tension, as well as through the withholding of the story's outcome until its final chapters."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I am a huge fan of contemporary romantic suspense and had very low expectations for this book I considered \\"dated.\\" In many ways, the language, the pacing, the heavy description, it is dated and feels slow compared to what we are used to in the genre. However, time doesn't diminish the power of the story, the sense of doom you feel for the unnamed narrator, the classic tension DuMaurier builds with every dark scene. I'm glad I didn't rely on the movie to know the story of Rebecca. The book is a classic for good reason."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"The best. The author is a great writer. Her descriptions take you there. I am reading it the second time through. I have watched the movie at least 6 times. Great story. Great writing.

Daphne Du Maurier weaves a tale full of tension and suspense that grips the reader from the start and doesn't let go.Max de Winter brings his new bride to Manderley, the home he shared with his beautiful first wife Rebecca, before her untimely death widowed him. Rebecca's presence still seems to permeate Manderley, haunting the new Mrs de Winter and sapping her confidence. The housekeeper Mrs Danvers who loved Rebecca and resents her place being 'usurped' feeds the young brides insecurities at every opportunity and makes her doubt her husbands love for her. When whispers of murder start to be heard, Mrs de Winter starts to doubt her new husband as well as her own sanity.A fantastic tale that can be read time and time again without becoming stale or boring."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Suspense, mystery, intrigue and one of the most fantastic twists in the tale. Reading through the narrators guilt and past everyones reverence of Rebecca a new branch is extended, and Rebecca's true colours are finally known. The part where Maxim tells his wife about Rebecca is spine-chilling-- not in a sense of the supernatural or blood and gore, but in a true psychological thriller sense (though that genre falls short of describing the thickly woven ruses in this novel). Classical."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"When I first got the book (very recently) I didn't expect much to it. I mean the sad reason I got it was because &quot;REBECCA&quot; was my name, and I've always wanted to read a book all about &quot;ME&quot;. But the moment I set my reading bud to work I absolutly fell in love with it. To give a brief describtion of the book is impossible. And I mean it when I say that. It is filled with such suspense and mystery that you have to read it yourself in order to find out. After reading the book (in just 2 days) I hated myself to death for finishing it. It leaves so puzzled and sad, I had to cry myself to sleep that night(which probably won't happen to you because I'm in a very emotional stage of my life). But if you really don't want your heart to break I suggest you to be very prepared, which I was not unfortunately. I would suggest this to anyone because after reading it, it gives you an very needed slap into reality."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I thought that Rebbecca was a little confusing in the beginning but the middle and the end were great!

The ending seemed a little sad though, and when I had finished, I went back and read the first 2 chapters again and they seemed to make alot more sense.

I gave myself a few weeks to read it, but wound up finishing it within a week.The book started off a little bit slow, but after the first couple of chapters, it picked up because Mrs. de Winter was reminiscing, which is what the novel is about. The character development within the book was great. Each distinct characteristic of Maxim, Mrs. Danvers and Mrs. de Winter formed the novel. They were all different and contributed to the revelation at the end of the book. I thought it was great. The end was a little confusing, but when I reread the first couple of chapters, I understood exactly what happened."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rich with tenderness and sympathy for the sensitive heroine, this romantic tale gradually becomes a murder mystery, both haunting and at moments, terrifying. The unexpected outcome makes way not only for an intriguing surprise, but also for a happier ending than we'd feared we would get to witness. An excellent novel for the true romantic."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I have seen this film numerous times and listened to the book on tape. I love being swept away to a mansion on the side of a rocky sea side cliff. I loved imagining waking up in the morning and having nothing to do but stroll the grounds and choose menues for the day's meals.A scene that strikes a cord with me is when the girl tells Maxim how she is alone in the world. Her parents are dead and she has no siblings. Before I got to that part of the story I wondered just how two people could come together so magnetically then I understood. They were both alone in the world and really did need each other.Had the story taken place in modern day times the heroine would have been advised to &quot;get a job.&quot; Through the story we witness this girl's growth from a young girl into a women. I agree with the other people who say the ending seems a bit forced and really leaves you wanting more. For one thing since they are so rich why don't they just build a new home instead of wandering from hotel to hotel? It makes no sense."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I'm not sure if my book is missing pages, but the ending didn't seem too complete. The begginning didn't seem to match up with the end. (could anyone whose read this book send me an email? ashleythewriter@hotmail.com) otherwise, this book is wonderful. The nameless narrator narrates in such a way that you are shocked, appalled, distressed, happy when she is. It's like you are her, going through the many ups and downs of life at Manderley.(and there are alot). One flaw, I sometimes wondered why the characters did some things. Maxim seemed to have no feelings one day, and tons the next day(referring to narrator). anyway, read this book."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Du Maurier's &quot;Rebecca&quot; is a very surprising, gothic murder-mystery and dreadful romance saga in one book. Does the novel manange to handle all of the elements successfully? Yes, with a hypnotic yet fevered pace. Though it starts off rather slow, the novel becomes like a good drug. Soon you'll crave more, and soon it will possess you. Anyone interested in horror should read this book. The vivid images have a way of creeping up to you. The only problem I had with this book was that there seemed to be a lot of unnecessary description where a few strong words could have done the trick instead of a few strong pages. Still, this is an exciting, character-filled saga of mystery."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I find this novel a very exciting story. It's a love story and a little thriller too.

But sometimes I had problems to understand the context. But we read the book together into the class and so we talked a lot about this book, and I got answers to my questions.

Before he also had a wife, who he had killed. In order to forget his past he married this new wife. They live together happily in his big manor house called &quot;Manderly&quot; until someone finds the body of his first dead wife Rebecca. Then the story becomes confused and Maxim has to prove his &quot;innocence&quot; My opinion is that Maxim does not use his new wife only for his own good. So when I read the book I was sometimes angry with him. But that's what makes the book interesting. And so I would advise you to read this book.

Decieving plots and characters littered the many words that deprived the reader of sense with the beauty of the novel.The nameless narrator arrives at Manderly, with a brief and secretive husband, Maxim de Winter. Yet the narrater, so shy and naive, feels out of place at the enchanted home, empty now and odd as the late Mrs. de Winter, Rebecca, had already left her mark of impressiojn upon everyone ever setting foot in Manderly. The servant of Rebecca, potently loyal Mrs. Danvers, is the main nemisis. Using her and many of the other servants, Daphne du Maurier creats a stunning picture of Rebecca just from the emotions shown of these people, though Rebecca has beern dead through the book.After strange and cruel unwelcomings, the naiuve narrater finds herself prior to the deciete of Mrs. Danvers and the evil yet devoted Mr. Favell, cousin of Rebecca. When a random yet plotted string of events takes place that hurts the narrater to the core. Yet further breaking points in Maxim and Mrs. Danvers releasing important clues that bring Maxim closer to the narrater and building confidence against Mrs. Danvers. As her confidence grows stronger and love more profound, she discovers something that will change her life forevert--as the secrets of Rebecca unravel...This book is slow in the beginning, but patient readers will find that the book is brilliantly written andpersonally, almost creepy.

I had somehow escaped this story during my younger days but am delighted to have found it as an adult. The opening paragraph has the power to remove you from your surroundings and drop you into the rural landscape of early 20th C England. The demure yet unpolished and insecure young protagonist forces us to connect personally to her constant neurosis concerning her adaptation into the DeWinter home. We have all felt at times so unsure of ourselves and questioned nearly everything and everyone around us. It is this instant symbiotic connection with this young woman which makes the story so engaging. We hope vicariously that her instantanteous entrance into high society is smooth and successful but cower with her when her youthful naivete bungles the daily household management. However, when her paranoia leads her to unearth Rebecca's memory, the real story begins. What a great way to spend a reading respite.

The best novel I have read in a very long time.I couldn't love the characters but I did very much love the novel. It is a good mystery/romance. The descriptions of Manderley, a big old English country house were wonderful. So were the descriptions of the everyday routine of life at Manderley from time in the morning room with correspondence and a review of the planned menu to tea in the library.The author is clearly a class snob and does not speak well to anything she thinks inferior.

Part mystery, part thriller, part gothic and one hundred percent genius!Most of the story is set at Manderley, an old family estate in England, where our intrepid heroine, whose name is never revealed to us, returns as a happy, but unsure, newlywed. Her new husband, Maxim, lived at Manderley with his first wife, Rebecca, who died a drowning death under mysterious circumstances the year before. That would be enough to handle for any young wife, but add to the mix Maxim's aloof nature, the constant reminders of the beautiful, seemingly perfect Rebecca, from her portraits to her monogramed belongings, to her maid, the creepy Mrs. Danvers and you have a story that is set to explode! An original, never-see-it-coming twist at the end makes this tale extremely gratifying.Definitely 5 stars.For an added bonus, check out the 1940 movie of the same name with Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, the black and white film is a wonderful adaptation of the book!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is the story of a rather clueless and sheltered woman's experience of love, wealth, and illusion. It is a classic of the genre and the progenitor of countless imitations. It is also a bit like an extravagant work of confectionary--it is great for its few passing moments, it may even haunt your palette for some time, but ultimately--so what?Ms. Du Maurier is a master of the well turned phrase to be sure. Just read the book's opening lines. The ever-tightening web of suffocation that she weaves is truly impressive.Still, Rebecca is no lasting masterpiece. If it is the mentally haunting effect of the work that you crave, let me suggest you turn instead to the Man Who Was Thursday by Chesteron or any of the novels of Charles Williams. If you are a devotee of the well turned phrase, Austen, or even Shirley Jackson, is more effective.All in all, Rebecca dwells in the borderland between a 3 and a 4 star book.A classic? Yes. Due to its impact on subsequent writers.A masterpiece? I had dreamt a little more of Manderley than I found there."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Daphne Du Maurier's Rebecca is one of the most gothic-romantic stories of the 20th century, and is very compelling story, for all types of readers. One of the most interesting things about the story is, of course, the main character : The Second Mrs. DeWinter, who happens to not have a name present in the story.The story revovles around a girl who is young mid-teens' early 20's, who works for a cold, obnixious old woman. Her life isn't really worth wild intill she meets the widower Mr. Maxiam DeWinter. The distant maxiam, who's dead first wife, Rebecca, present is still strong as ever, as if she was alive. Mr. DeWinter than marrys the naive woman, who would later in the novel, only be known as \\" The Second Mrs. DeWinter.\\" The second Mrs. DeWinter than moves into Manderlay, Mr. DeWinter's home. While there she meets the sinster Mrs. Danvers. Who seems to not get over the fact that Rebecca has died. And trys to make The Second Mrs. DeWinter's expirence as unplesant as she can.I first read this book after watching the movie, and just like the phrase, the book is much better. I enjoyed how the character really didn't have a name, which adds to her personality. Her having no name makes sense, The second Mrs. DeWinter, she's mousy, navie, not very confidence, which is the opposite of Rebecca, Maxiam's first wife. I would recommend this book to 13 years or older, or people who enjoy reading, simply as that."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I first read this book in the eighth grade.

One of the most important things to me in a book is a catchy beginning. This is something this book dfinitely did NOT have. Absolutely nothing happens for the first 230 pages. Then the plot gets interesting and we learn Maxim's deep, dark secret. What I don't understand is why the second Mrs. DeWinter stays with Maxim after finding out what he did. The plot is totally unreallistic, because Maxim asked her to marry him after knowing her for about two weeks. Also, no woman in her right mind would stay with a man who committed murder. And why don't we ever find out the second Mrs. DeWinters's first name? Overall, I really don't recomend this book. I had wanted to read Rebecca for a long time because everyone said it was so good. I must say I was extremely disappointed with the novel. This is a good book to cure insomnia. I hope I have better luck with the movie."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I haven't read a book where I've despised the main character THIS MUCH in a long time. She's spineless and worries incessantly through out the entire book and it gets annoying pretty much immediately. I read this over my vacation so it's been a little while, but I remember there are multiple times where she has imaginary conversations in her head about what people must think when they compare her to Rebecca, but never takes any action to calm those fears by, you know, talking to people. She never talks to her husband about his weird behavior, clings to him like a barnacle, and basically allows the servants to walk all over her. It got to the point where I just started skimming over her introspections in order to get the story moving along. What a feeble, insecure, and mind-numbingly annoying female lead! You'll roll your eyes at how ridiculously timid she is. Ugh!I give the book 2 stars for the mystery in and of itself, which I thought was fairly good - but seriously could have done without the main character mewling every five seconds. :("},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I couldn't wait to read it after it was recommended to me.

It's a slow starter, but once it gets going, it is one of the most intriguing books you'll ever read.Rarely does a novel pull off the first person perspective as well as Rebecca does. It is often just a plot device for cute asides, but here it is a true window into a fascinating subject. Were this novel from Maxim's POV, for example, it would not work. All of the descriptions and all of the imagining tell us only what the heroine sees. What is really happening at any given point is anyone's guess until all is explaining in the shocking climax. What makes this book different from, say, Jane Eyre or The Mistress of Mellyn, is that it makes use of the reader's own security. It taps into that part of our brains that is always thinking, \\"Am I good enough? How do I compare? Am I loved?\\"Maxim, love him or hate him, is one of the least cliche characters I have ever read. Everytime you think you know what he is going to say, he says something completely different. Not even Mr. Darcy's horrid proposal could compare to Maxim's. He is, truly a unique character.Read it. When you're through, watch Hitchcock's film version. While movies so often can't compare to novels, you will be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Thus begins Daphne Du Maurier's classic 1938 novel of romantic suspense. \\"Rebecca\\" is a subtle, slow building thriller with a page-turning finish, set in Cornwall in the 1920's.The story's narrator is a woman whom we meet as the young paid companion to a wealthy lady visiting Monte Carlo. They encounter Maxim de Winter, an older English gentleman said to recovering from a personal tragedy. De Winter and the young woman begin an awkward friendship that quickly leads to a surprise marriage proposal.Maxim de Winter brings his new bride to his estate of Manderly. The young Mrs. de Winter struggles to find her footing in a household dominated by the sinster housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, and haunted by memories of the first Mrs. de Winter, supposedly drowned in a boating accident. When the body of the first Mrs. de Winter is suddenly discovered, everything the second Mrs. de Winter thinks she knows about her marriage is called into question. The dead hand of the past, and a very live hand in the present, will threaten everything she holds dear.\\"Rebecca\\" is a superbly crafted, deliciously atmospheric murder mystery, very highly recommended to fans of Daphne Du Maurier."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This was a selection for our book group. I was quite disappointed...were we really reading an ancient romance? I then read the book, and was quite astounded. Suffice it to say this is a great book. This is what modern authors should strive for. A great story with awesome characters and development. It is not over-wordy, and the author never goes on self serving or confusing rants. Pure entertainment with strong messages perhaps more relevant now than in 1938. Great, great, book."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I read this book in the 8th grade and haven't forgotten it. Since then I've brushed up on it a couple of times. Rebecca, the late wife of Maxim, is praised and adored by the staff at Maxim's house. The new wife (whose name we are never given) feels inadequate to fill the \\"wonderful\\" shoes of Rebecca. Since there are many other reviews that describe what happens, I will touch on why this book is memorable and worth reading.The biggest plus to this book is suspense. Was Rebecca who others thought she was? Did Maxim adore her? Does the new wife have any chance at his heart considering their chaste relationship? They didn't even sleep in the same room. It's no wonder that the new wife feels like she'll never match up. The story picks up halfway through the book when we discover that Rebecca isn't all she pretended to be. This idea intrigued me, and I was relieved to find that Maxim preferred his new wife and did love her more than Rebecca. I do agree with the other reviewers who said that another chapter could have been added to the ending. I would like to know how their marriage was different after the trial and fire."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"My love for the classics intersects with my mother's love for murder mysteries . . . My mother had been telling me forever to read this book. I would get through a few chapters and grow tired of the incredibly long descriptive passages. On a recent trip to London, though, I steeled myself for the first couple of slow chapters (which my mother kept telling me were \\"worth it\\" to get through) and fell in love with this novel. It is fascinating, mysterious, romantic, and terrifying all at once. I simply could not put it down. It will remain a favorite of mine for life."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"As an inspirational romance author, I found Rebecca to be intense and gripping. Daphne DuMaurier did a wonderful job of capturing the flavor of the era. Her characters were real, even the dead Rebecca, the first Mrs. De Winter, invokes her evil through her loyal servant Ms. Danvers. And, when the innocent second Mrs. De Winter enters the scene, she discover Manderley is not a fairy tale land as Mrs. Van Hopper described, but a breathing, seething, bleeding house with many secrets, buried and alive. Life will never be the same for the innocent Mrs. De Winter as she discovers, learns and fights for her own destiny. I couldn't put this book down. And, now I'm reading it's sequel, &quot;Mrs. De Winter&quot; by Susan Hill, and so far, I'm not disappointed. If you're in for a cozy thriller with plenty of twists and turns, then this is the book for you. Good reading, and I bid you good dreams. By Kelly R. Stevens, author of &quot;Ragdoll, Song of the Cimarron,&quot; and &quot;One With the Wind.&quot;"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"... by the long descriptions or the romance-novel cover. They say you can't judge a book by its cover, but I did for a looooong time (until I found a gorgeous red hardback with gold embossing). I was also somewhat offput by the peeks at dialogue and descriptions. The first ten pages or so are a bit tough to get through, with lush descriptions of the manor, but then the story picks up pace.The unnamed heroine, the second Mrs. de Winter, is first shown to us as a gawky, freaked young girl who befriends Maxim de Winter while accompanying an American woman around. Maxim marries the young woman quickly, but even before they reach his home at Manderly, she feels the eerie spell of Rebecca, Wife No. 1.Adding to the creepy suspense is grim Mrs. Danvers and the staff of Manderly, who dwell on Rebecca as much as if she were still alive. Mrs. de Winter can't even pet the dog or sit in a chair without thinking how &quot;this is what Rebecca did...&quot;Du Maurier's skill is shown in the crafting of a dead woman, not even a ghost or apparition, who nevertheless haunts Manderly and everyone in it. The heroine gains a backbone over the course of the novel, while you start to hate Mrs. Danvers more and more...The prose is lush and visual - often it takes up a few paragraphs when it's a particularly pretty place. You will vividly see the trees around Manderly, the yawnworthy hotel at the beginning, the gardens of the house, the rooms, and so on. The descriptions and characterizations are subtle and beautiful, so that you can almost feel Rebecca there as well.A small warning to anyone who might read the mass-market paperback: It may not be worth it. I checked out several copies and the print was tiny and smudgy."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"A wonderful romantic story that will make any woman feel better about herself. A shy, self-conscious young girl marries a handsome and rich widower and goes to live at his mansion...great, right? Wrong. She cannot escape the shadow of her new husband's seemingly perfect deceased wife Rebecca. Everything she does seems to be wrong and not how Rebecca would have done it. The narrator overcomes her nagging insecurity to discover what really happened to Rebecca. Du Maurier creates a wonderfully suspenseful environment and uses several opportunites to shock you. This is the first novel I've read in a long time that totally shocks me with it's revalations. I say read it if you like suspense, surprises, and dramatic character shifts."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Anna Massey's dramatic voice provides just the right degree of drama and tension for Rebecca, the psychological story of a young woman's confrontations with a remote employer, a hostile housekeeper, and the ghost of a past wife. The unabridged presentation allows for full appreciation of Du Maurier's works and subtlety: highly recommended."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is a wonderful story! It is one of those stories that was first read as a teenager and gets pulled of the shelf and enjoyed again every few years!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Featuring the whimsical prose of the introspective young main character, this book sets a mood for heavy poetic descriptions and laments into her thoughts. The reader will travel with the character and learn of the epic story of Rebecca, revealed piece by piece. The subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) pieces are enough to aid the reader in figuring out Rebecca's startling story on his or her own, but some of the twists of the book are beyond the imagination of even the most clever reader.The strengths of this book are its remarkable organization, its prose which often times caused me to stop to ponder a quote or a particular idea, the brilliantly vivid descriptions, some literary risks that the author took that worked, and most of all, its stabbing ending. While it has often been described as a page turner, I can say that I was able to put it down during the first half relatively easily, but the last fourth of the book I could not put down.The weaknesses of the story is more a matter of personal preference. I personally don't like traditional British writing for its wordiness/over descriptions. However, the descriptions were bearable as they were poetic and charming. I also had a hard time identifying with the characters and was a bit frustrated with the main character at times, but this all ended up serving a greater purpose in the end.In all this book went beyond expectations in its story line, and fell short of some (it didn't turn out to be my oh my goodness favorite book ever). No doubt that fans of British writing style should love this story which has definitely earned its place among the classics."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca / 0-380-77855-6\\"Rebecca\\" is not your typical romance novel; indeed, it often feels more like a mystery novel, with the heroine often just on the cusp of discovering a terrible secret. DuMarier's writing is superb and keeps the reader constantly on edge, carefully maintaining the central conceit of the novel: the heroine's husband, Maxim, remembers his deceased wife Rebecca in a much different light than how the heroine sees her. DuMarier wonderfully utilizes secondary characters to provide valuable allies and frightening enemies as the narrator steps carefully along the labyrinthine mystery she has inadvertently married into.Frustratingly, and yet fittingly, DuMarier has chosen to strip the narrator of a name; she has no identity in this new world, except as Rebecca's successor - a sort of \\"not-Rebecca\\", for better or for worse. Allies, friends, enemies, and relatives never seem to truly see HER - they can only judge the difference between her and Rebecca. Even the narrator eventually internalizes this attitude, turning the novel into something of a cautionary tale: a warning against surrendering your self-image to those around you who would define and judge you.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This wonderful book bored me quite a bit of the way through, but maybe that is because I am a high-school student, and I had to read it. Without pressure, most books are much more pleasing. However, looking back, thinking about it, I love this book. Du Maurier is a talented author. She has created a grand environment, the immense Manderley. She has also made great and intriguing characters: the young, timid narrator, quite often the only one who is left not knowing what is going on (she is never referred to by her first name); the rich, enigmatic Maxim De Winter, the narrator's husband; the loyal servants, including the ever-active Frith and the bumbling Robert; the unforgettable Mrs. Danvers, always seeming to lurk in the shadows, always looking upon Mrs. De Winter with a keen eye of expectancy and detest; the tactless Beatrice; Maxim's agent, Frank Crawley; and of course, the dead, ever-present, haunting Rebecca. The narrator comes to Manderley, completely new to this lifestyle, and forever falls in the shadow of Rebecca. She learns of Rebecca's fate, having drowned in the sea after her boat capsized. She learns everything about the ways of Manderley, and tries to follow these unwritten laws. Then, a ship crashes somewhere near Manderley, and a diver is sent to survey the damage. When he comes up, he reports the discovery of Rebecca's ship! He also reports a body found in the cabin. Could there have been another passenger onboard? Did Rebecca even drown at all? Could she have been murdered? I won't spoil the big surprises, suffice to say this is where the plot twists and you begin to see the shades of gray. And of course, the last surprise, which is even foreshadowed on page 3 or 4, is given on the last page for the final eye-opener."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I read this book as a British literature project for school. I read it in two days, since it was so hard to put down! This book makes you really connect with the main character, whom the author kept nameless in a stroke of genius. I could feel the anguish and pain of the main character as she tried to fill in Rebecca's place in the manor. I could almost see parts of myself in the main character, she was so realistic. We've all had doubts that we could fill in the shoes of someone without messing it up. Plus, Rebecca was so seemingly perfect in every way. A must-read, very captivating and realistic."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"&quot;Rebecca&quot; is one of the most haunting novels I have ever read. The opening sentence alone is enough to give one the shivers: &quot;Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.&quot;The novel started as a project to see how long the author could go without naming her main character, and ends up as being a fascinating read. Maxim de Winter is a man with secrets, and his new bride, who feels Rebecca's oppressive spirit everywhere in their new home, is an honest and brave character with whom all readeres should be able to identify with. She is made of stronger stuff than any romance novel charcter I've ever read.Rebecca herself, although her voice is rarely heard and she lives on through memories of the inhabitants of Manderley is still a force to be reckoned with. Rebecca's loyal servant Mrs. Danvers (quite possibly the creepiest personal maid/housekeeper in literature) will make your skin crawl.The book has an astonishing ending and I guarantee that anyone who picks the book up will not only be unable to put it down, but when the last page is turned, will start to reread it immediately."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is an interesting book in many ways, but what makes it really different to many others is that we never, ever find out the name of our heroine, who narrates the tale, and the Rebecca who gives her name to the title is dead before the story begins. Thus is the scene set for a fabulously dark and brooding mystery.The characters are wonderful. We have our nameless heroine, her distant husband Max, whom she loves to distraction, and the malevolent housekeeper Mrs Danvers, who was devoted to Rebecca, the dead but original lady of the house. And the house itself, beautiful Manderley, with fabulous gardens and deep dark mysteries.It really is a delicious read, good for a stormy night, and despite the tortured relationships and scenarios throughout the story it has a surprising but very satisfying ending. It is a classic, and deservedly so."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"In reading a book, I know the author left an impact if I find myself missing the characters after turning the last page. Even though we were never told her name, the narrator is a character that lies inside many woman. She is a person they fear to be, the fear of losing ones personality in loving a man. Du Maurier clearly did a beautiful job in creating this character"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca was a book I read for my english class.

Ms. Du Maurier introduces her characters at a pace that today would be considered slow and unmarketable. But this is one of THE classics, filled with mystery, suspense--one of the true thrillers. And all of this without blood, lacerations and decomposed corpses in the first chapter. I remember reading and seeing the movie years ago as a teen, and gripping the edge of my seat. Now, as a mystery author, I could only wish to write a clever and exciting story such as this! Editors and publishers in the large houses should re-read this and remember what writing a thrilling mystery is about."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I read this book as an assignment for an English class, but I appear to have missed the \\"Classic, romantic and suspenseful\\" elements in it that so many other reviewers talk about. I couldn't find the romance in Maxim taking the main character for several car rides, where she did all the talking, before he proposed to her. After being married, Maxim grows distant and the main character grows incredibly paranoid that she doesn't measure up to Maxim's first wife, Rebecca. Not that she actually does anything about it. No, instead of confiding in someone, getting over it, or even talking to her husband, she goes on moping around for months.I found the main character spineless and annoying, the story in need of some editing (300+ pages, most of them of the main character worrying and complaining, is far too much for my taste,) and the ending pretty anti-climatic.I also had a hard time believing Maxim felt guilty about his crimes. Which is probably not good, given that the main character decides to over look them. She's just so relieved that he wasn't still in love with Rebecca.Perhaps I missed the point. (Whether it was to sympathize with the main character, or the whole story was about hate... I've yet to find an explanation that makes me want to explore the story more, and honestly, I don't think I'd want to have anything to do with it again.)"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This version of the audio-book is an abridged version of the book and this fact is not indicated in the listing.

I expected more of a mystery, more of a mind bending plot, not endless pages of nothing happening. The &quot;mystery&quot; did not surface until about 75 pages to the end. The ending deeply confused me and left the story hanging. Perhaps the &quot;sequels,&quot; which were released more than 50 years after &quot;Rebecca&quot; was published, will make things clearer. I do not recommend."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"The archetype of the buck-fifty romance novel. It's light reading, mildly entertaining, but it's nothing spectacular.

I chose to ignore them and read the book anyways. Hmm...My verdict (which was swift from the beginning but kept getting delayed because I want to give the book full justice) is that I wished I never picked up this book. The author did an excellent job of keeping up the sense of foreboding dread. If you like that kind of a book, then it would be good for you. If there is enough tension, heartache, and doom in your life, don't pick up this book. The author doesn't give us any relief.I am a reader of classics and have foresworn against Harlequin novels since I was in high school. This author does an excellent job of describing Manderly (the mansion and its property) and of leading the reader to spin in the mind of the nameless narrator (2nd wife of Mr. Maxim DeWinter). Otherwise there is no plot, and nearly no movement. Just plenty of character description without any character development. Even the first person narrator didn't really undergo character development.I understand that many people will still choose to read this book based on the 5 star reviews.

I wish one more chapter had been written to clear up- how did Manderly catch fire, what did they do when they got to the burning house, and how did they pick up their lives. All we had at the ending was ashes. Also, the narrator, who never gives her name, was sometimes very odd- hiding behind doors in her own home, sneaking food, hiding behind chairs.

I won't re-hash the plot, (naive young woman marries widower, goes to live at his creepy estate where the memory of his former wife Rebecca is everywhere). Suffice to say this novel has great suspense, a superb sense of foreboding, and enough plot twists to keep you hooked. As other reviewers have stated, it was a particularly brilliant detail to keep our heroine unnamed, it allowed the lingering memory of Rebecca to pervade this novel just as she infiltrated each of it's characters.

It's interesting how timeless this story is. I have read this book countless times through the years and as I've matured, I've gained deeper insight into the various characters' feelings and motives making it new all over again.

There were many words, which I haven't known before. But the wordlist we received, was a good help. And as I'd read about twenty pages, I found the book suddenly better than before. I began to read it at home to know what would happen next in the story. And so I had to think a lot about the story, because I found it really interesting. But the end of the story isn't very good. I was surprised that it ended like that. And I was also surprised as I was told us that the second Mrs de Winter had mixed feelings for her husband, and that she was only together with him because she wanted to have a better life, more money. I did not realise that before. I don't know. Perhaps I didn't understand that part of the story. Still, I found the book good and interesting!

The narrator gets caught up in the life of the former mistress of Manderly Rebecca. This novel is a stunning portral of the fine writting style of Daphne du Maurier. Readers get hooked and don't want to let go until the end"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Daphne Du Maurier has done a wonderful job in her story. Rebecca is one of her finest works. The characters are so real and the story is very intense and addicting. You never really know the outcome until the last words. A must read for all"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This ia a good old fashion love story and murder mistery all rolled in to one exicting page turner of a novel. It also teaches younger readers and reminds older ones to trust and believe in the one that you love, things are always not what they seem"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This was one of those books I will never forget. It was actually required summer reading for my freshman year of high school, it was the first I read for my high school career. I was the perfect age for that, age 14, hanging just between that childhood - womanhood age and about to progress from childhood to adulthood. Maybe that's why this grabbed me so hard.The narrator, whose name we will never learn and will only know as the second Mrs. De Winter, takes us on a mysterious, gothic tale of love and lies. A handsome stranger has come to Monte Carlo where he meets a loud, borish woman named Mrs. Van Hopper and her traveling companion, the narrator. The narrator is a shy, churchmouse of a girl just barely out of her teens who falls for this dashing man, Maxim De Winter. It's natural for her to have sort of a school girl crush on someone like him, for sure, and he takes her out and entertains her while in Monte Carlo. When Mrs. Van Hopper decides to move on, Maxim surprises everyone by asking the narrator to marry him. Maybe more surprising, she accepts and suddenly she goes from being a poor tagalong paid companion to being the wife of a wealthy English countryman.While it begins as a Cinderella story, the second Mrs. De Winter finds herself in a Cinderella dilemma: what to do now? While she is suddenly introduced to a new way of life, she is unsure and has natural apprehension how to act and how to present herself to others. Part of it is that she is very young, had been sheltered and put to the side, and doesn't know how to be rich while Maxim is much older, more experienced, and is very rich. She is nervous and insecure, which speaks to the reader very much of being afraid and trying to cope with change. Plus, she cannot escape his first wife, the beautiful, talented, charming Rebecca whose reputation preceeds everything. Now, we are in her home, Manderly, which has become a haunted house of sorts. The second Mrs. De Winter is growing more and more insecure everyday, feeling that she is always being compaired to Rebecca wherever she goes and is uneasy.The one who is compairing her the most with Rebecca is Mrs. Danvers, Manderly's housekeeper. She isn't just stiff, she is formidable. She barely conceals her distain for the new mistress of the house, as she absolutely adored Rebecca and will never let her memory die. Around the house, the second Mrs. De Winter finds things with the signature R (stationary, towels, etc.) that under Mrs. Danvers's orders were not removed. When the second Mrs. De Winter finds Rebecca's old room, it has not been shut down but has been kept as if she had just left and is awaiting her return. Even though she has been dead for over a year, drowned off the coast of Manderly.This book haunts us but so many things speak to us in it. The feelings of insecurity, being haunted by ghosts from the past (those alive and dead), finding out things are not what they seem to be. Rebecca, as it turns out, was certainly beautiful and beloved by all who knew her, but Maxim reveals that he hated her and their marriage was a front. Rebecca was actually rotten, evil, self serving, and unfaithful. Maxim is just as ashamed that he put up the front of a happy marriage when she was off cavorting and cheating on him in London. Secrets and lies keep it juicy enough to keep us interested. The formerly scary Mrs. Danvers keeping of her memory alive shows us not of her evil nature, but of her pathetic one. All these things make the second Mrs. De Winter grow up, and she becomes The Rock when she realizes that she no longer has to compete with a lie. And though she might have doubted it before, Maxim really does love her because he never loved Rebecca. Enjoy this for all the juicy secrets and lies."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Made you look with that title, eh?Well, think about it: \\"the second Mrs. DeWinter\\" is never even identified by name in this book. She sucks up all the abuse heaped on her by a servant, no less, because she wants to please everyone so much.du Maurier was trying to tell us something in this great book: our own initiative, curiosity and self-worth matter so much more than what sort of birth status we have, or what we marry. In fact, you could argue that by destroying Manderley at the end, du Maurier was making the strongest possible declaration against the so-called privileges of aristocracy. Such privilege breeds evil and madness. And Mrs. DeW2 only learns that toward the end - and, of course, each of us is Mrs. DeW2."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I read Rebecca for my 11th grade literature class. I really enjoyed this book because of its mystery and suspense. The plot is a romantic one, but it isn't your usual &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending. I found myself caught up in the world of Manderly and its affairs. The story centers around the second wife of Maxim de Winter, owner of the famous Manderly estate. The pretty, graceful, and cultured Rebecca, Maxim's first wife, was killed in a sailing accident. The new Mrs. de Winter has no idea of what she is getting into when she arrives at Manderly. She constantly feels criticized and compared to Rebecca, especially by Rebecca's loyal maid, Mrs. Danvers. She wonders if Maxim is still in love with Rebecca and imagines herself as only a companion to him, although she is deeply in love with him. Suspense and mystery grows throughout the story as the new wife discovers mysterious things about Rebecca, Mrs. Danvers, and many others. The reader is in for a surprise ending, but will enjoy the outcome of the story."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"\\"Rebecca\\" has been on my to read list for years-literally. There was always something to get to first but recently I was in need of something absorbing and after I had read the first few pages it was apparent the lulling/draw you in writing style of Daphne Du Maurier fit the bill.To be honest I have no clue how to review a classic novel that has been reviewer countless times before my people much more qualified than I. So I'll be brief and base this on personal tastes only. I did enjoy this book but I have to say that all the hype about the incredible suspense of the novel seems a little unwarranted. To tell the truth I feel like I read another book altogether then what everyone else described. Especially when the ending of the novel is factored in.I loved the writing style, the language the author used and the descriptions. But I just didn't get the plot and to be honest I feel a little stupid about it. Does anyone want to explain it to me?Three stars. But because I did like the over all writing maybe I'll try another of Du Maurier's books."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"It was great- My only criticizim was that it was very slow in the beginning.

Rebecca incorporates all aspects that are necessary in a classic, and I'm sure that it will survive the test of time and still be read 100 years from now. By writing with such beautiful imagery and captivating characters, Du Maurier creates a book that you can't put down -- and when you finish it, you want to start it all over again!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Absolutely brilliant....the author has combined a modern falir with the classic approach. It's not boring like most of the classics, but can be fairly considered a classic nevertheless. Excellent language descriptions, a haunting plot and great characterisation. One can easily relate to the new Mrs De Winter as she is portrayed so well. The only thing I didn't like was the ending...it could have been more resolved, and it was hard to figure out exactly what happened. I mean, it ends with Maxim and his wife gazing at some yellow-orange glare that rises where Manderley. What is one supposed to make of that? But other and that, a literary masterpiece."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I absolutely loved this book! It was a bit slow at first, but when it got going, I couldn't put down the book!

Because of Rebecca, the relationship of Maxim and the second Mrs.Maxim de Winter is unsteady and seems to have a gap. As the second Mrs.Maxim de Winter tries her best to win Maxim's love, she is provoked by the cold housekeeper and previous maid of Rebecca, Mrs.Danvers. Bit by bit, the truth unravels and the once shy Mrs.de Winter gains enough courage to run the household the way she wants. The surprising, but satisfying ending ties the whole book over, leaving very little unexplained. Rebecca is truly an enthralling story that was nearly impossible to put down, for suspense was always in the air. In this special edition, there is the original epilogue of Rebecca and an article that Dapne du Maurier wrote for Countryside Character explaining how the idea of Rebecca was triggered."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is in many ways a lot like Jane Eyre. Jane and Mrs. De Winter (her first name is never mentioned) both meet and fall in love with older men when they are very young and still fresh out of school. For Jane it is Mr. Rochester and for Mrs. De Winter it is Maxim De Winter. The two couples have short courtships and very suddenly they decide to get married. Unfortunately Jane and Mrs. De Winter each find that the men they love have darker and more sinister pasts than they had ever imagined. Jane responds to this by running away, but Mrs. De Winter embraces the new found secret because it makes her feel older and closer to Maxim. By the end of the books Jane and Mrs. De Winter are both portrayed as stronger and much more mature adult women.But even if you didn't like Jane Eyre I think you will still like Rebbecca because Daphne DuMaurier combined several elements that weren't in Jane Eyre to make a fantastic book. She had a wonderful setting, a suspencful plot, interesting and developed characters, romance, and a very unexpected ending. Maxim's estate called Manderley is where most of the story unfolds. When the new Mrs. De Winter comes back from her honey moon Manderley is still ruled by Rebecca with her servants, her friends, and her furnishings. The new Mrs. De Winter must live in the middle of all of this and try to rise up to Rebecca's standards. In this book there is no way of predicting the future because it takes so many twists and turns. You never know something important is happening until it is over. My favorite part of the book was its perfect blend of characters. There was the dark and loyal (to Rebecca) Mrs. Danvers, the diabolical Favell, contrasted with well meaning and kind Beatrice, the ever supporting and tactful Frank, and simple Ben. The reader can easily connect with Mrs. De Winter as Daphne DuMaurier takes them inside her head reading her fears, day dreams, and doubts. When all of those ingredients come together you are left with a gourmet read."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I read this book for the first time this year, some 50 years since its been written, and it hasn't lost its magic!

I must say, I really didn't like the way it ended, but over all, excellent book."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I always think of JANE EYRE and REBECCA together as they are so very similar in plot. Both have young, artistic, not conventionally pretty heroines who are totally alone in the world and fall madly in love with older mysterious wealthy men. Against all odds these men fall in love with our innocent heroines. And of course both novels feature beautiful dark women from the men's past who threaten to ruin our heroine's happiness. The hero's are both flawed because they have been abused by these horrid first wives. REBECCA is told in first person by our never named narrator (the heroine is NOT Rebecca) and has a mysterious quality throughout. It is more modern and less \\"preachy\\" than JANE EYRE. Many romantic suspense novels have tried to copy the gothic romance formula but none do it as well as Du Maurier in REBECCA or Charlotte Bronte in JANE EYRE. All book lovers who have not yet discovered the wonderful novel REBECCA should do themselves a favor and start reading it today!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Du Maurier captures the essence of Victorian hierarchal society in the must-read. Through her controlled use of dynamic prose, this classic romantic suspense practically turns the pages on its own.

This novel proves that some secrets, no matter how hard one may try, refuse to stay buried."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This was my first summer reading book in high school, which I chose merely because it was the only alternative to plowing through 'The Good Earth'. Picking up from the library a rigid, hard-bound novel with a very official lack of cover art, titled merely \\"Rebecca\\", inspired much skepticism within me that this would turn out to be yet another lovey-dubby romance. Much to my surprise, I was hooked after the first tinglingly-detailed page, and spent almost an entire month reading and re-reading a book that could easily be read in a few days, chapter by chapter.'Rebecca' is an amazing work of art. The story of a confused, selfless young woman, seeking to satisfy the incredible expectations of the world, it is inerwoven with both poignant and chilling symbolism, and a plotline bent with enough hairpin twists to leave any reader gasping and clinging to the book like a caffeine addict. As the novel progresses, the reader is drawn into the precariously-balanced life of the nameless narrator, seeing much of humanity reflected throughout the novel's pages, in the way beloved goddesses turn out to be mere succubi, nightmares turn out to be reality, and most importantly, and with a certain amount of paradox, seemingly empty love turns out to be much, much richer and deeper than previously imagined. 'Rebecca' is a gripping, wonderfully-written novel about the human heart itself that will leave any reader in an emotional mixture of satisfaction and unease.If it ever appears on your summer reading list, seize the opportunity."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book has been around forever and is still popular. The suspense builds and the reader is drawn into the description of the characters and the elegant house. Some earlier reviewers revealed the answer to the mystery so you may only want to read the first few reviews on this page."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"The tone of this novel is so dark and bleak and mysterious that opening the book to a new page feels like crawling into a bed draped in red velvet and black satin while a thunderstorm rages outside your window over the sea. Yeah, its that depressing. There is not mistaking the tone of \\"Rebecca\\", that wasn't the issue. I had issues with the total lack of a cohesive theme.The beginning was slow but I warmed to it quickly. The young, unnamed protagonist, an orphan charge of a wealthy and insufferable woman named Mrs. Van Hopper, falls unexpectedly in love with Max de Winter while attending her mistress in Monte Carlo. She agrees to marry him and is whisked off on a short honeymoon before going back to Max's estate in the West Country, Manderley. Mrs. de Winter tries hard to draw Max into a loving and fulfilling relationship, but she soon learns that Max's first wife Rebecca still haunts the halls with her larger-than-life presence after he accidental drowning a year before. Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper, seems to hate Mrs. de Winter, and she wonders why her presence as the new wife seems to unwelcome at Manderley. Nothing is what it seems to be, and Mrs. de Winter discovers the secret behind Rebecca and Max's relationship, which could ruin their future as man and wife.There is really no comment on the protagonist because she has absolutely no voice and no real role in the novel. She reminds me of Nick in \\"The Great Gatsby\\"- a narrator who is more of an observer than a central character. She is very meek and deferential and we really don't know much about her. I know it is central to the novel that she is pushed aside and not given anything to do, but I was waiting for her to gain a voice and stand up for herself, and it never really happened. I'm glad there was some hope for her and Max at the end, because for most of the novel, the tone just made everything feel doomed from the start.I had trouble grasping what this novel was really about. Was it a tragic romance, with the young couples' love hindered by the foreboding dead first wife, or was it a crime mystery? It only reminded me of \\"Jane Eyre\\" in tone, not in plot.I gave this novel four stars because of the parts of the novel when Mrs. de Winter believes she will never be able to take the place of Rebecca. There was so much sadness and despair, and the writing was so beautiful, and I really felt for the narrator. But then everything changed and I had no real reason to feel bad, and that sort of ruined my reading experience.This is a weird book. The imagery of Manderley is so gorgeous and vivid; I felt like I was really there for some parts. But the plot was too twisty and there was no unified conflict from start to finish. I don't think I'd read it again, but I'm glad I gave it a shot. It was well-written, but the plot twist didn't impress me."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I have been procrastinating in reading this novel. I'm glad I finally read it. I understand now why this novel is highly recommended and popular to other readers. Daphe du Maurier was gifted in writing and in mixing more than one genre in this story. It has a mix of romance, suspense, thriller, and mystery. The ending was unexpected and quite a surprise to me. I will never forget this story."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is a very well-written novel with a murder mystery twist.There isn't one character who is moral or innocent, yet everyonehas their own charm and justification for their actions. du Mauriercreated a complex story that holds together quite well and the endingleaves no doubt as to the role that suffering, jealousy and revengeplay in the lives of some interesting characters. A novel one canread and, then, re-read to catch some of the subtleties."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"A wonderful book, simply not to be missed. The language is rich, poetic, sensitive. All the nuance of snobbery, social mores, hierarchy of the time and English culture is beautifully portrayed.Du Maurier's love of Cornwall is strikingly set against Monte Carlo. The house, Manderley, comes alive - we live in the rooms.There is depth to the portrayal of Mrs Danvers - we feel her loss - yet we are never on her side. But the genius of Du Maurier is that we are swept along to accept the facts of Maxim's actions. We collude.The Hitchcock film avoids this, but Du Maurier was not squeamish, and in joining with her heroine we become criminal.Deeply thought provoking. A novel in the true sense."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"It's been called a mystery, a romance, a Gothic novel, been labeled the best novel of the century, criticized as intensely boring and slow, praised as a real page turner. To some degree it all seems correct, all of those elements being presented by Dame du Maurier in her famous novel.But I say that the only thing that kept me going through the first half of Rebecca was that famous opening line: Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again. Simply wondering why she was no longer at Manderley, what drove and kept her away, was enough motivation to get through some very, very slow and tedious narrative.I'm all for good descriptions of settings and character development, and in this book the estate Manderley is both of those, the setting and a crucial character. But in literature there's a spectrum of development, from inadequate to just the right amount and on to excessive - development overkill, if you will. Rebecca suffered, I think, some level of development overkill, and the details, excessive as they were, almost killed the story for me. I thought I was in trouble by page 10 when I could barely concentrate enough through the very detailed descriptions of the Manderley countryside and such things. Descriptions of the plants and the grounds and the woods and the animals, etc., etc. And those same descriptions had a very frequent (and unneeded) reoccurence. In short, many portions seemed overwritten and too detailed to the point of distracting from the story.But I read on. By page 50 I was wondering when something would happen, a break in the story to motivate the reader with some intrigue. Nothing. Page 100, still nothing to grip me. Fifty more pages, nada. On to page 200, and by now I've been slowly, very slowly, plodding my way through this story for a month. There was still nothing to compel me to turn pages; thus the book sat unread for many days at a time. There was a conversation around page 130 that I thought might lead to some excitement, but then nothing. Though one success by this point in the story, it's been made painfully clear to the reader that the unnamed Mrs. de Winter the Second is diffident, shy and weak, and that she lives in the shadow of and is haunted by the memory of the dead Rebecca. In fact, I think the diffidence of the young Mrs. de Winter is one area where Dame Du Maurier succeeded in her excessive character development; the young wife easily brings disrespect on herself by the reader because of her lack of self-worth and confidence.Finally, at about page 220, finally the story broke open. Finally I had reached a point that compelled me to keep reading. Finally, a story that moved quickly and was really a very, very good and well written climax. It became a five-star story from that point on, having elevated itself from a tedious, boring two stars.I also really liked the epilogue, the addition made by Dame Du Maurier later. Thought it brought the story around to a good conclusion for the reader. So in the end, while I think the overall writing was too detailed and to some degree overwritten, I did find entertainment in the story's culmination."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Daphne du Maurier walks the tightrope between popular fiction and literature, between the 19th and 20th centuries, and comes out on top in \\"Rebecca.\\"\\\\Shy, intelligent, sensitive orphan girl working unhappily as a servant meets and marries a fabulously wealthy older man and moves to his windswept English country estate where something sinister lurks . . . sounds like something you've read before, doesn't it? The joy of \\"Rebecca\\" lies not in the tale (though it has its surprises) but in the telling. The best way I can describe it is as a symphony of words, starting dissonant, then softening, then gradually building to a driving crescendo and an explosive ending.Readers who demand incessant page-turning action will find Rebecca to be slow going, especially in the beginning--really, that many paragraphs about a driveway? More patient readers will luxuriate in DuMaurier's painterly descriptions that reflect her love of English country life and carefully reveal plot and character.

Rebecca is the first wife of Maxim De Winter , and is dead.Her story is revealed through the second wife of Maxim, who does not reveal her own name in the book .No doubt , Rebecca is the real heroine.She is a powerful character.Even though dead , she lives through her house-keeper Mrs Danvers, who adores Rebecca and is fiercely loyal to her, even after Rebecca's death .So much so that when she learns about the real cause of death , she sets the beautiful mansion called Manderley on fire and completely destroys it .Rebecca was a complex personality. She was beautiful and magnetic.She had beauty , brains and breeding .But the marriage of Maxim and Rebecca was a failure , right from the start .She had a number of male friends and \\"lovers\\" in London and even around Manderley.She was not in love with anyone .Love-making was a game with her, as Mrs Danvers would later reveal .But she suffered from Cancer too , and this secret she had kept even from her most loyal house-keeper also .Probably , before her death , she had only three or four more months to live .Maxim's marriage with the narrator of the novel , who is young and nearly half his age, takes place , on the proposal of Maxim , one year after the death of Rebecca.Though he says he loves her , it is doubtful, as reflected by his conduct .Perhaps he needed a companion.She , on the other hand , loves him , and is ready to blindly support him , even when she finds him involved in murder.She is timid , under-confident and over awed by the shadow of Rebecca , in the beginning , but slowly and steadily , overcomes all her fears and becomes confident .The mystery whether the death of Rebecca would be proved murder or suicide , remains till the very end .The book is very subversive about the idea of love .Neither Rebecca , nor Maxim seem to care for love .The burden of love is carried by the nameless, poor , timid , narrator , the second wife of Maxim de Winter.The book has poetry and imagery , mystery and suspense , and much more qualities that makes it truly classic .

It is something to relax with but not in any sense enlifting. The drawback is that one can watch the film and get many of the points in the book, slightly changed to suit censors. The packaging led to losing 1 star. The pages are close to the binding and the text is close to the edge. I suppose this is the drawback of a cheap edition. On th whole, OK and no large complaints."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is such a haunting story. I read it several months ago and still can't stop thinking about it.

He seems tortured by something, and the rumors are that he's never been able to get over the death of his first wife...* Rebecca, a gorgeous, spirited free-spirit who seemed to charm everyone around her. However, her life was cut short after she drowned tragically in the sea that borders ...* Manderley, the huge country estate owned by Max DeWinter. This is where the second Mrs. DeWinter and Max live after their quickie wedding and honeymoon. But poor Mrs. DeWinter! She is so young and has no experience running a big household like Manderley. Good thing she has the help of...* Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper who seems abnormally devoted to the first Mrs. DeWinter.WHEN and WHERE does the book take place?The story takes place primarily at Manderley. I believe the time frame is the late 1930s when DuMaurier wrote the book.WHY should you read this book?Well, I suspect you already have! I'm the latecomer to this party. When I posted my list of RIP books, almost everyone commented about how much they loved Rebecca. I loved it too! It is one of the few \\"classics\\" that really lived up to the hype. DuMaurier does a fantastic job of slowly building up the dread and suspense. You get inside the second Mrs. DeWinter's mind and you just squirm and feel this sense of impending doom. Everywhere she goes, it is Rebecca, Rebecca, Rebecca. And she is so innocent and trusting that she bumbles along getting herself deeper and deeper enmeshed in the secrets of Manderley. I read somewhere when I was Googling around for the images used above, that Rebecca is really more of a psychological haunting than a physical haunting, and I thought that was a fantastic description. If, like me, you bypassed this book for all these years, be sure to rectify this. You'll be glad you did! (And I'm so going to check out the Hitchcock movie version!)"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Daphne du Maurier's slow, steady psychological thriller was pure enjoyment. I had a few moments where I remembered black and white scenes from Alfred Hitchcock's cinematic creation of \\"Rebecca\\". I must have watched it as a child. I was glad that I couldn't actually remember the ending.The young bride narrates and the reader journeys through her somewhat obsessive thought process as she meets the inhabitants of Manderley--her new home.The writing is superb and the main (unnamed) character especially is completely and some times frustratingly realistic. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"\\"Rebecca\\" had several elements that I loved: a large Gothic-style manor, ghosts, mystery and suspense. In the book, the narrator (in which interestly her first name is never revealed) is a young English lady of twenty-one, who is working as a \\"companion\\" to a middle-aged American gossip-loving socialite. The young lady and her employer are staying at a hotel in Monte Carlo, where the young lady is introduced to Maxim de Winter, the owner of a large English manor house called Manderley who has lost his wife in a tragic drowning one year prior. Mr. de Winter is a strange, serious man which everyone attributes to the loss of his wife, Rebecca.The narrator and Mr. de Winter have an odd relationship over the course of the couple of weeks in Monte Carlo and when the narrator is told she is to go to New York, Mr. de Winter proposes marriage. The narrator, longing for something more in life, agrees to marry him. She is deeply in love with him, although he often remains distant and mysterious. She expects that life at Manderley will be quite different from what she actually finds once she arrives there.Although the first Mrs. de Winter is no longer living, there are traces of her all throughout the mansion. The new Mrs. de Winter is told how wonderful Rebecca was and is very insecure in herself in that she feels she can't live up to Rebecca's reputation. Rebecca's maid, the eerie Mrs. Danvers, immediately dislikes the new Mrs. de Winter. As days go by at Manderley, the new Mrs. de Winter begins to have serious doubts that her marriage will be successful and that the house she is living in is still under Rebecca's influence. Maxim becomes more and more distant and odd, and the narrator becomes more uneasy and afraid, as is understandable as the mystery of what happened to Rebecca is unraveled.I really enjoyed the author's writing style - vivid descriptions with each scene set up nicely. The author did a remarkable job of creating a suspenseful atmosphere. Although I saw some of the mysteries of Rebecca's fate coming well ahead of time, there were still some new surprises waiting for this reader. I would liken reading the book to walking through a large, historic manor house like Manderley, with each turn and hallway revealing another twist in the story and finding surprises all along the way. I've seen other reviews that have said they found the book slow and dull, but I didn't want to put it down until every mystery was solved.My only letdown of the novel was that even while Rebecca was not a nice person, I found it very weak for the main character to stand by Maxim de Winter so faithfully after what he had done.After the story ended, I found it helpful to reread the first couple of chapters to be happily fulfilled with the ending."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I had known about this book for as long as I can remember, but just recently read it for the first time. What a great read! I thought that because it was written in 1938 it might be good but would be hard to read, etc. Not true. It moves really quickly and the story really grips you from the very beginning. It only took me about 5 days to read. It would have taken less time than that, but as I reached the end I wanted to make it last so I slowed down the pace. There are a few twists that I definitely did not see coming. I loved this book and plan to read some of Du Maurier's others as well. The 1940 Hitchcock film is a nice complement to the book, but just bear in mind that they do make some changes and it's not exactly true to the book, but still entertaining in its own right. I highly recommend the book and the movie!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"It's been a very long time since I first read this book. We reviewed it at book club and everyone much enjoyed reading it again. The book arrived early enough for me to read it and make the necessary notes."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I love this book. It's a classic for a reason. So well written, great plot. Hitchcock made a movie out of this and DuMaurier's short story, The Birds."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Do not be discouraged by the seemingly slow pace of this book; real life is often uneventful for a while. I did not particularly enjoy the first two chapters of Rebecca and almost made the mistake of not reading the rest so please don't put it down! However, I probably didn't care for it at first because I was expecting a much different writing style than Daphne Du Maurier actually writes in. I will provide a suggestion: start the book by wanting to meeting the characters and absorbing the setting. (Also, expect some people to drop in and out like in real life, as all people don't have to be important or necessary to the plot to be included.) This is such a great mystery. The only thing I didn't like about this was the beginning which I feel should have been placed at the end instead."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I had heard a lot about Rebecca but never thought it was one for me. While I do occasionally read classic literature, I tend to prefer more modern quick-paced novels. In Rebecca, I was expecting a sort of gothic romance...and that is more or less what it is. I have to say though that I enjoyed this book far more than I thought I would. The story itself took a little longer to tell than what modern audiences demand. It was a bit like watching an old black and white movie and several times (mostly at the beginning) I grew a little impatient with the pace of the plot. But stick with it for a very rewarding reading experience.The story is told from the first person POV but since the protagonist is such a timid soul, she takes quite a while to work herself up to getting something done. Lots of musing about what people might think if such and such were to happen. But then again, since the story was published in the 1930s, perceptions and family status were paramount.I have never read a book with so much \\"atmosphere.\\" The setting is brilliantly written and is extremely important to the plot, in essence another major character. The characters themselves kept my attention despite the slow spots and the mystery elements were very intriguing. I am glad I experienced this compelling novel. Overall, it was a pleasant surprise."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca de Winter is dead when this story begins, and yet is its strongest character. She haunts the second Mrs. de Winter (whose first name we never learn) even before her arrival at Manderley. Convinced that Mr. de Winter is still in love with Rebecca, she allows herself to be completely undone by the prospect of stepping into Rebecca's shoes. She is scared witless by Mrs. Danvers, the overbearing and creepy housekeeper, who remains devoted to Rebecca and determined to keep everything at Manderly just the way it was before Rebecca died.To be fair, Mr. de Winter seems to give absolutely no consideration of the fact that she might feel out of her league and doesn't seem to even notice her distress. However, even when the de Winters finally start communicating and things look like they might work out, she continues to act like a nitwit. It's very hard to sympathize which such a protagonist, but that aside, this is an excellent work of suspense."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"One of my most favorite books ever. You must remember when it was written and the period it is set in when reading. From other reviews I see some have become bored and impatient with the book which is a shame. If you take the time to understand the characters, including Manderley, you may find more to consider than it seems."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Du Maurier's classic takes the reader back to an earlier time when class and gentility were prevalent in the countryside not far from London. Mental images of the characters and the opulent house and grounds at Manderly will fill your mind. The female reader will easily identify with the young bride as Maximillian brings her home from their honeymoon in Europe. You find yourself wishing you could have such a life, except of course for the evil Mrs. Danvers, housekeeper at Manderly and personal maid to the first Mrs. de Winter. The suspense builds and holds you spellbound till the last page as the tale slowly unfolds. I had read this book as a teen and remembered loving it, but was still surprised by the ending! (Memory for details of this kind fade over 40+ years!)"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This was the first book I've ever read by Daphne Du Maurier and I really enjoyed it. I have since read My Cousin Rachel and enjoyed that one just as much. The element of suspense in her novels is so captivating you won't want to put it down. This novel contains all the elements of surprise needed to keep you on the edge of your seat until the very last page. You won't believe the outcome! Enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"An amazing read! The story of a young girl who falls in love and marries a mysterious man who owns the mansion Manderly. I fell in love with Maxim de Winter immediately and loved the little quirks of the heroine (who goes un-named throughout). The descriptions are amazing - you can picture everything du Maurier describes; you can see Manderly. The heroine arrives at Manderly expecting happiness, acceptance, and love, but instead she finds a dark secret that almost tears her world in two. The book's climax keeps you at the edge of your seat. Read it!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca by Daphne DuMaurier was one of the best books I ever read. The authors's language beatifully protrays the life of a young woman who marries a widower trying to start over. Unfortunately, the young lady must fight the memory of Rebecca, her husband's late wife, to win him back. But there are many secrets at the Manderley estate, and some, which do not want to be discovered."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is an intense, mystery that will keep you guessing what's next? There are many twists and turns in this book that are very unexpected. When I started reading this book I couldn't put it down! All I wanted to know was what's next? I find it very enjoyable and if your into mysteries I'm sure you would too. It's not only a mystery but it's also a love story, about tragic events that happen during these couples first years of marriage. I advise everyone who reads it to pick up this book and read it because I know it won't be dissapointing at all."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is about a young girl who falls in love with a millionaire who owns the house she's love since childhood. She finds out deep dark secrets about her husband's first wife that could ruin his husband forever....but will she tell...or will anyone find out? That's for you to find out in this book. I gurantee you'll like it."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I first read &quot;Rebecca&quot; when I was 13, and read it several more times in high school. It's been about ten years since I last read it--and it managed to hook me once again. Rushing home from dinners and drinks with friends to pick it up again. Staying up late reading, even though I know the ending. Rushing to get ready for work so I can finish just a few more pages. While I can't say this a literary masterpiece, I can definitely say this is one of the greatest _stories_ ever--well-told and suspenseful."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is probably the best book I've ever read. I love to go back to it and read parts of it again. The settings are wonderful, the main character was so easy to identify with, and you cannot put it down. When you're done, you wish there were more of it. I take this book with me when I go away, just because I know I'll never get bored if I have it, and because it's kind of about travelling in a way. This book will appeal to everyone, I think, and I would really recommend it."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I first read &quot;Rebecca&quot; for a school assignment over the summer, but I have read it over several times since then. I could not help but fall in love with Maxim DeWinter, and as the novel progressed I became engrossed in the lives of everyone at Manderly. The book is intriguing and suspenseful to the very last page, and the secrets of Rebecca are shocking! Daphne DuMaurier writes with an ease that makes &quot;Rebecca&quot; pleasant to read. Although not on quite the same level as &quot;Rebecca,&quot; the sequel &quot;Mrs. DeWinter&quot; provides a wonderful sense of closing to the story of Max and his young bride. Anyone who enjoyed this novel would also like the romantic drama, &quot;The Thornbirds&quot; by Colleen McCullough."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This was a truly wonderful book. I loved the movie (Joan Fontaine) so much that I bought the book and the book absolutely amazed me. I could identify with the main character so much and even now that I have read it so many times I still flip back to passages anywhere in it just to read them. I even take this book with me when I travel because it comforts me. How many times does a book do that??!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is an excellent book that mystery readers of all ages will enjoy, I'm sure. It does start out a little slow but all the information the first few chapters give you is important, don't put it down even if you get discouraged. And for those people who only read the beginning, I would like to remind you &quot;Don't Judge A Book By It's Cover&quot; and the same goes for the first few pages."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I enjoyed the mysterious setting of the book. I often felt sorry for the main characters of the book, but I think that they would not have been as affective if they had acted different. I almost wanted the book to end different, but the ending was very fitting to the rest of the story. I also liked the fact that there were subtle hints through out the book about what would happen in the ending and afterwards. This is a book that is best read in an English class because there is some symbolism that I would have missed if I had not done this in class. This is not a book that I would normally just pull of the shelf because I am not normally into this type of literature, but I did enjoy what I read. I think that most anyone would enjoy this book even if it is not their first choice. The part of the book that I liked the least was when Mrs. Danvers was showing the speaker around Rebecca's room because it seamed that Rebecca would come in the room, and because of Rebecca's seemingly perfection. I think that no one is perfect and do not make acceptions for Rebecca. I also disliked the way that the speaker always seemed to make social blunders. I do think that this book was well written."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I enjoyed the mysterious setting of the book.

After analyzing it and Daphne du maurier for an english project, i found it to be an excellent book. THe only thing i wasn't thrilled with was the end, which was very unrealistic. It is written in a very good way which adds to the suspense that builds as the story goes on. however, if you are a person who does not enjoy endings that are inapropriete and end up &quot;happily ever after&quot; i would not reccommend it. For me the suspense overided the ending."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is my favorite book ever, and trust me I've read A LOT! Daphne du Maurier was a genius, all her books are good, but this one gets the gold star. She writes it so vividly, you can see every occurance. Not to mention how psychotic she wrote Mrs. Danvers. An excellent, excellent book."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book was the best book i've ever read! it was so exciting, and i couldn't put it down! there was surprise after surprise and it kept me reading all the way through!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is one of the most amazing books I have ever read. You always hear about books that make you feel &quot;like you're really there.&quot; Well, if that describes one book, this is it.

Obtain this book and become lost in Manderley!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rachel is defintely a book I will read again. I finished it in one day.

I thoroughly enjoyed it!!!!!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I'd always liked reading romance, you know the kind of old-fashioned one. This was one of my favourites. It's about this young girl, who is bossed (not exactly) by a nosey old lady. When this lady finds out that the guy sitting in the next table is Maxim, the fellow who appeared in the newspapers, she goes along &amp; tries to establish contact. The girl(some how Du Maurier manages to finish the story withiut revealing her name), is embarassed &amp; after a lot of confusion, finds that she actualy likes Maxim &amp; he says that he likes her too &amp; wants her to come with him. She does so &amp; after going to his home, Manderley(That's how it begins..'Last night I dreamt I was in Manderley again')she thinks that she is not as good a replacement for Rebeca (who was the 1st wife of Maxim) In the end she finds BIG surprise waiting for her! But I won't tell u that, for it'll spoil your reading."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Je Revien! Could describe my love affair with this book.

I get involved in the characters and the storyline, and it's so well-written, the ending is always a surprise."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Only someone hung-up on TV movies would not appreciate this excellent book.Despite other reviews, I found this interesting from page 1. Give the author a few pages to set mood, and then you're off to meeting some fascinating characters and all along you're wondering: why ...why...why?Very exciting, and very thought-provoking. Now that I've read the book, I'll see Hitchcock's movie......."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Anyone who is disappointed by &quot;Rebecca&quot; does not appreciate gothic literature. This book is suspenceful and fascinating. Each character has been burned into my mind ever since I first read the book in 6th grade. Hitchcock made this book into a movie so IMAGINE what the story must be like!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I read Rebecca about a year ago in 8th grade, and I loved it so much. I started it around 7:00 at night and stayed up until 4:30 in the morning reading it, even though I had school the next day. I simply could not put it down. The ending was so suprising, very Gone With the Wind-ish. The only problem is that it starts a little slow, so you have to stick it out, but it is so good, you forget that in the end. But, just as a warning, the sequel is not NEAR as good!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"this was such a good book! i just couldn't stop reading it! this book ate up all my free time! but i must admit it was well worth it. a great story. this book is what romances should be like, we don't need all those annoying sex scenes"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Daphne du Maurier's love story is a story about love, yes, but it is also a testament to her love for Cornwall. The moors , beaches and woods in this beautiful part of the world are described and portrayed as only by one who has lived and loved in this part of the world can. The story is about a house as well as people. The mysterious house of Manderley with all its secrets is the setting of this novel. Ms. du Maurier actually based her Manderley on an actual house found in Cornwall called Menabilly. The story is about a well-bred, but penniless young woman who makes a brilliant marriage to Max de Winter. All seems to be wonderful for her, but then it becomes sad and quite menacing to Rebecca because her Max seems to be ruled by another woman, and that woman is not alive, so it's very difficult for her to compete. The novel is a haunting and lovely story about the sadness that this young woman encounters during her married life and what she did about it. A true Gothic treasure."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"On the shores of Monte Carlo, Du Maurier's nameless heroine falls in love with and marries the fabulously wealthy Maxim de Winter within the space of a few days. Maxim, a widower, takes his new bride back to his home, Manderly.Once at Manderly, the new Mrs. De Winter falls into a sinister web of mystery that begins and ends with Maxim's dead wife, the lovely Rebecca. Though dead for over a year, Rebecca still mantains a strong prescence over the entire household and over Maxim himself. The heroine finds herself doubting if her husband even loves her but only married her for companionship for none can replace his beloved, Rebecca.Rebecca's rooms are as they were the last night of her life. Her servant, Mrs. Danvers, is still loyal and runs the house exactly as Rebecca wished."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"The book, Rebecca, was a very interesting book. I liked how it portrayed romance and mystery and kept me guessing throughout the book. Mrs. De Winter had to get through the trials of living up to the late Mrs. De Winter. Her husband, Mr. De Winter, only wants a companion not a lover. In the end, Mrs. De Winter does not feel intimidated by the late Mrs. De Winter after finding out how mean she really was during her life. I would recommend this book to readers of all ages who like mysteries with a little romantic involvement."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"From the moment I started reading Rebecca I was hooked. The storyline was amazing, the characters were outstanding, and Du Maurier used a great amount of detail to describe the mysterious Manderly. I must have enjoyed this book more than any other I have ever read. I was literally upset the rest of the day after I finished it. I had to read this book for school and it definitly wasn't a waste of time this summer! I recommend this book 100% and I think most people out there will enjoy it. This book combines Romance, Thriller, and Mystery all in one! It was truly amazing and I'm on my way to read other books by Daphne Du Maurier."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"What a wonderful, wonderful book. The first (and definitely not the last) time I ever read Rebecca was when I was a teenager; it still remains as one of my favorites. Its opening sentence must be one of the most famous in English literature: &quot;Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.&quot; Such a simple sentence, but there is so much meaning in it. Mrs. Danvers is one of my favorite villains of all time, and Rebecca one of the most sinister ghosts in my reading memory; most sinister, because she can't be seen, only felt in the way she is reverently remembered.Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again... and so I keep visitng Manderley and all its wonderful characters over and over again. Its thrilling conclusion is the best possible one for a story such as this, reminiscent of Jane Eyre ad the like."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I've been familiar with the story of &quot;Rebecca&quot; for what seems to be most of my life; I've watched the screen version numerous times, but only recently got around to reading the novel. Even though I knew what was going to happen, Daphne Du Maurier still managed to keep me on my toes. Only the greatest of suspense writers can do that.&quot;Rebecca&quot; tells the tale of a young woman, without family connections, who finds herself falling in love with and agreeing to marry the widowed Maximillian DeWinter. She becomes the &quot;second&quot; Mrs. DeWinter and must adjust to life at Manderley, the estate that Maxim owns (and, where he also lived with his first wife). A shy and naive girl of nineteen, Mrs. DeWinter is unable to cope with the splendor and magnitude of life at Manderley. She constantly feels that everyone is watching her and judging her; but most importantly of all, comparing her to Rebecca, the first Mrs. DeWinter. She is also convinced that just as much as she loves her husband, he is still that much in love with his first wife. This mindset is enhanced and complicated by the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (possibly one of the very best literary villians ever) who keeps Rebecca's rooms intact, as if she were about to walk through the door at any moment. She terrorizes our narrator with her tales of Rebecca and how much Maxim loved her and Mrs. DeWinter believes all of Mrs. Danvers stories.The past finally has to be confronted when Rebecca's body turns up in her sailboat, buried at the bottom of the sea. The ghost that has hung over their precarious marriage finally &quot;comes to life&quot; to haunt them. Du Maurier brings her novel to a thrilling conclusion, (even though the story technically begins after the novel's story has come to an end). The characters are vividly written and one feels the reach of Rebecca's deviousness just as much as Mrs. DeWinter does. And when it's all over, you want to read it again."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is the riveting and romantic tale of a country girl, trying to fill the shoes of a deceased goddess. The story takes place at Manderley, a beautiful mansion over looking an English bay. Rebecca, an elegant mistress, has recently died and her widow, Maxim, decides to remarry. He marries the narrator of our story who is a shy, simple girl now placed in the spotlight by the well-loved deWinter reputation. She must battle the previous standards set by Rebecca and her known way of life. At times she is frustrated to the point of tears, not thinking she fits in. She discovers shocking truths and an abrupt turn of events changes everything. du Maurier does a wonderful job of leaving surprises at every corner, and keeping suspense until the last page. Although the introduction and some of the descriptions tend to be tedious, don't let yourself put down the book. The characters are charming and the events breathless. Rebecca lives up to its reputation as an all-time classic, which should be savored until the very end."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"We chose this book for our senior project in Senior English. We really didn't really have many high expectations for this book though I have seen the movie. We thought it would be interesting to read, and in fact we were proven wrong with out accusations. In fact, we found that the book was indeed really good and could hardly put it down. We would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read romance and suspense. It does have a rather surprising ending, one that would not have guessed. This is a MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I don't read mysteries but I really had fun reading &quot;Rebecca&quot;. It was recommended to me by a friend &amp; like all the reviews, I agree that it started out slow &amp; boring, but don't lose hope. I almost did. I know this is a good novel because I was never able to tell what was going to happen next. It is such an inventive novel &amp; I love how descriptive it is. I gave it 5 stars because, other than the ending, was pretty much perfect. It being old makes it all the much better. Mysteries today seem like they were made on an assembly line. I do think everyone should read this one, though."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"After knowing Maxim de Winter for only a few weeks, the narrator marries him and is taken back to his estate Manderley on the coast of England. However, upon arrival things do not go as the new Mrs. de Winter planned because the memory of Rebecca, Maxim's first wife, continually haunts her. Rebecca's belongings remain untouched, the servant Mrs. Danvers continually comments on how beautiful and amazing Rebecca was, and the narrator begins to feel she will never live up to the seemingly flawless ways Rebecca ran Manderley. As the narrator begins to wonder if even Maxim loved Rebecca more than herself, she prepares for a ball and is unknowingly convinced by the sly Mrs. Danvers to wear the same ball gown Rebecca wore the year before. Just as the new Mrs. de Winter is about to give up hope, the story of the seemingly perfect Rebecca begins to unfold, and the secrets of Rebecca's death are revealed. Daphne du Maurier is a hauntingly beautiful writer with sinister and gothic undertones. She immediately draws readers into the stormy world of Manderley and leaves them with unexpected psychological twists, throwing traditional definitions of good and evil to the wind."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is a classic gothic mystery, centered on a naive young woman working as a companion, who is swept off her feet by a man suffering after the death of his first wife, the dark and dashing, Maxim de Winter. While all seems well as they honeymoon, upon returning to his home in Cornwall, Manderley, things begin to slowly unravel. The young woman, unnamed throughout the novel, feels very much out of place as lady of the manor and becomes consumed with finding out more about his first wife, Rebecca, who seems very much present in her surroundings, particularly to the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, who was also Rebecca's personal maid. After a devilish betrayal by Mrs. Danvers, the 2nd Mrs de Winter begins to find out more about Rebecca and the circumstances surrounding her death which completely change her world view and bring out her strengths. While reminiscent of Jane Eyre, the novel stands well on its own and is an intriguing tale of deception, suspense, and a touch of mystery.I would comment that the print quality of this edition was very uneven, and at times, difficult to read."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is my favorite book and movie of all time, so I had high hopes when I purchased the audio book. I'm so glad it was unabridged since I relished every word from narrator Anna Massey. Her interpretation and reading were flawless. I limited myself to one disc a day to stretch it out as long as I could. If you are a lover of the 20s-30s time period and English authors, you will love this story. Daphne duMaurier's descriptions and plot build-up are unmatched."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This was a lovely 'step back in time' read. I really enjoyed the way you were brought back in time.

But all is not well with their love story - our protagonist constantly feels as if she doesn't measure up to Maxim's first wife in the mind of her husband and his household staff. A gothic mystery reminiscent of Jane Eyre, Rebecca is a mystery that provides just enough hints to keep the reader interested but not so many as to be frustratingly obvious."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Pages: 410Release Date: This edition - 2008; first edition - 1938Date Read: 2011, October 14th - November 12thReceived: OwnRating: 5/5 starsRecommended to: 15+Summary -\\"Last Night I Dreamt I Went To Manderley Again.\\"So the second Mrs. Maxim de Winter remembered the chilling events that led her down the turning drive past their beaches, white and naked, to the isolated gray stone manse on the windswept Cornish coast. With a husband she barely knew, the young bride arrived at this immense estate, only to be inexorably drawn into the life of the first Mrs. de Winter, the beautiful Rebecca, dead but never forgotten...her suite of rooms never touched, her clothes ready to be worn, her servant -- the sinister Mrs. Danvers -- still loyal. And as an eerie presentiment of evil tightened around her heart, the second Mrs. de Winter began her search for the real fate of Rebecca...for the secrets of Manderley. (From Goodreads)My thoughts -Golly goodness I really really really love this book. It is one of the most unique, thought-out, and weirdly fascinating books I have ever read and probably will ever read. It was recommended to me by so many people and I found it for less than $2, almost brand new, at a 2nd hand store, and couldn't pass it up. I've found myself getting into the idea of Gothic novels and was quite interested...By the end of this reading experience (for it is an experience), I had been shocked so many times it was almost impossible not to give it five stars on the spot. But not only did it shock me - it made me love it, incredibly so. I love this book; and for that, five stars in inevitable.Character notes -The second Mrs. de Winter is quite extraordinary, for many reasons. One is her name in and of itself. I say this because she does not have one. As the story is told in first person, she does not introduce herself; her name is mentioned once as being hard to spell, that people usually get it wrong; and after she marries Max she is called by everyone she knows as \\"Mrs. de Winter\\". It was quite shocking for me to discover half-way through the book, that I had missed her first name, and I that I was such a terrible reader for missing such an important detail like that. I re-read parts of the beginning, asked around and discovered the truth: she has no first name because it is not important. What is important is that she is the second Mrs. de Winter.Besides that, she amazed me by totally getting on my nerves sometimes and still being a fantastic character who I could relate to and love. How did she annoy me? Her lack of ability to speak out sometimes drove me up the wall with thoughts of, \\"Goodness! Why won't she just say something?! After being so ill-treated!\\" But it was her character; she became like a friend; I could love her in spite of that fault (and whatever others to her name...or lack thereof). And in the end - well, she's quite the lioness at the end. I love books with changed heroes/heroines. :DBesides Mrs. de Winter, the other characters are so perfectly drawn for the reader that it is hard to forget them. Frank (one of my top three favorites - he was soooo awesome), Maxim's sister, Max himself, Mrs. Danvers, and Favell especially, but there are others, and they, too, are profound.And Rebecca, even being a mere ghost of a character, is still shockingly real. Everything about her made my skin crawl - and I didn't even know why. You won't know why either. There is no exact reason why I felt that way, and you will wonder... Oh, you will wonder.Story notes -This is such a unique story - and so weird. Everything happened in a way that made me weirded out with no real explanation whatsoever as to why. (See above comment on the character Rebecca.) And then - BOOM! There's an explosion, and you'll be holding on for dear life, because there's no possible way this could really be happening.At least, that's how I felt. I was on an airplane when I read the climax - the EXPLOSION - and holy crud don't ever do that. Confined to a chair with quiet people all around me and flight attendants scanning the rows with narrowed eyes, searching for disturbance of any kind - yeah, don't ever try it. Best to wait until you've landed, read it when you get home, and whoop and holler and scream and stare in shocked silence as much as you want. All I could do was hyperventilate in a very quiet manner. Haha - just kidding! Sort of.Summing it up -Shocking, to say the least. I did not expect it to be the way it was, with the writing style or the set-up or the conflict or the climax or the resolution. All of it was unexpected and perfect. Please, do yourself a favor and read this book, now. Unless you have the tendency to scream when shocked and are currently on an airplane. If this unfortunate combination applies to you, please wait until you have reached a safe environment before expression appropriate feelings of exuberance and/or show signs of sudden startled or disconcerted emotions.For the Parents -This is a classic, and should be treated as such (which means everyone should read it at least once). However, themes are slightly more mature, and I wouldn't recommend to anyone younger than 15. Some brief strong language and lots of...death. But I can't say anything else!! ;)"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I recently convinced my 15 year old daughter that this was something she needed to read. She loved it - couldn't put it down! Daphne du Maurier is just as relevant today as always. Just trying to decided what to recommend next - My cousin Rachel or Jamaica Inn. Of course even they won't stand up to Rebecca!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Seen the movie many times so there weren't too many surprises except for du Maurier's writing style--very sensually detailed, full of beautiful descriptions. The story takes place in England in the 1930s and is narrated by a young nameless woman (played by Joan Fontaine in the film) who may be the most neurotic character in all of fiction. She marries well above her station and becomes the second Mrs. Maxim de Winter, the first being the mysterious Rebecca who died in a boating accident nearly a year before. \\"Rebecca\\" is a mystery, so I'll stop there, except to say that if you haven't seen the film the book will be hard to put down as you brave the suspense and clever plot turns. After I read to the end, I watched the movie again and this time the film seemed vacant."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is such a wonderful and suspenseful book that every woman should read and see the DVD. I have purchased every DVD made from this book, that is how much I loved reading it, could'nt put it down and stayed up all night reading it. I could'nt wait to turn the pages, same with Jane Eyre, movies that are about true love and misfortune without vulgar words or nudity or steamy sex scenes, the scope is so good it does not need those in order to grip the reader heart and mind. I now own every DVD of the writer of Rebecca and Jane Eyre, House on the strand and Jamaca Inn, these two I am waiting for arrival, has been sent and I am anxious to get into these as well. When I was a child I read these, my very first adult book was House on the strand and after that I became an avid reader. Iwas really too young to comprehend all of Daphne's books but I knew they were very good and reading them as an adult has been a true pleasure, I will no doubt read them again and again through the years and never tire of them. I now have a wide variety of favorite writers in various catagories and completely enjoy them but only Daphne makes me cry with heartfelt recognition to the characters and situations. I highly recommend Rebecca and Jane Eyre especially and if you buy the DVD get Jane Eyre with Timothy Dalton, it is the very best one, follows the book word for word and the actors play the parts extremely well, and Rebecca I highly recommend Masterpiece Theaters version with Charles Dance Emilla Fox Faye Dunaway and Diana Rigg, the very best of that story, they are extremely touching to the heart and mind, every woman should see these and read the books, I highly recommend them. Both of the books were purchased from Amazon and one of the DVD's. While you are at it purchase a Kindle 3G and download thousands of books from all varieties and most reasonable plus in 60 seconds you have the book in your hands to read from your Kindle, I love mine so well it stays by my side and often goes with me when I leave, it never forgets what page you are on, it goes right to it. What more could one ask for? And never a shipping charge with a Kindle, the savings are enormous and it pays for itself quickly. I also bought my Kindle from Amazon of course when this version came out, one of my daughters bought the largest one, sold it and got a 3G like mine, and you can adjust the size of the print as well."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"What appears to be a story about a woman's slow descent into madness turns out to be something else---something else entirely.It is worthy of note that Alfred Hitchcock won his only Oscar for his production of \\"Rebecca.\\"Put together a great director with a great, great story and the Oscar was inevitable...perhaps without a lot of work on Hitchcock's part.

This is by far the best book that du Maurier has ever written."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book held me captive after finally getting through the first chapter, which is particularly boring. The symbolism of Manderly was actually the thing that intrigued me the most. I would recomend this book to any female who believes they are only ordinary and there is nothing special about them. This novel makes you realize there could be some one who thinks of you like Maxim thinks of the narrator."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Excellent!

Du Maurier's lush narrative transports you into the strange world of Manderley and the new Mrs. DeWinter.

I must say it has left a lasting impression on me ever since. Rebecca was the first book that ever kept me completely entranced throughout, and never waivered in the integrity of the stories plot. It was suspenseful, romantic, and coy all at the same time. I would recommend Rebecca to anyone ,young or old, who just really wants to read a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I loved this book. it tells a story of mystery, and romance. this book is fully developed. it's got an awesome ending that completely caught me off guard.

She is endearing and silly and lovable at the same time and yet as we read how she is haunted by shadows of ghosts we are drawn to and repulsed by Manderly at the same time. And the end of the book does not come back to the beginning. As Max has said &quot;Perhaps in the end Rebecca has won&quot;, that nothing ever ends when it does."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I read Rebecca by Daphne DuMaurier when I was 15 years old and I have never forgotten the story.

Our never-named narrator marries a millionaire twice her age, and moves back to her husband's estate, Manderley, on the coast of Cornwall, England. Soon her husband's now dead first wife, Rebecca, whose body was never discovered, begins to invisibly invade the newlyweds. If that's not enough, add Mrs. Danvers, the all-seeing housekeeper who yearns to have the original first lady of the house back in charge, and a mysterious man who surprises our narrator at every turn and you've got what you paid for: A terrific page-turning mystery. Rebecca is du Maurier at her very best, which is why, 60 years after its first publication, Rebecca continues to deliver mystery and intrigue to her readers and why annually thousands visit Cornwall, in search of Manderley. You'll read this book more than once and each time you do, you'll appreciate the evocative and intriguing way du Maurier lures you into Manderley's mysterious world."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book is a true gem. But I warn you, you need a brain to enjoy it. Not just any brain will do. You must be able to transport yourself to another time, to enjoy richly woven suspenseful tales which make you feel as though you are in the same room indulging your sense of smell in the heady bouquets of roses, bluebells, hydrangeas, and rodedendrons. You must be able to feel as a young, naive, unworldly, penniless girl in the twenties would feel. A girl with no family and no experience with the world. You must believe things were different in that time. I am firmly convinced the one star reviewers lack such a brain. This would explain their ignorance. Oh and those one star reviews because the page was torn or the print too small. Hmmm do you review such things? Save that for e-mail correspondence with the seller or Amazon. That is the proper channel for those - just throws off the curve wouldn't you say? Pick up this book and be prepared to be transported. To those of you who've trashed it with a one star review .... Shame on you. Just because you lack the intelligence to enjoy the gift you were given, don't spoil it for those with a literary brain who would treasure the the fabulous book that is......Rebecca."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I enjoy literary fiction now and then, although it's not my usual fare, for the three-dimensional characters and polished prose. I am, however, fairly indifferent to symbolism and other literary devices (maybe I'll develop more appreciation for them eventually, once my school days are far enough behind me). And I have the feeling that if I were a lover of literary devices and critical essays, I'd give this book 5 stars. As it is.... a solid 4.The basic plot: the young, unnamed narrator receives a surprise proposal from an older man, Maxim, and moves with him to Manderley, his enormous estate. But no one can stop thinking about his recently-dead first wife, Rebecca, and there's something increasingly ominous about all of this....The plot is compelling and suspenseful without falling too far into horror, and I quite enjoyed reading it. The narrator in particular is incredibly well-realized; her shyness and self-consciousness have turned off some readers, but I found her so completely believable and relatable that this didn't bother me a bit. The secondary characters are also vivid and realistic. Maxim and Rebecca, however, gave me a bit of trouble. Maxim is rather distant for much of the book, and I was never quite sure who he was. As for Rebecca....MAJOR SPOILERSI am still trying to work out my reaction to Rebecca. Part of this is my unique experience with the book--I let a friend spoil me years ago, thinking I'd probably never read it, and she interpreted the book very differently; her view was that Rebecca is slowly revealed to be a villain, such that the reader understands and accepts Maxim's murdering her. To me, it seemed we get very few hints of Rebecca's imperfections before being simply told that she was a sociopath (although that word isn't actually used), and so I never had any visceral response to her nor thought Maxim's actions excusable. In part this may be because times have changed; a large part of what's supposed to make Rebecca so awful is her rampant adultery, which just isn't as horrifying today as it may have been in the 1930s.All that aside, I'm not entirely comfortable with the juxtaposition of the good-hearted, timid narrator whose life revolves around her husband with the sociopathic Rebecca, who's dynamic and has a life and doesn't need men (but seduces and manipulates them for fun). It's not uncommon for early-20th-century novels to portray \\"good\\" women who are shy and let love dominate their lives, while the \\"bad\\" ones want more and do more (and not caring for men, in these cases, always means engaging in romantic relationships with them anyway, but in selfish and destructive ways); a rather unfortunate worldview that we've hopefully gotten past today. At least there is the more confident and also good-hearted Beatrice to balance things out a bit./SPOILERSAt any rate, the author does a great job with the setting--which reminds me of an old movie--and with atmosphere and suspense. Everything from the weather to the plants on the estate is imbued with potentially sinister, anthropomorphic qualities. (Occasionally I had my doubts as to whether weather actually works as described, but it makes for good storytelling.) And the writing is, indeed, very good throughout. I'll leave you with a passage I particularly liked:\\"I wondered why it was that places are so much lovelier when one is alone. How commonplace and stupid it would be if I had a friend now, sitting beside me, someone I had known at school, who would say: \`By-the-way, I saw old Hilda the other day. You remember her, the one who was so good at tennis. She's married, with two children.' And the blue-bells beside us unnoticed, and the pigeons overhead unheard. I did not want anyone with me.\\"It takes a very good book for me to start marking passages I like, and I'd recommend this one. But it's probably best if you don't spoil yourself first!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"My mom had recommended me reading this book because she said it was her favorite. Let me tell you, I am so glad I read it. This book is full of suspense and drama. Despite what another reviewer had said, I loved the main charater, sympathized with her, and rooted for her all the way through. The only thing I wished DuMaurier had done different was name the new Mrs. De Winter. I wish I could put a name with such a great charcter. Then again, it adds to the sort of mystery of the book.Overall, I am so glad I finally found my favorite book, Rebecca.P.S. I am a freshman in highschool"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"...with only ten books, \\"Rebecca\\" is one of the ones I would pack. I've read it every year or two since I discovered it in 1990, and there's always something new to discover. The language Du Maurier uses is gorgeous. Her imagery is stunning. You can see the violent red of the rhododendrons, the beautiful wildflowers in the Happy Valley. The dialogues are brisk. The narrator's youth, shyness, and inexperience are painful to read, but it's a good pain. You do have to wonder on occasion why exactly she fell for Maxim, since he is often snotty and condescending, but he improves on closer acquaintance. The moment you realize everything is not as it seems is a WHAM on the back of the head--when Maxim finally opens up and tells all, it's chilling and terrifying, but it also makes everything make sense.Some reviewers have complained about the nameless heroine, the second Mrs. De Winter. \\"Why didn't she ask Maxim what was going on?\\" they ask. Well, as I mentioned before, the nameless protagonist is very young and sheltered, with little experience of the world. She's shy and has been dominated by strong personalities most of her life, so it makes sense that she would gravitate toward Maxim's strength. It also explains why she is easily silenced on the rare occasions when she does try to speak. Further, there's the time factor to consider. The novel was published in 1938, but the narrator said it happened years ago. If we assume that the story had taken place even just a decade before, remember that 1928 in England was the year women of 21 years of age finally got the right to vote -- it's not as if they were used to going about speaking their mind and making demands of their husbands. Men didn't expect or want them to be opinionated. It's hard for us a century later to remember there was ever a time before women enjoyed the freedoms we have today, but it did exist.I read a lot of books 20 years ago, but the benchmark for quality for me is, did I like it well enough to return to it at least twice in twenty years? There are few that I come back to again and again; this is one of them and will always be."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"The tale of Rebecca is a thrilling read from start to finish. She was a beautiful, talented woman who cared only for herself and used others. However, she hid the selfish attributes behind an exterior that seemed to make everyone love her except her husband who knew who she really was. Rebecca died in a boating accident and her husband, Max, was grief stricken. He traveled to try to recover and he meets a very young woman who makes him laugh and enjoy life once again. She is a companion to an elderly woman. When the woman returns home, Max marries the young woman and takes her to Manderley, the beautiful home treasured by his family and decorated lavishly by Rebecca.Everywhere the young wife looks she sees Rebecca's influence. Even the housekeeper who cared for Rebecca as a child until her death resents her presence. Sinister, devious, she plans to evict her from Manderley. To the young wife, it seems as if Max can only think about Rebecca. He shows little affection and expects much. While her youth and inexperience were part of what caught Max's attention, it leads her into frightening experiences and social errors that make her doubt her decision to marry Max even though she loves him dearly.As the story unfolds, one discovers there is much more to Rebecca's life than one can imagine. Manderley is only a one place where she spends her time. The ending is unexpected and exciting making this one of the best reads of the year for me."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca follows the second Mrs. Maxim de Winter from the time she meets Maxim in Monte Carlo through the rough first year of their marriage. Set at Manderley on the Cornish coast, the new Mrs. de Winter must contend with the overwhelming presence of the first Mrs. de Winter, Rebecca, kept alive by the creepy housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers. The new Mrs. de Winter becomes obsessed with Rebecca and everything to do with her while also struggling to step out of her shadow.I actually found that it took me longer to read Rebecca than it did with Paige Harbison's New Girl. I am not sure exactly why - I think it was mostly just a slow reading week for me.I would not have known about Rebecca if it were not for reading Cristina's (The Princess of Storyland) review of New Girl. I had no idea it was a young adult retelling of a classic. Beyond that, Cristina recommended that I watch Alfred Hitchcock's movie, Rebecca, so I did. I enjoyed both Daphne du Maurier's book and the movie. And if you are wondering, yes, I believe Paige Harbison's version keeps true to the original while making it modern and available to a younger crowd.If you have read New Girl, you need to read Rebecca and vice versa. In Rebecca, the new Mrs. de Winter's first name is never revealed and in du Maurier's Author's Note, I learned why: she simply could not think of one. I found that interesting because the lack of a name seems like such a good plot device.Recommended for lovers of classics and anyone who has read New Girl. Also, I found out there is another book based on Rebecca called Rebecca's Tale by Sally Beauman.Google \\"The Musings of ALMYBNENR\\" to see this review in its original format and to follow my book review blog."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Don't worry, my review is not going to give away any key plot points. In fact, I'm not even going to discuss the plot since the suspense of this novel rides on the story's unpredictable twists and turns. \\"Rebecca,\\" published in 1938, is a Gothic thriller in the tradition of \\"The Mysteries of Udolpho\\" and \\"Jane Eyre.\\" All of the elements required for a creepy Gothic romance are here: 1) a Byronic hero haunted by his past who may or may not be a villain; 2) a beautiful dead woman, the novel's titular character; 3) a mysterious stone mansion overlooking the sea; 4) a village idiot, who appears to know more about Rebecca's death than he lets on; 5) a scary housekeeper; and 5) a high-strung, impressionable narrator given to reverie and fits of bravery who periodically is seized with the urge to explore the mansion's uninhabited west wing.Daphne DuMaurier has a special gift for creating ambience. In \\"Rebecca,\\" Manderley, the ancient estate in Southern England where most of the novel's action takes place, becomes a character unto itself. Manderley, with its high-vaulted ceilings and stone terraces, its lawns extending down to the sea, its woods, its coves, its gardens, is at once welcoming and forbidding. DuMaurier uses botanical imagery to convey these contradictory qualities: \\"blood-red\\" rhododendrons, impressive yet ominous, form a wall fifty feet high at the entrance to the house; in the wood, which is carpeted with bluebells, beauty commingles with horror as the flower-filled \\"Happy Valley\\" abruptly gives way to the sea and the cove where Rebecca died; beech trees \\"with white, naked limbs\\" come together like an arch over the serpentine driveway leading to house, creating a claustrophobic atmosphere. Throughout the book, flower imagery is used to sustain tension; the character of Rebecca is associated with the intoxicating fragrance of Manderley's azaleas.DuMaurier is quite skilled at keeping the reader in doubt as to which characters are the good guys and which characters are the bad guys. Is ghoulish housekeeper as evil as she seems? Is the brooding owner of Manderley to be trusted? Is the narrator, whose name is never mentioned, a reliable source? And what was Rebecca __really__ like? This is a great novel and a fast read. I highly recommend it. There's a reason why it's considered a classic."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"After Rebecca, the wife of millionare Maxim de Winter, dies in a sailing accident, Maxim travels to Monte Carlo where he meets a young, naive girl who is working as a companion.

The new Mrs de Winter has to put up with Mrs. Danvers comparing her to the rightful mistress to the house and tells her that she is not a real lady like the late Rebecca.Lacking self confidence and over-whelmed by her new life, Mrs de Winter worries about her husbands love for his late wife whom she feels he never got over.Full of drama and suspense i couldn't put it down"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I always put off reading this story because I thought it was a romance. Granted, I based this solely off the book cover, so imagine my delight as I got older and heard that it was instead, decidedly Gothic and creepy.The entire story is told through a flashback of events that occurred when the unnamed narrator is a hired companion for Mrs. Van Hopper, a gossipy brute of a woman. While traveling through Monte Carlo, they meet Maxim de Winter, whose story is one that Mrs. Van Hopper willingly offers up. Maxim's recent loss of his first wife Rebecca is a sad fate, and as the young narrator spends more time with him, they decide within only a few weeks that they will get married and move to his estate, entitled Manderley.But upon arriving to Maxim's estate, it becomes quite a different experience than she anticipated. The mansion is huge, with a full staff to keep up the house and grounds, and the ever-present ghost of the beautiful, social, and popular Rebecca is behind everything that is desirable about Manderley, and even the parties she's hosted are still talked about. But not only is she a part of Manderley's past, she is very much a part of a creepy and sinister presence about the house. Rebecca is everywhere that the new bride finds herself in - from the beautiful landscape of the grounds, the cove where Rebecca lost her life, the little cottage down by the sea that she used to rest in after she would go sailing. Rebecca is everywhere, and the new Mrs. De Winter, meek, quiet, and shy, cannot keep up. Even the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers is cold and intimidating, harboring secrets that make the new bride fearful. She knows she is being compared by the housekeeper, the visitors to the house on their social calls, and she can't quite help feeling like even Maxim is doing the same, ultimately wondering if he is contemplating if he made the right choice to marry her.I loved this story. I've read Du Maurier's short stories last year and enjoyed them, but this struck me much more than anything else and was much, much creepier. It is beautiful and dark and perfect for autumn. I absolutely recommend this story"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book is a wonderful piece of literature, but it's NOT a romance novel. Du Maurier never intended it to be read is such. The main characters are married, but the story does not focus on their courtship or their relationship, rather I would say on the individuals they are. I believe that the narrator's journey from naive, innocent, childhood to aware, mature, adulthood is very important. The fact that she remains nameless throughout the story, or is referred to as Mrs. De Winter, shows how easily she initially gives up her own identity to please others: her employer, her husband, even her own staff. It is only towards the end that she begins to assert herself. This book would probably be better classified as a psychological thriller, since it deals both with the mystery surrounding the death of Rebecca (the 1st Mrs. De Winter) and her continuing impact on those she left behind. Beautifully written."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"\\"Rebecca\\", the book that gave Daphne du Maurier immortality, has all the features of the novel of its time. Balancing on the thin, invisible line between plain romance and deep psychological analysis, it is engrossing, for me to the point of sacrificing sleep.The plot itself is constructed quite simply and classically, starting with the young girl - companion to the wealthy lady, falling in love and marrying the rich widower, Maxim de Winter. The young bride is the narrator of the novel and she finds itself initially incapable of understanding her husband's past (especially as she gets no direct answers) and of bearing the burden of living in Manderley, the mansion haunted by the powerful presence of his first wife, Rebecca.In fact, the naivety and childishness of the narrator sometimes irritated me massively, she was extremely self-conscious and eager to please, so much that she could not see the obvious...Very good character, I bet this was the author's plan. But finally she undergoes the complete transformation, albeit in very dramatic circumstances, discovers the truth (a horrible secret... more than one in fact) and can be happy with her husband (this is not a spoiler, as the novel starts at this pint and is written in retrospective). Ultimately, this is a story of lack of communication which is the basis for misunderstanding, suspicions, false loyalty and the whole spectrum of emotions with which this novel if bursting.\\"Rebecca\\" is a great classic, full of suspence, with great characters (Miss Danvers!). It is definitely worth reading even as the only book by du Maurier, to get acquainted with her style, and it is a very good novel for a long, winter evening, virtually moving the reader to the British countryside at the beginning of the twentieth century. Although the novel certainly aged, it did so gracefully, retaining all its charm."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I read Rebecca about a year ago in 8th grade, and I loved it so much. I started it around 7:00 at night and stayed up until 4:30 in the morning reading it, even though I had school the next day. I simply could not put it down. The ending was so suprising, very Gone With the Wind-ish. The only problem is that it starts a little slow, so you have to stick it out, but it is so good, you forget that in the end. But, just as a warning, the sequel is not NEAR as good!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"For all of Rebecca's hype as the \\"modern masterpiece\\" of Gothic fiction, romantic suspense, etc., I think readers need to understand exactly what they will be getting with this story. I can understand people's frustration with the Second Mrs. De Winter (I wanted to slap her repeatedly too) and what they perceive as a \\"boring narrative pace\\" where nothing \\"happens until the last hundred pages or so,\\" and while these are all valid points to a degree, I think they should approach the novel from a different perspective.Rebecca is first and foremost a probe into human psychology. Du Maurier herself saw this as a \\"study of jealousy.\\" There is romance, but the story is not romantic, nor was it intended to be. The narrator and Maxim have a love of co-dependency on her part and selfishness on his part. A forty-two year old man and twenty-one year old girl meet in Monte Carlo and marry within several weeks. The man takes his inexperienced bride back to his great estate and thrusts her into a life she's not prepared for. The Second Mrs. De Winter becomes insecure and obsessive over her husband's dead first wife, the seemingly beautiful, intelligent, and perfect Rebecca.People claim that the Second Mrs. De Winter is spineless, weak, over-imaginative, and spends her time making the situation worse than it is, imagining that she is more deficient that she is, and they are right! But the narrator is not supposed to be anything other than that. The Second Mrs. De Winter is pathetic, and she could have solved a lot of her problems by simply firing Mrs. Danvers and/or taking initiative, but she allows her own internal fears to stop her from doing anything. She keeps trying to convince herself that she and Maxim \\"are happy,\\" even though the shadow of the past looms over them. When Maxim goes away to London for a few days, the narrator actually feels more free and happier than she's been in a while then tells herself she's being \\"wicked,\\" \\"unloyal,\\" that Maxim is her \\"world.\\" The relationship has a dark undertone to it from the beginning. Even when Maxim proposes to her, she tells herself that she didn't really want a \\"church wedding\\" and all that, except she does.Mrs. Danvers, the creepy housekeeper, obsesses over Rebecca too and resents the Second Mrs. De Winter for both replacing her mistress AND for being a coward (if our narrator had been bold the first time they met it might have made for an entirely different dynamic between the two, maybe Danvers might even have respected her a little). Mrs. Danvers loved Rebecca for being strong, and the psychological warfare she wages upon the narrator, as well as the shrine she keeps for Rebecca makes for interesting material.Maxim is our third character study. His and Rebecca's relationship and the drama that followed could have been prevented if Maxim hadn't allowed his pride and excessive love of \\"Manderly\\" to...well, I leave that for the reader to discover. About halfway through the book, he asks if his wife is he was \\"selfish\\" for marrying her, showing that he's aware of what he's done yet there's not much he can do about it now. Maxim broods, is aloof and on the cold-blooded side, and how much he loves the narrator for herself versus her being the anti-Rebecca (and thus helping him to \\"blot out the past\\") is a subject of discussion.I've seen a few people who called the ending \\"happily ever after.\\" They need to re-read the end and the beginning of the novel (which I grant--the first two chapters are a chore to get through). The narrator and Maxim survive through their ordeal, escape, and are \\"free\\" from the past with no \\"secrets between us now,\\" but they live in exile, scarred forever by what has happened. They do not go off into the sunset. In fact, one must go back to narrator's obnoxious employer, Mrs. Van Hopper, who upon hearing of her engagement to Maxim, says \\"you are making a big mistake--one you will bitterly regret.\\" One can't help but wonder if the Mrs. Van Hopper wasn't right, not that the narrator would ever allow herself to *think* so.The character of Rebecca herself is fascinating. Dead before the story begins, we only know her through what other people say. And as the Second Mrs. De Winter's demonstrates through her own narrative, perception can be quite different from reality.If you're looking for an epic, love conquers all romance or an exciting, thrilling plot in the modern sense, Rebecca might not be for you. But if you allow yourlself to understand the subtlties of the Second Mrs. De Winter's highly subjective narrative--what she believes or imagines versus what is true--and if you are willing to journey into the complexity of human nature and relationships, Rebecca is well worth your time and energy. And once you past the first few chapters, it's quite an easy read.This is a novel of character."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I have had an intimate knowledge of Rebecca, by Daphne Du Maurier, for several years and not until today have I been able to share my thoughts on this terrific novel. What originally captured me was what most other people might consider the novel's downfalls. The formal diction, vivid imagery, and abstract character developments drew me to the heart of the novel's secrets. The omnipresent tormentor, Rebecca, gave the novel a charnal house atmosphere. It was definitely the most intriguing piece of literature I have ever read. I will continue to read this book and pour over it's worn pages for many more years to come, I suggest you do the same."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Reading Gone With the Wind really spoiled me for other books--I've only found two since then that I really loved, and Rebecca was one of them. (The other was the Thorn Birds by Colleen McCullough) This book starts out a little slow and dry, but trust me, you won't want to put it down about halfway thru. I love books written long ago when things were left to the imagination, as Du Maurier does. Her characters are excellent and the way she writes a scene is perfect. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I didn't like the ending, but I didn't like the GWTW ending, either. Perhaps I was just disappointed that it had to end..."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I'm afraid I simply can't quite understand why this book has the reputation it does; it struck me as being little more than a pale imitation of Charlotte Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre.\\" Both have oppressed, rather nervous women as their main characters; in both novels this woman meets an older, wealthy man who owns a mansion, and has a dangerous former wife lurking in the shadows; in both novels the mansion is burnt down . . . But whereas Jane Eyre is a true heroine, a woman of moral courage and conviction, the protagonist of Rebecca is spineless and frightened from beginning to end. Both she and her husband are defined repeatedly throughout the book as being deeply conventional, and horrified at anything that would appear to make them otherwise. Seen in this light, it is Rebecca who has the strongest claim as being the heroine of the story: Rebecca has spirit; Rebecca is deeply, profoundly rebellious against all conventionality and, in her disdain of men and their love, against the patriarchal standards of her time as well. She emerges, to my mind at least, as a tragic character, in the classic sense: one who rebels against her human station, and pays the price. I'm not saying that I don't understand the appeal of \\"Rebecca\\"; most of us have a certain love of conventionality and find comfort in it; it can even be argued that conventionality is necessary to some degree to create a stable society. It's an interesting enough theme--just not, to my mind, well handled in this particular novel. My only satisfaction is in the knowledge that Mr and Mrs de Winter are left at the story's end (as described early on in the novel) as leading such extremely dull and frightened lives that reading the sport's column of the newspaper constitutes the highlight of their days. Bear this in mind when you consider du Maurier's novel: is this really what you would call a happy ending? Rebecca does indeed exact payment of her own. If you want to read a truly first-rate accounting of these characters, why not turn to the masterful and far more thought-provoking original model, \\"Jane Eyre\\"? And then, for good measure, give Jean Rhys \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" a try. These two books both deal with similar themes as \\"Rebecca,\\" are quite as entertaining, and much more challenging to the discerning reader."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I had to read this book as required reading in high school. I didn't think it would interest me, but happily, it did!! Everything about it was fascinating, from the characters to Manderley to Ms. DuMaurier's graceful (if somewhat rambling)prose. Naturally, I read the sequel MRS. de WINTER immediately after it was published. I am in the process of reading the third book in the series, REBECCA'S TALE.REBECCA is narrated my the nameless Mrs. de Winter. A traveling companion and servant to a snobbish socialite, Mrs. de Winter is swept off her feet by Maxim de Winter, a wealthy and sophisticated widower, while on vacation in Monte Carlo with her employer. After a whirlwind courtship and quick, quiet wedding, Maxim whisks her away to Manderley, his ancestral home on the Cornish coast in England. She's not there long before she realizes that her predecessor, the ineffably beautiful and accomplished Rebecca, is everywhere yet nowhere, dead yet still alive, gone yet not forgotten. And no one underscores these sentiments more strongly than Mrs. Danvers, Manderley's housekeeper who had been Rebecca's loyal serving woman. Constantly haunted by Rebecca's memory and forced to do battle with Maxim's odd mood swings, Mrs. de Winter fights to hold her own in her new milieu. The turning point in the story comes with the discovery of Rebecca's sunken sailboat at the bottom of the bay, and with it horrifying new revelations that she may not have drowned but had been murdered instead. A series of suspenseful events follows that will keep you on the edge of your seat as the de Winters fight for their love and their lives, and the story concludes with a shocking ending.The movie, made in 1940 by Alfred Hitchcock, is also excellent and stays pretty true to the novel."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"It's true that most people will find the first two chapters (or more) tedious, but don't let that stop you from reading the rest. The nameless narrator (a brilliant move-- although I read that Du Maurier simply couldn't think of a name) has the truest emotions of any character in any book I've read, and I don't see how anyone can dispute it. Be careful reading other reviews on this site-- many are great, but several give inaccurate details that may send you into it with the wrong state of mind (and some even give away the plot!). Read it and enjoy. The book does move well-- but pay attention! Little details may very well be important...they help to make this book the masterpiece it is."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"It's funny how much of an impact someone can make on everyone around them. When Rebecca de Winter died, people were in shock. She was the perfect woman to run Manderley, the estate of Maxim de Winter. She was beautiful, clever, charming, and a great friend to everyone... except for those her knew her all too well. Although she was such a bold woman, no one expected Rebecca to hold such a lasting impression at Manderley. When Mr. de Winter brought home a new wife, people weren't quit sure what to say. Why, this young bride was nothing like the previous Mrs. de Winter! But, for those who adored Rebecca, they needn't worry. Rebecca would live on. In the halls and rooms of Manderley and in the minds of all her acquaintances. Manderley was Rebecca's, and nothing could take that away from her. Not even her own death. One woman. One house. One widowed husband. One blushing bride. Many memories that won't die. It all adds up to an extraordinary novel that will have you on the edge of your comfy reading chair until the very last word..."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is a gripping novel, I could not put it down till I've finished it. Excellent Reading!!!!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"this is a truly amazing story of suspense and love. It follows the story of a young girls love for her husband who is haunted by his previous wife. It is the story of her self triumph over Rebecca's memory and her finding of peace with her husband.

Make sure you have nothing else to do because Rebecca is hard to put down."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"For those of you who enjoyed Jane Eyre, this is a wonderful book to read as well.

It continues to keep me interested (rarely do I read books more than once). I am a reader and could read just about anything I get my hands upon, but I think even a moderate reader would really enjoy this. The book is suspenseful and riveting, but also has romance for you romance readers. This is one of the few books that I have read that totally surprised me. Usually I can predict the outcome or come pretty close to figuring out how a story will end, but the first time I read this I was completely wrong (and happily so) about how it would end. Wonderful read!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is the most amazing book in the world for a young girl coming of age. i greatly enjoyed it because of the mysterious past of Mr. de Winter and also because it is full of the narrators emotions. i recommend it to anyone ready to sit down and open a long book full of excitement..."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is a wonderful novel. Everything about it is brilliant. ... chose this book to read for a book report, only because I had heard Alfred Hitchcock made a movie out of it-which I have not seen yet. I didn't really know what to expect, and I have to admit, I had major doubts about the book after reading the beginning chapters. But after reading the entire novel, I I understand why they were there and now appreciate them greatly.One of the strongest points of the book are the characters. Never have characters been so developed and real, or at least I think of them as real. I completely felt for all the characters, especially Mrs. DeWinter (the second). She responded to situations as I would of and since much of the book is her racing thoughts, she thought like me too. I felt for all the character and could understand why a man would kill his wife.The genious of this book also comes from the smart storytelling and intruiging plot. Everybody looks at Mrs. DeWinter and compares her to Rebecca, haunting her every thought (or at least she thinks they are). The story telling is just plain brilliantThe book is slow at first, but give it patience, you'll not regret it."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I'm not really a reader of romances but heard this one was a great suspense novel as well, a classic made into a film that starred Laurence Olivier and won the academy award for best picture in 1941. A 40something millionaire widower suddenly marries a young woman with no money, background or breeding and takes her to live at his estate, Manderley. She is haunted by the presence of Rebecca, his first wife, whom she imagines her husband is still in love with.I thought the second half of the book much better than the first, I don't know how I stayed through the first 150 pages, which is the same tiresome whining of the main character over and over. The narrator is so mean spirited, self-centered and just too stupid to be believed, searching & sifting through every conversation, the most minor social encounters, digging and digging and digging to find the insults she believes everyone is directing at her. Perhaps this character is dated and can only be appreciated through 1930's lenses as a sensitive, unworldly, eager to please young woman, but I found it hard to be on her side and couldn't identify with anything she felt. The second part of book seems to deserve the suspense label and really does become a page turner once it leaves the realm of the narrator's inner doubts about her marriage and moves to the mystery of how Rebecca really did die."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is a marvleous story about a young naive girl who is picked up in Monte Carlo, France by a wealthy, powerful aristocrat.

It's no wonder du Maurier never gave her a name. Anyone with any gumption would have fired Mrs. Danvers after the second encounter, redecorated the west wing, given all those clothes to the local thrift shop, and had a life. Obviously well-written, classic story of suspense, etc, etc, but I had to force myself to finish this book - the heroine is so useless I had no empathy with her at all. And Maxim is another neurotic. No wonder the book is called Rebecca."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"After reading the book, \\"Rebecca\\", I can understand why it is mandatory reading for a high school English class. The writing and language of Daphne DuMaurier is exquisitely rich with such precision to detail, one can easily enter the stage she sets and the worlds she creates.The story is told through the eyes of a young woman whose name is never mentioned, unless Mademoiselle, and later Madame and Mrs. DeWinter. Beginning at the ending, in the first two chapters, the narrative begins again, in Monte Carlo as a hired companion to a boorish matronly social-climber, while befriending a widower on holiday who suddenly asks her hand in marriage before she is required, by duty, to leave Monte Carlo for New York. The simple-bred and educated young woman henceforth lives within the aristocratic English estate, Manderley, and the shadow of Rebecca, the recently deceased former wife of her new husband where she finds superficial manners and politeness as well as drama and mystery.Here is one example of the part Rebecca plays in the story, from the new Mrs. DeWinter's point of view: \\"I could fight the living but I could not fight the dead. If there was some woman in London that Maxim loved, someone he wrote to, visited, dined with, slept with, I could fight with her. We would stand on common ground. I should not be afraid. Anger and jealousy were things that could be conquered. One day the woman would grow old or tired or different, and Maxim would not love her any more. But Rebecca would never grow old. Rebecca would always be the same. And she and I could not fight. She was too strong for me.\\" (But wait until you find out how Rebecca died....)The sequel to this story, written by Susan Hill Long, is called \\"Mrs. DeWinter\\", so I'm assuming the narrator's given name still remains a mystery even there."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I found the story very slow and boring (at least at the beginning,fortunately the end is a slightly better, else it would be very boring) is , the characters sometimes seemed to do simply nothing. The actions of the people are often not or only heavily comprehensibly, for example Mrs. de Winter. Why does she stay with Maxim after she found out his dark secret? In the movie it is more understandable. But I think the movie is much better than the book."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"The main conflict of &quot;Rebecca&quot; is between Mrs. De Winter, a very shy and timid character, and the infamous Rebecca. Even though Rebecca is dead she still holds power over Manderley. Other characters like, Mrs. Danvers, adds to her struggle to become accepted as Mrs.de Winter, with her obsession towards Rebecca. Maxim can't bring himself to tell her of Rebecca's affairs and evil ways because he is afraid of her finding out the truth of Rebecca's death. Then Maxim torn by his wife's love tells her the horrible truth, &quot;You thought I loved Rebecca ? You thought I killed her , loving her? I hated her. I tell our marriage was a farce from the first. She was vicious, damnable, rotten through and through. We never loved each other, never had a moment of happiness together. Rebecca was incapable of love, of tenderness, of decency.&quot; The book portrays the dark, vile side of the beatiful, revered Rebecca and shows how she is overcome by true love. The two lovers can finally live together in peace and as a devoted couple, occasionally remembering the woman who tried so hard to keep them apart. A delightful love, mystery novel that grasps the readers interest and leaves you in suspense. Joseph Dion"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I had to read this for Literature by Women in college. It's frustrating to read because the main chracter doesn't havea name, plus she complains a lot. It doesn't get interesting til around the 17th chapter or later. The end leaves you in suspense which is frustrating too."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. Du Maurier was a genious in building up a reader-based perception of everything and then at some point revealing that what you think is not always what it is.At the beginning, the nameless second wife of Maxim seemed so shy and childish, but sometimes, her words struck me as clever and defying, she became someone who knew exactly what she wanted even from when she was in Monte Carlo. A fit rival for Rebecca. From the first impression made of the De Winters and Manderley till the last event gave such a full vision of who was Rebecca but at the same time also gave the reader a full understanding of who was the narrator.After finishing the book, I got the feel that I had just saw a painting, with clear focus, enigmatic strokes. By not mentioning the narrator's name, the author gave such a powerful focus on the whole story. Compared with Jane Eyre, this story is more a psychology drama rather than a romantic one. Rebecca was a more lively dead character than the first Mrs. Rochester."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is my favorite book.I read it about . . . oh, maybe five months ago, but the characters are still fresh in my mind. Why? Because I can relate so easily to the nameless young woman who narrates the tale.Our namesless shero is shy, meek, and bites her tongue a little too often. She works for a fat, gossipy woman who, ironically enough, unwittingly brings her into contact with her future husband -- Maxim de Winter.Maxim is a man haunted by a greivious burden...\\"They say he can't get over his wife's death . . .\\"But max's secret isn't what it seems.

Initially, i found the book a little hard to get into. There were times when i wanted to grab the heroine and tell her to stop hiding- or to stop thinking of completely random things. However, as the book moved on i found that i was sat up, on the edge of my seat and that i simply couldn't put it down till the end. The last half of this book must simply be read in a night. Will Maxim get away with it? Everytime we think he has- another obstacle is hurled at us and we grip the book in frightened anticiaption. If you liked the Bronte sisters then this book is certainly for you- it's dark and has that same brilliant atmosphere of Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. It's long, but well worth the ending."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book doesn't seem to have lost any of its appeal since it was first published almost seventy years ago. If you don't know the secrets of this book, they still have shock value and you will still be intrigued and surprised by the plot turns. There are a number of strong points to recommend this book: it very effectively creates suspense, fascinates you with the mysterious Rebecca, widow of glamorous Maxim (although she is already dead when the story begins her presence looms over every page and you wish you knew more about her), unexpectedly touches you with the relationship between the unnamed narrator and Maxim and effectively provides two points of suspense: the first portion of the book rests on a completely different sort of mystery than the second. I won't give away the ending, or any of the book's secrets, except to say that the excitement doesn't stop until the end,even after critical details have been revealed. As a young woman I can assure readers that, overall, the book ages well and will be just as exciting to young readers as older ones. However, there are a few points that don't hold up as well which prompted some of the later feminist critiques/rewritings of the book (e.g. the idea of \\"bad\\" versus \\"good\\" women etc.,)and although the critiques are valid this is still a wonderfully written novel, a classic of the gothic genre, and I defy anyone to pick it up and be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"When the very young, unsophisticated and nameless heroine of Daphne Du Maurier's \\"Rebecca\\" happily turns over the ideas that she will \\"be Mrs. DeWinter\\" and \\"will live at Manderley\\", she hasn't a clue as to how these thoughts, prompted by much older Max DeWinter and his proposal of marriage, will change her life in a far different way than she ever anticipated. Du Maurier's heroine narrates her own story; she is fanciful, as gauche as the prototypical unblossomed teenager who feels everyone is looking at her as she walks down the high school hallway and hears cruel comments whispered at her expense. Imagine our heroine's surprise when handsome urbane widower Max DeWinter spends all his time in Monte Carlo taking her for drives and escorting her to lunch. Think how awed she is when his proposal comes---the dreams she conjurs--the romantic scenarios that bloom in her head with the same wild ferocity as the flowers Maxim tells her grow in profusion around Manderley's grounds. Of course, she accepts and the story changes venue from Monte Carlo to DeWinter's famous estate, Manderley. The narrator's voice becomes more uncertain as she enters Manderley's doors--the house, its servants and the responsibility of actually being mistress of Manderley unnerve and overwhelm her. In particular, the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, emits a frigid aura that our heroine cannot thaw. Over time, we discover that Mrs. Danvers was very much attached to the first Mrs. De Winter, Rebecca. In fact,from the new bride's perspective, Rebecca haunts nearly everyone in the story: herself, Max, Mrs. Danvers, Frank, Beatrice, Favel---no one seems to be able to function fully without her. Du Maurier's technique of sharing the narrator's fantasies and fears regarding how she measures up to the legendary Rebecca, adds a masterful bit of psychological tension to all action in the story and helps flesh out the rather insignificant narrator whom Du Maurier didn't even think to name. (Younger readers may find these meanderings a little annoying at times and will want the action to continue rather than indulge in more daydreams. Reading these thoughts aloud rather than skimming over them will add more frazzle to the character's already taut nerves and deepen Manderley's already dark shadows.) Equally intriguing and enigmatic is the character of Max DeWinter, tortured by his loss, so wanting to move on, and so dysfunctionally frozen and unable to do so. Du Maurier creates an unequalled atmosphere of palpable unease. Whether you've read the story before and already know Manderley's secrets or are reading it for the first time, you are in for a finely nuanced treat that elicits many different interpretations of each of the main characters with each reading. This is undoubtably the best Gothic novel of the 20th century--the sequels, Mrs DeWinter and Rebecca's Tale (by different authors) do not compare, even though they are sanctioned by the Du Maurier Estate. Many critics dismiss Rebecca as one of Du Maurier's escapist romances; it is anything but---there is no romance here---the nameless narrator does not escape from the odd happenings manifesting themselves within Manderley's walls to love, she, as all other Du Maurier heriones finds herself trapped, first as a servant to an obnoxious American, then again as a servant to her husband who ultimately controls her every thought and action. Du Maurier creates the eptiome of the 20th century woman. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"* This book shall go down in history.

This book, however, helped me remember why I like to read.The book \\"Rebecca\\" not only has a riveting story that keeps you wondering and thinking between each reading, but it is also written perfectly, in my opinion. Daphne Du Maurier definitely knows the English language and how to put sentences and paragraphs together that flow and develop the story and characters. She seems to choose the perfect words and best writing style to build to the right atmosphere for every situation in the book. There were times when I was reading that I forgot I was reading and felt as if I was actually in the story observing what was going on.This book is going on my \\"best books I have ever read\\" list."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"it was an interesting book. not the best i've read"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"The story begins with one of my favorite opening paragraphs (second only to A Tale of Two Cities): &quot;Last night, I dreamed I went to Manderly again.....&quot; From there we are swept into a seaside story of paranoia and excrutiating love. Rebecca is a classic mystery story set in a lone English Manor by the sea and filled with dark secrets. It is a tale of rivalry. A new, young, painfully shy wife, is brought into a legendary estate, and forced to share her marriage with the presence of her husband's beautiful and tragically departed wife - Rebecca. I read this book for the first time when I was twelve years old. I thought Mrs. Danvers, the obsessed (maybe possessed is a better word) housekeeper was the devil (still do). I remember lying in bed in the dark of night, hearing only the ticking of a clock in the hallway and feeling that Rebecca was watching me too. I was insanely in love with Maxim, and desperate for his approval of our heroine. I used to try and guess what her &quot;beautiful and unusual name&quot; could possibly be, since Du Maurier never tells us but consistently refers to it, admitting later that she could simply never think of one.Du Maurier, one of the great masters of suspense, uses the art of manipulation in its' finest form here - leading your mind and thoughts where she wants them to go. You feel what she wants you to feel and are shocked when she wants you to be shocked. You smell the salty sea. You hear the dark ocean waves lapping on the shore like long, cold fingers. And most of all, you share the terror of the unyielding presence of Rebecca.A jolly good read."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Just recently me and my bestfriend did a switchoff with books. She read my favorite book Jane Eyre and I read her favorite book Rebecca. Ive got to tell you its one heck of a book! Its details and twists and turns are amazing! The beginning though wasnt that interesting but the middle and end take up its slack!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebbeca has been on of my favorite books for a long time. I just wanted to inform other who like this book that there is a sequal, which not many know about, called Mrs de winter by susan hill. I have to say it is not as good as rebecca but for those who want to find out what eles happens to maximum and his bride it is a must read."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"i thought this was an excellent book. it was required for one of my classes, and i'm glad it was. it was a bit boring for the first 5 or 7 chapters, but things get sooo much better at the end. definatly a book you would want to read."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"The story is ingenious and the characters are completely believable. Daphne Du Maurier manages to gain our sympathy for some of the chracters and loathing for others. Raises a lot of questions about marriage and friendship but leaves a lot unanswered!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Every so often, you run across a book that you remember for a long time. I have recently read Rebecca and can honestly say it was one of the greatest books I have ever read. Du Maurier is extremely descriptive, making you feel as if you were there at Manderley yourself. I absolutely loved every bit of this story. It added symbolism that Mrs. De Winter had no name, to add to her non existence. I saw the movie, it cannot even hold a candle to the book. Everyone, if you want an unforgettable experience, read this novel!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I loved this book. I began reading it without knowing what to expect and this put me on the edge of my seat. I could not put it down. The ending was a bit disappointing though. It definately makes me to want to read the sequel."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I first read this book when I was 13 for a book report in language arts. I thought, you know, what the heck, it's a mystery romance sort of thing and I'm a sucker for love. From the very first sentence, to the very last, I could not take my eyes off the page! It's a wonderful wonderful book that completely captures you. You'll hate Ms.Danvers, love the second Mrs. DeWinter and sympathize with her, and you'll feel sorry for Max. It's one of the best books ever! It's filled with suspense, fear, mystery, EVERYTHING you could ever hope for."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is the best book i have ever read, no girl should live without reading it!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I read this book for my Great Books class, and it was great! I admit, the first couple of chapters are boring and they didn't catch my attention, but it gets so much better! While the narrator is at Manderley, she can feel Rebecca's shadow hovering over her life. There were times when I was reading when I could almost feel Rebecca's presence. I was definitely not prepared for the climax of the story. I really admire Daphne duMaurier for coming up with such a thrilling, powerful novel! I recommend this book - it will be well worth your time and money."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I happened to pick up this book by chance, and I am extremely glad I did. From the time when the plot started taking shape, it enthralled me. I was very surprised by the way things turned out, and it was probably the last thing I would have expected. The characters were truly portrayed well, and while I can say that I did not always agree with their actions, I was rooting for them the whole time. The language was beautiful, the romance was charming, yet frustrating at times. The ending left you yearning for more, and I cannot wait to read the conclusion. If you have not read this book, I strongly suggest you do."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I recently read this book for a book discussion group. Although it was wordy at times, I enjoyed it. I went on to read &quot;My Cousin Rachel&quot; by the same author, which is even better!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"***** awsome book! I totally enjoyed it, couldn't put it down. I wish I could visit Manderley..had to buy Rebecca's tale as soon as I finished Rebecca. Maxim De Winter was waaay to good for Rebecca anyway!! Daphne Du Maurier is an excellant story teller..I am gonna read this one again someday Im sure.."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I had to read this novel over my Thanksgiving week of 01' (I was behind, didn't start the book so I had to read 50 pages a day, wasting 2 hours :) At first I thought this is going to be one of those boring books like all books you have to read in English class. I started reading, boy, I couldn't believe how good this book was. Ms. Du Maurier always ends the chapter with maybe an ironic scene, which makes you push yourself to read what's going to happen next. Even though it's 380 pages long, it's a great book. I recommend you to read it."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"that was one of the best books that i have ever read."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"&quot;Last night i dreamt I went to Manderly again...&quot; and so the story begins. Daphne Du Maurier has woven &quot;Rebecca&quot; into one of the most captivating novels I have ever read. From the moment the main character is swept off her feet by an older man, and carried off to his wealthy estate, Manderly, until the last few pages of the novel--Du Maurier keeps the reader in a trance. The characters in her novel are intricate and personable, each with his or her own secret to reveal. There is a surprise around every corner, and a new twist in the plot when you least expect it. In addition to the ingenious story, &quot;Rebecca&quot; has captured the most briliant and ironic ending perhaps of all time."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I was assigned this book as part of my Sophomore Summer reading list. As with all assigned books, I did not look forward to reading it. But Rebecca surprised me. The charcters were very interesting, the plot was mysterious from the beginning as to why the title is the name of a person dead from the start, and it kept me wanting to know what was next the whole time. The ending was well hidden up to the moment they reveal Rebecca's fate and even had more up the sleeve after that! I do intend to read the sequel and hope it was as good as the last.p.s. Didn't you find the 2nd Mrs.de Winter a bit paranoid? Or maybe she just had a very active imagination, what with all those scenarios she kept thinking up?"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book was so well-written. I had to read it as a summer reading book for school, and I enjoyed it so much. It has a touch of mystery, and much suspense.I only wish there was a sequel to this beautiful book, I would read it immediately."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I remember reading this book in the 8th grade for a book report and had no clue what it was about. Needless to say I made up the report. Anyways a few years later I chanced upon it again and read and it made perfect sense. Sense that time Rebecca has been one of my most read and beloved novels. In a story of a young girl raised as the companion of a shrew of a woman she finds love in the most strangest of places, Monte Carlo. Her love is for a man who is old enough to be her father. When he asks her to marry him she says yes and is wisked away to England and the magestic house known as Manderley. However, this dream romance is far from what it seems to be. She must deal with the sinister maid of her husband's deceased wife and her lack of proper breeding that makes her ignorant to the ways of Manderley. Yet behind the face of this young girl's husband is a dark secret that is waiting to be revealed. In a truly interesting tale of murder and love this suspenseful novel will leave you guessing down to the very last page."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Although the book gets off to very slow start, readers must stick with it then it gets better."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I loved this book when I first read it in high school. It opened my eyes to a great author and a genre I had previously never enjoyed. I have read it 3 times and still enjoy it's depth, alive characters, and rich descriptions. It is a tad slow in the beginning but stick with it becuase it such a jewel to be treasured. See Hitchcock's film version for a different spin on the story too!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I admit I agreed with the reviewers who said the beginning was slow and they gave up. But if they had continued and finished the book, they would have realized what a fabulous book it really was! Absolutely wonderful, I must have closed the book and said &quot;wow.&quot; That's the word to describe it...WOW."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"For one of my classes we had to read a classic novel and I picked Rebecca because a friend had recommended it. The first of the book was a little over-done, but soon I could not even put it down. Rebecca is a well written romance-mystery novel and I highly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"this book was truely of of the best i have ever read. i fell in love with it at the first page. Daphne duMaurier captures the inoccesnceof youth in Maxin's new wife, and how strong love is. she wrote a web of character that you felt you knew and you can't help but feel sorry for. Mlle. duMaurier found an aboslutely perfect fit for the end to this story full of twists, turns, mystery and in the end true love. a spectaculare book that anyone will love."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book portrays the dramatic love story between a widower and a first bride. At the beginning, it started off slow, but when you get toward the end, it ties beautifully. Practically the best romance novel ever written. Also, the plot twisted into a unexpected ending. Well done, Mrs. DuMaurier!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Reading Rebecca was a class assignment that, at first, I did not think would be much fun. I proved myself wrong in this case. The ever-changing plot was wonderful. The nameless narrator did a great job telling the story from her point of view. It made you feel as if you were at Manderley with them. I have read a lot of good books, but I would have to call this one my very favorite. I, personally, cannot wait to read the sequel, Mrs. de Winter, by Susan Hill. I would definetely recommend this classic novel to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I have probably read hundreds of books in my life (a definite book-aholic) and Rebecca is my all-time favorite. I re-read it at least twice a year and I never get bored with the story. I believe that the reason why so many people (read: women) love this book so much is they see a piece of themselves in the story. Everyone has, at some time, felt they stood in another's shadow. Everyone has, at some time, felt they were haunted by memories. Rebecca touches a universal chord in people. Masterpeice Theater (PBS) did a wonderful production of Rebecca that can be purchased. I highly recommend viewing the presentation if you can find it on sometime."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I loved this book. I cannot stand romance novels. A teacher told me to pick it up for extra credit and I read it over night. I was struck by this story of love, decit, and murder. It was a page turner."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"The thing I love the most about &quot;Rebecca&quot; is the way the author tells the story. When I read it, I feel as if I'm at Manderley with the second Mrs. de Winter. Also, Daphne du Maurier never mentions the second Mrs. de Winter's name, and I think that is truly unique. This book has so many plot twists, that it makes one wonder how she got the idea for the story. This book is truly a classic."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I had to read this book for an English class, then I had to write an 8-page paper on it. The paper was due within a week, plus I had to read all 380 pages! Well, I thought it was going to be a chore, but to my surprise, I loved it! I just couldn't put the book down. The twists and turns totally keeps the reader interested. I'm not even going to sell the book back to the bookstore--I'm going to keep it and read it all the time. I can't say that about too many other books I've had to read for that class. Or any English class for that matter."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I loved this book. All I can say is that its a classic. It's got the perfect setting, interesting characters, and the twist at the end that just shocks you...you must read this! (FYI: If you really liked it, there's also a sequel out now by Susan Hill!)"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I loved this book. I can see how it would be tough for some people to get through, as it was VERY descriptive and not so thrilling at some parts. However, I became lost in Manderley. I felt like I was there, like I too, was jealous of the beautiful Rebecca. I was uptight when Mrs. Danvers was mentioned, and I yearned for Mr. De Winter's touch just as the main character did. Overall, a beautifully written book that is rightfully a classic."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Daphne knows how to write and make sure that you're in the book alongside her characters. A great story...actually a classic!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I love almost all of Du Maurier's work, but this is my absolute favorite. Her writing is so beautiful, vivid, and macabre... I felt like I was the \\"new\\" Mrs. de Winter inside Manderley. I was thinking her thoughts, feeling her insecurity, dying inside with each awkwardly intense situation. The twists and turns in the novel will keep you up at night. The Hitchcock film does not do this novel justice. Rebecca will haunt you... in a good way... in the best way. It is EXQUISITE."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I read this book for a book club. I would have never picked this book on my own, but I enjoyed it very much. Difficult to get into it at first, but after about 50 pages I was hooked. Hard to put down. The writing is not like anything I have read in current books. Very, Very descriptive. I wish it was available on Kindle!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Some called this book a gothic romance but it is so much more. You get immersed in the unfolding drama and complexity of characters and your feelings towards them.....or because they may represent some part of you."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"The first book in quite a while that I had trouble putting down. Takes you back to feelings you had when you were a young lady with a lot of insecurities. I loved how she described the setting of Manderley. A perfect blend of romance, psychological drama with a little bit of spooky thrown in. A fairly easy read. I watched Alfred Hitchcock's movie the next day which was good but I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as the book."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Like everyone here, I am a virtual slave to the book, Rebecca. Daphne du Maurier's story captured my imagination some 40 years ago and I never fail to fall under her spell whenever my eyes steal over the opening sentences of the book. But this is a review of the audiobook and why this is a marvelous marriage of prose and performer.It was pure serendipity that someone hired Anna Massey to read this magnificent tale. With her well-controlled voice and actor's talent, her becomes the overwhelmed heroine as well as the curt, unseeing de Winter. The heroine's unreasonable obsession becomes all the more believable when recounted with that cut-glass British accent. However, her performance as Mrs. Danvers is absolutely classic. I had the privilege of watching her play the sadistic Danvers in a 1979 mini-series and her performance even surpassed Judith Anderson's. It is no wonder the impervious chill of her video performance returns in this audio reading.So I can recommend this highly with only only caveat. If you are overburdened with imagination or tend to believe in what goes bump in the night, buy this product but enjoy the performance during the daylight hours or in the company of a friend. You don't want to hear Mrs. Danvers speaking during in the cold watches of the night. She will disturb your sleep."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"beautiful. simply beautiful. there is nothing more to it. this book is an all time great book and i could read it one thousand times and not get bored with it."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"The new Mrs. Max De Winter (who shall remain nameless) can't wait to begin her life as a young bride and newcomer to the renowned Manderley mansion on the Cornish coast. When she arrives she is put off by the housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, who is still devoted to Max's deceased first wife, Rebecca.If you visit the mansion of Manderley you will not find Rebecca there. You will find her spirit as she roams the hall and haunts the walls. The second Mrs. De Winter walks in Rebecca's shadow as she gets to know her husband and her surroundings. Rebecca and Mrs. De Winter are opposites, one shy and quiet, the other talkative and vivacious. Of course, the current wife feels she pales in comparison to the first. Evil is lurking in unexpected places as the house tries to keep its secrets and Mrs. De Winter is being pushed to her limit.Reading Rebecca for the first time is a unique and satisfying experience. The reader reaches a point in the book of shocked contentment and the book becomes an unstoppable page turner where you just aren't sure what will happen next. De Maurier does an excellent job of setting up the mystery, the suspense and the romance and when combined with a house that is a formidable character and with the nervousness of the nameless narrator, you have a winning combination. Rebecca will make the reader want to stay up all night reading under a blanket, holding a flashlight.Rebecca is a timeless Gothic masterpiece. From the first famous sentence, \\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.\\", to its last, Rebecca is unforgettable. A book to read again and again."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I am reading this again after many years and although I know the story from the movie too, the haunting description of Mandelay and the creeping insidiousness of Mrs Danvers doesn't disappoint. The naivite of the present Mrs De Winter is masterful as Du Maurier leads us into her obsession about the first Mrs De Winter, Rebecca. The story unravels at a good pace allowing the reader to comprehend the class conventions of the time and how the present Mrs De Winter, in British terms might not be \\"top drawer\\". A great read and a fantastic story, including that famous first line....."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book was terrific! I have never read a romance/mystery novel before and I loved it! The book was full of suspense and romance. The book almost resembled a scary movie in the sense that you think you know who the killer is until the very end when you are mystified by a plot twist. I could not put this book down, maybe it was because at times I felt as though I were standing in the room watching the main character or because I was so determined to find out what happened to Rebecca. I highly recommend reading this book! You'll want to read the sequel!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"It took me two tries reading this book, but I'm glad I finally finished it. The first chapter made me fall asleep and so did the second. Don't quit though once it gets rolling it is actually a very good book. You could feel what emotions the main character was feeling and it seems like you are her. The ending is excellent. It leaves you wandering and wanting more. I still can't believe the ending and I finished the book acouple of days ago. Read Rebecca, it's a book for all ages."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"A timeless place, a stifling air, a world of fascinating characters, cannot even begin to describe the world of priviledge and forboding that is so masterfully painted by Ms. Du Maurier. Her descriptive talent for painting words on a page literally breathe life into the Manderly Estate and you catch yourself walking among its misty setting within your imagination.Like a menacing fog, the claustophobic secrets of Manderly slowly reveal themselves and completely take you by surprise. The story is timeless, the issues could be ripped from today's headlines. Human emotion is ripe and in full bloom here as the suspense of human drama builds to a shattering climax. For a novel written so long ago, I was completely engrossed until the wee hours of the morning reading......Pondering......Guessing......Shocked!!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Ok, so I'm only thirteen. But this book displayed great detail and almost brought you into the the whole setting and gave you a great idea of what the author created these characters to be. An extremely well written novel about love, deceit, jealousy and truth that deserves to be read by many."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I was forced to read this book in one of my litature classes my sophomore year in college. I thought it looked horrible and sounded worse. I was so wrong. It is simply wonderful. I got completely lost in the story and the lives of all the characters. Now, almost four years later, I still find myself randomly thinking about the story and the people. It is one of the few stories that is timeless. It is unususal for me to like this kinds of book. I noramlly like adventures in far off, fantastic places. This book is not that. It is a good mistery, but more than anything, it is just a perfect example of story telling. Every word and detail is perfet for the overall effect. This is a must for ANY book lover's collection."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is positively the most overwrought book I have read since &quot;No Adam in Eden&quot; by Grace Metalious. I have read some of the author's short stories in the past, but this novel blew me away, with it's bodice-bursting tale of ludicrous passions and dark deeds on the windswept Cornish coast. This book has a great deal of suspense, but if you want to laugh at the heroine's weaknesses, you'll also find plenty of mean-spirited comedy. She crumbles again and again before the hired help, terrified of what they think of her underwear and hiding behind doors when they approach. Bette Davis's character in 'Dead Ringer' never had it so bad, and she deserved it, since she was a murderess. My only complaint is I wanted a more fantastic comeuppance for Mrs. Danvers after being so memorably rotten. What a great gift from Ms. DuMaurier. Read it and your friends will get sick of hearing about it."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I found this book in a box (a jumble) of books my Mother bought at a garage sale and had never heard of it. Several years went by before I finally picked it up. I won't go into any detail about the plot because what you don't read of it in the other reviews, you will want to discover for yourself if you will just read the first few haunting paragraphs! For by then I was in-escapably emersed in the authers web! Sufice it to say that I found myself truly wishing I had picked it up much sooner. I had had a treasure on the shelf and hadn't even known it. I only came to realize the height of celebrity the book had raised long after reading it. I still havn't seen the movie, but plan to do so soon"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"What's most excellent is that Rebecca, who's dead, is protrayed differently by the people who knew her. Yet the contrasting protraits is VERY rather fascinating because you wonder,&quot; Who is the REAL Rebecca?&quot;; because, each protrait is biased and less than accurate.The author's style reminds me of Margaret Mitchell's: excellent and good balance of characters, narrative, setting, description, plot, ...etc (yet both of them stand alone in their successes). The plot had such great twists, especially spooky ones, that I must admit, I stayed up quite late when I should have lett early for the SATs the next day. But I HAD to read it! The very slight love scenes were nicely done: less was certainly more, yet it still gave me warm chills."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I loved this book. I read it for a book club and put off starting it for several weeks. One of the most interesting things the author did was to never name the main character. It was very effective as a tool to keep her unimportant. She remained in the background of her own life. She let everyone, including her husband, keep her in the dark. By never assumming any status in her own home, and neglecting to ask even general questions of her husband's past marriage, she build a fantasy life that overshadowned her actual life.When her husband finally confided in her, her reaction was not what I expected. It was interesting how the reader is drawn in as her ally. I look forward to reading the sequel."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"On the edge of my seat excitement and suspense; thrilling and surprise ending. I would recommend this to anyone. Loved it !"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"classic story of a young girl marrying a mysterious man she barely knows. Complete with eerie characters and a lavish setting, this book left you asking question after question. Unfortunately, it dropped off with an open ending."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I'll never understand the 1 star reviews. This is one of my all-time favorite books, and anything else Daphne du Maurier writes is always amazing as well. This book haunted me for days the first time I read it. Yes, her characters have flaws, yes, you get frustrated with them, yes, there are cruel twists - is this not life? Rebecca is suspense at its realest and I absolutely adored it."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"After reading many more recent books where other reviewers made parallels to Rebecca, I felt like it was a gap in my reading list. I have been enjoying what I term \\"literary mysteries\\" for several years, many of which could also carry the \\"gothic\\" label, and this seemed to be a frequently cited model for the genre.This book, penned in the 1903s, presents an unnamed narrator who marries a man about whom she knows very little. The marriage thrusts her into an upper-class world that is unfamiliar and takes her to his famed estate, Manderley. The narrator feels haunted by the memories that her husband, townsfolk, and the staff (especially the head housekeeper) have of the husband's first wife, Rebecca. It is hard to say much more without creating spoilers of things that unfold towards the middle and end of the novel.I'm having more trouble than normal organizing my thoughts on Rebecca. I'm giving it four stars, although it definitely dragged. In many ways, it felt more like a \\"novel of manners\\" (throwback phrase from my English-major days) and a romance than a mystery. But I do think the subtlety of Rebecca's presence is very well done and much more realistically drawn than a lot of novels garnering the \\"gothic\\" label. It is a mental and emotional haunting, not a story of ghosts. I never developed a very firm opinion of the narrator, which may explain my hesitation on the four stars. But the prose, while lengthy, is quite lovely and held me through the whole story. I appreciated the was the author built the intrigue in a story that is largely about mental and emotional struggles (the \\"action\\" starts late). I also appreciate that the novel clearly lays a foundation for future works and for future women authors. Worth a read for book lovers captured by more recent titles who want to see a bit of their \\"roots\\" and have the patience for a slower paced read."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I read this book when I was in my teens, and at that time I found it very suspenseful . . . even though I wondered how and why the young female hero from whose point of view we see the events unfold could be so naive. The naive-woman-in-peril genre doesn't thrill me. Nevertheless, I couldn't put this book down, and I liked the ending, which was a twist upon a twist and very well done. I have no idea what I would think of this book if I read it today, when its style is so passe. I'm glad to see that it's still in print, because it's a classic."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"...almost as good as \\"Frenchman's Creek\\" and \\"The House on the Strand\\" which are my DuMaurier favorites. Definitely a 5 star novel!I just got the book \\"Blind Windows\\" by Edwina Levin MacDonald via Inter Library Loan and was in vain searching for ANY slight similarities with \\"Rebecca\\". The book was sooo boring (it takes place in New Orleans) that I stopped after 50 pages. There are some old books from the early forties or thirties that are definitely worth reading like \\"The Woman in Red\\" by Anthony Gilbert or \\"The Blank Wall\\" by Elizabeth Sanxony Holding and even \\"Now Voyager!\\" by Olive Higgins Prouty, but \\"Blind Windows\\" surely is not one of those, believe me: it is plain boring. Period.After 50 pages of Southern atmosphere I finally gave up (what a waste of time!), because my hope to discover anything that reminds of \\"Rebecca\\" was not fulfilled.So now I can understand all that fuss about plagiarism (sp?) even less, because it does not even have any similarities with \\"Rebecca\\".And even if the similarities would start showing up somewhere on page 100+, why did Mrs. MacDonald even bother suing Daphne DuMaurier for plagiarism???\\"Blind Windows\\" was released in 1927 (was it even released in the UK?...as far as I know DuMaurier never put her foot on American soil before the late forties when her American publisher invited her to the US...but o.k. lets suppose she got a worn out copy of \\"Blind Windows\\" while she was in Egypt with her husband in the mid thirties and homesick for Cornwall and got a little inspired by this novel...who cares???).So by the time \\"Rebecca\\" was published (1938), Mrs. MacDonald had already sold her book many many times and it was rather unlikely that the publication of \\"Rebecca\\" took any readers/profit away from her.Read \\"Rebecca\\", don't waste your time and money on this one (or only request it at the public library)."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is a great example of excellent and timeless writing. Daphne du Maurier's story is suspenseful with plenty of well-thought out characters who give us a look into the life of the old English elite. How does a young bride find her place at the Manderley mansion as the second Mrs. de Winter? We watch as she stumbles through her early weeks at Manderley and tries to acquire Rebecca's grace, please her husband, and earn the respect of the household staff and Maxim's friends and family. All the while staying far away from the menacing Mrs. Danvers. The plot develops into an exciting twist of events that keep you reading enthusiastically straight to the finish.Mr. and Mrs. de Winter are very busy and keep to an active schedule, but it is all leisure. I especially enjoyed the descriptions of the lavish tea-times. How funny to think of people living this way!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"My original review on my account at www.goodreads.com:This was a book club book, and definitely not one that I would have picked up on my own.After reading the first two chapters, I thought for sure I was going to be bored out of my mind. They are overly descriptive, but without giving any information about the characters themselves. And it was driving me crazy that the main character didn't have a name yet - although by the end of the book I'd forgotten about that particular annoyance until I read the note by the author explaining that she never did think of a good name for her.The book ended up being a lot better than expected. The author had me convinced that things would work out a certain way, but the character who I thought would be \\"to blame\\" turned out to be completely innocent. And I actually think I prefer the author's version! It was very well done, everything fit together so nicely. And I especially loved how Ben being told he would be put in an asylum if he ever said anything ended up blowing up in the face of Mr. Favell. I love it when books do that and totally throw me for a loop.The writing is still a bit flowery for me to be entirely happy with the book - I think it could have been written in about half the number of pages. And all the parts about her life at Manderley seemed pretty unnecessary, but I guess it was just to give the reader a long time to make up what we believe the relationship between Max and Rebecca to have been. I hope to read this again someday, knowing what I know about the ending, to see if there are any events that I interpret differently."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is a hauntingly great story. The first thing I did when I read the very last sentence was to start from the beginning and reread the first chapter. It is one of those books that makes you think about it after it ends. What a Classic."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"****Warning: SPOILERS****The Rebecca of DuMaurier's novel is more ambiguous than her film counterpart. Though in film and book she is revealed to us by the self-interested (and justifying) second Mrs. De Winter, there are sufficient departures to create a more complex dead woman. One is sorrier for her in the book than in the film, but the film condenses much, leaving less time for reflection, tempting quick judgment.I don't think it was mentioned in the film, but \\"Danny\\" Danvers, the maid of the film, in book and film alike clinging to Rebecca's clothes, pillowcases, and other finery with evident homoerotic longing, is the woman who raised Rebecca from birth. She tells what a \\"beauty\\" Rebecca was from the age of 12. Rebecca had no mother, just Danvers. Insert your own conclusions. Favell, as in the film, is introduced as Rebeccca's \\"first cousin,\\" but while this seemed like a euphemism for a returning lover, in the book he is confirmed as a first cousin with whom she probably had a sexual relationship. The whiff of something verging on incest is strong in both cases. Certain subtleties, like Maxim's remark that at any party there were a few others, or in a particular instance a half dozen \\"persons\\" that Rebecca took to her cottage to spend the nights, and the parallel of Rebecca in trousers to \\"a boy with the face of a Boticelli angel,\\" strongly suggest the character's bisexuality. With all the priggishness of 1938 Maxim assures us \\"Rebecca...was not even normal.\\" Going back and reading the first chapter (as anyone must upon reading the last page) the second Mrs. DeWinter seemed smug, bratty, naive.A note on the doctor visited at the end of the Hitchcock version, to find out if Rebecca was pregnant on the night of her death. In the film he is shown in lurid shadows, as if to suggest the character's need of a dispenser of anti-biotics, birth control and perhaps even abortion after her many debauches. In the book, he is a reputable physician operating in daylight. Rebecca only saw him once, to confirm her mortal illness (uterine cancer). Danvers, with the confidence of her intimate relationship with Rebecca, whatever it may have been, assures everyone that Rebecca was \\"above all that.\\" Her acts with her cousin notwithstanding, one wonders about Rebecca's true identity, sexual or otherwise. I even found myself wondering whether she might have been gay. Rebecca disclosed something to Maxim on Day 5 of their marriage that turned it into a \\"deal\\" and \\"arrangement.\\"I was also very dissapointed to read that in the book Maxim shot Rebecca dead in the heart, at close range. In the film it was an accident, and I could sympathize with him and his bride as a result. But Max -- good family name notwithstanding, it's called a DIVORCE. Why kill her?"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"With only the title and cover in mind, Daphne du Maurier's novel Rebecca could easily be mistaken for a sappy romance novel filled with love triangles, beautiful women, and implausible scenarios. Fortunately, it is not. Beginning with the first line, \\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again\\" (1), you become a captive of this magnificent piece of literature, captivated by its suspense, romance, and intrigue as we follow a young woman battle the past to make herself known in her own home.Set on the Cornish coast in England in the 1920's, the novel revolves around Manderley, the beautiful, isolated estate of Mr. Maxim de Winter. Our narrator, whose first name is unknown throughout the novel, meets and quickly marries the recently widowed Mr. de Winter. When they arrive at Manderley after their honeymoon, the young bride becomes consumed by the apparently unforgettable life of the late first Mrs. de Winter, the stunning Rebecca. Although she has been dead for over a year, nothing at Manderley has been altered. Much of the estate remains exactly as it has been since the night she mysteriously disappeared into the clutches of the sea. While the second Mrs. de Winter tries her best to acclimate to this new, proper world, having been only a companion to a wealthy woman traveling in France, she finds herself constantly comparing herself to Rebecca, self-conscious and timid beneath the searing eyes of Mrs. Danvers, Rebecca's personal maid who still runs Manderley and is constantly making her feel like an intruder in her own home.\\"Something, in the expression of her face, gave me a feeling of unrest, and even when she had stepped back, and taken her place amongst the rest [of the servants], I could see that black figure standing out alone, individual and apart, and for all her silence I knew her eye to be upon me.\\" (67)The second Mrs. de Winter becomes a slave to Rebecca, terrified of disturbing the spirit who still controls Manderley.\\"She was in the house still as Mrs. Danvers had said, she was in that room in the west wing, she was in the library, in the morning-room, in the gallery above the hall. Even in the little flower-room, where her mackintosh still hung. And in the garden, and in the woods, and down in the stone cottage on the beach. Her footsteps sounded in the corridors, her scent lingered on the stairs. The servants obeyed her orders still, the food we ate was the food she liked. Her favourite flowers filled the rooms. Her clothes were in the wardrobes in her room, her brushes were on the table, her shoes beneath the chair, her nightdress on her bed. Rebecca was still the mistress of Manderley.\\" (233)As the novel progresses and the second Mrs. de Winter begins to resent the world she is trapped within, Rebecca's, she digs deeper into the secrets of Manderley and the real fate of the first Mrs. de Winter.There is no doubt that Rebecca is a masterpiece. Daphne du Maurier's writing caresses the tongue as Beethoven's Ninth Symphony caresses one's ears. Its chilling plot, vivid characters, and superb descriptions draw you into Manderley's immense halls, and you feel as though you are by the second Mrs. de Winter's side as she uncovers the secrets of Manderley and its former mistress - secrets that were never supposed to surface again. Although the very beginning of the novel was a little slow, the plot quickly thickens and you become completely enthralled. Filled with brilliant language, stirring emotion, and nearly unbearable suspense, Rebecca is sure to have you wide awake into the wee hours of morning. I would highly recommend this novel, without any reservations, to anyone in search of an intriguing classic that can be read dozens of times without ever becoming old."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"It's funny how much of an impact someone can make on everyone around them. When Rebecca de Winter died, people were in shock. She was the perfect woman to run Manderley, the estate of Maxim de Winter. She was beautiful, clever, charming, and a great friend to everyone... except for those her knew her all too well. Although she was such a bold woman, no one expected Rebecca to hold such a lasting impression at Manderley. When Mr. de Winter brought home a new wife, people weren't quit sure what to say. Why, this young bride was nothing like the previous Mrs. de Winter! But, for those who adored Rebecca, they needn't worry. Rebecca would live on. In the halls and rooms of Manderley and in the minds of all her acquaintances. Manderley was Rebecca's, and nothing could take that away from her. Not even her own death. One woman. One house. One widowed husband. One blushing bride. Many memories that won't die. It all adds up to an extraordinary novel that will have you on the edge of your comfy reading chair until the very last word..."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I remember reading this book in the 8th grade for a book report and had no clue what it was about. Needless to say I made up the report. Anyways a few years later I chanced upon it again and read and it made perfect sense. Sense that time Rebecca has been one of my most read and beloved novels. In a story of a young girl raised as the companion of a shrew of a woman she finds love in the most strangest of places, Monte Carlo. Her love is for a man who is old enough to be her father. When he asks her to marry him she says yes and is wisked away to England and the magestic house known as Manderley. However, this dream romance is far from what it seems to be. She must deal with the sinister maid of her husband's deceased wife and her lack of proper breeding that makes her ignorant to the ways of Manderley. Yet behind the face of this young girl's husband is a dark secret that is waiting to be revealed. In a truly interesting tale of murder and love this suspenseful novel will leave you guessing down to the very last page."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This suspenseful novel is, by a long shot, Daphne DuMaurier's most popular. The realistic character development, the complex relationships and the thickening plot makes it an enjoyable novel. As the book goes on, the reader's curiosity for this mystifying character, Rebecca, grows. However, the reader is lead in the wrong direction at first and thus is very surprised at the shocking news that is discovered. As the book draws to an end you become anxious for the main character. Sympathy is given to Mrs. De Winter and then thrilling information is revealed as all the puzzle pieces fit together. This novel is surely an incredible experience; I encourage all to read it (if you can stand your heart beating and fast paces)"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I think the book is good. The story is about Maxim de Winter, a rich man, who goes to Monte Carlo and who marries a quite young woman there. He takes her back to his lovely country home, Manderley. But in Manderley there is still the ghost of his first wife Rebecca who destroys the happiness of the couple. The autor had a very good idea, to start with the end of the story. Like that the book gets a special touch. But apart from that the beginning of the book is a little bit ardious and boring to read. But it becomes better and better up to the final scene which is very exciting which isn't a happy-end. The whole book is filled with emotions and unexpected expressions.The variation of feelings of the unknown narrator are descripped in a way which allows the reader to go into this person and to feel with her. The feelings change from love to hatred. The book also shows how soon that hapiness can be destroyed and what it means to be compared the whole time with a perfect person, even though that the course of the book shows that there doesn't existe a perfect person without a mistake in the world. I think it the book would be better when the beginning would be shortened and instead of that to embellish the end."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"To be blunt, &quot;Rebecca&quot; is a romance and a murder mystery rolled into one. Just to make sure, I must tell you that I never read romances. I did however make an exception for this book due to its unique qualities.&quot;Rebecca&quot; isn't a very romantic book at first. Our young, gauche heroine (whose name is never actually given) is suddenly proposed marriage by the brooding owner of the beautiful estate of Manderley, Maximilian de Winter. Her mind is abuzz - what does this dark brooding man find in her - a young, maladroit nobody - but cautiously accepts his offer and moves to his enourmous estate.At this point the book gains something akin to momentum: the entire body of the great palace is permeated by the influence of Maximilian's late wife - Rebecca, and our heroine lives in her shadow, far too afraid to confide in her distanced husband. She feels that everyone is scrutinizing her - relatives, servants; in her mind she constantly compares herself to Rebecca - a brilliant, charismatic woman everyone loved to death - but was that all there was to her?If this book is beginning to sound interesting to you - take caution. I can't say that it's not a masterpiece - but the plot moves very slowly and the pages are peppered with vivid descriptions and confusing sentence structures. Also, several others who read the book expressed concerns that several of the characters aren't fully developed (something I never noticed), and that the relationships between the major characters aren't as realistic as they would like (a claim that is at least partly true).If you want to read a quality romance that isn't cliche and has appeal to fans of other genres, you might wish to give &quot;Rebecca&quot; a chance."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I didn't notice for a long while that the main character in this book goes nameless for it's entirety. It dawned on me one day as I was trying to relate the story to a friend and kept stumbling over pronouns. I love the fact that DuMaurier at some points refers to her as having \\"such a lovely christian name\\" but then of course never reveals it. The story is really one of the best she ever wrote. The brilliance of keeping her protagonist nameless through out, makes the presence of the long dead Rebecca even more sinister. And of course Mrs. Danvers is one of the best villainesses to ever be put to ink. A classic must read."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"The tagline of this book, \\"the classic tale of romantic suspense\\", is rather misleading. False advertisement, if you will. It's not a romance novel. Perhaps, some readers see it that way, but I most certainly do not. Yes, there is a love interest, but there isn't much romance. It's really a mysterious and intense ghost story without a ghost, as told through the eyes of a psychologically flawed young woman.I am told that the opening line of this novel is quite famous. \\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.\\" Maybe that line ropes in some readers, but not me. I found the first couple of chapters confusing and disorienting. Perhaps that is the author's intention -- to disorient the reader before placing her in a surreal time and place. I don't know. But, after five chapters, I found my footing and really got into the book.At the beginning of the story, the narrator accompanies an older American woman who is traveling in Monte Carlo. There, the narrator meets a gentleman, who eventually asks her to marry him. She accepts and then moves into Manderley, the home haunted by the ghost of the gentleman's late wife. Except that there isn't really a ghost, and that makes the book even creepier.Du Maurier masterfully creates an intensely eerie atmosphere full of mystery that verges on horror. The driveway to Manderley isn't just a driveway, it's a serpent. The grounds of Manderley don't just have some flowers, they are rhododendrons of a slaughterous red. Mrs. Danvers isn't introduced simply as the head of the household staff. She is \\"someone tall and gaunt, dressed in deep black, whose prominent cheek-bones and great, hollow eyes gave her a skull's face, parchment-white, set on a skeleton's frame.\\"The words simmer slowly in your mind and insidiously place you in the mind of the highly anxious and frightened narrator. The characterization is spot on. Our young female narrator begins as a typical youth, anxious to please, uncertain, and self-conscious - traits that are somewhat relatable. But then, du Maurier inches the characterization outside the realm of normal so slowly that you almost don't notice it until you've been inside the head of a psychologically disturbed woman for the past hundred pages.I highly recommend this well-written novel. The mystery and tension are layered so thickly that reading about a ringing telephone actually made me jump just as much as in a horror movie. Crafting that level of intensity is no easy feat, and du Maurier has done so masterfully."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book, in my opinion, is the best book of Daphne Du Maurier. I have already read it about 25 years ago (in a printed format) and now decided to read it again. The characters in the book have been described as if you live amongst them, and the drama and secrets around it are amazingly constructed. Highly recommended reading!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca, I have to admit, did not enchant me from the very first page. It took a number of chapters for the plot to kick in, but when it did, it was definitely worth the wait. What struck me most about Rebecca was its' writing. Du Maurier writes very, very well. Her writing is so descriptive and poetic, always. The story itself begins to unfold when the main protagonist is swept away from Monte Carlo, when ask by Maxim de Winter to marry him. She arrives at Manderley, finding it a mysterious place. There is a lot of mystery and suspense in this book, and a massive twist of events in the middle.I had to read Rebecca for school, and at first i didn't like it, because it was very descriptive, with an un-exciting plot, which isn't a good mix, for me. But when the plot became so suspenseful, that you had to keep reading, one finds that the writing helps to complement the scene being described.I'd recommend Rebecca to anyone ages 13 and up.Give it a try, you're guaranteed to love it..."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"What an incredible book! This novel has been on my list of books to read for years and I can't believe I didn't read it earlier! I'd feared it would be pretentious and filled with flowery language that would bore me to tears, but it was absolutely the opposite. This modern classic is the tale of a young bride haunted by the ghost of her husband's first wife, the gorgeous and perfect Rebecca de Winter. From the opening line, \\"Last night, I dreamt I went to Manderly again,\\" I was hooked. Du Maurier writes beautifully and her storyline is riveting. She includes sinister characters, a haunting tale, and shocking twists, all the ingredients for a page-turner. This novel is a must-read and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I have read many of the other online reviews for this book, so I won't be redundant repeating the outstanding aspects of this book - its visual sense of place, rich symbolism, wonderful character development of the narrator, surprising plot twists, and excellent craftsmanship throughout. There are a few aspects about Maxim, though, that bothered me. I am supposed to somehow be 'on his side' in this book, but I found this increasingly more difficult, as he erodes his character's intelligence by falling into one foolish decision after another. His first and most colossal blunder takes place on a high hill in Monte Carlo, when he deliberately sacrifices his personal happiness by making a conscious choice in favor of his socialite standing. And so he sets himself up from the beginning for a one-way trip to hell. After he arrives at that destination, he allows Mrs. Danvers to continue haunting the west wing of Manderley, which remains a morbid museum to his first dead wife, and somehow he doesn't think that's creepy. Even worse, he leaves undisturbed that cottage on the beach, complete with its cobweb-covered furnishings and horrifying memories, when any sane person would have had that sinister shack bulldozed immediately. This is the framework for his worst decision yet: He decides to take the new Mrs. deWinter back to Manderley, the very place where all his nightmares lie in wait, Why? He believes that his love for the place will somehow conquer all its demons. Sentimental childhood home or not, a more sensible person would have sold the place immediately and moved on. Then to somehow expect his second wife, a shy, waif-like doe of a girl, to try to fit in there and not get creeped out herself, seems incredibly shortsighted and dense for a man of 40+ years. I think his most brilliant line in the whole book is when he laments, \\"Oh why did we ever come back here?\\" Why indeed. Personally, I think Du Maurier did those two a favor by what happens to Manderley at the end of the book. One can only hope that Maxim's decisions will now be more sensible, and that perhaps the second Mrs. DeWinter will finally get to experience some well-deserved happiness. All this being said, I do realize, of course, that if Maxim had had more brains in the first place, this haunting novel couldn't have been written."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This item was listed as a hardcover book but it was actually a paperback version that had a hard cover put on it.

I read it in one day when I should have been doing other things, but I kept saying just one more chapter, until I reached the end. I recommend that other readers try (and are prepared) to read the book straight through. It's rare (for me) to find a novel that's so well written that I just cannot put it down.The plot is terrific and develops quickly (I won't give anything away), the main characters are very well drawn, and the writing style is beautiful. Given it's age, I thought it might feel dated and remote - not at all - but the reader does have to feel, at least not antagonistic, towards the life-style of the English aristocracy more than fifty years ago.

Rebecca, Maxim's late wife, whose shadow the narrator walks in, becomes the one person who can shatter her newly found happiness. Rebecca's death still holds mystery but the truth has its ways of being known. I thought the book to be thrilling and compelling, keeping you at the edge of your seat with each turn of the page.

It's all in the narrator's head, just her own endless, causelessly fearful flights of fancy, which makes her very difficult to like, or even sympathize with.

Oh, and Mrs. Danvers has got to be one of the lamest beloved villains in all of literature...why the hell didn't they just give her the sack several times over?The whole thing was rather boring, absurd, and pointless. Apart from the plot and character inconsistencies, it is decently written, and it is quite effective in places---but it isn't remotely in the same league as gothic novels like Jayne Eyre or the sensation novels of Wilkie Collins in whose tradition it is often placed.Two and a half stars."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Although the story begins slowly, (due to Du Maurier's painstakingly descriptive writing style), it nevertheless vividly sets the dark and gloomy atmosphere that pervades Manderly, the ancestral home of the hero, Max de Winter who is tormented by a dark secret.This is an excellent novel for those students of early 20th century British society and mores, and for those who like a good \\"who done it\\"."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This has always been one of my favorite books.

I am planning to read this book again! :)"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"cool, classy, romy, sleek, sheeck, scary"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I have only read about 3/4 of the book so far and i am now unable to put it down!! it is an excellent and also confusing gothic novel but very good a good one to help let your imagination run wild!!!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"rebecca is the string of the book and the character i like most is Rebecca. she is featured as a witted and cunning woman and everyone was under her shadow.But, through the book, we can see that people around her admired her so much that even if she died, she took control of the Mandelly. i like her."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I THOUGHT THIS WAS A BORING NOVEL AT THE BEGINNING BECAUSE SHE JUST DESCRIBED THE FLOWERS AT MANDERLEY . AFTER SHE GOT AWAY FROM MRS. VAN HOPPER THINGS STARTED CHANGING. WHENEVER SHE GOT MARRIED TO MAXIM I THOUGHT THAT IT A LITTLE NEAT BECAUSE AS I SAW SHE WAS KNOW LIVING HER DREAM OF GOING TO MANDERLEY. I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN SHE'S ALL BY HERSELF WITHOUT MAXIM BECAUSE HE HAS GONE TO LONDON OR WITH FRANK.WHENEVER THEY HAD THE FANCY DRESS BALL I THOUGHT IT WAS NEAT. MRS. DANVERS GAVE HER THE IDEA. SHE IS SO WICKED WITH HER COLD SELF.I'M REALLY GLAD THAT NO ONE FOUND OUT ABOUT MAXIM , BECAUSE I THINK THAT REBECCA REALLY DESERVED IT EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL PERSON INSIDE AND OUT.I THOUGHT IT A STRANGE TWIST WHEN THE ENDING WAS A HAPPY ENDING. IT WAS SUCH A GREAT BOOK.I LOVED IT."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book is extremely thick, just a warning. The beginning is really slow moving and you may find yourself reading through it painstakingly. But towards the end, you can hardly stay in your seat. The story gets interesting and more mysterious by the moment. Daphne DuMaurier is da'bomb!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I think it\`s a good book. Not the best I\`ve ever read, but really good. I like the fact that in the middle of the booky you notice suddenly all is different from what you have thought. I was really surprised that Rebecca was such an unkind person! And that Maxim never loved her. I think the end of the book is also really good, because the whole book deals with events that have never happened when Manderley, Maxim\`s house, isn\`t so important for Maxim any more. And at the end, Manderley burns down.But sometimes the book is a little boring. There are a lot of long dialogues that aren\`t really exiting. They are much too long!But I still liked reading that book."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"My opinion about the book Rebecca isn't very good but not very bad either. I think Rebecca is a very interesting and a thrilling story. But sometimes I had a lot of problems to understand who did what and who is who. I think the reason for this is because I didn't understand everything. But the book is still worth reading and gripping for anyone who understands a little bit of English."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"All in all I liked reading Rebecca. It was interesting, but not always. There were also boring passages. But I liked reading it because it's a thrilling story. Sometimes I had little problems with the different persons in the book, so I didn't really always know who was who. Otherwise I didn't find it very different to understand."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Although I was I was bored at the author's rather lavish detail of surrounding landscape, I have to admit that this book read very well. I would recommend it to anyone who can handle being bored for a while until the book finally catches your attention, which it certainly will, half-way through the book."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Can you believe it? A hardback is supposed to be a special edition, not a cheap paperback. Of course my girlfriend opened her gift to find the pages were cut off along the top. Hard to believe."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Does anyone need a review of this classic .... It is the best description of human emotions set under mysterious surroundings ..."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"The story is not bad and some scenes are exciting but after all the settings seemed too strange and the story too constructed for me. Also the characters are a little wierd, for example Ms Daver's only function is to walk through the castle and to be mysterious. It's just not the kind of books I like reading."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book is very dry, and dull until you reach chapter 22, then it gets more intersting. But unless you want to read that much, I don't recamand this book."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book, was a required summer reading book, which I had to read. At first I thought I would never enjoy it, I mean come on, it was written in 1938. The first chapter was horrible! But it got way better! Daphne Du Maurier, is an excellent writer, she made the book VERY intresting! I felt like I was Mrs. De Winter. I was tottally shocked to find out that Maxim murdered, Rebecca, but I still loved Max. I hated Mrs. Danvers, when she had that little scene where she screamed at her. I was devestated when she came down the stairs, in the outfit, and Maxim yelled at her. The parts I didn't like were the fact Mrs. de Winter didn't have a name, and the ending didn't corespond with the begining!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"An incredibly thin story. The author spends most of the pages descibing things as perfectly as she can which, as you should expect, is very tiresome to read."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I'm sorry, but I hadn't even read the first 50 pages yet, and I was bored stiff reading this book. People told me that it doesn't get better until towards the end, but who wants to wait until then to get to the good part. In my opinion, a good book should get you interested right away, if not then, then at least SOMETIME in the first chapter."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Even as a high school English teacher, this book was a little too wordy, and the climax wasn't really that great. If I were to rewrite this book, I would take out a word or two a sentence to shorten the book and Miss DuMaurier could have used some more events rather than just the second Mrs. DeWinter comparing herself to Rebecca, Maxim's first wife. The Ben character was underused, and Mrs. Danvers could have been more sinister. That is why I gave this book 1 Star."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read! Pages and pages of detail with no real story. I would never inflict this book on anyone."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book is, without question, the most boring peace of literature ever written. It makes the technical manual to my VCR look like \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\". In fact, it's so boring that I recommend a new synonym for boring, \\"Rebecca\\". The book is about people who have disgustingly unbelievable personalities, who do really boring things, and make up mysteries about killing people that aren't even in the story, then insist on telling you about it. The main character/narrator is the most overly emotional and sappy person in all of fiction, and could never ever be a real person, even in the 1920s when this book takes place. She insists on telling you about all of her problems, and how she can never \\"feel right\\" at Manderly, even though no sane person could EVER care. It's enough to make you sick. The story really wasn't that bad but it could have easily been told in about 1/10 of the amount of time. It's like Dickens description without everything that makes Dickens good. Even after the thousands of atrocities committed by Hitler, I still consider him to be a great man, for burning THIS book. It's that bad."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"i tried to read this book but i couldn't even get past the 1st chapter!!!!!!i wish i could have given this book no stars but the least amount of stars was one."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I found this book very long, drawn out and boring. It was far from realistic, and I found the characters flat and lifeless. The story was unbelievable and it's hard to stay interested - I wish I DIDN'T have to read this for school!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I tried on two seperate occasions to read this book. The first time, six months ago, I didn't finished the first 100 pages. The second time, I got up to page 134 and quit. This book couldn't hold my interest for very long. There is too much detail written and not enough plot. I would not recommed this book to anyone. It is in my bag of books to take the used book store for trade."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book is terrible. The whole thing could be summed up with &quot;I'm depressed. Boo hoo.&quot; Need I say more?"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I had to read this book for school and I couldn't get through the first five chapters. They were so boring and very un-interesting. What I had to end up doing is skip a few chapters ahead and read from there. Even then though I had to force myself to read it. Not enjoyable at all."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I started this book and read about 10 pages. The whole time, the author was going off about the different kinds of plants which grew in this garden, and I didn't even know who the narrator was, and where the garden was. It was so boring and confusing that I did not read on. It probably gets much better, but I was not inspired to read more that I did."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"When the narrator (Name unknown) overwhelmingly accepts Maxim De Winter's unanticipated marriage preposal, she finds herself in a horrible nightmare as the new \\"Mrs. De Winter\\" of the enchanting home of Manderley. It is in her new high rank as the head mistress of Manderley that she undergoes the many harships of replacing the notorious, beautiful, and powerful, late wife of Maxim's, Rebecca. Du Maurier beautifully crafts her heroine, touching on each and every painstaking moment she must endure of being the \\"replacement.\\" The surrealness of Manderley, the timelessness of the characters, and an unforgettable twisting climax, all contribute to this stories ease of capturing every reader's heart. The love I have for this story stretches far beyond this simple summary. Read it; and don't tell me you loved it, because I already know you will."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"My mother insisted that I read Rebecca while in high school. I fell under its spell and have remained there ever since. I reread it about once a year. It remains ever spellbinding. Thirty years later, it is still on my top ten list."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This novel tells the story of a naive young woman (whose name is never mentioned) traveling in Monte Carlo as the companion to an older woman. In the dining room of the hotel, she meets the brooding Maxim de Winter, who is taking some time off after the apparent suicide of his wife. He takes a fancy to her and after a whirlwind romance, they wed.After a long honeymoon, they return to Maxim's family estate, Manderley. Almost immediately, the second Mrs. de Winters begins to feel her inadequacy. She thinks the staff look down on her as a common girl, which is further re-inforced by the contemptuous looks from the first Mrs. de Winters' personal maid, Mrs. Danvers. And, then there is the presence of Rebecca -- the first Mrs. de Winters. She seems to be everywhere, and the new Mrs. de Winters constantly feels that she needs to live up to her popularity with the staff and the people of the town.Through a series of disastrous events, the second Mrs. de Winters learns the truth about Rebecca's death and in the process grows into a stronger person.This wonderful novel is full of twists and turns that leave the reader wanting more. Du Marier's characters are all well-drawn, especially the sinister Mrs. Danvers. The story gets a bit melodramatic at times, but that can easily be overlooked because of the age of the story.Still a page-turner well worth reading."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book is my favourite of all time! This is a mystery masterpiece. I cannot do justice to it in my own words, except to say that I really felt I was in the nameless heroine's place as she discovers new intricacies every day. 'Last night, I dreamt I went to Manderley again ...'"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I have been reading this book with a mixture of annoyance and expectation. Probably this was the aim of the writer, because even if this nameless main character reveals herself as an extremely weak and complaining woman you cannot help but keep on reading to see how it ends. There is the husband, Maxim, who apparently seems to be cold and detached, but you somehow feel that something is killing him from the inside. Mrs. Denvers, on the other hand, is a woman you cannot find hard to hate. She is the devil behind a servant's eyes; the obsessed and crazy character. It is basically the story of abovementioned woman, who marries Maxim: a very rich widower and moves to his estate, Manderly to be confronted with the memory of his beautiful and successful deceased wife, Rebecca. After enduring her crazed self-pity for half of the book, sympathizing with the husband, who is not rejecting her despite of her unbelievably moaning and childish behaviour; while hoping that Mrs, Danvers falls down the stairs breaking her neck, the reader finally comes to the last couple of chapters and the story gets interesting. You end up eating the last pages like you are starving only to be confronted with a quite dull end. I am quite disappointed by this book."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I don't do well with novels where the women are portrayed as subservient femme fatales. There is also a lot of internal dialogue where the main character is talking to herself for several pages at a time. Not a fan of that either. That being said, I respect how well written the book was, and enjoyed the story itself."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"The unnamed protagonist of \\"Rebecca\\" is the young second-wife of the aristocrat Maxim de Winter, a widower of barely eleven months and owner of the famed estate Manderley. We meet our protagonist in Monte Carlo, where she is employed as the companion to a busy-body dowager, on the day of her first meeting with Maxim de Winter. From the beginning, duMaurier is constant with her characterization of the narrator: she is a thoughtful and anxious dreamer, painfully aware of her lower-class station and aspiring for true and ardent love. Upon her marriage to Mr. de Winter and their arrival in Manderley, she is preoccupied with the mystery of Rebecca, the first Mrs. de Winter.\\"Rebecca\\" is a slow-paced, yet engaging, mystery novel concentrating on the circumstances of Rebecca's death and the hold she has on the inhabitants of Manderley. duMaurier writes beautiful, vivid prose (albeit occasionally purple) with much description fixated on Manderley's landscape. \\"Rebecca\\" reads like Henry James, however our narrator is nowhere as a vivacious as a James heroine."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"A can't put it down, page turner of a book. If this book were a flower it would be a hothouse flower, if it were a color it would be a supersaturated fuchsia or magenta. As I read, I am transported back in time to Manderley where I watch, trapped by my anxious curiosity and battle with morality, as the story unfolds in a jumble of reality and fantasy born of obsession and insecurity. Fabulously fulfilling!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca tells the story of Mandalay, a house in the English countryside that is haunted by the memory of Rebecca, Maxim De Winter's first wife. Maxim has remarried yet neither he nor anyone he knows can forget the beautiful and alluring Rebecca. This makes life almost unbearable for Maxim's new wife. The most interesting aspect of this book is that the main character, the second Mrs De Winter, has no name. Given that the story is told from her perspective there is really no need to have one.The book was most famously adapted for the big screen by Alfred Hitchcock in 1940. Anyone can see why. This book has all characteristics of a classic Hitchcock film - an innocent in peril, a frustrated love, a creepy villain and a sense of something sinister lurking just beneath the surface. The novel is set in the 1930s and much of the story's twists and turns owe their plausibility to that era. Without giving too much away, many of the plotlines would have turned out differently had forensic evidence been available at that time. I enjoyed this book primarily because of the quality of the writing - it is first rate. Rebecca is an excellent read."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is a book narrated by a girl just barely out of her teenage years. In spite of that, it's a book for adults, too. The poor Mrs. De Winter is thrown into a whirlwind of society and class with which she's completely unfamiliar. She's suddenly expected to be beautiful, classy, and clever right off the bat. Du Maurier excellently portrayed Mrs. De Winter's thoughts throughout the novel. Even though they never mentioned her first name, Du Maurier still was able to sculpt the heroine into a lovely character.I never once had to force myself to read this book. The suspense to see what would happen next had me reading whenever I could pick up the book. Just when I thought things were settling down, some new twist would have me reading with my nose practically touching the paper. I couldn't set it down!The characters were anything but black and white. They were more detailed then any non-biography books I've read. Sometimes, I'd be turned around and be irritated with the protagonists and sympathizing with the villains. The villains were well developed as well, not just the normal brute force \`I kill you now', but they're sly and deceitful, and you can never see their next blow until it was too late.Now that I've praised the characters completely, I actually do have one critical thing to say about Mrs. De Winter. It annoyed me that she was so groveling. She just allowed everyone to walk all over her, and she didn't say a word about it. It would've been nice for her to have been able to stand up to someone at least once before the climax.But that didn't detract severely from Rebecca. There were more than enough things to make up for it, and it was a good read anyway. I recommend this book to teenagers and adults alike."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This has been and will always be my favorite book of all time! It is an incredible love story and is very suspenseful along with vivid descriptions and an amazing twisting plot. I love it!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"&quot;Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley....&quot; Daphne du Maurier's haunting tale of a naive young woman who cannot escape the shadow of her wealthy, older husband's previous wife, Rebecca, who was adored by all who knew her. But in trying to overcome her feeling of inadequacy, the young woman (who is never given a first name) finds a terrifying secret about her beautiful predecessor. One to add to your collection."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca was one of the best books I have ever read, a true page-turner. Some would say the beginning was slow, as did I before I read the whole novel. Now I see it was perfect, a slow beginning that increases during the entire plot. A masterpiece that is enjoyed even more every time one reads it."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I had rented the movie Rebecca and loved it so much I had to buy the book. Rebecca is one of my all time favorite books. I'll never forget how I had to do a report on the book. I was so into it, I was the only person in my class to get a hundred. Rebecca is a true classic."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"A deeply moving, suspense filled romantic novel. One can really relate to what the narrator is going through, trying desperately to fill the gap Rebecca left. The unexpected turn of events left me breathless, it was so sudden, when it came towards the end. I thought the ending was a little unresolved, but I guess that adds to the mystery of the book. The novel starts with a beautiful description of Mandereley, very poetic writing, in fact, but it may bore some readers. Otherwise, a fantabulous novel by Du Maurier."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I didn't read &quot;Rebecca&quot; until I saw the second half of the Hitchcock directed movie on PBS, and I became totally obsessed with knowing how it all started. I borrowed it form the library the next day and raced through the 358 pages to see the differences between the book and the movie. The book- as usual- was better than the movie. I love the book so much, I am writing about it for my research project in world lit."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"the book tends to drag on at parts, and in other parts it'll rush . . like music, but unevenly . . the description in it is lush, but sometimes grows old. i don't see how it makes a great suspense novel, since it doesn't make one sit on the edge of their seat, biting their nails, dying to know what's going on, but it does make one hell of a romanticist book. has a lot to do with the heroine's emotion and philosophy. this book lets you dig deep into her psyche."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"If you like this book, try reading Stephen King's Bag of Bones. He refers to this story often and it's a really great read!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I had always heard that &quot;Rebecca&quot; was a wonderful piece of literature and had thought about reading it &quot;someday.&quot; Then one day I picked it up at the bookstore and fell hopelessly in love. It was far beyond my expectations. Heartwrenchingly beautiful and elegant, I understand why it is a classic. Though it starts a bit slow it only gets better and better until the abrupt ending that makes you gasp!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book caught me from the very beggining with beautifly written descriptions of the dream. I never lost interest This book was simply brilliant."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This was a great book. One of my very favorites. The movie was good, but the book is oh so much better! I really liked that we never get a glimpse of the beauty of Rebecca, it is left up to our imaginations, and contrasted with the second Mrs. DeWinter, we only know her by that name, nothing else. This story is sometimes light and at most times chilling. Do not cheat yourself out of a great book!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I THOUGHT THE BOOK WAS GOING TO BE A CHORE BUT THEN LATER ON I FOUND OUT THAT IT STILL WAS.J/K I LIKED THE BOOK AT THE MIDDLE AND THE END BUT THE BEGINNING WAS REALLY BORING!!!!!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"As for the story itself, I found it boringly cliche. A young girl from a lower class gets swept off by a rich, enigmatic middle aged man and declare her eternal love for him in spite of his confession of murdering his first wife is stuff for teenage girls at the threshold of life. If I were her, I'd run as fast as I could out of Manderley. Had he nursed her through near death, I could see sensibility in her staying and continuing to love him. As it is, any men with wallet full of money could make a woman feel like a queen (until either his money or his desire to have her runs out). Nothing special here.I couldn't feel the suspense though I could picture the beauty of Manderley. Perhaps I've lived too damn long. All through the reading I kept thinking this second Mrs. de Winter is stupid and this Maxim got nothing to offer a woman. What was the reason he married his first wife? The one he gave was pure stupid.Read this book for the lovely writing style of the author only."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I realize not all the classics are meant to have some kind of societal significance. Some of them are like guilty pleasure junk food - Anna Karenina, Lord of the Rings. But Rebecca is neither significant nor is it by any stretch of the word pleasurable to read. Forget that the main character fell madly \\"in love\\" and married a man after knowing him less than a month and then all she can do is complain about how she doesn't fit in when she gets to Manderly. Suspend even for a moment the fact that all of the characters are either stereotypes, tropes or stocks (Except Beatrice - she's kind of cool. I wish the book had been about her instead). The real problem I have with Rebecca is that, while it's supposed to be suspenseful, the main character pretty much discovers all there is to know about Rebecca in one long diatribe courtesy of her husband (Mrs. Danvers also has similar moments where she, not to be vulgar, /pukes/ out background information), and then there is that random bit about cancer at the end which caused the inquest to be completely anti-climactic. I'm not going to say Rebecca is a Shaggy Dog story, but the ending is unsatisfying and forced, and the only character I sympathized with through the whole thing was Jasper. Poor puppy. By the ending, I wondered whether or not this book was meant to be a joke or something - a dig in the ribs of similar, superfluous wastes of paper. But if it was, it wasn't presented very well. As a lesbian, I wish I could give du Maurier more credit, but I can't. I will say that her sexuality definitely comes out to the observant reader, but I'll say no more about that. TL;DR: read it if you want but it's not very good. :)"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"One of my favorite books EVER!! This book truly does have a little bit of everything. The magic of this book for me is how so much of its story is really untold. The reader is forced to fill in the blanks, but in the end you know that you were right all along. How brilliant is it that the main character never utters a word, that Manderly is a main character itself, and yet another main character has no name at all? (Not to mention Mrs. Danvers, YIKES!! ) Please read this book!!!! For me this is one of those books that I can't see how EVERYONE doesn't love it!!!!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is surely the the quintessential Gothic suspense. DuMaurier controls and modulates the atmosphere in scene after scene with wonderful descriptive passages. The characters are simply drawn, but stay true to the tragic story. Suspense and foreboding build steadily, even though the plot holds no surprises for the modern reader.I am never interested in romance novels, gothic suspense, or mysteries. Nevertheless, I found Rebecca to be a completely satisfying read.While reading the novel, I felt like I was watching an extended directors' cut of the best Hitchcock movie ever. So I was not surprised to find that he brought Rebecca to the screen and that it was his breakthrough film. He obviously learned a great deal from DuMaurier."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book boasts one of the perfect opening paragraphs, quite similar in &quot;instant classic&quot; feel to the 1st paragraph of The Haunting of Hill House. Manderly features as largely as any character, benign and malevolent, shelter and trap. And in the end, I can't bear that it is no more.I really feel that Maxim is awful and the narrator is a twit. But neither weakens the story; they're just ideas of their time."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"After not reading this book for at least ten years, I picked it up again. It's a masterpiece, no doubt, but as I've gone along my own life my reaction to the characters changes. The second Mrs de Winter IS very young, like a self-conscious adolescent, so concerned about what others think, so easily intimidated, refusing to speak up in a way that is frustrating. (For example, if Mrs Danvers tried that costume trick on me I would fire her within the hour -- but at Mrs de Winter's tender age I would have been intimidated.) She wastes her time imagining terrible situations, not realizing that her husband loves her the whole time, that what she wants is close at hand, too frightened to be happy. Both Maxim and his second wife are flawed, and in some ways another reviewer is right, Rebecca, not seen, who grabbed life with two hands, is to be admired. Nevertheless I enjoy the scenes narrated by the second Mrs de Winter, even the slower first chapters, as they draw you through the novel. I disagree with other reviewers that some of the dialogue is dull -- or rather, it is meant to seem like a dull overlay to the terrifying secrets just below the surface."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"All I have to say is wow. I watched the Alfred Hitchcock version of this movie in my English class before I knew about the book. The book and the movie are different in some ways, but hands down, the book is better. Exactly how every other review summarizes the book is how I would put it too. I think one of the reasons people like this book so much is because besides the fact that it's so intriguing and written beautifully, we can all relate to the unnamed narrator in how she feels at times and how she overcomes it. This book gives answers at the end, but at the same time, leaves you guessing, which is perfectly left wide open for a sequel. (which, I can't wait to read.) The movies made from this book that I know about are the Alfred Hitchcock version, and a BBC version and a mini series that aired in the 80's or 70's. I intend to watch every one of them."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"The story of Rebecca is interesting and different from usual ones. The novel shows the problems of the main actor, Mrs de Winter, very graphic. But for me there's not enough tension. One of the reasons for the missing tension is that you don't wonder why something happens because either you know why or you don't notice that something strange is going to happen.After about three quarters of the book, the reader knows what exactly happened with Rebecca, but the book doesn't end at this place, it still goes on. That makes the end rather boring in spite of the unclear ending."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I highly recommend \\"Rebecca\\" as an interesting and engrossing story. The book arrived in great condition. I give it 5 Stars.."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Classic!!Full of twists all the way till the end! An extremely engaging book."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"There is a reason it's called a classic. It is one of the best written books in history, in my option, and it really resonated with me, long after I finished it. My mom suggested it, and usually I don't care for her fare, but I am so glad I read it. I won't go into any detail because I'd hate to spoil it for anyone, but let's just say, it's a winner. Also, I loved the movie--Rebecca."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"What a great classic....very slow at first, but once you get started, you can't put it down.I figured out a few things as I was reading, but the end was quite a surprise.I too was not happy my book club chose this book, but it turned out to be a wonderful choice.You won't be disappointed once you get past about the first 50 pages.ENJOY!!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book took a long time to get rolling but once the hook was set the reading became easy ripping off one page after another through to the end. A great story of a man's limitations, the things money can do for you, and how the inevitable will always get you in the end."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This wonderful book, took me to the deepest chambers of my soul and heart and left me to ponder my fate in this world"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is a chilling book that follows the life of the second Mrs. Maxim de Winter and her experiences trying to outlive the ghost of her predecessor, Rebecca. She meets Maxim while serving in the employ of a Mrs. Van Hopper--a rude American who hires the narrator to be a companion. She hates Mrs. Van Hopper but doesn't see much other option for herself since her parents died and left her penniless.Upon Mrs. Van Hopper becoming ill, the narrator and Mr. de Winter strike up a friendship that turns into something more and eventually marry. It's upon the return to Mr. de Winter's estate, Manderley, that things start to get interesting and complicated for the narrator. We follow along as she deals with family, the servants and former friends, and attempts to make a happy life for herself and Maxim. The mysterious death of Rebecca haunts the main character though she can't quit pinpoint why, and we follow her through her daily routine until she discovers what happened and why it's important to her.I found the book tedious at points. The writing is very tightly wound up in the narrator's mind and we follow her thoughts through several permutations of \\"what could have happened\\" or \\"what might be happening\\" or \\"what other people are currently thinking about her\\", etc. I never felt like putting the book aside, however, but I did find it difficult to get into in the beginning. And it isn't until around p. 200 (in my edition) that it becomes gripping...and the book is indeed gripping, and I finished the last 200pp in an evening and the following afternoon.Recommended."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca is one of my favourite novels because of it's re-readability. A reader is invited into the head of it's mousy heroine and asked to tread the halls of manderley, a place where the new mrs De Winter feels out of place and lost. She sees signs of her predecessor everywhere and she feels inferior to the more accomplished and beautiful woman that came before her.She is made even more unwelcome by the forbidding housekeeper Mrs Danvers, who doted on the original Rebecca and brings more trouble to the unnamed new wife.Brilliantly written, a wonderful tale of passion and jealousy. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"If you have never read Du Maurier's classic, you must. This book is one of my all time favorite novels and has everything a good novel should have...suspense, mystery, romance and the most colorful characters you will ever find. The first time I read the book, I couldn't put it down. And the second time, the same thing happened...even when I knew the ending!! I can certainly understand why this book propelled Du Maurier to author stardom. It should be on everyone's bucket list of books."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Love Plays An Important Part, But This Is Not A 'Romance Novel'I really enjoyed Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier.Mr. Maxim de Winter is vacationing in Monte Carlo when he meets our narrator who is employed as a lady's companion to the perfectly dreadful, Mrs. Van Hopper. When Mrs. Hopper falls ill our nameless narrator falls in love with Mr. De Winter and marries him.Once they return to England and his home, the beautiful and renown Manderley, she discovers that she is haunted by the former Mrs. de Winter, who is ever present despite that fact that she is dead.What does it do to your confidence to be constantly compared to someone who came before you?My reading was periodically interrupted by various things from the real world (preparing meals, packing lunches, doing laundry, how annoying) and each time I was interrupted I was anxiously wondering what was going to happen to the de Winters? How would things work themselves out?The author creates a lush and vivid setting. I thought the words were beautiful and the story telling was wonderful. The characters were well drawn the situations and dialogue realistic. It was all very very enjoyable. I would have loved more.I was a bit disappointed in the specific copy that I chose to read. I'm always aware of how many pages I have left to read. I knew the book ended at page 410 so when the story itself ended on page 386 I was a bit surprised. The remaining pages were a letter from the editor, a note from the author, an article that the author had previously published and the original epilogue, much of which was included in the first chapter of the book. I wish I had known.This would be a wonderful book for a book club.I will be reading more of Daphne Du Maurier."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I read this book for my Freshman English class last year, and I must admit I was not looking foward to it -- I figured it would be just another boring &quot;classic.&quot; But I was definently wrong! This book was extremely absorbing and gripping, and I could not put it down until after I had finished the shocking conclusion.Do yourself a favor and read this book -- it's definently worth your time."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"In my high school honors English class, we had reading groups assigned with a college student. OUr book was Rebecca. I began reading it and it went very slow and I thought the book would be a long, painful process. We would meet every week and discuss the book. Guessing what would happen, always turning out to be wrong. The book had so many cliffhangers and unanswered questions that you had to keep reading. Even though I heard the sequel was awful, I would still like to read it and see what becomes of the characters. I am also looking forward to working with my group onn making a project for this wonderful novel."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This was such a great book! It started out a little slow, but go so interesting, and though nothing really happened for a while, the words just made you want to read, and read.. Maxim de Winter meets a shy, plain girl who is accompanying an older woman, Mrs. van Hopper, in Monte Carlo. Soon they marry, and she becomes the second Mrs. de Winter, and finds herself living in the shadow of the first Mrs. de Winter, the beautiful Rebecca. Everything about Manderly, the place she lives with Maxim, is how Rebecca wanted it. But Rebecca was killed in a boating accident a year ago. The 2nd Mrs. de Winter is afraid to change anything, because of the sinister Mrs. Danvers, the main housekeeper, who was very fond of Rebecca. But soon the second Mrs. de Winter finds out some things..and learns the secrets of Manderly. The ending was really a surprise, and I loved all of this book. It's a MUST read!"},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I read Rebecca first as a teenager. I couldn't put it down. After I finished it the first time I was monumentally annoyed that after reading a book I loved I could not remember the name of the heroine. I sat there racking my brain, so I thumbed through it looking for it. The next thing I knew I was reading it again. I became so enthralled with it the second time that I forgot I was looking for a name. I read that book THREE times before (remember I was a teenager!!) I realized she simply did not have a name! Who on earth would write a book and not give the main character a name?!?! That was part of duMaurier's genius. Now that I am older (MUCH older) and I recommend this book, I warn my friends about that, because our patience is thinner as we age and such a perceived 'memory loss' could be quite unsettling!! It's testament to her skill as a writer, you didn't even realize it as you read, so caught up in the story, as you are. It's not until after you have finished it and are thinking back over it.You are not a book lover if you have not read Rebecca."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"This book is a true masterpiece. A nameless heroine marries Maximillian de Winter. He lives in a rich estate and was once married to Rebecca, the most perfect woman anyone has ever met. The heroine is always struggling with Rebecca despite the fact she is dead. That is all I will say. If you want to find out more read the book, but I would suggest not to buy this edition. This edition is a piece of crap filled with typos and crooked pages. Which is why it is so cheap."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"The story is set in the 1930s in the south-west of England: it could be Devon, but it is Cornwall to those who recognise it. Rebecca herself is dead, but her ghost haunts the story. Her husband, now a widower, is rich, highly placed in society, and good looking. Maxim de Winter is landed gentry - the owner of Manderley, one of the grand old stately homes of England, but after his wife's death he is too wrapt up in himself, now he needs above all to recover from his loss and so he tours the continent. When abroad he meets the young and gentle woman of very modest means who is working as a companion to a rich older lady. They meet, fall in love, and marry.Back at her new home in Manderley amid unaccustomed grandeur and elevated society, the inexperienced new wife feels out of her depth and constantly tries to measure up to the opinion of everyone else in what she should be and do, or at least, what she imagines is so. She cannot get the previous wife out of her mind, insecurity eats away at her, making her fear for her position as the new Mrs de Winter and wonder whether she can host the great Manderley ball, as Rebecca did. Even in the eyes of the servants she feels she is judged inadequate. Her manners and bearing are simply not stately, not \`born to the manor', she is humble, honest, and kindly. Above all, the grim and insolent housekeeper, Mrs Danvers, rules the staff with tyrannical discipline and loses no opportunity to compare her to the old Mrs de Winter. So her real and imagined gaucherie keep her in a state of anxiety, her ignorance and her desire to please are great, and she has so little by which to measure her performance.Now the housekeeper and the house have their secrets. The relatives and the local tenants have secrets. Maxim de Winter is too taciturn for his relationship's good. Our poor heroine does her blundering best to please, but events are unfolding around her apace, and even the elements themselves conspire to reveal the past. The powerful personality of Rebecca is so imprinted on the lives and hearts of so many of the characters, and even dominates the house in so many ways, that things cannot remain hidden for long.This is a story of a bygone age. The fact that it is told entirely as a reminiscence (\`in flashback' is technically accurate, but inappropriate to the dream-like recall and pervading ambiguity of the whole), it is a long memory jogged by a vivid dream which sets the tone. She is looking back on the events that brought her to her current place, and the whole is seen strictly through her first person point of view. The whole story is in her head, seen through her eyes, told in her voice, felt in her emotion. Her fears and hopes are real and so acute that her lack of understanding and her yet growing confidence and many setbacks are vivid to the reader. The writing is easy to follow, and the dialogue and observation of character acute. Many of the characters can easily and fairly be called stereotypes from a bygone age, but certainly not caricatures or comic figures, as they all keenly drawn and the dialogue makes them live as individuals. Apart from the slowly lifting shroud of mystery on the past, the constant interest is the developing character of the narrator herself. Overall a \`whodunnit' and 'whatisit' feel pervade the story as the expertly created ambiguity is carefully maintained, and as one element is revealed in full, another unseen and unpredicted element is brought into view. The pace speeds up as events unfold, and the climax is as dramatic as could be wished.There is a morality tale here, masquerading as a love story and mystery play. It is only explicit at one point, in a brief bitter comment of Maxim de Winter. There is also a prophetic aspect to the novel. It is also a passing of an era novel. The characters and their behaviour, past and present, alive and dead, lead in one inexorable direction. This is subtly done as it maintained with a light touch and clearly points to the course of the book and the characters, but the haunted look-back-in-gentle-sorrow tone of the narrator indicates that the future is known (as it is all reminiscence) which does in fact contradict the prophetic aspect. But the reader attends to the unfolding action and drama, and does well to forget that the opening tells us that all is recall.Some would say that the novel is a re-write of \`Jane Eyre': the orphan girl first-person narrator, love story, mystery past, skeletons, cupboards, morality aspect, evocation of period, and costume-drama scenes of the gentry. But where \`Rebecca' looks back and ends with a full stop, \`Jane Eyre' looks forward and ends with an ellipsis. Rebecca is an ember, Jane is a flame."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"I am a fan of neither mysteries nor romances. I feel like I got my fill of Nancy Drew before junior high and enough mindless bodice rippers while I suffered through an early marriage and divorce. It seems inifinitely difficult for books from these genres to be anything but formulaic. Since this book is promoted as both a mystery and a romance, I doubted that I would be interested.To my relief and surprise, I found that \\"Rebecca\\" is really a fascinating study of complex characters. Daphne Du Maurier eeks out tantalizing details about each character in a way that establishes palpable tension and suspense. The primary characters are involved in a new marriage, so loosely the story may be perceived to have a romantic subtext. However, it is the characters that provide interest.Furthermore, Du Maurier drives the story, the characters, and the suspense with language that is carefully and skillfully crafted to move the arc of the plot irresistably toward the climax. Her sentences are dense with meaning and ambiance. Her writing consistently adds to the atmosphere and the readers' involvement with the characters. Her words and sentence structure flow smoothly and are never distracting.I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a well-written, tightly woven character study with an effortless plot that moves the reader through the twists and turns of life."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"Rebecca,by daphne du maurier is certainly a book that will never die, no mater how many times it is read it wil always have that same enchanting magic.It is it that kind of a book,that will always remain close to the readers heart.

And it does not prosper, that sort of love.\\" So says Maximilian de Winter, the handsome and wealthy master of the house and country estate so named. After the sudden death of his beautiful and accomplished wife, Rebecca, de Winter flees to Monaco. He astonishes both himself and the book's nameless narrator by marrying that narrator just weeks after meeting her. The new Mrs. de Winter is barely out of school, and so poor that she's in Monaco as paid companion to an obnoxious widow. Does Maxim really love her? Or is he simply unable to bear returning alone to his beloved Manderley, with Rebecca no longer there?The young second wife is out of her depth socially and economically, feeling far more kinship with her husband's staff of servants than with his friends. Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper who came to Manderley when Rebecca was Maxim's bride, realizes that immediately and takes full advantage. Mrs. Danvers adored Rebecca, and hates the woman who now occupies her place at Manderley. Which Rebecca seems never to have left, after all....I enjoyed this book thoroughly. It's beautifully written, with rich detail and a slow, subtle building of menace that's ultimately far more creepy than modern \\"in-your-face\\" scare-fests ever manage. I especially like the flaws in Du Maurier's heroes, and the sympathetic qualities of her villians. Not only does that make the characters, all of them, more realistic; it also matches the novel's start-to-finish ambiguity. In a lesser writer's hands that ambiguity might come off as unsatisfying, but Du Maurier manages to strike exactly the right note. Especially - where it matters most - on the final page."},{"Title":"Rebecca","review":"It was very nice to purchase a hardcover of this book but the size was that of a paperback.

In the process I became a way bigger fan of Roger Miller. Previously I was only familiar with King of the Road and some of those hits from the sixties.A movie needs to be made on Roger Miller, he was outragious and hugely talented. An interesting character study.Despite another review I read here, I enjoyed the fact that it wasn't just focused on Roger. I mean if I was the guy who caught the last of the outlaw feud with Tompall and Waylon, I'd be an idiot not to include that in this book. Also, he explains out right that he kept things in there music fans would probably be interested in, if you're not interested, skip it! It's not going to make a difference to your enjoyment of the Roger stories. I don't think any of those stories were included to fill space, it's quite longer than the average book. I see them as a bonus!After searching online, this is the only book on Roger Miller and I think it's a great one. It's not just for Miller fans by any means, it made me a Miller fan! I mean I liked him before but I didn't start looking for old albums of his until now. It's for fans of all kinds of music, not just country, and fans of the people that were interviewed in the book, it's stuff I've never read them talk about before.If you liked the WALK THE LINE movie, you'll love this book. My Dad is reading it now and calls me almost everyday to share a laugh or story he liked from the book.I thought the interviews were the perfect length and taught me a lot about a guy that hasn't been written or talked about as much as he should.Well worth picking up the book, over three hundred pages of great stories on Roger Miller and the people interviewed."},{"Title":"Ain't Got No Cigarettes: Memories of Music Legend Roger Miller","review":"This is a great book full of many people's memories of Roger Miller.

Style, your only career options are playing point guard for the Kentucky Colonels circa 1973 or chronicling country music, and readers should be grateful that Style has chosen the latter path. In this collection of Q. and A.'s with dozens of illustrious country artists and fixtures of the Nashville scene, he ostensibly recounts the life of the musician and raconteur Roger Miller, of \\"King of the Road\\" and \\"Dang Me\\" fame, who died of cancer in 1992. But through a quirk of deliberate or accidental genius, what Style has actually assembled is a living document of country music in its hootin', hollerin' outlaw heyday, when the D.J. Captain Midnight ruled the airwaves, Tootsie's Orchid Lounge was the ultimate hangout and everyone, it seems, was on cocaine -- even the mimes. Along the way, Style learns some unprescribed uses for diet pills, discovers that Miller's King of the Road Hotel may have been owned by the mob and reignites an old feud between Tompall Glaser and Waylon Jennings.

This compilation of Roger Miller stories is funny and insightful into the life of a singer-songwriter who told someone he had just written a song while the other person was singing. On a Nashville Family Reunion show, Bill Anderson, another songwriting genius, said, \\"We could tell Roger Miller stories all night. Everybody has a Roger Miller story.\\" The book's author, Lyle E. Style (who never answered the question of whether that's his real name--but it couldn't be, right?), has collected Roger Miller stories from an assortment of Miller's friends, associates and acquaintances. The book is easy reading, the vignettes short, mostly only a page. The picture that emerges of Miller is that of a man who -- as Humphrey Bogart allegedly once said about himself -- is \\"two drinks\\" ahead of the rest of the world. His friends describe the ups and downs of his career, his personal unhappiness till he married Mary, who became a stabilizer.

Roger could make you laugh out loud despite yourself or make your eyes tear-up and get misty the next . . . and sometime both at the same time.But it didn't stop at Roger's musical talents . . . he could work that same magic in simple converstation. Just watching any television interviews Roger gave could captivate you to latch on and wait for his next comment. He had a smile and a slightly giddy twinkle and spark in his eyes that let you know he had a great line coming . . . or had just delivered one.This book of reminiscences and memories of many who knew or encountered Roger may be the second best thing to meeting Roger yourself. It is a shame and a loss that Roger didn't write his own autobiography and memoirs and life observations. That would have been \\"the\\" experience to read and re-read.

The narrative offers us a savvy glimpse into the life of Winona Bartlett, a twenty-something filmmaker, who is passing the time, and paying rent, by working as a secretary in the swanky and ritzy Manhattan law firm of Greko Mauster Crill, Where she has, at least, &quot;an identity, the sanctity of identity in her normal work.&quot; When Sandy Spires, a blind, ambitious and devastatingly beautiful lawyer joins the firm, Winona is inexplicably drawn to her. Sandy befriends Winona, promotes her to office manager, and showers her with attention and affection. But Sandy has a secret, and Winona through her own nave ambition, is unwittingly drawn into Sandy's clandestine activities.Out of the office, Winona has to suffer her flighty and self obsessed sister Liz, who is constantly asking her to house sit, &quot;do her bidding,&quot; and look after her dog Sniffles. She is also shielding attention from Rex, a cute young hotshot lawyer, who wants to &quot;date&quot; her while coping with her current boyfriend Jeremy, who wants her to go to a couple's conference for counseling. After she decides to break up with Jeremy, Sylvester, a savvy, older continental filmmaker, courts her with the promise to help her break into the industry. The plot twists and turns and Winona finds herself getting caught up in all sorts of experiences as she searches for integrity and tries to navigate through the frustrations of life.Winona's film is going to be called The Anxiety of Everyday Objects and she wants the heroine of her film to be going about her business, seeing things, but things that are &quot;magnified, imagined, or skewed - an outburst of her own anxiety.&quot; Is there a difference between what you see and what you hear, or are they incomparable as &quot;an aria to a sun collapsing over a French Hill?&quot; How we perceive each other, and what we look for in a person's character is at the heart of this delectably lively and spirited novel. Perhaps in the end, it isn't absolutely clear whether it is sight or blindness that produces happiness. Fans of &quot;chic lit&quot; are going to appreciate this work, along with anyone who has ever found themselves in the middle of the manipulations, and scheming affairs of office life.

Manipulation and office politics are treated with gravity and wit. An excellent and impressive first novel. I will definitely buy Sheehan's next book."},{"Title":"The Anxiety of Everyday Objects","review":"The beauty of The Anxiety of Everyday Objects is that it is a goodread on different levels - as an entertaining and suspenseful page turner, as well as an insightful exploration of the integrity of pursuing artistic (and other!) desires. Ms. Sheehan is wellregarded for her poetic prose and that, coupled with a significantplot twist (one I'm trying hard not to give away),will prove most rewarding from the first page on."},{"Title":"The Anxiety of Everyday Objects","review":"Every once in a while I go through a reading drought. My shelves look uninspired and I'm tired of the same-old-same-old but not energetic enough to try something completely different. These droughts generally happen once a year or so, and last for a few weeks, and will always be ended by a phenomenal book. I picked this one up a few years ago on a work trip at an airport bookstore, and devoured it during my flight. The writing is divine, the characters are so real, and the story is wonderful. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Anxiety of Everyday Objects","review":"I loved this book. &quot;Our&quot; heroine, Winona, is all over the place when it comes to work (she has a Master's degree yet works in a secretarial position), men (they come and go, so to speak), and film (her secret passion). Winona does the &quot;right thing&quot; at work (a small law firm bordering on the brink of insolvency). She suffers through all of the unpleasantries associated with working for lawyers. At the same time, Winona has to indulge her completely self-absorbed (and whacko) sister. There is so much in this novel, and the writing is so good, you just have to read it. You will be delighted."},{"Title":"The Anxiety of Everyday Objects","review":"Aurelie Sheehan is a magnificent storyteller and she writes like a dream. The Anxiety of Everyday Objects could be a bright, crisp read--a series of madcap adventures provides a smart page-turning pace--but I took my time. It's one of those books that packs sentence-by-sentence delights driven by a miraculous sense of language."},{"Title":"The Anxiety of Everyday Objects","review":"I picked this book up while browsing. I flipped through a few pages, liked the crisp writing, flipped again, and still liked the writing. But, much to my disappointment, when I tried to read the book straight through, I found the overall plot to be surprisingly off. Aurelie can clearly frame beautiful sentences, but what happens in the book is helter-skelter (at best), and the secondary characters seem unknowable."},{"Title":"The Anxiety of Everyday Objects","review":"Well-written, intriguing unraveling of the perfect legal secretary from Connecticut.

Female oriented and imaginative."},{"Title":"The Anxiety of Everyday Objects","review":"Winona Bartlett is a wannabe film-maker living in New York City. Although she doesn't own a camera, she spends lots of time imagining her first film, to be called \\"The Anxiety of Everyday Objects,\\" a plotless piece that will illustrate the ways in which we continually misperceive the world around us, for example when we misread a sign that says \\"Turn ahead\\" as \\"Turn ahead.\\" Yet while Winona's artistic aspirations run to the philosophical and ponderous, her day-to-day life is, well, predictably boring. She works as a secretary in a small law firm where she obsessed about making coffee that is just the right strength for her boss, she lives alone with her cat Fruit Bat, she is bossed around by her self-centered older sister, and she dates a series of unsuitable men. Things start to change when her firm hires Sandy Spires, a mysterious, sophisticated blind lawyer to help with a lawsuit they're working on. Sandy shakes up the firm, but in the end, and frankly as any even somewhat astute reader could have guessed--Sandy turns out not to be who she seems, and the revelation of this leads to a series of events that set Winona on a much more promising course. The book ends with the kind of explain-it-all scene one sees in TV detective shows, as where Monk exclaims \\"Here's what happened.\\""},{"Title":"The Anxiety of Everyday Objects","review":"This book isn't chick lit, but real lit. It follows Winona Bartlett, a legal secretary in New York City, as she moves through her work and love life. The story is less important than the overall feeling of floating through life, which Winona experiences and Sheehan beautifully conveys. Winona is an artistic type who wants to create an experimental film with the novel's title exploring the life of objects. In a way, Winona herself is struggling to move beyond being an object and to become the main actor in her own life.The novel is beautifully written and very enjoyable. However, the ending is forced and feels tacked on, which is a real shame. It is still a good read, but not a great one."},{"Title":"The Anxiety of Everyday Objects","review":"I was hesitant to read this book- but after seeing the good reviews it got online- I decided to give it a try. I did NOT like this book. It was so boring- I could not get into it at all and i regret the time I spent to read it. Other people liked it , but it was not for me. I found the plot and writing to be very unimaginative and slow. Even a really bad chick lit book can hold my attention better than this!"},{"Title":"The Anxiety of Everyday Objects","review":"The Anxiety of Everyday Objects is beautifully written with charisma and charm evident in every word on the page. Ms. Sheehan writes with care, and tells her story with wonderfully clever word use. Her style of writing complements her characters, and makes this book an extremely satisfying read. The book is easy to digest, even when dealing with deeply dramatic issues, and never gets tied down too far in needless detail."},{"Title":"The Anxiety of Everyday Objects","review":"This is one of my favorite books. Especially as an artist working in a not so artistic job.When I picked it up about a year ago, I assumed it was a standard chicklit book, but I was really pleasantly suprised.

The first a broad survey of the history of the Christendom mindset and its implications on Church life and the second a tentative proposal of how the Church must change to adapt to this new situation.Overall I found this book an excellent introduction to the whole subject of Christianity and Christendom and how antithetical it is to the Christian gospel. The book is wide ranging and as a result does lack somewhat for detail however this is unavoidable given its breadth. This is however counterbalanced by good referencing and a key bibliography that enables those wishing to pursue areas further to do so (I already have a couple of key books on order).On the negative side I did find it a little strange given its concetration of British Post-Christendom that there was so little analysis of the rise of Christendom within England/Britain (the English reformation under Henry VIII, for example, is (externally) a prime example of a top-down conversion).Overall though this is recommended."},{"Title":"Post-Christendom: Church and Mission in a Strange New World (AfterChristendom)","review":"I loved this book. And I am genuinely thankful to Stuart for doing it. It is scholarly in the classically British way--understated, gentle, articulate, and thoroughly devasating to views that have held that Christendom was the acme of a so-called Christian civilization.

The modern-postmodern transition has received a lot of attention, but Murray focuses on the just as significant end of Christendom - where the Christian story was known and the church was central - and the implications for mission and discipleship now from the margins. New outside-the-box models are imperative. Murray draws on early Christianity, dissident movements and the global church to suggest fresh, simple, de-clericalised, risky and re-imagined directions for church and mission.Originally appeared in Darren Cronshaw, \`The Emerging Church: Introductory Reading Guide', Zadok Papers, S143 (Summer 2005)."},{"Title":"Post-Christendom: Church and Mission in a Strange New World (AfterChristendom)","review":"Stuart Murray offers a penetrating and concise analysis of how Constantinian Christendom hijacked Christianity, and suggests ways for churches to move ahead while discarding the Christendom mindset.I enjoyed this book so much that I gave it to a friend, then felt the need to read it again and so had to buy myself a second copy!"},{"Title":"Mussolini's Empire: The Rise and Fall of the Fascist Vision","review":"This very easy to read biography of Mussolini is an interesting study into the life of this dictator. It is by far one of the most pro-Mussolini biographies that one can find. There is little criticism of the dictator and his life is glazed over in some areas. Despite this it makes for a very interesting and refreshing perspective. I would not allow this to be the only biography of Mussolini that you read but it does make for a new perspective. While RJ Bosworth's book tries to make a balanced approach and ends up as a semi vindication this book combined with say Dennis Mack Smith's biography would really give a good view of Mussolini. The title is somewhat misleading and this really is mostly a domestic book that looks at the Duce's rule in Italy. There is some attention paid to foreign affairs but at the end it is mostly domestic. I think that this book can be useful in the context of a simple biography that looks positively at Mussolini but it is only one small piece of a very complicated puzzle and could have done much more hence the three star rating."},{"Title":"Mussolini's Empire: The Rise and Fall of the Fascist Vision","review":"This book has many fascinating things in it: direct quotations from conversations with Mussolini's aides; statements about him from world figures (including a compliment from Gandhi); and information about his deeply personal feelings regarding certain matters. Unfortunately, there are no citations (footnotes or endnotes) to back any of these up. In other words, the reader has no way to judge the reliability of what Hoyt is saying.I know that publishers of books for popular consumption tend to dislike footnotes. However, Hoyt paints Mussolini in a better light than most other biographers or historians, and many of his conclusions are controversial. The absence of citations makes me doubt Hoyt; perhaps if he had included them, I would take some of his statements more seriously.However, if you simply want to know the undisputed facts such as when and how he took power, this book will do nicely."},{"Title":"Mussolini's Empire: The Rise and Fall of the Fascist Vision","review":"This book gives a through story of his life from day one to the very last day of his life.

This book will provide the reader with some great tips on reading other people!"},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"I was a novice when it comes to body language, and this book was a great intro. It shows common body language at work, in courting rituals, etc. It also goes into common body language shown with the face, arms/hands, legs/feet, etc. The book is well written, easy to read, and the authors have a sense of humor that will make you laugh. Last but not least, this book is new - it discussed gestures used by contemporary figures like Tony Blair, G.W.Bush, etc.The only downsides are two: (1) the book is somewhat basic, and now I feel I will need to follow up with something else, and (2) sometimes the British sense of humor of the author is mixed in with the explanations of a given piece of body language, and it is hard sometimes to know what is irony and what is supposed to be taken at face value.Overall, great primer - start here if this is your first book on the subject."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"I love this book! Despite what Pineywoods Man says. Hey man, you gotta start somewhere. Most people are clueless about body language. This where you start. If he knows so much he should write a book.

At least, this is what the author wants that his readers believe!Unfortunely, when the book tells about the man and pet soul similarities, the cell personality transfer for the transplanted organ or 62% sales increase as a result of the tall salesman that has decided to seat (among other laughable passages), Allan Pease put in risk his credibility.In spite of this, the core remains strong and seems like really based on many, many years of practice.It could have more illustrations because some descriptions are difficult to understand visually. It lacks a real list of references and bibliography, besides a final word index.To sum up it's a very interesting and applicable book, but lacks scientific rigour and there is too many wild guesses."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"This is a fantastic book. It is one of a few body language books I've read and by far the best one. I find myself recommending it to my friends, coworkers and even my professors.Also, it is a huge leg up when you bo are playing poker to understand this book. I hardly know how to play but by judging body language I could tell if my friends felt confident or not about their hands. As well as helping me bluff.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand how to communicate better."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"The advice given in this book is very valuable and also very accurate. I found it interesting how the authors were able to make connections between human body language and that of other primates. Their claims are backed up by statistics, and are explicitly delineated. The book may appear to be sexist at times, especially in the 30 pages devoted to courtship and flirting. It doesn't take one long to realize that the authors are distinguishing biological fact from political correctness. As if to counteract this perceived sexism, they also give advice to women on how to be taken seriously in the workplace and how to counteract male dominance.I read a good portion of this book while people watching at the beach. I was surprised how many tidbits of information I could authenticate just by looking at my surroundings. The information in this book will help you succeed in job interviews, and you can continue to apply what you learned while in the workplace. There is significant emphasis on how to build positive rapport with both your peers and your superiors. Everyone who needs help at work, interviews, dating, and even just general socializing should read this book."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"An excellent guide to human body language and decoding what others are thinking based on their posture, position and gestures. It also offers advice on how to communicate better through appropriate body language and how to convey information (or lie) more easily.The book is spiced with witty jokes, cartoons and anecdotes that make it an easy and enjoyable read. The language used is simple to understand and information contained in it is easy to learn.I only wished that the authors were not as pretentious with their introduction. They say that this book will \\"revolutionize the way we deal with others\\" and \\"change our life forever\\". Oh please. I did read it and I did use the information in it for good effect, but it did not revolutionize the way I deal with others and it did not change my life forever. I realize that they want to sell the book, but making grandiose statements on how your life will never be the same after reading it, might put some people off.The only other complaint I have is that the book seems to focus mostly on business/office relationships and dating. While humans do spend a lot of time working and pursuing romantic relationships, it is not the only thing we do. How about some advice about how to behave in a restaurant with friends or in a store when negotiating with a salesman?The complaints are minor, however.

This book not only answered my questions but also helped me to understand the significance of body language in various situations such as business negotiations, job interviews and politics.What I particularly like about this book is to come to understand that body language is a way to understand how we are feeling regardless of what we say. This understanding made me a better communicator who can be in touch with feelings. It is this usually unnoticed correlation between physical body and emotion that this book implicitly centers upon, providing a whole range of body language in various occasions that counts the most in our lives. Throughout the book, the author provides scientific explanations for why a certain type of body language is connected with a certain emotion. It not only drives his points home but also makes it hard for me to forget what I read.\\"The Definitive Book of Body Language\\" is also full of illustrations and pictures.

Barbara and Allen flesh out not only how people act when in these situations, but also how to detect when someone may be lying or holding back. There are tips on everything from how to survive giving speeches or presentations to how to up your chances of a second date (or taking your date home with you), and they make this goldmine of knowledge simple and sometimes funny!But one pointl to remember is, none of this information will be useful to you if you are not willing to put forth the time and effort it takes to unlearn bad body language habits and practice more effective ones. It&#8216;s scary at first, but two days into reading this book and adopting new habits I&#8216;ve already been seen as more open and approachable by my colleagues!"},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"The Definitive Book of Body Language seems to delight in telling us what men cannot do that women can, and vise versa. While I will not claim some of the emotionally-charged gender stereotypes parroted in the book do not have truth to them, the way they are presented make the authors seem invested in pushing their views on the sexes. I personally felt as if I was doomed to being a bad communicator for having a penis. Is it necessary for a book on body language to make you compare yourself to others in unhealthy ways?Allan and Barbara Pease showcase their other books right behind the cover, ALL of which have male and female stereotypes in the titles. (i.e. \\"Why Men Lie and Women Cry\\" or \\"Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps\\"). The book's attempt at documenting body language itself strongly contrasts with the rest of the text, since it abruptly stops talking about the sexes and starts acting like a desk reference. The descriptions that follow discrete examples of body expressions only mildly refer to the gender biased content that precedes them.To be fair, the authors' descriptions of body language were intuitive. So intuitive, in fact, that I felt like I already knew what they were telling me. They offered simple explanations for various handshakes and stances that you could come up with on your own with enough time for reflection.Even so, I would personally recommend finding another book on non-verbal communication that is more objective about how the body conveys information without focusing so much on what is between your legs. If the authors are going to generalize, I would want them to stay within the realm of the human body, not the man's body or the woman's body."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"We found this book to be very informative and a fun book to read.

It is not organized at all. One chapter will talk about eyes, but all the sudden it will jump back to hand gestures. They compare the same people too often(Hitler, Clinton, and Marilyn Monroe). They fail to list proper sources for their interpretations too. While they are not wrong on some of the subjects, I felt like I was reading \\"natural cures they do not want to know about\\".I would not be blasting it this bad, had the book cost less.

I like the idea the authors use present-day celebrities, also photographs and/or illustrations so that the reader can see by example. I also like the fact that the authors use humor to explain certain situations.

It brings up interesting points and as you are reading it you will say \\"wow I do that or I remember someone doing that\\". Very inteesting. However, the authors grasping at evolutionary straws got very old, very quickly. That is the only downside to this book and the fact that it touches so briefly on a few topics and keeps refering to one of their previous books that you need to read both to really understand body language. Good book though."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"I love this book as there is more information page per page then you can get in most books. You learn about how to properly shake hands, how to tell is someone is lieing and where to sit to present your topic most effectively.

I would highly say this is critical for those who are serious about success in business."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"I picked up this book for further expanding my knowledge on human body language. This book is excellent in non-verbal communication. It covers everything from facial expressions, hand movements/gestures, leg/feet placements, stances, and difference between negative and positive expressions.It also does a great job in explaining it from a negotiating stand-point. As the book is business oriented (in how to get someone to buy you or your product). Of course, aside from business, this is great for social encounters.You'll be able to tell someone's true feelings as to what ever you're talking about. For example, someone can be agreeing with you verbally, but their body language shows crossed arms and legs, which means that person is either thinking negatively (defensively) or is holding back on their true feelings (just being polite).The book also makes a great point in reading body language in clusters and not just individually. Meaning each body language is like a word in a sentence and you'd put those words together to make a sentence.I picked this up as an interesting read. Definitely for people wanting to know more on human interaction and also psychology. The book is an easy read and has many illustrations, so you don't have to use your imagination as to what it may look like when someone's disagreeing or agreeing."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"It's amazing how much you can tell about somebody from their hand shake or smile. (Chapters one and two). You really will want to start examining people to see if you can tell who is lying or what they really mean. Also, if you're a guy and you really want to fool your girlfriend or wife, you are gonna really have to try hard. It seems that women have a real edge on reading body language."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"I was hoping for a bit more, but still the book delivers on it's premise of helping someone determine the meaning of body language."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"This book is a practical and straightforward guide to how people's body language mirrors what they think, whether they say it directly or not.It should be noted that this book is an accessible bestseller and a practical how-to guide, not a serious academic book. But I've already seen enough of the gestures described in public to be convinced it has value.Some of the hint seem obvious, some make sense once you read them (though you may not have thought about it before), and a few things could really surprise you. But most of the positions that I've had a chance to see in other people seem to match up, and I've gotten better at judging people's attitudes by reading this book.I'd heard about body language before, but was a bit sceptical. Maybe people just keep their palms open or stretch out their legs because they \\"feel like it\\", for no meaningful reason, or because its more comfortable. What this book argues is that what \\"just feels comfortable\\" actually says a lot more about your mood than you might realize.The clincher for me was studying people I already know well and already know the internal opinions of, to see if their body language matches up to what it should in certain situations. For the positions that indicate boredom or being unconvinced or closed, watch how your friends react when the office bore or braggart comes up and starts talking to everyone. Everyone tries to be friendly and listens politely, but watch how they start standing!"},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"I work in corporate america...

It also debunks some old myths.I do recommend this book as it will provide the reader with something that can be used after reading the information.

This book will teach you minute body gestures that reveal certain emotions and that you are most likely to be unaware of. Full of illustrations and depictions that make the presentation all the more entertaining and retain-able. As you proceed through this book, you will have real fun putting this knowledge to the test on people you know as well as people you don't know and you will be amazed at how oblivious people are to their own bodies and how they reveal explicitly their thoughts and intentions, which is good news because you will also learn to control your own body language and make sure you convey the right messages. The book also gives valuable advice to salespeople on how they should watch and evaluate the body language of their prospective customers and act accordingly. This is a real fun book and is definitely worth your time and money"},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"The book presents truly comprehensive and detailed descriptions of body language and their analyses. The authors leave very few stones unturned. I would definitely recommend this book as a body language guide. The book could have addressed reading body language in context, rather than as making definitive statements. The authors leave little room for interpretations of certain gestures and movements beyond their own definitions. I'm not talking across cultures, but even within U.S. culture, they tend to make rigid statements about how to read body language in very specific ways. Often, I have observed that you must read individual body language cues within context of other cues. These multiple signals will send a message that may differ from what one originally thought about the first cue. Still, the book serves as a great reference and tool."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"Have you ever wondered what a person is saying without saying it? Does what they are saying match up to their body language? Red this book and you will find out. This is an impressive book when it comes to deciphering the non verbal information that people \\"leak\\".After reading just about every book on body language this is one of the better ones. Most crossover and compliment each other and yes some miss some parts where others pick up the lost information.One of the best ways to learn reading non verbal information is to go to a bar towards the end of the night. Peoples actions are exaggerated and the control to be safe is lost. The more you watch the better you will get."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"I enjoyed the way it explains the need to consider the situational context, the verbal communications as well as the CLUSTERS of gestures in order to better grasp the body language.It provides just the right amount of scientific, anthropological, evolutionary basis of the (almost) reflex gestures we all have - without getting too deep or boring the reader with more than necessary.The pictures and illustrations are excellent. Last but not least - a great sense of humor all over and quite funny to read."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"I liked this book, but while a lot of it made sense, I started to get the feeling that about a third of it was just speculation, not based on actual research.

The authors specialize in the use of body language for business and politics. I found the illustrations and photos that accompany the text to be very funny and appropriate. This is not a very scholarly book, so if you're looking for a very serious and academic book about the study of body language, then this isn't the volume you're looking for, but if you'd just like an introduction to body language from a practical point of view, then this is a perfect book to read. In addition, it is very easy and entertaining to read, so I can recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"This is a fascinating book! What I liked most were the many illustrations demonstrating the authors' points throughout the book. Read the text though--there is so much more to this book. The author's sense of humor, though a little dry, added entertainment to an already enlightening read. I especially liked the courtship section. It is amazing that women send signals an average of 5 times before the men they are interested in respond. It just shows you how dense we men are. I found it unsettling that if you are interested in another woman at a party, the woman you are with will pick up your signal is a New York minute. And, if another woman starts flirting with you from across a room, the woman you are with will send recognizable body language to the other female: \\"hands off, he's mine--you're looking at trouble.\\"After reading this book, I guess I will never go into another meeting without subconsciously, or consciously, trying to recall the lessons in this book.

I learned more from the Introduction of \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Body Language.\\"My main beef with this book is that after reading it, I know a lot about the \\"basics\\" of body language, but not really how to read it. They take a lot of time to point out that you have to look at \\"clusters\\" instead of any one signal, and then spend the rest of the book interpreting individual symbols! They also tend to present most of the gestures as \\"absolutes\\" or definite, while every other book warns you that all gestures can have multiple interpretations and you must be careful.Honestly, not a bad reference, but hardly \\"Definitive.\\" don't make it the only book you read!"},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"I became interested in a body language book after hearing about it from my prof in grad school. The title of this book made me think that it was a \\"definitive\\" or \\"complete\\" book, but it was not.What's good about this book is that it is written from the perspective of experienced salesmen. That is very good in itself (you're paying to learn from their expertise). They cover common body language signs and explain what they usually mean. They also give practical advise on learning/reading body language for many different kinds of settings (business, dating, etc). In other words, this book is very practical and easy to read. I did learn new things about body language by reading this book. However, it did not cover some things that are important from a more purely psychological or medical point of view (such as psychomotor agitation, etc).What I hated about this book:1) It is loaded with questionable scientific information. The experiments were not really experiments, and the authors use scientific names and information like pharm reps would. I noticed use of weasel words and lots of sketchy information to \\"sell\\" their ideas. That is what made me lower my rating the most. It cheapened the feel of the book and made the reading less enjoyable. (-2 stars)2) It contains extraneous information, such as sections on why laughing is good for your health. I also got annoyed at how much of the beginning of the book was dedicated to scientific information when none of them are clearly qualified or well-informed on the subject.3) It is ultimately NOT a book that's purely on body language. Read it and you'll see why. They should add a subtitle or change the title. (-1 star)"},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"One of the better psychological influence books I've recently purchased. Excellent insight into interactive persuasion in business and marketing. A very interesting title to say the least. It provides very detailed information and analysis on the full gamut of body language; facial expressions, gestures (hands, feet, torso, arms crossing), head movements, eye contact, postures and stances. For the learning impaired, these are accompanied with illustrations to explain body language explanations quickly. A great deal of the information is intuitive and often things you would never think of. Some of it is pure psychological speculation not backed with any scientific data or experts. All in all, you'll find the contents to be extremely beneficial in any sales career, as you can effectively recognize and decode the nonverbal messages of others. It's uses are as much for selling yourself as well as picking up on what others' body language is telling you.Additionally you'll find some NLP influence explanations for mirroring people's actions to build rapport. Also, tips on reading people's emotions; flirtation, deceit, confusion, gullibility, excitement, etc. Teaches how to get the advantage in every social interaction.I wouldn't vault this book up there as a scholarly piece like Robert Cialdini. There's a fair amount of pretty bold claims and leaps to judgment that cannot be backed up. But it is occasionally funny, and easy to glean the intended advice. Excellent analysis on detecting whether people are lying to you...how to be more approachable and likable. Overall an interesting, dry and entertaining read, for effective improvement of your business and marketing influence abilities.As far as seduction, I'd couple this book with the funny psychological satireThe Professional Bachelor Dating Guide - How to Exploit Her Inner Psychoto enhance your subconscious attraction, emotional influence skills, as well as improving your reading and seducing of the ladies."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"As creatures of many senses, coming from different ethnic, cultural, and social backgrounds, it is a wonder that we can communicate with others as well as we do. For most of our lives, particularly in our educational system, the focus is on the words that we use. Yet studies have shown that the actual spoken words comprise only 7% of the message received by the listener. Tone of voice accounts for 38% of the message with the remainder (55%) of the message resulting from body language. Non-verbal communication drastically alters, modifies or filters the message, often resulting in a discontinuity between what is \\"said\\" and what is \\"heard.\\"THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF BODY LANGUAGE, by Allan and Barbara Pease, provides an engaging, informative, and easy-to-read exploration of how we communicate we communicate with each other. Drawing on decades of experience, the authors show how body language originates from both biological and environmental sources. With clear and simple illustrations and photographs, individual elements are isolated and analyzed, and then are placed in a more holistic context.Topics include the basics of body language, and then move to specific elements including hand and arm movements and gestures, facial expressions, eye signals, leg and body positioning. These areas are examined separately as well is together in general or within a specific cultural context. There are chapters dealing with the body language of power, deceit, emotions, flirtation and sexual overtones - both innate and learned. One of the most helpful chapters on improving communication is in their discussion of mirroring techniques as a means to build rapport.This is an enlightening book from cover to cover. Its table of contents provide and effective index should the reader wish to explore individual topics or refer back to specific areas of study. The book is invaluable for all who seek to improve their interactions with others. I recommend it highly to those in counseling, ministry, business, and politics - in short, to anyone who must communicate with others (just about everyone)."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"This book has a lot of generalizations in it. This book almost always mentions the \\"what\\" of body language; but, I found it rarely gave the \\"why\\" or \\"how\\". When the book did give a \\"why\\" or \\"how\\", it was usually expressed as a belief strictly of the author's view. When I bought this book, I didnt want someone's opinion; but rather, I wanted the facts. The book does give statistics; however, correlation is not necessarily causation. Correlations dont always reveal absolute facts; but, maybe just patterns cluing in to possible facts. The book often stated what gestures meant for males or females; but, rarely stated that the gestures are open to ambiguity, since, males and females are not completely dictated by their hormone distributions or roles that society expects from them. Each male or female has different perceptions aside from hormone distributions and society roles; thus, all gestures are open to ambiguity; but, this book presents its beliefs pretty much on their own (presented mainly as beliefs of the author with no factual reason as to why A possibly means or does mean B), which makes me believe this book has logical gaps that could be filled to be more accurate. I would have appreciated the possible meaning for all gestures more than the believed meaning for all gestures."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"This book is full of generalizations and unsubstantiated statements. Even looking at the back cover you can tell it did not get much backing from serious people (the praise comes from other authors of similar books, not from researchers or universities, and the authors are not antropologists or sociologists, just regular people). You will find many statements like \\"90% of all people use a palms up handshake\\" without any studies or anything else to back that up. In general, it's like reading USA Today, no more, no less."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"I read through this book pretty quickly. It kept my interest on almost every page. This is a great book if you are interested in learning about body language.I learned a lot from this book. I am now very aware of my body language when talking to others. I have noticed that I tend to get into a defensive body mode when i talk about serious items, probably not the best way to approach the subject. I also enjoy the fact that I now watch everyone I interact with in a new light. I am more able to steer the conversation to my benefit when i talk to people because I can now gauge their reactions to the topics. If they are open and positive, I continue on. If they are closed and defensive I change my approach.I thought I had a pretty good understanding of basic body language before reading this book. But in reality I only knew a few of the basics of the language. The authors go into detail on how a single move is not always accurate, what you want to observe is clusters of movements or positions. Lots of really helpful information.There was also a lot of coverage of engaging the opposite sex. Lots of really good information that I will try out if my wife ever lets me date."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"Intro--Your facial expressions, gestures, head movements, eye contact, and posture all communicate, either congruently or incongruently, with what you are speaking. BODY LANGUAGE is an excellent, highly recommended book that explores the meaning of our non-verbal communication. The book is fun, interesting, and highly informative in addition to being useful and practical. It is not necessarily scholarly but nevertheless an important primer on a very fascinating subject, body language (kinesics).Develop Perception of One's Behavior(s)--The book, I believe, will help one to become \\"perceptive.\\" That is, from reading the book, carefully, one will be able to discern the contradictions in one's words and actions. E.g., if some one tells you that she is very interested in what you have to say, then takes a seat, folds her legs, crosses one arm over her lap, looks down, and then covers the mouth, you can be confident in believing the person is in fact not at all interested. Obviously, this is an extreme example. However, taken piece by piece, the legs crossed indicates a defensive posture. The one arm crossed is also a defensive posture, a barrier between the the person and speaker. Looking down indicates disapproval, and the hand over the mouth suggests a critical evaluation. The hand to the mouth gesture could also indicate uncertainty.Business Applications--The book has many useful and varied applications for business professionals, particularly people in sales. You will learn effective techniques in communication to build rapport with clients and convey your message confidently. Further, you will learn effective techniques on not only how to conduct an interview but on how to read the non-verbal cues interviewees signal during an interview. Nevertheless, I would be very careful in presuming anything about non-verbal messages.Permanent Frown--I hope you are smiling while reading this review, because it is true that your mouth can develop a permanent frown over time. You should definitely smile more, and \\"humor sells\\" as the book explains. =DDating--Yes, the book also discusses behavior patterns that indicate whether some one is interested in another person. E.g., our feet, the direction in which they are pointing, can indicate our dis/interest in a person. Additional \\"courting signals\\" could be exposed wrists (such as holding our hand up with a cigarette in our hand) or the \\"macho\\" position, in which a man stands with his legs open and thumbs in his belt.Conclusion--The book will help you become more aware of your own behavior, perhaps if you are \\"submissive\\" or \\"negative\\" and need to change your behavior to project a more \\"confident\\" or \\"positive\\" image. As I stated, the book is not very scholarly but still useful and important for one to better understand the meaning of non-verbal communication. Nevertheless, I still feel compelled to caution anyone who reads this book in attempting to immediately apply the concepts covered. Remember that all non-verbal communication must be viewed in a certain context and also in clusters."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"An interesting look at the importance of body language in communication both to get a message across and to understand what others of telling you non-verbally. You'd be surprised at some of the messages that you're giving off. Whether or not it is the definitive book on the subject, I can't say, but it's worth a read."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"I thought this book was a great read for anyone interested in learning about people.

I have been using these techniques for years without realizing it. One point that stood out was when we say we're good at reading people, we are actually reading a person's body language and noticing there is no congruency between their words and actions. Again, this is a great reference book."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"At first I was a bit skeptical about this book. However it has exceeded my expectations for reading the non-verbal clues in my personal and business life. I feel that I have become a much better communicator after reading applying the principles of this book. It's a very easy read and all their information is backed up by the latest research. The easy to follow pictures and illustrations enhance the concepts. You will be quick to figure out when someone is not giving you the full story, they think they are superior to you or what your boss thinks of your proposal. It even goes as far as how to set up your office to make meetings more relaxed or more official."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"I chose it by reviewing online through Amazon site.I'm impressed and satisfied.

As he did so, I noticed something odd he did with his hand. At first his hand was in the dominant \\"palm down,\\" position, to which he immediately switched to a more submissive \\"palm up\\" position. He flashed me a fancy smile, and pitched his goods.

Likewise, I have read several internet sites that share some, but never close to all of the info within this book.Overall the book has been very fun and interesting, the only thing I've seen that is in anyway lacking is how to improve my own body language. A few tips so far (remember I haven't finished yet), but not much - although some of that can be inferrred as just avoiding negative body language.It's a good read. and I recommend it highly.Also, if anyone has read other body language books and prefers them to this one, please send me a message.

Allan and Barbara Pease have presented a book that isolates, examines each component of body language and then explains it with entertaining clarity. This book is full of illustrations, examples and pictures that will help you to more effectively recognize and decode the nonverbal messages of others. Study this book and you will improve your ability to sell, manage, lead, and negotiate. If you want to improve your communication with your spouse, friends, colleagues or members of the opposite sex, this book will give you a leg up.The book covers a wide range of nonverbal behaviors such as hand gestures, body postures, and eye signals. The section on the thirteen most common gestures is interesting, providing tips on the meaning of different head nods, stances and sitting postures.If you are looking for tips on how to navigate office politics, you might enjoy their tips on where to sit in meetings, how to use interpersonal space and how to recognize the signals of deceit.This is by far the most entertaining book on the topic of body language. However, if you are looking for a more scholarly approach to this topic, you might check outEmotions Revealed, Second Edition: Recognizing Faces and Feelings to Improve Communication and Emotional Lifeby Dr. Paul Ekman, who has done more research on this topic than any other living person.

There is little scientific information about how to communicate with body language and how to use the body language they describe.

There were a few things that were never even gone over, like top palm hand displays, especially with women and nails, or within a fighting/opponent context, and within certain cultures, but the more you study the more you will learn. It covers a lot and gives many references and studies one can look into more thoroughly. The only thing I personally didn't like was, the journalist writing style, it is written for the &#34;average&#34; New York Times best seller book reader, and binding is just as horrible. It does it's job, and you will learn to &#34;read&#34; those around you and hopefully use that to improve your relationships with others.

I bought specifically this book on body language from reading the reviews of others and I'm so happy I did."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"\\"The Definitive Book of Body Language\\" very thoroughly covers all kinds of body language signs and how to read them. This book is a must if you want to understand people and certainly if you want to increase your success in business or in your personal life. In fact, I cite this book in my dating book for men, \\"Changing Your Game\\" - if a man can learn to read women, his options increase dramatically.This book covers the gamut: the art of reading people, hand/thumb gestures, handshakes, facial expressions, arm signals, cultural differences in reading people, signs of deceit, eye signals, signs of dominance, attraction/sexual signs, and much more. It has lots of pictures, diagrams, and examples.The one negative, and it isn't really a negative, is that the authors are from the UK, so Americans won't be as familiar with some of the examples (e.g. Tony Blair, the Beckhams, etc).Good book."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"I don't think I really paid attention to people's body language in the past. If I did, it was completely subconscious.Could I generally get what people were telling me? Yes.Did I rely mostly on the intonation of the voice and words chosen? Yes.Have I been using the skills I learned from this book everyday since I started reading? Yes.I'm sure this book has given me just enough knowledge to be dangerous. When I see somebody crossing their arms, for instance, I now get nervous that they are closing themselves off, perhaps disagreeing with me. I try to remind myself of how the Peases implore the reader to not let one gesture or pose incorrectly make you jump to a conclusion on their mental state... so I usually check myself.For the people complaining about the jokes or the politics in the book... get over it. It's supposed to be lighthearted, and they try to be fairly equal opportunity about things. It's written by a husband and wife, and the conversational tone is something I really appreciated. This could become a very dry subject if written in a different way, but the Peases pulled off a simply fun book from start to finish.Worth it to buy the book and read multiple times. Improve your personal and professional life more than you'd ever imagine."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"I have read many books on the subject of body language.

So I am practicing on him and it is working.LOL Good thing I am dating a relatively honest person.haha"},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"Allan Pease and Barbara Pease apply their experience in medicine, biology and psychology to illustrate the workings of the brain and how this influences our body language. In the Definite Book Of Body Language, the authors show us how we can use our knowledge of the brain's functions to understand people's emotions and behaviors.I have to say that neuropsychology and behavioral science have always fascinated me. There are many books out there about these topics. But I found this one particularly interesting as it covered real life examples which you can undertake to practice reading people's emotions and behaviors.I would recommend this guide to everyone really. Whether you are interviewer, a manager, a teacher, businessperson, someone looking for a job, or for a partner, this book can help you understand other people's behavior and perhaps overcome communicational barriers. It does serve as a great premier especially if you are not entirely familiar with the psychology of body language."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"Overall: This book was exactly what I was looking for. It does not go into every type of common body gesture, but definitely enough to keep you busy for a while. Immediately after I started reading this book I began to notice the behaviors in myself and my colleagues. I think this book is more useful for reading people in social or personal situations because it is much easier to accurately read someone's body language in a purer/ more natural state. For example, in a business meeting a colleague may rub their chin. The book would say that can indicate someone who is thinking/contemplating and secondary gestures should be watched to indicate what their decision may be. In a business meeting that same gesture could be a cover up for day dreaming, an attempt to please their boss or simply trying to stay awake. When I make assumptions based on the book in business settings I have been wrong because so many factors could lead to the emotion that is creating the language and most of which have nothing to do with me or the current interaction. In personal settings it is spot on and can sometimes be very entertaining. The chapter talking about women and what their facial expressions indicate is priceless and men should read it just so they know when to chance course in their behavior or conversation.On a social front I tested out some of the attractive and open female gestures in courting or even talking with men and they certainly do work. For example showing the inner wrist is supposed to be a sign of openness and femininity and when I casually had that part facing I was treated much differently.Layout: The material is interesting, but the illustrations and simple descriptions make the lessons learned in this book easy to remember. They also make connections to the animal kingdom or how the gesture evolved from a functional action when possible which helps me remember and feel more engaged with the material. The author also has a sense of humor and provides the right about of space and breaks in the text with humor, pictures and examples to keep it from getting too dry. This layout also follows the tell you, tell you again and tell you what they told you approach so you can even read it in public and watch for the behaviors while you are reading.There is not a whole lot I would change about this book except the claims are much greater than anyone can possibly make. Sure it can help you read someone's true feelings, attract people more easily and tell when someone is lying, but it is not a surefire method and cannot make you successful in all types of interpersonal situations on its own. This is just a tool and should be clearly described as such."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"This was the first book I purchased regarding body language and I am so very glad I did.

In addition, he placed these pictures of these figures besides animals to create great contrast so that we could remember and recall with ease. He also used great and easy to depict drawing to illustrate his points.I have read/buy many books on body language and in my opinion this book beats them flat down whether you are improving your relationship, aceing interviews, getting ladies, and so forth!"},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"This was the first book on this subject that I read. I found it very interesting and entertaining. I believe that the book is thought of as an overview of great range of topics, instead of going deep into few.As an engineer I found the book a bit \\"silly\\" in the beginning but then I realized that the nature of the book is such that one should not expect great formally presented wisdom. If you want to open your eyes for body language with out reading 10 advanced books, this is the book you should read.Topics covered: Job interviews, meetings, pictures, \\"your image\\", difference between men and women, tall and short people, how to structure your office, how to take advantage of your body-structure (gender, height...) etc.I was originally looking for a more formal educating book, but in the end I believe that this is exactly what I needed!"},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"Filled with photographs and illustrations the authors have included dozens of examples of politicians and celebrities revealing their feelings and motives through non-verbal communication. A good book to share with a friend, start a conversation, or even use as a primer for a short class on non-verbal communication.Most people would not intentionally dismiss messages someone is sending verbally or refuse to understand the jargon within their profession. To do so would be foolish and extremely arrogant. Why is it acceptable to ignore clear and powerful messages communicated through body language?The information provided by the authors can be of benefit to almost anyone interested in increasing their ability to communicate more effectively with others in a face-to-face setting.From a teaching perspective I would have preferred endnotes or footnotes for the sources on the statics and other research discussed by the authors. They provide a reference list but without any connection to the text. I found myself wanting more information to support their claims. However, even without further documentation, the text is beneficial and I'm glad I own a copy."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"As an author, I am naturally a student of observation, so this book had the potential to be of great service to me not only in my writing, but in character-building and expression.I enjoyed the read. Unlike some other Body Language books, this one has a lot of photographs, and at the risk of sounding sophomoric, they really added to my understanding of the text.The chapters/categories made a lot of sense, and the information moved along with little unnecessary repetition. I think everyone who reads this book will have their eyes opened, and begin to read body language everywhere they go.The only thing that bugged me was that the authors used evolution to explain much of the human's use of body language. I didn't find their theories believable, and evolution explanations really weren't necessary. I would expect some reference to the ape-man, Neanderthal, etc, but these authors referred to them with a fervor akin to proselytizing. This shortcoming is the only thing that held me back from leaving 5-stars.

This husband and wife team has spent the last thirty years researching the science of body language and consulting for speakers, actors, businesspeople, and politicians.Understanding the principles of body language can be a useful tool for reading an audience, developing rapport with a prospective client, or effectively delivering a message. This book is a wry and lively review of what everyone should know about body language. Numerous examples are issued in the form of celebrity photos, which are analyzed fully. A memorable section is written on the most common gestures of liars, (including facial touching and change of eye contact) with many examples of contemporary politicians as photographed during speeches and testimony.Most of the content is geared towards businesspeople and at times the book feels a bit like finishing school for MBA's. For example, a full chapter is based on the social hierarchy of seating arrangements for conference tables.Another chapter is dedicated the do's and don'ts of handshaking, including local variations. Detailed advice is given for dealing with problematic handshakers in what could be described as combat maneuvers for handshake jiu-jitsu. For example, a dominant \\"palm down\\" handshake used by assertive CEO's can be countered by a gentle two handed clasp with slight wrist rotation to level the playing field during an initial encounter. Furthermore, for photo opportunities, handshaking toward one's left side almost always communicates a position of greater power and authority.In a delightful section on how to offend other cultures, regional differences are fully explored, including variations in the use of personal space and the appropriateness of touching in various cultures. Basic hand gestures are explored thoroughly. As an example, the symbol for \\"Okay\\" in North America can be interpreted as \\"worthless\\" in France or construed as a sexual insult in Turkey.In addition to being humorous and entertaining, this book is amazingly useful. It deserves a place on the shelf of anyone interested in communicating effectively and working with other people. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"I agree that this THE \\"definitive\\" book on body language. I have read many books on the subject---for no other reason than I find it fascinating--and this book is the best, in my opinion.Pros: All body signal are covered---soup to nuts. They also explain the theory behind each gesture, which really makes you think, \\"Ahh . . . that makes complete sense.\\" You are taught how to read body movements in clusters, which is quite different than a single gesture. Things are put into context, which I feel is very important to driving home a point. I like the fact that when they explain a certain gesture someone makes, not only do they explain what the gesture means, but they also provide advice for dealing with it. e.g. What you should do when closes their eyes for long \\"blinks\\" when talking with you, with their hands on their hips. Additionally, they provide little \\"tests\\" for you to conduct with other (unknowing) people to really understand what you are reading is true. Finally, the book does use a lot of examples that are geared toward business relationships.Cons: I found the section on courtship displays a little dry. I guess it is because I am a middle-aged, married man with kids, and at this point in life care little about courtships. ;-) They also have a section on \\"props\\" and what they really mean (glasses, cigarettes, etc.) that I found somewhat boring.All in all I give this five stars. Regardless if you are new to learning body language or (more importantly) if you are fairly adept and want to learn more---this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"These two folks make an enormous amount of unattributed statements. If authors do that, one would hope that they would reference a specific assertion to an actual source. No such luck in this book. In the first chapter they state that recent mri scans show women have more areas of communication in their brains then do men. This may or not be true, they cite no source for this statement so the non-comatose reader can check out the validity of their statement.Neither of them, from what I can deduce, are doctors. This entire book is 'science or studies show....'. How can one write a non-fiction book and not backup at least some of their statements. If you like pop psychology this book might be useful for light reading. The lack of footnotes or specific attributions kills this book for me."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"I decided to pick this up with a few of Paul Ekman's books. Then when I started reading through it, he was mentioned in it more than a few times. Everything this book says, every other book already says in the same way \\"look at clusters, and look at context, and look at congruency/lack there of.\\" That's kind of disappointing because I thought I would get some information that was new. It is a decent read. The writing isn't serious by my standards in anyway. It was kind of annoying. I didn't think any of it was funny at all.To its credit, it does go through and explain why we send the messages we send and how. And then at the end it tests you with pictures and a specific number of signs. That was kind of difficult because the art work could have been better to what they wanted from you. It was black and white lines instead of actual people. Some of it was obvious, other parts not so much like certain facial expressions.I would pick this up if this is your first book on reading people.

Or when someone lies, they tend to put their hand by their mouth? This extremely informational book does an extraordinary job of telling you exactly why people act the way they do. The authors, Allan and Barbara Pease have a witty sense of humor when it comes to explaining things, yet still get the point across.A favorite part of the book for me, was when they explained how since your legs are the farthest from your brain, you have less control over them. Therefore, your legs give away most of what your feeling. For an example; if you tap your foot, it could be a sign of not wanting to be there.I think the most important part of the book, is that not all people are the same. And to \\"read\\" them properly you have to take into consideration the rest of their body. People can be misread quite easily if you don't put the \\"sentence\\" together; to put in \\"all of the words.\\"If you take an interest in \\"reading minds,\\" or want to do better in business opportunities, or attract a \\"mate\\" easier, than this book is for you.

Pease does an excellent job of telling you what to look for.We as people give ourselves away so easily by our gestures, and even if we can keep one telling sign in check, other parts of our body will speak volumes by the small gestures that we make.

It is a combination of lessons on manners, subconscious mind and communication.

One will learn good sales and negotiation tricks that are helpful during interview process, or office politics and power play. For well rounded business person, this book is a must have. Add to it work on NLP, emotional intelligence and business ethics and one can conquer it all. While some may find this book to be a tool on teaching manipulation, others will find it to be a useful too on staying ahead of the game. The only disagreement I have with the authors is in reference to the use of cell phone during interview process. I totally disagree that it is acceptable to act \\"busy and important\\" during interview process regardless if one is in the waiting area or in the room with the person interviewing them. If person interviewing you would rather take a phone call than listen to what you have to say during scheduled interview time, it is a sign that your interview is either not going well or you have lost the game already to another candidate. Why get more vulgar and add oil to the fire by making or receiving cell phone call. Your cell phone should be off (or in your car) while you are in the interview room.

The information you want to know is easy to find and to understand. There are a lot of interesting little bits of information everywhere and it was a pretty good read."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"Reviewed by Irene Watson for Reader Views (7/06)How often do we look at a person, while listening to what they are saying, and wonder if they are telling the truth? Or, how often are we puzzled by the gestures of the person talking because they don't reflect what he or she is saying? Allan and Barbara Pease offer a text-book like version of all the gestures imaginable - many we've done ourselves and didn't realize we were sending mixed messages.The Pease's included actual photos, many of politicians, illustrations, as well as true-life stories. When they are asked if a person can fake body language they claim that no one can \`because the lack of congruence that is likely to occur between the main gestures, the body's micro-signals and the spoken word.\\" The authors also claim that \\"body language is easier to fake with men than with women because, overall, men aren't good readers of body language.\\"In this near 400 page book the Pease's explain many gestures. They explain palm power, handshakes, smiles, arm signals, hand and thumb gestures, space invading, and many others. They delve into the most common gestures that we do and see daily, e.g. nod, head shake, picking imaginary lint, stance. An interest to travelers or those dealing with people from other cultures will find the section on \\"Cultural Differences\\" most informative. When President Bush was seen holding hands with Saudi Prince Abdullah the gesture made the headlines and much controversy occurred. However, according to the Saudi culture, \\"if a Saudi man holds another man's hand it's a sign of mutual respect. But don't do it in Australia, Texas or Liverpool, England.\\" Also, as Westerners, and including Europeans, we \\"blow [our] noses into a handkerchief or tissue while Asians and Japanese spit or snort. Each is appalled by what they see as the other's \`disgusting' behavior.\\"It is obvious that the authors have done their research before compiling all the information into this book. It would be hard to find something missing, or in fact to disagree with them. The book is easy to understand, easy to read, and makes a very good reference book.Book received free of charge."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"I'm not just saying to buy this book because I have to as part of the assignment.

If you are truly interested in th subject then you probably will end up like me with several books that you can continually reference.

One thing that struck me was that Sigmund Freud was right about how much we think about sex (though he isn't mentioned in this book) - there is a lot of consideration of a future mating partner (I use the word 'mating' because this book references a lot of primates' actions as a pre-evolutionary version of ours) as we evaluate others of the opposite sex.As a guy, this is helping me see, literally, what others are thinking despite what they may be saying. I say this because women are naturally more perceptive to body language. So this is especially useful, say if you're in business, and you're unsure why people don't seem to like you in a conversation with a potential client, and you'd really like to close a deal. If they're crossing their arms, it means they're defensive. So get them to hold something, like a photograph, or ask them if they'd like a drink. Surprisingly their frame of mind may completely change because the defensive mindset has been removed simply by uncrossing their arms.You learn cool stuff like that in this book. You'll read it and as you go along, you'll be saying, \\"Wow, I never knew that doing ____ with [part of body] meant that I was ____. But of course that's what it means - it's so obvious!

I would go to the library, search for keywords of the topic, and put whatever information I find into a paper. To meet the minimum word requirement, I would expand a good piece of information I find to several paragraphs, and I would also make the fonts a little bigger.This book seems it has done all that. It has some useful information, but often a single piece of information is explained using 5 pages where a few sentences are really enough. There are some scientific experiments that are irrelevant to the topic discussed, but are there to make it seem credible. Most information, however, is based on the author's personal opinions without any scientific proof, and a simple piece of opinion is, again, explained using many pages. I can't really say the author is wrong on her opinions though, because, well, let me put it this way: It's like I can say anything about aliens -- I can't prove any of the arguments, but you can't disprove them either.The Amazon book rating system is a great way for buyers to decide how good a book is.

I read a (quite expensive, mind you) book from the Library calledDetecting Lies and Deceit: The Psychology of Lying and the Implications for Professional Practice (Wiley Series in Psychology of Crime, Policing and Law). This is written like a peer reviewed journal by a expert at lie detection, he essentially tells you the 'fool proof' ways of detecting lies in this book are bunk. This section being so inaccurate makes me question the accuracy of other sections."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"The postulations made by the authors themselves are dangerously unskilled. The book itself is highly outdated. By that I am referring to the fact that the majority of the researched used to bolster the author's opinions are studies/works published in the 50s/60s/70s (for a book written in 2004).There were double contradictions all throughout the book and there was a horrible amount of redundancy that could have been eliminated by an unbiased editor.There are better books out there. And by better I mean more accurate and more widely respected."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"I've found this book to be accurate in it's descriptions of gestures and postures and the attitudes they foster or perpetuate. The information as it applies to how a gesture cluster or posture means about the person adopting it are true. Solid from that aspect. The authors think rather highly of themselves, however, and make some pretty bold claims throughout the entire book. They actually make the statement in the beginning of the book that the world was daft of the knowledge of body language until their first book was published in the 70's! On top of the monstrous ego this book hauls around with it are some pretty far out speculations on where and how these gestures developed. The authors try to relate everything we do now as it has come about since the missing link's need for survival. To top it off the authors fancy themselves comedians of sorts. They weave in horrible jokes with the lists of meanings making the line between rest of the information and the lead-ins blurry.So if you feel you can wade through a sense of self-importance the size of Texas, brave bad jokes and wild evolutionary and psychological speculation then have at because the information is good after you wash it off with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"This book is slightly enigmatic, it certainly is (at least a little) cashing in on the TV show \\"Lie to Me\\", though then that's not too surprising because the show is based on the work of a real person. However Paul Ekman did not write this book and is merely cited a lot, probably more than anyone else (from a cursory glance at the references).Just like the TV show, this book focuses on the large signs (which is just as well as Ekman's work indicates that most people can't see the small signs anyway, even if they are aware of them, see \\"Wizards Project\\"). And it does so very well, and to the point, however it derails itself every once in a while when it talks down to the reader. Some of the slurs are not so unexpected as the authors are Australian (like myself) and we are rather racist (though not in a mean way). Cultural sensitivities are a concern and the book addresses this, but then proceeds to tell us that if we aren't aware of at least N many we should never leave the country we are in and discover other cultures.To me this raises a question: why is this book about body language, which declares over and over again that it deals with the common factors only, telling me I'm a bad (or at least ignorant) person because I don't know what (for instance) various hand signals mean. This wouldn't bother me so much, if a lot of the meanings for Europe (or at least Germany, where I grew up) weren't subtly wrong. The base information isn't as complete as it could be and although they do try to cover some of their own unawareness factors by saying that various countries are being Americanized. Undoubtedly true, but if you want to deal with that topic, you probably want to deal with it more completely and current. Still, when you say some people shouldn't be issued a passport because they lack awareness and \\"are probably an American\\" (pg 111 in hard cover), I wonder about the rest of the book, and how this passed by the editor.Still, the crux of the book is good and easy to verify anyway. Just motion the motion and be critical of your own feelings and you see how they make you feel to assess what the book tells you. Also the chapter on seating positions was very interesting, but again it raises more questions and fails to address them.As others have pointed out this is not a scholarly work. Though filled with references, it is dressed to suit the general public and is meant as a light read. The information is mostly true though the treatment is superficial. If you want to learn about this in depth, this is a book that will get you started but from there you'll want to find titles that (at least) deal with signal clusters in greater depth, though most areas could be addressed far deeper."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"This book is definitely better than some of the body language books out there but it is certainly not the best. The biggest problem with the book in my opinion is that the author goes on and on and on. Most chapters could be summarized into a couple of pages and the writing style is very showy (\\"Let me tell you something most people would never dream of!...\\"). The illustrations are terrible and at times are confusing or ineffective as an examples of what to look for.Instead of this I would recommend \\"What every body is saying\\" by Joe Navarro and ex-FBI interrogator. The book unlike this one is straight to the point and has better/more information presented in a much better format. He also comments on a lot of personal experiences/observations that, while are not backed by any scientific studies, are relevant considering his line of work and are extremely insightful."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"400 pages about the way your body communicates may seem a little overwhelming, but this book proves to be a really fun and simple read. The Definitive Book of Body Language covers way more than just what simple body language means, but where it comes from and how to read it. Reading this book made me more aware of those around me, and has helped me catch things about my own body language that I have not previously experienced. This book is ultra helpful in noting the cultural differences, as well as power and class differences, when it comes to body communication. This book would be very useful if you are going to travel abroad and want to give yourself some precautions, so as not to offend other cultures. There does not seem to be any real bias in the text, as it attempts to cover all angles as to why we communicate the way we do with our bodies. For instance, the authors discuss very interesting natural body reactions to certain emotions that have links to our own evolution. They also discuss things in our own environment that shape the way our body language evolves, such as television. Gender studies in the book are very strong, as it points out many of the strengths and weaknesses men and women have in reading and communicating body language. If you are interested in finding out what categories of communication you fall into (i.e. passive, dominant, flirtatious, etc.) this book is rather helpful in revealing those truths--you may not be aware! For the things you do that you are unaware of, this book can help teach you how to change your thoughts which adversely will change the way you present yourself. The book offers many answers to common questions: Can you teach yourself to lie and not be detected? What kind of handshake communicates what? Can you cross your arms and not come off as guarded? There are plenty of social scenarios that this book addresses, such as dating, business, law enforcement, friendships, etc. It was really intriguing how these different situations also fit within our personal space limitations. There are a vast number of examples and illustrations that help demonstrate the types of body language discussed; most interesting are those of celebrities and public figures. So whether you are interested in facial expressions, eye contact, legs, hands, or gestures this book covers it all, and does so in a humorous manner. The humor in combination with the imagery makes it very easy to remember the concepts addressed in the text. The only qualms I have about this book is the level of repetition of examples, however, this can serve as a good learning device and is hardly noticeable unless you are reading the book cover to cover. Overall, I highly recommend this book if you are interested in figuring out and perfecting others' perceptions of you or if you want to be able to decipher others' signals to give yourself power in interpersonal communication."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"I each non-verbal communication at a university.

Navarro's book seemed more strictly focused on body language signals and interpretations, while \\"The Definitive Book\\" seemed to delve into the same things and also how they apply in real world situations (interviews, courtships, etc.).I believe other reviewers have mentioned that the authors of \\"The Definitive Book\\" do not cite their sources or mix in opinions with research so that it's hard to tell the difference. Example: \\"Simply put, the more he can make her laugh, the more attractive she will find him. This is because the ability to make others laugh is perceived as a dominant trait and women prefer dominant males, while males prefer subordinate females.\\" No research or studies were cited and it sounds like an opinion to me, but since I'm not writing a paper on this I don't really care either way. It should be noted that the authors did cite specific researchers and experiments with most of the information they presented.The authors did occasionally tell jokes that didn't really seem to make the point they intended to. However, they were still funny so I was not bothered by them.The book covers a wide range of topics from how to tell if someone is lying to how to behave in interviews and business situations. I learned a lot from this book and have begun to paying attention to other's body language to try to hone my body language reading skills.Overall, this was both an entertaining and informative book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Definitive Book of Body Language","review":"I have read a few books on the subject and as far as overall scope, this book is it. Very easy to read, has a few jokes here and there, and interesting little tidbits that i found spot on. Example:when passing people in a crowded hallway, woman passing a man tend to turn her chest away to pass, while a man will turn his chest toward the female.when you cross your arms, do you cross the right over the left or the left over the right? Did you know that 70% of people tend to do this in a certain way? (answer in the book)So are you going to be a Body Language expert after this book... no, however it gives you a great base-line on where to start and as with most things (see Malcolm Gladwell's -'Outliers' or Geoff Colvin -'Talent is Overrated') it's going to take practice (a lot of it) to become an expert.Here's something you can do while you wait for the book in the mail: while watching TV (when people are interacting) mute the sound... see if you can pick up on what is going on, what are the emotions, and notice the mannerisms and gestures. Then if you have a DVR rewind and unmute or if you don't then just unmute the TV and see if you were right.Overall I would highly recommend this book. Now onto my next one....

Aside from the shooting script for the movie it gives a lot of historical background information on the Firefly 'verse as well as some of Joss Whedon's and the cast's musings on Firefly and the making of Serenity. The illustrations and artwork included in this tome are beautiful and inspired. All in all if you are a fan of the series Firefly and/or the Serenity motion picture, you will enjoy this insightful little treasure."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"If you have questions about the now released movie Serenity based on the short lived tv series Firefly, this book is the place for the answers.

If you can't get enough of the BDS, BDM, or their BDH, then this is absolutely for you. I'm very happy with my purchase. (It's soo shiny!)"},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"Like many book lovers, I buy way, way more books than I read or could possibly read. Friends come over, look at my thousands of books, and absurdly ask, \\"Have you read all of these?\\" Well, of course not. So, a few years ago I bought SERENITY: THE OFFICIAL VISUAL COMPANION shortly after it came out. I'd looked at some of the pictures, but basically put it up on my bookshelf beside my other TV books.Recently, however, I got SERENITY on Blu-ray (which, by the way, is far more worth the money than FIREFLY on Blu-ray--while the TV series was only marginally better on Blu-ray, SERENITY is improved dramatically, but I'll deal with all this when I get around to reviewing that disc) as an upgrade on the DVD Collector's Edition, which was in turn an upgrade over the original DVD (I really do hope that this is the last time I ever have to purchase SERENITY). To celebrate this I decided finally to read THE OFFICIAL VISUAL COMPANION. And I can without hesitation recommend it. The interview with Joss Whedon is a great one. The sketches and storyboards included in the volume are great. And the shooting script adds new dimensions to the movie. It is a great supplement to the movie.Although I got the Blu-ray disc when it came back, I'm only now ready to watch it. I've seen SERENITY 5 or 6 times so I wasn't feeling too pressed to watch it again, though I did rewatch several of my favorite scenes just to check out how good the Blu-ray looked. But interestingly after reading this book I'm more excited to see the film again than ever. I'm sure it is just as good a read immediately after seeing it. However you decide to use it, if you are a fan of SERENITY, this is a must own book."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"Take my love, take my land, but don't take this book. Here is the perfect companion to the movie. Full of large colorful photos and loads of insights, you'll love reading interviews with Joss and seeing the development behind one of the best Sci-fi movies of the generation."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"A fine addition to my collection of Sci-Fi movies companion books. I am primarily interested in viewing the storyboards, concept art, design, and good quality stills (hate those books that rely on grainy low-resolution pictures to fill their pages) of movies I enjoyed. This book delivers a fine balance of visual information and engaging and amusing prose for fans of this \\"universe\\"."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"I thought I was getting a ham sandwich and they gave me a pig! Much more than I expected. A must-have for fans."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"SERENITY is Heaven and Joss Wheedon is the St. Peter of this truly impressionable and artistically-crafted world that has caught everyone's fancy and fired the imagination with the flames of creativity and excellence!"},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"Starts with beautiful pictures, witty interviews, the script, story boards. Some not so pretty pictures (bad guys). Do not open before seeing the movie, because you will read it and be spoiled. But come home after the movie and enjoy. This is a quality product. I enjoyed the guide to OMWF, but this surpassed that."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"This is the shooting script for the movie \\"Serenity,\\" but it only starts there. It's also a long interview with creator Joss Whedon on the show \\"Firefly,\\" what roles he originally envisioned for the characters and how the actors embodied them, all the different elements that went into creating a TV show like few others, and all the great insider stuff that fans burn to know. Then there are the extras...The definitive (since it's from Joss) history of how the 'Verse got that way. How the government is set up. How the war for Unification began with the best of good intentions. And how a young man named Malcolm Reynolds volunteered. Star maps. Tons of photos from both sides of the camera. Production drawings of weapons, ships, costumes (including some beautifully drawn samples of Inara that I'd like to see available as prints), and every major set. Long notes from Joss about lighting, direction, and cinematography. Quotes from the cast about their characters. Storyboards for the exciting fight and chase scenes. Oh, and the script, written in Joss' trademarked style and including scenes you won't see in the movie.This is like a DVD extra you can get before the movie is released."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"If you have any interest in the movie Serenity or the tv show Firefly, you NEED to buy this book. Chances are, if you're a Firefly/Serenity fan, you probably have some interest and/or questions about how Joss Whedon came up with his ideas for all of the characters and all of the other aspects of the Firefly 'verse. Well, they're probably answered in this book. There is just tons of information in here that probably would have been revealed over time if Firefly had continued as a series, but that I didn't know and probably never would have found out about if I hadn't bought this. Seriously, if you really want to fully understand the Firefly 'verse, this book is essential. The information you'll glean from this book is worth so much more than the sub-$14 price tag. If you have (will soon have) the Firefly (Serenity) dvd sets, you also should buy this book. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"Large and very high quality, glossy paper (you can't tell from the picture). Gorgeous shots from the movie and from the set, beautiful artist renditions of costumes, sets and scenes from the movie. Interviews, storyboards and extras for the biggest fans, just the pictures themselves are worth it for me. My compliments to Joss Whedon and the Firefly/Serenity team for this lovely visual companion, this is a MUST HAVE!"},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"I really got my money's worth in this book. I bought it primarily for the pretty pictures, and there are certainly plenty to look at. But it also included the full shooting script of the movie, a wonderful interview with Joss Whedon (the writer/director), and lots of blurbs about the world of the movie, and words from each actor about their characters. There was tons of production art too, but of course my favorites were the stills from the movie."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"Ah. Truly sweet. A lengthy intro from Joss about the making of the movie and the Firefly universe, followed by the screenplay (including a few deleted scenes), all interlaced with numerous gorgeous color shots. A wonderful book for anyone with interest in the movie, or the 'Verse."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"This is a very well put together book, with lots of very good quality photos and shots from the movie, a number of interviews with Joss Whedon, cast and crew, and the full shooting script. The interviews have a lot of background info. Even as a casual fan, I am very pleased with it; die-hard browncoats probably have it already."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"I remember being impressed a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away from that of Joss Whedon's \\"Serenity\\" when they published the scripts for the original \\"Star Wars\\" films with pre-production paintings and storyboards. So it is with a profound sense of understatement that I can tell you that \\"Serenity: The Official Visual Companion\\" is the proverbial much, much more. There certainly are the promised visuals, consisting of dozens of pieces of not only production art and storyboard but also movie stills. Being able to see a production painting of a deserted street on Miranda next to a photograph of the actual set, the storyboards for the escape from the Reavers on Lilac, the conceptual art for the Alliance spaceships, and Inara's costume designs are all worth the looking. But there is a far amount of worthwhile reading between these covers as well and that is what makes this companion volume essential for fans.The cover trumpets that this book has an introduction and the motion picture screenplay by JOSS WHEDON, but in between the cheery welcome to the book and the full shooting script (i.e., it includes scenes cut form the final edit) there is 32-page interview with Whedon conducted by Abbie Bernstein. In it Joss talks about how he originally developed \\"Firefly\\" and its main characters, how he had the opportunity to make a movie version, and what it was like making the film. So this is an in-depth interview and not simply a case of ten or twenty questions. But, wait, boys and girls, there is more, because in the pages of that interview you will find Whedon's pre-production memos on \\"A Brief History of the Universe circa 2507 A.D.,\\" \\"Frame/Lens/Perspective,\\" \\"Light,\\" and \\"Music\\" (Yes, Joss has even worked out what music will be like in 500 years). We have known for some time that Whedon pays attention to detail, and here is the textual evidence that proves the point. Bernstein does a good job of not just setting up Whedon, who always provides long replies to any and all questions, but also of asking questions about things fans want to hear about (you will find out more about the series and the film from this interview than you will from listening to the commentary track Joss made for the DVD and that commentary track was not hay).Consequently, this is much more than a visual companion, as stunning as that part of the book can be. Once you read all of the background material you can sit down with the shooting script and follow along while watching the film to see not only what has been altered or deleted, but also to enjoy Whedon's stage directions (If you read any of the script books for \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" then you know there are always some fun little comments worked into his scripts). This is an absolute must have volume for the legion of fans of the television show and theatrical film. Final note: I thought the blue tinted shot of River with Mal's head behind her that appears on the cover of the \\"Serenity\\" premium trading cards binder looked pretty good and while they follow the same basic design with the cover for this book they have used a much better shot of Summer Glau as River (plus adding a shot of Firefly in flight from the binder's back cover rather than the Serenity symbol). The \\"Serenity\\" poster that is available is actually a cross between the two, the original River with the Firefly from this one, which is good, but not great."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"AFTER you see the movie, this book gives you all the juicy info about how it became what it is. Besides the shooting script, Joss explains how he came up with Firefly and the true story of how the movie came to be made.The movie is an awesome accomplishment: fitting about 2 years of TV show into 2 hours, while making the story comprehensible to new viewers. This book is truly the perfect companion."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"The Official Visual Companion is excellent for its graphics, stills, and production artwork from the filming processes alone. However, it touches upon almost every element of the production process as well. It is not a text book for film production, nothing is dealt with in great detail, but each element IS touched upon where it is most appropriate: Inara's costumes, Reaver make-up, etc. Fans of Joss Whedon will love the Meemos at the beginning, offering insights into his intentions and the tools he used to tell his story on multiple levels. The shooting script itself is priceless to answer almost every question you could have of the film, from \\"was that reaver REALLY a femail?\\" to \\"What does Mal REALLY say when he's telling off Inara?\\"Good stuff."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"I came to \\"Firefly\\" backwards - I saw one episode on TV and was underwhelmed, but went to see \\"Serenity\\" with my 24-year-old-son. I was hooked, and went back to see all the episodes of the series. I'm a big fan of \\"behind the scenes\\" books about films anyway, and this one was nicely packaged, with excellent photography and lovely production illustrations. Reading the script demonstrates just how well-written the film was, and how much the actors continued to bring to their roles. Best of all was the interview with Joss Whedon and the \\"mee-mos\\" he wrote to the crew, outlining his vision. The book was worth it just for those! You'll go back to this one again and again!Why only four stars? Fully 3/4 of the book is the script - not a bad thing, but I'd like to have seen a couple of longer interviews with the cast, or the other production crew, or something - in short, what's there is great, but I'd like more \\"meat.\\""},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"I was so excited to get this book. The pictures and artwork are beautiful. There is a script in the back so be warned if you are waiting for the movie. This book is a must for any browncoat. I felt that it added to the paperback. So you are warned if you hate spoilers. I am just excited that there is merchandise for a show I truly loved. It is very informative on the making of Serenity. The book is beautiful."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"As a big fan of Firefly and Serenity this book made the sting of not having anymore new episodes to watch a bit less.Beautiful drawings, photos, and plenty of behind the scenes information on the characters and settings made this a treasure.Every Browncoat needs one!"},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"Serenity is one of the most technically perfect movies I've seen, and the Visual Companion provides an in-depth look at not only the shooting script, but Joss' memos, behind-the-scenes musings, and his intent in crafting the 'verse of Firefly/Serenity."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"This is truly a companion for teh movie.

I watch the show almost daily. And of course if you're a fan of the show then you're going to love the movie, which is named after their ship, Serenity. I fell in love with the movie and what did I do after I watched it? I went to Amazon.com. That's where I found the Official Visual Companion. As you can tell by the title this book it has fantastic pictures and stills right from the movie. I wasn't quite sure what I was getting when I ordered this book so I was pleasantly surprised to find an interview with the creator of 'Firefly', writer and director of 'Serenity', Joss Whedon. And being a huge Buffy fan that I am I like to read anything Joss. He gives great answers in this interview, but some of the questions didn't seem to be given any thought. Another pleasant surprise I got with this book is that it has the complete script of the movie! Even the scenes that were cut! I'll be honest, if you're not a fan, which I don't know why you wouldn't want to be, obviously there's no reason to buy this book...unless you're buying it as a gift for a fan. If you're kind of a fan then there's still no reason to get this book. This book is for devoted, crazy, browcoat, 'want to own my own ship and have a crew' kind of fan. Those fans need this book. Get it!"},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"Does a great job of giving you inside info on how Joss saw the movie, nice art, and the conmplete screenplay (with translated chinese for the phrases, and a few notes on some tiny scene cuts from the final print.)But, overall, feels much thinner then many other making of books I have purcased. Seems like a lot less information and \\"making of\\" stuff, since most the book is the script.So, I loved the 1st hour I spent with the book, and after that, pretty much wished there was more."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"Wow...who would have ever thought a year ago or so that we'd be seeing a book...any book, on this great, short-lived TV show that was never given a chance to blossom by the numbskulls at Fox. I hope the film does huge business so creator Joss Whedon can rub their noses in it.Like all the great Visual Companion books it contains a wealth of information about the film including some great photography, pre-productions sketchs, finished art, storyboards, as well as the complete shooting script. There are great concept drawings of ships and weapons as well. But the best part of the book is the lengthy interview with Whedon himself which reveals a lot of information about the Firefly universe. Great stuff and a must have for fans."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"Length:: 0:21 MinsSerenity Official Visual Companion is like the director's commentary that goes on DVD. In this book, it's an in-depth interview with director Joss Whedon on the world of Serenity.Joss Whedon talks about everything inside and outside of the movie. He talks about his inspiration, writing style, favourite scenes, Firefly (of course!) and its world, challenges, casting and all the other usual things you find in a \\"making of\\" book.The 40 pages of interview provide a very good behind-the-scenes look at how the movie was produced. There are plenty of stories on shooting, the scenes, stunts and working with all the different actors and crew on set.Just after the interview is the full shooting script for the movie. It is laid out with set photos, storyboards and concept art.

The visual guide has stunning pictures, and yes, I went ahead and read the script before I saw the movie. I am the kind of person who looks at the last page occasionally to see if I want to bother reading the book. It did not spoil the movie for me - rather I noticed things that I might not have seen on the first viewing.The background (given in this guide) was wonderful, though. I loved Joss's candid explanations of the way his world works - why everyone speaks both Chinese and English fluently, what was behind the war (fought in Serenity valley, in part), what drives the crew dynamics.I actually fell in love with the character of Jayne - which was totally unexpected - hated him at first. But you've gotta admire someone who always speaks his mind and hang the consequences. (Of course, everyone loves Kaylee.)The Serenity guide just enhances the whole Firefly/Serenity experience. It lets you jump into Joss's world with both feet, and drift for days. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"I enjoy this book, primarily for the costuming pictures and other good information. Unfortunately, it doesn't have as much information as I'd hoped, though it is useful during gaming occasionally.It's strictly about the movie, and doesn't have the information I was looking for, about Firefly-class ships and background and such, and the costuming wasn't as in-depth either.Still, it's interesting and good to have around if you really loved the movie. It does have the full script in it, including some parts that were cut from the movie."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"You get the full shooting script including the translated Mandarin Chinese and some deleted lines. You get details that go by to quickly in the film and production art. You get brief thoughts on the characters by the actors who play them. You get Joss's technical direction.

Joss discusses anything and everything you would want to know about the characters, about the ship, and about the 'verse. He discusses the entire mythology as we know it at length. He also discusses some of the more technical jargon for real film buffs as the book progresses, including his philosophies on the use of lighting.The book is also sprinkled with comments by the actors on their charactrs, which is a real hidden treat. It's great fun to hear exactly how Adam Baldwin views Jayne, or the way Alan Tudyk approaches Wash.The shooting script is the real centerpiece, and no matter how many times you've seen the film, it's not redundant. You get to see Joss' descriptions before they came to life - not to mention the deleted scenes still intact. So it's the original story that Joss wanted to tell, before it hit the screen and he began making cuts.Besides all this, there are innumerable renderings of original and scrapped production art from vehicles like the Mule to items as small as the pulse beacon.My personal favorite was the up-close spread of The Reavers, showing their make-up and costuming in detail, which is hard to spot in the film.Overall, this book is a lot of fun for anybody who's aching to know more about Firefly and Serenity. It doesn't get any better than this."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"I love Serenity, Firefly, anything Joss Whedon doses is bound to be good.

And if that's not enough to move yo to buy it, it has amazing pictures, original sketches of scenes, and behind the scenes information that we all were dying to know about! One last thing this amazing book has is the MEE- MOS. In case you have no idea what that is it's memos, but that's how Joss Whedon put's it so, huh.Even if you are not a die-hard fan, you should still buy it because it will completely blow your mind!!WE HAVE TAKEN BACK THE SKY!!"},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"This book is awesome.

It reads like a book-long interview with Joss, and includes a full shooting script, although NOT in original format, which I found disappointing - but the book as a whole overwhelms any slight disappointment I'd felt about this detail.There are really interesting pre-production memos and drawings. The book also includes Joss' explanations of the Serenity/Firefly universe, some of his angst over adapting characters and stories intended for a long run on television to a two-hour movie, and wonderful photography. The book itself is well designed, absolutely beautiful to hold and page through.It was well worth the money."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"A cross between a script book and a making of book, this fantastically illustrated release combines the magnificent full shooting script of Joss Whedon's superb Firefly spin-off Serenity with a great Joss interview, fantastic production memos by Joss (including a guide to the Firefly universe), quotes from all the cast and crew, and tonnes of great pictures and artwork. There's also a fun introduction by Joss himself.Browncoats across the galaxy should snap it up."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"I'm just realizing that this is the fifth Firefly/Serenity related item I'm writing a review for--which means I actually possess five items...and that gives me cause for concern.Why? Because, despite many years of exposure and occasional moderate-to-fan-like interest in other sci-fi series--including Babylon 5, Farscape, an occasional Dr. Who, Star Trek, Enterprise, Stargate SG1, plus several I'm sure to have missed--I've never actually bought five of anything relating to just one short-lived TV series plus a movie; or for any of those other series. I attended a Star Trek convention once, but that was because it was in the same city as I lived then...I detect a worrying trend that has to do with the development of an addiction, and this book here may well be one of the bricks in the wall sealing my fate. It's got the shooting script, such as they saw fit to publish, plus lots of photos and interspersed production materials, as well as a lengthy and revealing introduction.A great fix for addicts, and a treasure of thought provoking stuff for me in my writer/film-maker persona.Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, SELADIENNA, CONTINUITY SLIPP.S.

There's still the Serenity soundtrack."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"Sorry about the punLots of wonderful pictures and tidbits from Joss himself.

Like the characters on the show, Firefly has been fighting an uphill battle all its life, a battle that continues after the release of the excellent, well-reviewed, but vastly under-attended feature film, Serenity. Firefly's life has never been easy, but it has always been interesting, and this nicely laid-out screenplay/companion book, filled with story boards, production photos, fascinating interviews and insights, and beautiful shots from the movie, just makes it clear how much of a labor of love Serenity truly is."},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"From the pages of insight from the man Whedon himself, to the very pretty stills of the very pretty actors, to the gorgous preproduction art, to the script complete with cut scenes, there is no place on this book that I wouldn't put-- hee.

Also, because this is the shooting script, it isn't the exact same as the movie, a few lines have been changed in the movie, and things have been cut from the script present in this book.But like I said, this is a must have for any Browncoat.You can't stop the signal"},{"Title":"Serenity Official Visual Companion","review":"I bought this for my husband for Christmas.

Many people fear growing old - being irrelevant, being ignored - and worse, being useless. In the church today, there are programs for people in the \\"and beyond\\" age category with a mission that fulfills one clich&eacute; or another. Older people have \\"paid their dues\\" and now this is \\"there time\\" to enjoy each other, spending their time only with each other doing crafts, having lunch - because they have no real ability to commit to the important work of the Kingdom. Well, if you believe that any of this is true, you not only have a serious problem, but you need to read this book.The way this book is organized helps to keep the reader engaged. Each chapter includes the author's perspective on the role of the more seasoned members of the Christian community as well as a biographical sketch of an important woman who have served the church. Sketches of these godly women include Win Couchman, Eliza Davis George, and Evelyn Christenson.\\"To finish well\\" is the essential message of the book, to encourage women that growing old does not mean that our ministry is over and passing the torch is something we must do when we can start receiving social security. No, ministry persists, and sometimes change, but we're called to be diligent in our service to the end.This book, while clearly inviting senior Christians to be bold in their desire to serve God, will also challenge them in their comfort zones. The author affirms that she has to keep herself in check. In her attitude, she wants to avoid propagating certain myths about older generations. \\"Am I resistant to change?\\" \\"Do I want to be merely entertained?\\" and \\"Do I consider children and young people in the church a noisy distraction rather than an opportunity to love and nurture the next generation?\\" (p. 158)This is an important book for both men and women to read as I believe much of what she says definitely resonates across gender lines. But especially for women in ministry, this is an important book from which to glean wisdom and understanding through the passion and experience of godly examples of womanhood."},{"Title":"Looking Forward to the Rest of Your Life?: Embracing Midlife and Beyond","review":"Having read Risk Takers for God by Lorry Lutz and having personally met this amazing woman I was expectant in reading this book. I was deeply impressesd and I have given the book to a number of people. The personal life stories of the women are so helpful and climax with the best story of all. The book will inspire vision for the later years in a woman's life, giving practical assistance including financial wisdom."},{"Title":"Millionaire Boy: The Adventures of a Game Show Contestant","review":"Like many people, I had watched the WWTBAM show since its beginning in 1999 and hoped and wished to get on the show. When I saw this book it looked very intriguing. I just had to read it. Although I haven't been on the show myself, I have been the companion-person of one of the ten contestants in the &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, but who was not quite fast enough to get into the Hot Seat. I have tried numerous times to qualify for the show via the Phone Game myself, but without success.This book describes, in humorous style, the author's qualification process, and relates a story of the joys and frustrations associated with it. It also tells of the excitement and fun of being notified, when choosen to be on the Show, and the trip and experience of New York City and the WWTBAM taping.Equally interesting is the story of the subsequent time between Show taping and &quot;air&quot; dates, the experiences after the show &quot;airs&quot;, and when the substantial show winnings check arrives.The author is a good story teller, and with a great deal of humor relates a fun story of his experiences getting choosen for, going to New York City, being on the WWTBAM and winning a substantial amount of money, but unfortunately not the full one million dollars.I highly recommend this book, and have gotten favorable responses from several friends and family, to whom I have given a copy as a gift.

The case for Christianity is stated in simple language and the basics of this religion are explained very well. Everyone should own this book."},{"Title":"Steps to Christ","review":"THE BOOKAfter reading this book, I read it over, and some chapters over and over again. It is short, simple, but VERY deep even for a well-studied Christian - The chapters on repentance, confession absolutely broke my heart - the the chapters on faith and Growing up in Christ put me back on my feet and gave me hope! I have started to make amends and to correct wrongs Ez 33:15 which I read in the book, and have started to learn to look to Christ and to be focused on him, not on my self and my short comings.THE AUTHORThe author's life and works speak for themselves, initially I didn't want to read anything by her because of controversy. To be honest - I also feared if I read what she said I would be moved to change things in my life. I have read many of her books now, and have been moved to change, vanities and the things of earth are less appealing and I have sooo much more self control in appetite and other lusts of the flesh. When reading internet \\"gossip\\" about the author I noticed much of the claims were straight out lies! and the authors used very ungodly means to get their point across - would God use lies to lead people in the right direction?? I had to ask my self that, because after a short study of EG Whites writings and first-hand and from the critics, I learned they were taking things out of context and inventing things to slander her image.

I definitely think that anyone who honestly approaches the core of the book's message, is able to have a more completing understand about God's love. Great book, I am still giving only 3 stars because I need to read more about the author and this way I hope to grasp more completely an understanding about Her goals, backgrounds and/or issues that make people so unloving about her books.

This book deals with that.One of the things that I've found is that many people miss out on the power that God's grace give us to live out the Gospel. The power of the gospel empowers us to live victoriously.You will not find just ideas, but scripture is quoted throughout the entire book. It's not long or complicated. This is not about the latest fad in Christianity or the next superstar Christian teachers ideas, but it always points back to Scripture as the guide rather than the backup for idea.

If eternal life were granted on any condition short of this, then the happiness of the whole universe would be imperiled.\\" Here again we see the works of righteousness as wrought by man being the determining factor. The righteousness of Christ is imputed to the Christian and we do not need to depend upon our own works of righteousness. We need not go to bed at night worrying if we have become righteous enough to merit eternal life.The Christian is God's workmanship. Eph. 2:9-10 For by grace you have been saved (past tense) through faith. And this is not of your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.\\" The Christian progresses in the faith as God works within him or her to become more like His Son Jesus. This is what the doctrine of sanctification is all about namely our spiritual growth.The author like most Seventh Day Adventists, eventually brings one back under the law as obedience 'the condition of eternal life\\". This view traditionally is recognized as the heresy that the Apostle Paul battled with the Judaizers who invaded the churches of Galatia. The covenant the Church is under is the New Covenant, not the Old Covenant. And the New Covenant is not a mere rehash of the Old with only the place of the law (all 603 of them??) being written on our hearts."},{"Title":"Steps to Christ","review":"Please be aware that this book is by Seventh-day Adventist author Ellen G.

There is no denying that the designs have intricate, exquisite details, and the finished products are gorgeous. I especially admire the high-heeled shoes and the violin, both with floral and leaf accents.However, these cakes are much better suited for display windows than for plates. I am a cake decorator looking for design ideas, and I suspect most brides looking for wedding cake inspiration would not choose any of the designs in this book, unless they had an unlimited cake budget and a preference for very modern styles.I'm no Colette Peters, but I love her books because at least you can take her ideas and adapt them--create one or two tiers instead of six, or skip the pounds of luster dust and use beads or ribbons. These designs would be extraordinarily difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to make. They're all fondant, with draping and other details that don't translate into better-tasting buttercream. When I look at these pictures, I can't help but be impressed by the details and the technical skill, but for all the elegance, the cakes lack personalized charm.I applaud the contributers and Vincent for this compilation of distinctive, original designs.

I have had opportunity to purchase and use many books during that time and I've had the chance to take additional classes for myself as well.Kerry Vincent's book is like being in class with a wonderful teacher. The designs are beautifully executed and her instructions are detailed, yet easy to read and understand. The pictures of the cakes are well presented and clear (unlike some books I have seen) and there is an abundance of &quot;how-to&quot; pictures for those of us who grasp a concept better by seeing it than by reading about it. Her tips on transporting and setting up the finished product are great as well.I would recommend this book without hesitation to anyone, beginner or professional, who is interested in working with rolled fondant or is simply looking for some inspiration to improve their own work in the area."},{"Title":"Romantic Wedding Cakes (Merehurst Cake Decorating)","review":"I collect wedding cake books,and have for 14 years. this book is a wealth of modern information and fresh ideas.

While I doubt I'll ever be asked to recreate a cake from this book, the instructions are INVALUABLE. This is a definate MUST HAVE for the serious cake decorator. Tons of hints and tips and ideas to help you create your own masterpieces. Plus, there's a section with instructions for dressing up the table and an extensive list of suppliers from around the world. I highly recommend this book . . . great job Kerry!!"},{"Title":"Romantic Wedding Cakes (Merehurst Cake Decorating)","review":"The designs in this book are exquisite, no doubt about it. But to copy even some of the elements, much less an entire cake, you would need TONS of specialty equipment that could easy set you back hundreds and hundreds of dollars. Unique veiners, cutters, mats, push molds, beadmakers, stencils -- the list goes on and on. And no, you can't duplicate the effects without this equipment. That expense, coupled with the minimum 30-40 hours of decorating work I'd estimate for each cake, puts these designs way out of the reach of all the brides in my area, and probably most of them anywhere. A good book for oohing and aahing, but unless you've got oodles of money and time to burn, not actually useful."},{"Title":"Romantic Wedding Cakes (Merehurst Cake Decorating)","review":"Romantic Wedding Cakes (Merehurst Cake Decorating)Chosen and commissioned by Merehurst to design and develop the first international wedding cake book, Kerry Vincent, an Australian national living and designing in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has created a work in sugar artistry for the experienced decorator. Steeped in European history and the haute couture of France, her cakes of majesty have gained her international recognition as a sugar art designer.Ms. Vincent invented the Vincent Marquetry (an inlay technique) which is featured on a cake-top plaque gracing the exquisite Peche Belle La Russe cake where, inlaid purple flowers brushed with mauve luster dust and other blossoms with silk-white luster dust it sits on a crown of miniature carnations. On the bottom tier, this three-tired couture-inspired cake has sumptuous drapes pleated around the bottom tier while acanthus leaves curve under carnations. They stand tall, marching around the second tier. Matching bonbonieres (favors) shaped as domes, decorated with carnations, acanthus leaves, tiny violets and trips of sugar-silk ribbons enhance the cake design.Another invention is the unique 'organza sugar pleat' featured on the Simply Pretty in Pink cake. Seamless strips of rolled fondant folded and wrapped overlapping around the cake are confined by pleated ruffles with molded buttons which have been brushed with red pearl luster dust.With her artistic vision established in tradition, Ms Vincent presents several cakes in the architectural majesty of the European past. Simpler to create than most, the Stylish Satin Sugar Roses model is wrapped sugar-satin roses which stand in a molded-sugar vase that tops an elegant five-tired cake embellished with 150 acanthus leaves brushed with antique silk luster dust and anchored with roses. The Breathtaking in Brides Lace cake, a majestic testament to the institution of marriage, reveals Ms. Vincent's dedication to bringing the highest standards of design and workmanship to her art. This four-tired dramatic architectural form, a tribute to Christian Lacroix, is wrapped in lace, draped in sugar-ribbon, and adorned in swages that are secured with lisianthus flowers. A cake of understated elegance is Reception Confection. A superbly draped cake-stand gives the illusion of height for a small two-tired wedding cake. Milk-chocolate-colored grosgrain ribbons, roses, primroses, and stylized leaves are artfully placed. The Mosaic Magic cake, reminiscent of ancient mosaic tradition, is updated with magnificently crafted hydrangeas and balloon flowers. The top is a moulded-sugar vase filled with gold ribbon loops and the same sugar flowers. Ms. Vincent suggests sugar-mosaic gift tags to match the wedding cake which may be placed on the brides table.Ms. Vincent's formal cakes excel. The Marquise de Pompadour cake, reminiscent of the Marquise's lifestyle, reveals the elegance of jewelry design in sugar. Medallions, suggesting golden topaz surrounded by pearls, superbly ornament the sides of the four-tiered cake. Drapes and ribbons at the side caught by jewels add richness to the bottom tier. A very fashionable cake, Pretty Petals-Precious Pastels, is covered in rolled fondant, which is sponged with salmon-pink and white food coloring, and when dried, is brushed with antique luster dust. Stenciled ribbons and tassels complete the cake and magnificent polka-dotted and stripped camellias add drama. A delightful and sophisticated groom's cake, Sea Shades Shimmer, has jewel-toned tropical fish artfully arranged on sand-colored fondant-covered white chocolate. Each fish is individually sculptured and painted with pale-green, green-gold, ruby and teal luster dusts.Attesting to true greatness in art, Ms. Vincent promotes decorators with promise. Although each guest cake is extraordinary, two are favorites. A crown of pale peach roses adorns the A Jewel in the Crown guest cake by Scott Ferguson. Splendid in three tiers, pale peach roses are tastefully interspersed among beveled lace leaves that adorn the two top tiers. White mini bells dusted with silk-white luster dust delicately hang over four magnificent Maharaja-type chocolate elephants which stand on the third tier whose side designs are framed filigree panels. They hold garlands of jasmine finger flowers in their trunks, which traditional thinking suggests will bring the wedding couple good luck. The Fantasia Roseta Romantica, a guest cake by Rosa Viacava De Ortega, features ruched dotted-Swiss sugar drapes with crocheted-like sugar trim. Pale pink fantasy flowers are positioned delicately, and patterned bows and ribbon tails sit on top. Each of the four tiers is on a separate acrylic stand creating the effect of cakes floating in air.Because weddings are filled with little memorable extras, Ms. Vincent has added several \\"touches of elegance\\" which may please the discriminating bride. Three of several catch the eye: The Tussie Mussie, a sugar Victorian posy holder embossed using metal strips, ornamented with sugar lace and filled with sugarpaste flowers of choice. The Romantic Foot First is a collection of dazzling sugar footwear for the bride's table, each assembled on a Vincent Marquetry Plaque for display. The Petite Guilded Cottage, dedicated to Lord Wedgwood who encouraged Ms. Vincent in her career, is resplendent in gold and white. Tiers in a Teacup, tiny individual stacked cakes sitting atop elegant china cups are a timely design.Extensive instructions are provided for the cake decorations and the memorable extras. Templates also provided for flowers and side designs. Ms. Vincent's signature recipes are included, as are her notes on decorating. Guest Donna Davis instructs on the decorating the cake table.Kerry Vincent's Romantic Weddings will set the standard of wedding cakes for years. Every experienced cake decorator who desires to earn serious money for his/her work should have this book. Because knowledge about the basics of cake decorating and sugar work is necessary, dedicated amateurs will find Romantic Wedding Cakes an exciting challenge, beginners may gain inspiration, and the aficionados may experience delight.A most splendid cake in lace is Love is in the Air. It is decorated in pale teal rolled fondant and flounced with sugar eyelet lace; each eyelet is circled in antique silk luster dust.The All That Glitters cake, dramatic with gold scrolls and pearls, is topped with an ornate crown."},{"Title":"Romantic Wedding Cakes (Merehurst Cake Decorating)","review":"It was a pleasant surprise to be asked to be one of the 'guest decorators' in Kerry Vincent's book, &quot;Romantic Wedding Cakes&quot;. Until I saw the book in print, I didn't fully realize what an honor it was for my work to be included with Kerry's innovative sugar art that was planned and decorated with such precision.While at the photographers studio during the shooting of some of the works, I was impressed with the attention given to every aspect of the display and it's presentation.

Although some of the work is outstanding, the cake colors are pretty much the same throughout the book. The flowers do not look natural and flat leaves are far from normal! With all the effort that was put into this book, I was expecting ideas that would be useful. Many of the tools that she uses are NOT widely available, therefore making it difficult to even attempt to do any of the cakes. In most parts of the country, it is very difficult to get anyone to pay what it would take to do any of these cakes. For the most part, Kerry's work is beautiful, but I would like to see less lustre dust (gold or pearl) and more natural looking flowers and greenery. ...The cakes by the other artists were for the most part, the best part of the book."},{"Title":"Romantic Wedding Cakes (Merehurst Cake Decorating)","review":"Ostentatious and gaudy!

A bride who I am doing a wedding cake for asked for the \\"All that Glitters\\" cake so I went out and bought the book. I keep flipping through the pages. There is only one problem I see with it. Every cake requires many special tools, fondant cutters, etc. This is good and bad since while expensive, it brings the designs within the grasp of newbie cake decorators. The problem is that the desciptions of the tools are not clear enough to easily find them on the web. There is a list of suppliers but no indication of what came from where. The only suggestion I would have would be to have a list for every cake listing suppliers and actual model numbers for the tools.I'm looking forward to the next book by Kerry Vincent greatly."},{"Title":"Romantic Wedding Cakes (Merehurst Cake Decorating)","review":"I love the designs in this book.

Being a friend of Kerry's, I saw many of the cakes in the book during their production and I know the amount of work and thought that went into each project. Even having seen some of the edited text before publication as the book progressed, I was still amazed at the quality of the final copy. The pictures are extremely clear and detailed and the instructions are complete and concise. It is a very usable book for the decorator to increase their upscale business and for the prospective bride to fine a truly unique cake design. I have quite an extensive collection of wedding cake books and have seen none with the attention to detail that this book has.

I have known Kerry for years, and she personally sparked my resurgance into the world of quality sugar craft. I know Kerry fought hard to have other sugar artists included in her book, and we all had to submit proposals and show previous works to the publisher before the approval was granted. Thank you Kerry for going to bat for us. I know the selection of only four of us was a difficult task.The execution of only one project in this book was a great deal of work, but a labor of love. My project was very involved and used a lot of techniques relatively new to the sugar art community. Editing the text to fit into the book was quite a challenge, but every effort was made in all projects to list specific equipment and show step- by-step proceedures. I have received numerous corresponcance from others trying to duplicate my project. What an honor!I was so delighted to see the final book in print and was not the least bit dissapointed. Kerry has a definite style to her work that is so injoyable. Her attention to detail, no matter how simple the project, is a trait I so admire. This book appeals to many levels of readers- I know from personal contacts with them. This was definitely not a beginner's book, nor was it intended to be. It is full of exquisite workmanship we can all only strive to achieve.

The poll tax had been passed to raise money to support that war. Thoreau believed that the war with Mexico was an unjust war of greed and expansion on the part of the American government.Mark Twain was another \\"war protester\\".

A fiercely independent man, he writes what he feels and doesn't sugar-coat his thoughts. His ideas on a wide range of subjects are well thought out and original.

I highly recommend it, particularly to those interested in learning more about transcendentalist thought."},{"Title":"Civil Disobedience and Other Essays (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"I've been teaching \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" in the high school classroom for thirty years now. That novel's core dilemma is whether Huck should follow his own moral compass and help free Jim, or should he listen to the conventions of society (government, religion, social mores) and return Jim to his owner?That's why, when my students get to chapter 31, we read Thoreau's \\"Civil Disobedience.\\" Thoreau is anything but ambiguous as to what he would tell Huck:\\"That government is best which governs least....\\" And when carried to its ultimate goal, \\"That government is best which governs not at all.\\"So, when I went looking for a cheap, yet durable copy of \\"Civil Disobedience,\\" I immediately looked into Dover Publications. I already had a classroom set of that company's \\"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass\\" that I purchased in 1996, and they are still in excellent shape. So I figured durability was a given.

Thoreau seemed to put so eloquently into words what I already felt that I felt like shaking my metaphorical fist at the specter of authority. Every American should read this book."},{"Title":"Civil Disobedience and Other Essays (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"Possibly the best exemplar of what America truly stands for is Henry David Thoreau. The above title quite effectively summarizes the premise of Thoreau's CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. Unfortunately, this sentiment is no less true today than it was in Thoreau's time. The government he so despised supported slavery, the slaughter of Native Americans, and a war of conquest against Mexico. The majority of Americans today agree that the first two, at least, are quite disgraceful (though only in retrospect). Wars of conquest are just fine providing that you win. As Hitler said, \\"Nobody will ever ask the winner if he told the truth.\\" Few Americans would have minded that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction and nothing whatever to do with the destruction of the World Trade Center if Bush's war had been successful. They also do not mind that American corporations keep the majority of the world's population in unnecessary poverty and subjected to brutal \\"pro-American\\" dictatorships as long as the stolen wealth of these nations make them wealthier also. Now that these corporations are hoarding most of this stolen wealth for themselves, causing America's middle class to shrink and the number below the poverty to increase, it is likely that Americans will soon start minding corporate greed - at least at home.CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE is one of the books that was mentioned with mild approval in high school literature classes in the late 60's; perhaps that is why so few people ever read it. Certainly, those very few who actually read it, and acted upon its advice, were despised. Now that I have finally read it, I am astonished to find how \\"radical\\" it is. \\"Radical\\" being the term used to describe attitudes that are supposed to be both Christian and American (though the most vocal of today's Christians - the CORPORATE-WHORE sect -- revile those people who actually understand Christ and America as Godless traitors). This was the book that inspired Gandhi, who understood both the teaching of Christ and what America is really supposed to represent. It is not surprising that the hypocritical Reagan administration - the administration during which the gap between the wealthy and the middle class first started to skyrocket, corporate criminality blossomed, and a war supporting a dictatorial regime was illegally financed - adopted Thoreau's motto, \\"That government is best which governs least.\\" In fact, Thoreau asserts that legislators who put obstacles in the way of commerce \\"deserve to be classed and punished with those mischievous persons who put obstructions on the railroads.\\" If one only read the first few paragraphs of Thoreau, one might almost suppose that he was the Jesus Christ of corporate capitalism. Of course, in today's America, the corporations ARE essentially the government. When they claim they want a government that governs least they are actually declaring that they do not want Americans to have any control over them. It is mind-boggling that so many Americans lap this up. But citizens are taught to respect law rather than justice, to such a degree that they cannot distinguish between the two. \\"The mass of men serve the state thus, not as men mainly, but as machines, with their bodies.\\" The primary human trait that has made our history so ugly is that we permit ourselves to be manipulated by the voracious. Thinking clearly enough to look out for ourselves and our brethren is condemned as traitorous, and it is against the law.Cheney's response to being told that 71% of Americans opposed the war was, \\"So?\\" Even though it is clear now to the majority what has always been clear to radicals, (i.e. people who are not easily manipulated), that the war was for the sake of oil companies, Bush unabashedly boasts that \\"it was worth it.\\" Indeed, for his ilk, the war has turned out to be far more profitable than they had imagined. But in reality it has made America one of the most hated countries in the world, has turned Iraq into a breeding ground for terrorists, jacked up the price of oil (which is why it has been \\"worth it\\" for the oil magnates), and has made all thoughtful Americans profoundly ashamed of our country.We are now engaged in the mesmerizing media extravaganza known as voting for a new leader. An intelligent human can only respond, \\"So?\\" Thoreau points out the obvious: \\"All voting is a sort of gaming . . . with a slight moral tinge to it.\\" We can vote against evil rather than actually do anything to amend evil. America will stay in Iraq regardless of who is president. One cannot be accused of saying anything that is not already obvious by stating that the corporations decide for whom we are permitted to vote. The idea that we have a two party system is transparently false. What we really have are two factions of one party, namely the liberal and the conservative, of the corporate capitalist party. Though the difference between the two factions is not nearly as significant as it was thirty years ago since the corporations have nearly succeeded in destroying the labor unions, it does still make some difference which faction is in office. On the other hand, if our \\"masters\\" decide that they want a war with Iran, as it seems they do, then America will go to war with Iran regardless of for whom we elect as president. It is not as if our government's ethical code condemns concocting a disaster that they can blame on Iran to muster popular support for such a war.Getting rid of the draft was a cunning strategy. If all young Americans had to face combat we would quickly see mass protests. Now the military is far easier to control and the corporations have their own private militias - Blackwater and other CORPORATE THUGS beyond the control of Congress, the Pentagon, the puppet government of the occupied Iraq, and the Geneva Convention - which are nonetheless still paid for by taxpayers. (Is it being too paranoid to fantasize that different corporate factions might start vying for power so that we will see these thugs engaging in street wars just as the illegal gangster do)?It is noteworthy that while America - \\"the land of the free\\" - has just 6% of the world's population, it has 25% of the world's prison population. While I doubt that very many American are in prison for the crime of obeying their conscience rather than the law, is there any reason to think that Americans are so much more prone to criminality than other nationalities? Thoreau writes, \\"Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man is also a prison.\\" Thoreau was imprisoned for refusing to pay his tax-bill that supported the Mexican War and slavery. Since my income tax is taken from my paycheck before I ever see it, this mode of standing up for what I know to be right is barely an option. Even if it were, I should probably not take it. \\"If I deny the authority of the State when it presents its tax-bill, it will soon take and waste all my property, and so harass me and my children without end.\\" Gandhi and Thoreau had the sufficient courage and confidence to believe that their acts of defiance would accomplish something worthwhile, but I do not. I think I would merely ruin my marriage and my child's chance to get a college education, and only a handful of largely unsympathetic people would ever be aware of it. Jesus advised us, \\"Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's;\\" In other words, that might be interpreted to mean that we should pay our taxes. But how can one really do that in good conscience if those taxes support that which is clearly evil? If there is anyway in which I feel that I am a traitor to America, and a failure in doing what Jesus would do, it is that I obey unjust laws without doing anything more noteworthy to obey my conscience than writing essays such as this one."},{"Title":"Civil Disobedience and Other Essays (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"It's great to see this edition, a small, affordable and easily carried book for a day outing.

This Dover Thrift edition contains several important Thoreau tracts: Civil Disobedience, Slavery in Massachusetts, A Plea for Captain John Brown, Walking, and Life Without Principle. Thoreau also wrote the famous \\"Walden,\\" and several other influential pieces shaped by his sense of environment and his unwavering belief in the power of the individual.In \\"Civil Disobedience,\\" Thoreau discusses the role of the individual in society and government. Starting off with his famous statement, \\"That government is best which governs not at all,\\" Thoreau waxes philosophic about the role of the United States government in the Mexican War and slavery. Thoreau argues that majorities in a democracy decide what the laws are because they are the strongest element in society. According to Thoreau, what is law is not necessarily right, and just because the majority decides an issue doesn't automatically make that issue palatable to a man's conscience. Individuals can, and sometimes should, oppose the majority, and they can be right even if they are in the minority. Ultimately, if laws are not reliable beacons of truth, one should appeal to one's conscience to decide what is right and wrong. However, merely deciding something is wrong is not enough if that decision is not followed by concrete action. Thoreau criticizes the voting process in this context, since anybody can vote for something. Without action following a decision, voting or supporting something is useless. This essay also contains Thoreau's account of his stay in jail for failure to pay a tax.\\"A Plea for Captain John Brown\\" probably caused considerable controversy at the time of its writing. John Brown was the fire-breathing abolitionist who made the famous raid on Harper's Ferry in the 1850's. Brown eventually went to the gallows for his crimes while American citizens debated his actions. Most thought Brown a wacko, an extremely dangerous radical who threatened the social fabric of the country. Thoreau defends Brown in an essay both eloquent and nave. This is really a panegyric to an unrealistic man who used questionable methods to attain his goal. When Thoreau refers to Brown as \\"an angel of light,\\" it is necessary for the reader to remember Brown killed many people in cold blood.\\"Walking\\" is the centerpiece of this collection of essays. Thoreau starts his discussion by musing on the wonders of walking in the country (sans terre, or \\"sauntering\\"), and ends up discussing nature, the movements of mankind, work, and freedom. Thoreau feels we gave up something very special when we locked ourselves in our shops and devoted our days to long hours of work. Get out! Enjoy life! Admire the trees, a sunset, and the birds! Don't give up your freedom for a wage and dull toil! These are the things Thoreau urges upon us in this essay, and he certainly has a point. This is an amazing piece of writing because it is probably more relevant today than in Thoreau's time. At least in those days vast expanses of nature still existed. Today, we must climb into our little boxes with wheels and drive for miles before we see a small forest or some mountains, while elbowing our way through all the others doing the same thing. \\"Walking\\" is a beautiful testament to a bucolic life.I find Thoreau's writings vastly superior to anything Emerson wrote. Thoreau is more accessible, cares more about concrete issues, and seems like a nicer person. Thoreau comes across as the type of guy you could shoot the breeze with for an hour or so, whereas Emerson seems aloof and esoteric. Thoreau as a person is from an era long dead, but his words continue to resonate deeply in our souls. I think I'll go take a walk."},{"Title":"Civil Disobedience and Other Essays (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"If ever a document came close to matching the Gospels in detailing a way to live morally, it is Civil Disobedience. In a brief, clear, and concise essay Thoreau proffers a challenge to all men, &quot;not to cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for the right.&quot; In all my life, no words so simply and yet so profoundly has affected my view of our country and our world."},{"Title":"Civil Disobedience and Other Essays (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"It is unfortunate that Henry David Thoreau experience little renown in his lifetime, but I am glad to see that he is now recognized as one of the leading lights of American political philosophy, as he well deserves to be. His writings, which have influenced everyone from Martin Luther King Jr. to Ghandi to Robert A. Heinlein to Don Henley, are the very essence of the strength of invididualism and freedom of the spirit. Thoreau was vehemently against slavery (his two essays on the subject in this volume are so passionate that they may move you to tears), and the title essay is, of course, a classic in itself. Distilling the virtues of conscience over the mere created laws of man, Thoreau makes a very good case here for self-government, and I am surprised he is not more frequently cited by the Liberterian movement. His remembrance of when he spent a night in jail for refusing to pay his poll tax - in which he says he felt that the prison walls did not confine him, that he felt more free than ever inside them, that he came to feel sorry for the state and even pity them for resorting to such measures, and that he, in fact, felt like he was the only citizen who did pay his poll tax - I find truly inspiring. They just don't make men like that, anymore. While many of us may find it hard to be so idealistic about things, we are reminded, in reading this, of a time when people could - and did - truly die for what they believed in. One wonders what Thoreau would think of present-day America. Life Without Principle is another eye-opening piece, in which Thoreau condemns the American social system and job ladder. Walking is a classic that is still cited by conservationists everywhere, and that helped in a big way in the U.S.'s national parks movement. Seminal American writing in the tradition of Thomas Paine, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and other great American thinkers."},{"Title":"Civil Disobedience and Other Essays (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"I was very disappointed in the quality of the book. The typesetting is atrocious, with many misspellings. Very hard to read. Avoid this edition."},{"Title":"Civil Disobedience and Other Essays (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"Henry David Thoreau did not just think, he acted. In order to see which luxuries of life he could live without, he lived in a secluded area for two years near Walden pond. Instead of paying a poll tax he thought unjust, he spent a night in jail. Thoreau backed his thoughts with action, and this gives validity to many of his writings.Perhaps no work of Thoreau has been more influential than his essay &quot;Civil Disobedience.&quot; Many world leaders, including Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., drew inspiration from this classic treatise on passive, nonviolent resistance. Simply put, Thoreau did not believe in allowing government to take more of his personal liberty than he, Thoreau, was willing to surrender. He also believed that, as citizens under a government, people have the moral obligation to break any law they think unjust (provided it does not injure another). This is the basic premise of &quot;Civil Disobedience,&quot; that &quot;I do not lend myself to the wrong which I condemn.&quot;All of the essays in this collection are important, but none has the tremendous power of &quot;Civil Disobedience,&quot; one of the classics in American thought."},{"Title":"Civil Disobedience and Other Essays (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862), in his essays, expressed a point of view which continues to be relevant not only in the United States, but in any society that values civil liberties and democratic ideals. &quot;Civil Disobedience and Other Essays,&quot; from Dover Publications, brings together the title essay along with four other pieces: &quot;Slavery in Massachusetts,&quot; &quot;A Plea for Captain John Brown,&quot; &quot;Walking,&quot; and &quot;Life Without Principle.&quot;Reading Thoreau's work, I was struck by how much some of his ideals are echoed by a later United States activist: the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. Thoreau was passionately opposed to slavery. He also cast a critical eye on the concept of majority rule, and was concerned about the place of a minority within an unjust system of laws. He has some noteworthy thoughts on the U.S. Constitution.Thoreau is not just a &quot;theoretical&quot; radical; in the title essay he reflects on a night he spent in jail as a result of his civil disobedience (that event inspired the excellent play &quot;The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail,&quot; by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee). Thoreau's voice is still strong after all these years, and deserves to be heard by contemporary audiences.

He moved in the same circles of society-critical network as Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882), in the middle of the 19th century at the American east coast. Thoreau's \\"On the Duty of Civil Disobedience\\" has left behind world-wide effects: Gandhi carried it during his frequent prison stays in his pocket (later India attained home rule and racial integration), Hermann Hesse (Siddharta) was influenced, the resistance against Hitler-Germany used it for backbone-stabilization, Martin Luther King Jr. or Joan Baez were inspired by him, Bertrand Russell, Nelson Mandela or the philosopher Herbert Marcuse (19.7.1898-29.7.1979) took possession of Thoreau's patterns of thinking. Thoreau was ever convinced that he was not on earth to please anybody, but rather to be authentically. Of course Thoreau's rugged individualism is not the very first in the history of philosophy. Forerunner structures can be found in the \\"Antigone\\" of Sophokles (translated in earlier years by Thoreau himself) or in the thoughts of Confucius (well known to Thoreau) or in the essay of Boetie, a friend of the french philosopher Montaigne: Boetie wrote about \\"discours sur la servitude volontaire\\". As a guidance to nowadays political actions Thoreau's spectrum of opinions probably is no longer suitable. One should reflect on the more and more complicated administrative systems, the clever governments and political leaders, their artfulness of subterfuge, their underhand stratagems, the many snares layed out by laws and remissions, injunctions and decrees; don't forget the sometimes dull executive. They made themselves fitter than ever to overcome all sorts of social resistance. Instead of paying a poll tax Thoreau once upon a time spent a night in jail. Inspired from this classic treatise on passive, nonviolent resistance you may decide to make a sit-down-strike against crusaders and reverse-crusaders or an action, refusing to pay money for the electricity, because you like to restrain the atomic age: be sure: you will not change the direction of the politicians passing by. They will think you are a little bit farcical. To retreat obstinately into the wood living in a block hut alike Thoreau: I don't advise this method to the broad of the population in the present days, at least take a look at the medical supply situation thus worsened. Linguistically however could start a new era of Thoreau's effectiveness, if there were increasingly sensitive readers. A futile hope? Think about the sentence \\"I do not lend myself to the wrong which I condemn.\\" What sort of consequences and changing the rules of behaviour are TODAY necessary to realize such a direction of sef-reliance? Let's finish with another quotation of a sentence, which this extraordinary American philosopher wrote - and I never can forget these words like the one in the beginning of my review. He noted in his laconic style: \\"The lawyer's truth is consequence.\\" Means: Without action following a decision, supporting something is useless. It inspired me to write a book concerning \\"The Persistance of the Philosophers\\" - and to take a daily walk down by the riverside ..."},{"Title":"Civil Disobedience and Other Essays (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"This book is not only great unto itself, but it is a phenominal counterpoint to Socrates' Crito.

Coupled with the Crito, you get an interesting look at whether or not civil disobedience is acceptable."},{"Title":"Civil Disobedience and Other Essays (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"\\"There will never be a really free and enlightened State until the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power, from which all its own power and authority are derived, and treats him accordingly.\\"So concluded Henry David Thoreau in his seminal essay, \\"Civil Disobedience\\". Originally titled \\"Resistance to Civil Government\\", it was later published as \\"On the Duty of Civil Disobedience\\" because it was written in part as an answer to William Paley's \\"Of the Duty of Civil Obedience\\". This is somewhat confusing, however, since Thoreau makes it quite clear that he does NOT believe civil disobedience to be a duty, but rather thought it proper for people to be primarily concerned with the business of living: \\"I came into this world, not chiefly to make this a good place to live in, but to live in it, be it good or bad.\\" He said only that one should resist when failure to do so brings harm to others: \\"It is not a man's duty, as a matter of course, to devote himself to the eradication of any, even the most enormous wrong; he may still properly have other concerns to engage him; but it is his duty, at least, to wash his hands of it, and, if he gives it no thought longer, not to give it practically his support. If I devote myself to other pursuits and contemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do not pursue them sitting upon another man's shoulders. I must get off him first, that he may pursue his contemplations too.\\" (And even then he refrained from judging those who failed to resist out of, for example, fear of the consequences to their families.) (See Wendy McElroy's essay on \\"Civil Disobedience\\", particularly the penultimate section, \\"A duty to resist?\\").Really, the best way to review \\"Civil Disobedience\\" is to let Thoreau speak for himself. A few more key passages, starting with this early one expressing a clearly true, but rarely practiced, idea: \\"I think that we should be men first, and subjects afterward. It is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for the right.\\"\\"The mass of men serve the state thus, not as men mainly, but as machines, with their bodies.... In most cases there is no free exercise whatever of the judgment or of the moral sense.... Yet such as these even are commonly esteemed good citizens.... A very few, as heroes, patriots, martyrs, reformers in the great sense, and men, serve the state with their consciences also, and so necessarily resist it for the most part; and they are commonly treated as enemies by it.\\"\\"All men recognize the right of revolution; that is, the right to refuse allegiance to, and to resist, the government, when its tyranny or its inefficiency are great and unendurable. But almost all say that such is not the case now. But such was the case, they think, in the Revolution of '75. If one were to tell me that this was a bad government because it taxed certain foreign commodities brought to its ports, it is most probable that I should not make an ado about it, for I can do without them. All machines have their friction; and possibly this does enough good to counterbalance the evil. At any rate, it is a great evil to make a stir about it. But when the friction comes to have its machine, and oppression and robbery are organized, I say, let us not have such a machine any longer.\\"Unfortunately, Thoreau is not always entirely consistent. He opens with the motto, \\"'That government is best which governs least'\\", and continues, \\"Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe, -- 'That government is best which governs not at all'; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have.\\" The second proposition, however, does *not* necessarily follow from the first (depending on how one interprets it). And when Thoreau goes on to differentiate himself from the \\"no-government men\\" of his day, it becomes hard to tell what exactly he is advocating. Is he an anarchist, or not? A sort of gradualist anarchist, or what? (And indeed, scholars have debated precisely this point for many decades.) Thoreau basically tells us what he is against, but he is much more vague about what he is *for*. He asserts that \\"Government is at best but an expedient,\\" but never gives any argument for or content to this claim. This does not seem to be consistent with his conclusion with which I opened this review, and leaves us with little guidance as to what might be the *proper* functions of government, if any. So on the whole, \\"Civil Disobedience\\" is a very good essay, one might well say a *great* essay, but in some respects somewhat lacking or inconsistent.Also included in this collection are \\"Life Without Principle\\", \\"Slavery in Massachusetts\\", \\"A Plea for Captain John Brown\\", and \\"Walking\\". These essays are generally even more philosophically mixed than \\"Civil Disobedience\\" (in that he makes some poor arguments for unsound conclusions), but there is a lot of good material in them as well.\\"Life Without Principle\\" is perhaps the most interesting of these, though ultimately a bit disappointing. It sounds like a piece on what might be called \\"practical philosophy\\", like he will explain the importance of principles AS SUCH in daily living; instead, it's more on the \\"practical\\" side than the \\"philosophical\\" side, as he just offers a number of principles by way of advice on how to live well. It is by and large good advice, though he clearly has little or no understanding of economics, which leads him into one or two blunders. He really doesn't have that much to say about the subject of the title that is deeply insightful.\\"Slavery in Massachusetts\\" and \\"A Plea for Captain John Brown\\" are both passionate denunciations of slavery, and I certainly sympathize with Thoreau's sympathy for Brown, but there is more moral fervor here than practical solutions.\\"Walking\\" is about a certain way of life that includes an appreciation for nature, very reminiscent of parts of Walden. Thematically, it doesn't have much to do with \\"Civil Disobedience\\", but if you liked Walden, you'll probably enjoy this.(Note: This review refers to the Recorded Books audio edition narrated by Jefferson Mays, but as I can't find that product anywhere on Amazon, even by ISBN, I'm posting it here as these editions are evidently based on the same text and contain the same set of essays.)"},{"Title":"Massacre on the Lordsburg Road: A Tragedy of the Apache Wars (Elma Dill Russell Spencer Series in the West and Southwest)","review":"Today's news headlines of missing children and the search for them is not a new phenomenon. As we see in this book, Marc Simmons takes us way to 1883 to a remote corner of the then-New Mexico Territory where a husband and wife were killed and their son captured by members of the Chiracahua Apache tribe on an old dirt road between Silver City and Lordsburg.The author's story reveals three salient points. The first was that the attack by the Apaches came at such a late time in the period of the Indian Wars. By this time, all of the plains Indians, including the hardy Comanches, had been relegated to reservations for almost ten years. Most of the remaining tribes were either on reservations, on the run or located deep inside Mexico. The second fact was that the victims were prominent citizens of the Silver City community and that the deaths and their child's capture was broadcast via telegraph from coast to coast; this was a shadow on things to come in terms of publicity and sensationalism which revealed itself in the numerous speculative stories on where the child was located. The last point was that this incident spelled the end of the Chiracahuas as an effective fighting force. The hostility towards this group was so strong that the Army, after the tribe's surrender was obligated to ship most, if not all of the men, women and children of this tribe to Florida. Some were transferred to Fort Sill, Oklahoma and by the time they were moved again to the Mescalero Apache reservation in New Mexico, only a handful survived.The author admits that much of the early record of the lives of the victims was missing and the first chapter was full of speculation. The other thing that stands out is the speculation on what happened to the child Charley McComas. The author generally accepts the story that the child, who was taken by the Apaches, was taken into Mexico where he died some time later after the tribe's encounters with U.S. Army general George Crook's forces. The final chapters are essentially an epilog on what happened to main characters in this story, both white and Apache. I recommend this book highly. The book contains 205 pages of text, end notes, an index and a bibliography."},{"Title":"Family To Be (The Daddy Club) (Harlequin American Romance)","review":"Of all the Daddy club books this one was my favorite.

Camping in Hawaii never even occurred to me. Anyway, the Restaurant information was up to date and on point, and agreed thoroughly with each recommendation. Ditto for the outdoor and tourist information. This book is rich with information and is like a personal real life tour guide, with detailed historical and current information on each point of interest we visited.

I was looking for solid information about alternative, independent travel. I intended to camp with a friend for most of my vacation. As a female traveler, I was particularly interested in accurate, unbiased, first-hand descriptions about campgrounds and safety in order to make good decisions.The author described the camping situation poorly. Photos and descriptions lead me to believe that the county and state campgrounds would be beautiful, well maintained, and strict with the possibility of a few local families enjoying extended stays and who might resent tourists. Instead, I found the campgrounds to be not unlike roadside homeless shelters for meth addicts, particularly mid-week. Most were extremely close the main roads and often had the down and out living out of their cars in the parking lots. I'm not criticizing the locals or their situation, but knowing this before my trip would have changed my approach. Making the reader explicitly aware of such situations is critical to providing sage travel advice. Frankly, the author danced around this particular issue. When camping, there's a huge difference between having drug-free local folks who may resent visitors and dealing with drugged-out people who don't have a home. Nilsen also neglected to describe the campgrounds enough (e.g. road goes right by it...often have locals cooking in the bathroom and leaving lots of garbage...theft issues, safer on the weekends when families camp there, very safe and on-site caretakers, etc). After speaking with local friends we learned, that of the many campgrounds available, they would only recommend two or three for safety and aesthetic reasons. That's the type of advice I was seeking from the book but didn't receive.We also tested out the guide on the opposite end of the accommodation scale. We ended up having to stay at the Hyatt Regency Waikiki since all budget and moderate hotels were booked. The author describes the rooms as &quot;large and plush with the latest in adornment and amenities...nothing is skimped on when it comes to guest comforts...luxury.&quot; This review set me up to expect nothing short of a five-star hotel. In actuality, we arrived to extraordinarily dirty carpets in the halls and our small room, smoke in a non-smoking room, and Motel 6esque decor with no extra amenities. They may have had nice rooms somewhere in their building, but ours were 2-3 star quality with a 5-star view. This hotel was long in the tooth, which the book didn't recognize.The chasm between some of my actual experiences and the author's descriptions made me lose faith in the information in the guide book 1/2 way through my trip. Had I wanted budget accommodations and just some simple activity suggestions, I think this would be a sufficient guidebook.

One of the biggest problems in fantasy is a lack of originality. The author has brought in some fresh elements such as the new races of the Dreydan and Mehari. The magical system is also well done- I particularly like the idea of having to find all 6 people to complete the 7th circle. There were other creative elements as well. The idea of the rock snakes was a great way to compliment the Mehari race and provide transportation. I also thought the use of Lokanrel's blood to confuse and impassion the Nendar army an excellent plot device.One of the author's strengths is writing about the evil characters; the fact that they have their own motivations besides some generalized \`world domination' ads credibility to the story. I found myself relating to Thaklar more than any of the other characters. It's easy to see how things spill out of control and there's little doubt that he will become a fearsome enemy in the next book. (There is another book, right? =) )Unfortunately while the story itself was good, I think the writing style will be difficult for many readers to get used to.

The notes are great, however."},{"Title":"The lady of the lake","review":"INTRODUCTORY SYNOPSIS: The hero of THE LADY OF THE LAKE is James Stewart. To Ellen Douglas, the Lady of the Lake, he calls himself James Fitz-James and The Knight of Snowdoun. When, on a second visit, she declines his invitation to come with him to Stirling and become either James's wife (her interpretation) or his mistress (James's intent), the kind-hearted amourist proves a good loser and gives Ellen a ring to admit her instantly to his chum King James V should she ever need help. At poem's end, Ellen comes to Stirling to plead for both her imprisoned father, Lord James Douglas, onetime mentor of the youthful monarch, and for her lover Malcolm Graeme, a ward of the king. James Fitz-James keeps Ellen in suspense as he leads her in to present her to the King. But where is the King, Ellen wonders, as she looks about? Why is everyone focused on her escort?\\"To him each lady's look was lent,On him each courtier's eye was bent;'Midst furs and silks and jewels sheen,He stood, in simple Lincoln green,The centre of the glittering ring, --And Snowdoun's Knight is Scotland's King.\\" (Canto VI, Stanza xxvi)The playful king soon reveals that her father and he have made peace. His ward, Malcolm Graeme, had offered the Douglas shelter despite the King's general loathing of the clan which had held him virtual captive during his boyhood. Will Ellen not plead for him? No? Then he must be chained.\\"His chain of gold the King unstrung,The links o'er Malcolm's neck he flung,Then gently drew the glittering band,And laid the clasp on Ellen's hand.\\" (Canto VI, Stanza xxix)END INTRODUCTORY SYNOPSISKIng James V (1512 - 1542) was the father of Mary Queen of Scots. There are similarities in character both to England's Henry V and Baghdad's Haroun al Raschid. James V was a good, strong king, protector of the poor, often going out among them in disguise, either to detect and correct their woes or to woo their daughters. He died young, forecasting correctly that the Stewart dynasty would end in less than two centuries \\"with a lass\\" (Queen Anne) as it had begun with a lass, the daughter of Robert the Bruce.Scott's poem THE LADY OF THE LAKE sketches six days in the life of a good-hearted, randy, grudge-bearing, high tempered young monarch. The title of the six cantos sketch the tale's progress:The Lake.The Island.The Gathering.The Prophecy.The Combat.The Guard-Room.-- I. The Lake. James Fitz-James, lost hunting a stag in the Trossachs of Scotland, is given a night's hospitality by Ellen, the lady of the lake, and by the mother of the castle's owner, on an island in Loch Katrine belonging to Roderick Dhu (Black Roderick). Roderick, with his aged mother Margaret, shelters Ellen and her banished father, the once mighty Lord James Douglas. Fitz-James is smitten by Ellen. But leaves at dawn.-- II. The Island. The island's owner, Roderick Dhu, is rowed to his island fortress while his hardy followers sing \\"Hail to the Chief,\\" which has become the American Presidential processional hymn. Ellen's father also returns, with her young admirer Malcolm Graeme in tow. Roderick asks Ellen's hand but this is denied by her father. Ellen's two admirers quarrel and Malcolm then swims the length of Loch Katrine rather than be indebted to Roderick for a boat.-- III. The Gathering. Believing that King James means to march into the Trossachs to subdue Clan Alpine, clan chief Roderick Dhu has the wild Brian the Hermit peform semi-pagan rites, then sends out the burning cross to assemble his liege men for war at Lanrick mead. Duncan, Ellen and the minstrel Allan hide from the King in the Goblin Cave.-- IV. The Prophecy. The hermit Brian prophesies that whichever chief \\"spills the foremost foeman's life, that party conquers in the strife\\" (Stanza vi). James Fitz-James arrives on foot planning to take Ellen to safety behind royal lines. But he is being led into a trap by a man of Roderick. Ellen will not leave. James gives Ellen a ring to gain instant admission to King James should she ever need him. Fleeing pursuit. James meets Blanche of Devan, a mad woman whose brand new bridegroom had been murdered by Roderick during a raid into the Scottish lowlands. She asks for vengeance. The guide shoots off an arrow at James but kills Blanche instead. James pursues and kills the traitor guide. He later comes upon Roderick. Neither recognizes the other though they exchange frank views. They spend a hospitable evening together before departing at dawn for a proper dueling place.-- V. The Combat. Once just beyond Roderick's mountain fiefdom, they duel. Terribly wounded, Roderick grapples James and would have killed him but his strength fails. James bugles for help and has the wounded man carried to Stirling castle. En route James recognizes Lord James of Douglas, who is coming to Stirling to give himself up for the cause of peace between King and Clan Alpine. James allows Douglas entry to the castle grounds, where a popular athletic contest is about to take place. The aging but still incomparably powerful and gifted Douglas enters the contests and wins at archery, wrestling and hurling. The king gives awards but otherwise ignores him. At last, Douglas identifies himself and his reason for surrendering and is led to prison.-- VI. The Guard-Room. Ellen and the minstrel Allan pass through the guard-room occupied by foreign mercenaries. She awaits audience with the King. Allan asks to be admitted to his imprisoned master. The warder thinks Roderick Dhu is meant. The dying Roderick asks Allan to sing of the battle just ended by the King's truce. Meanwhile, the King has made peace with the imprisoned Douglas. Still in his assumed role, James leads Ellen in to an audience with the king. He cannot grant her mercy to the newly dead Roderick. And her reconciled father needs no mercy. He teases Ellen to intercede for Malcolm. When she does not, the King places a golden chain on Malcolm's neck and places its clasp in Ellen's hand. She may now marry the Graeme.THE LADY OF THE LAKE is made up of hundreds of gorgeous lines, mostly iambic tetrameters, of descriptions of nature, hunting, mobilization of a highland army, politics, character and love.

It is refreshing to see a realistic artist finding his way so confidently in a graphic medium. Contrasting this, the full color works are carefully finished with much attention paid to texture. Christy gives Scott's heroic characters great weight within exquisitely detailed environments.All in all, Christy accomplishes quite more than providing pretty pictures (and they are pretty indeed!)

Many months later I see my review still on the board, so I have taken the time to write a more accurate review of this book.Now to the review:The book has a good section on the Fit Deformation command of the lofting component. The model that you make (a woman's high heeled shoe) is a good practical model for learning the Fit Deformation command and the other features that go along with the lofting component. A pretty good section on animating a hopping kangaroo, however...In the tutorial that shows you how to model and animate a kangaroo, the author clearly states that the boolean function may not work when modeling the kangaroo. She's right! I never got it to work. Boolean functions are indeed tricky, but to put a tutorial that is clearly going to have a difficult time performing a boolean function shows extreme short sightedness. As a seasoned 3DSR4 user, I had the patience to try this boolean over a dozen times before I gave up. I cannot imagine new users truly understanding the usefulness of the boolean function if it doesn't work in a tutorial.Half the book is made up of one tutorial in which half of that tutorial is composed of programming. Most 3D artists are artists, not programers. I don't mind learning some scripting but the tutorial they provide (which is pretty neat, by the way) is way too long and complicated.In sum, they should get rid of the kangaroo tutorial and the space buggy tutorial."},{"Title":"3D Studio MAX: Tutorials from the Masters","review":"This book, written ages ago for MAX 1.2, doesn't do the job now that MAX is up to v2.5.

This might be okay for a veteran MAX user, but for a beginner, or even intermediate user, I think they just left too much out.On the other hand, the tutorial subjects were excitingly diverse, from creating a kangaroo to creating and animating a space rover type vehicle.

Anyway, it's a great book for the 8 dls or so that I paid. Nilsen, says the legend, used to be a disciple of Sergei Eisenstein, and actually, he was one of the three cinematographers listed in Eisenstein's \\"October\\". Like Eisenstein, Nilsen went beyond technique, and actually wrote this seminal book on film theory, expanding the range of his menthor's own theoretical writings on the two-dimensional nature of film. As obvious as it sounds, you'll notice few contemporary filmmakers seem to take full advantage of that feature, or even reflect on it. If you've ever watched a Peter Greenaway film you'll understand what I'm talking about. But this is about Nilsen's book, so, in short, if you're interested to know about visual design on films, I'd suggest you read either \\"The Cinema As A Graphic Art\\", or the more recent and less profound \\"The Visual Story\\", by Bruce Block. Both are great introductions. Block as a technical primer, and Nilsen as a theoretical primer. This book is out of print, but there's many second-hand buying options here in amazon.

This dictionary saved me from a web of confusion by clearly defining each term.The terms are explicitly explained and differentiated from each other. This sort of description is hard to come by in sociological literature.It also acknowledges the relationship between terms by recommending other terms to refer to. Below many definitions, there are even references to readings if you want more information on the topic.While the definitions are restricted to explain only the given term, they are also detailed enough to give a good understanding of the meaning and context of the term. Most terms are explained in a paragraph or two, while more important and complex terms or phrases are explained with more information, often in one or two pages.If you want explicit descriptions of terms that we don't often encounter outside of sociology, or of terms that have a different meaning within sociology, this book will definitely help you.

The ISO 9000 Quality Systems Handbook 4th Edition, by David Hoyle is one of the best I have read on this subject. In this 4th edition, David analyzes each section, clause and requirement of the ISO 9001:2000 standard in detail.David Hoyle has over 30 years experience in quality Management and has authored or co-authored more than five books on ISO 9000. He is also the director of Transition Support, a firm that provides training and consulting in business improvement.The book is easy to understand and is suitable for students, managers, instructors as well as auditors. The novice ISO practitioner as well as the seasoned ISO 9000 enthusiast will find this book a valuable tool when implementing ISO 9000 quality management systems. For those making the transition from the 1994 version of the standard, this book helps to point out the changes from the 1994 to the 2000 standard.The standard has changed considerably. In the 4th edition, the meaning of each of the requirements of the ISO 9001:2000 standard is explained in detail and some of the sometimes confusing ISO language is clarified. The author explains why each of the requirements is necessary. He shows how each requirement links to the eight quality management principles on which the ISO 9001:2000 standard was based. The book gives practical guidance on implementing each requirement. This is the strong point of the book.After introducing some basic quality concepts, the book explains the role, the origins and application of the ISO 9000 family. The succeeding chapters, 4 through 8, correspond to each of the five sections of the standard. This makes it easy when looking for help in understanding and implementing a certain requirement of the standard.The 4th edition has a summary, a questionnaire that provides food for thought for the reader, and a list of references at the end of each chapter. A glossary and a list of related websites are included in the appendix.The 4th edition of ISO 9000 Quality Systems Handbook will find a permanent place on your desk. Auditors will find this book indispensable."},{"Title":"ISO 9000 Quality Systems Handbook (4th Edition)","review":"Contrary to the views of another reviewer, this book is not out of date.The ISO 9000 Quality Systems Handbook (Nov. 15, 2001) is an in-depth presentation of the requirements of the ISO 9001:2000 standard. I purchased five other books that offered an interpretation of the standard, and all were brief and incomplete by comparison.&quot;What on earth do they mean by that?&quot; is the most common statement that people make when working with the ISO standard. This book presents each requirement in the standard and then tells, 1.) What it means, 2.) Why it is necessary, and 3.) How it is implemented. The explanation is complete and easily understood by anyone. A product like this is what is needed to understand what to do, and how to go about doing it when working with the ISO 9001:2000 standard. Companies transitioning to the new standard are assisted with a comparison of requirements to the prior standard.This book was recommended to me by an ISO 9000 registrar auditor who stated that it is being used as part of the training for their own auditors. I am a writer of ISO 9001 auditing materials. To prepare my own product, I found it necessary to read what was available in the marketplace that explained the requirements of the ISO 9001:2000 standard.

This book gives you a good understanding of the requirements of the standard.When I wrote my quality manual in line with ISO 9000:1994 I found the book Indispensable, as the standard required you to comply with the clauses of the standard, and most people (my self included) wrote their quality manual in line with those requirements. This was OK until the new requirement came out in September 1999. Now the standard has changed from the clause approach to the processes approach. This is saying there must be a link between processes i.e. if one processes does not fulfils its requirement, then you cannot proceed to the next stage of the process. The overall message is that you \\"must satisfy your customer requirements\\".How do you go about changing the way you now write your quality manual, that is easily answered you read David Hoyle's 4th edition ISO 9000:2000 \\"Quality System Handbook \\" this is the one with the picture of the pearl on the front.

This is an indispensable book for those implementing ISO 9000 Quality Management System. The reader will, among other things, understand the difference between the previous procedure approach to the current process approach to quality management. The reader will learn what the ISO 9000 requirements mean, why they are necessary and how to implement them.The other critical features in the book includes a summary and questionnaire to reinforce the reader's knowledge and understanding as well as comprehensive list of references that should be very useful for those who need to explore the subject more widely.The book is recommended reading for people involved in the implementation of ISO 9000 for enhanced organizational performance, particularly managers, designers, auditors, instructors and students of quality systems."},{"Title":"ISO 9000 Quality Systems Handbook (4th Edition)","review":"I was first introduced to David Hoyle back in 1994 with his first ISO 9000 Quality System Handbook, I found the book so well written that I had no problem understanding what was required to implement a Quality Management System that would give results.

David Hoyle skillfully takes ISO9001:2000 and explains it in an easy to read, thoughtful and challenging manner. Instead of simply achieving ISO9001:2000 certification as a \`badge on the wall' Hoyle defines a road-map to improve your business and generally raise the \`bar' on your performance. We can always do more with less !The early sections of the book introduce the basic concepts of quality management and focuses on some key questions to be asked when making the transition from procedural based systems to performance measured systems. The differences between ISO9001:1994 and 2000 are then succinctly defined and explained with clarity.The balance of the book dissects each of the new 8 Sections in ISO9001:2000 and applies a consistent format : per discrete element : (1) what does the requirement mean (2) why is the requirement necessary (3) how is the requirement implemented ! A useful sidebar indicates what exactly has changed from ISO9001:1994 to 2000 : What more could you ask for !!In summary this and all books by David Hoyle (I have them all !) is excellent. If you are serious about getting real value from your investment in ISO9000 then don't start your initial registration (or transition) project without this book.

In 1918 he became professor of the history of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley.\\"Reference: \\"Cajori, Florian.\\" Encyclopdia Britannica from Encyclopdia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD.The first edition of this History of Mathematics occurred in 1893. Subsequent editions were in 1919, 1980, 1985, and this 5th edition in 1991. Apart from stylistic changes and minor corrections, the main revisions in the 3rd and later editions are said by the editor to be concerned with the eight page chapter on Babylonian mathematics, which was rewritten for the 4th edition and partly rewritten for the 5th. A book of similar title by Cajori, A History of Elementary Mathematics, although based upon this book under review, is a different work.This is a densely written book, and especially in its later chapters assumes a mathematical background consonant with the period in which it was originally published. This is not a textbook. It is a scholarly discussion on the history of its subject. The historical limit of Cajori's discussion, mentioned in the preface to the 3rd edition and operative still in the current edition, is \\"the close of World War I.\\" His viewpoint is not that of a modern reader. He is writing during the first blooms of 20th century abstract mathematics. The 1st edition of Whitehead and Russell's Principia Mathematica, which he mentions, occurred over the course of the years 1910 to 1913. The 1st edition of Felix Hausdorff's Grundz&uuml;ge der Mengenlehre, which he doesn't mention, occurred in 1914. Emmy Noether (1882-1935) didn't arrive at G&ouml;ttingen until 1915. Bourbaki's first book wasn't published until 1939.Although Cajori lived until 1930, in revising his book for the 2nd edition (later editions occurred after his death), he could not know where mathematics was going in its methods of abstraction or how educational reforms and popular culture would affect the intellectual background and concerns of future readers, and so he could not write his history to speak to the viewpoint and expectations of a reader in the 21st century. But if you enjoy this sort of thing, this book is worth your attention, regardless of how well you understand everything in it.The editor of the 3rd edition remarks: \\"With so vast and complex a subject to set forth within so small a compass, the author of a one-volume history of Mathematics must decide what facts to select, what interrelations to point out, whom to name, how much to explain, and the like. There is no optimum, no one way of doing this. Every one-volume history of mathematics is therefore necessarily very different. Indeed, each of the few that exist are, as the reader can easily verify, strikingly different.\\" (p. iii)"},{"Title":"A history of mathematics","review":"This isn't a proper e-book.

The book also focuses on the pleasures of having a puppy and the frustrations of cleaning after it and all the work it takes caring for a puppy. This great book taught my little brother how to nurture, care for, feed and clean up. It taught him that having a puppy is a big responsibility and it was easy for him to read and understand."},{"Title":"The Berenstain Bears' Trouble with Pets","review":"The Bear family had taken in a little bird because its leg was broken. So Papa bear made a wooden splint for the little birds' leg. But when the time came to let the bird go, brother and sister became very sad. They asked Mama and Papa Bear if they could get a pet; Mama Bear said \\"no\\". But Papa Bear is all for it! So the Bear family all gets into the car to go to the pet store. So, they are driving along and brother sees a sign that says \\"PUPPIES AVAILABLE SEE FARMER BEN\\". Papa Bear drives into the drive-way and up to the barn. Sister finds a puppy and the whole family agrees on it. Farmer Ben gave them the puppy for free! They were so happy!! They had to wait a couple of weeks though because the puppy needed her mothers' milk. After the couple of weeks went by and it was time to go pick her up from farmer Ben. And they took her home.The lesson this book teaches is that you should take responsibility of things you said you would. The age level for this book could be age's six to 10. I think that this book is good because it teaches how you should take responsibility of your pets."},{"Title":"The Berenstain Bears' Trouble with Pets","review":"Every child wants a pet at least once in their lifetime. Most of the time it's because they think animals are cute and they never really take time to understand all that goes into taking care of an animal. In THE BERENSTAIN BEARS' TROUBLE WITH PETS, Brother and Sister Bear want a pet of their own after caring for an injured bird for a week. Soon after they select a puppy from Farmer Ben's new litter. It takes a few weeks before the cubs can take the dog home, so in the meantime they read up on a book about puppy care. When they finally get the dog, the have to get him a license, leash, and shots. Then there are all the things that go along with taking care of a dog, including cleaning up the nasty accidents. The puppy grows into a big pup, and becomes too big for the house and has to be moved outside. The Bear family loves her very much and she becomes another member of the family.Children rarely consider all that accompanies raising a pet, from the shots to cleaning up \\"accidents\\" to the fact that some animals grow so much they are no longer able to live inside one's home (they are just too big). This book introduces many things that children may not think about on their own and therefore is a great read for any kids that maybe wanting a pet of their own."},{"Title":"Colors of France: A Painting Pilgrimage","review":"I very much enjoyed this delightfully personal and emotional journey through the backroads of a France not previously known. The beautiful illustrations by one of my favorite artists gave the reader vivid images of this gorgeous landscape. For a non-artist, it was especially interesting to experience the journey through an artist's eye...an artist very worthy of the invitation to paint Monet's gardens. The book is a wonderful collaboration by a gifted painter and a talented writer."},{"Title":"Colors of France: A Painting Pilgrimage","review":"Feasting and fasting, reflection and spontaneity, fellowship and solitude - all the elements of a pilgrimage are contained in this intimate account of Margaret Hall Hoybach's journey to paint Monet's gardens. Her sketches and paintings convey the wonder of her journey. Joan Brown captures the creative spark that propels an artist forward and the moments of conversion that await those willing to embrace their dreams. Colors of France is filled with rich, inviting textures arrayed for any traveler, regardless of destination. Hoybach's willingness to share her experience leads me to examine my own path. A good book to share with a friend."},{"Title":"Colors of France: A Painting Pilgrimage","review":"I had an interest in this book as my parents own several Hoybach works. Margaret's Impressionist paintings of flowers are magnificent and in recognition of her talent she was invited to paint in the garden's of her even more reknowned predecessor, Monet. This book is an account of a painting trip through France including stops in Biarritz, the Pyrenees, St Etienne de Baigorry, Tarbes, Rocamadour, Ile d'yeu, Brelidy, Nantes, Limoges, and of course Giverny. With help from her friend Joan Brown, Hoybach shares her impressions of France through the written word as well as her paintbrush. Its a quick read but you will find yourself going back to enjoy the paintings. This one will stay on my coffee table a long time."},{"Title":"Colors of France: A Painting Pilgrimage","review":"a beautiful book and perfect collaboration of two talented people!

This is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Colors of France: A Painting Pilgrimage","review":"I have had the good fortune to be able to travel the world and visit many of its most exquisite gardens. The beautiful book by Margaret Hoybach and Joan Brown is another adventure into the world of indescribable color and beauty. Only the most sensitive photographer or highly gifted artist has been able to capture and display the splendor of nature's pallette. In my opinion, the artist can do this better than the photographer, because the artist can better select the colors and manipulate the subject. Margaret Hoybach beautifully portrays the essence of the scene and its delicate lighting. In &quot;Colors of France&quot; her technique is masterful. This colorful journey is a sheer delight!"},{"Title":"Colors of France: A Painting Pilgrimage","review":"Viewing France through the prism of Margaret Hall Hoybach's wonderful paintings and poignant often amusing narratives, insightfully written by Joan Brown, is a book I will revisit again and again. To personally travel Hoybach's path through France would be wonderful, though truly a close second, is to savor this lovely book."},{"Title":"GUN KETCH (ALAN LEWRIE)","review":"very entertaining series. easy to get hooked. if you like the aubery series (e.g. master & commander) you will like this also."},{"Title":"GUN KETCH (ALAN LEWRIE)","review":"Dewey Lambden is a C.S.

This is no heroic figure and is more in the realm of an adolescent's fantasies."},{"Title":"GUN KETCH (ALAN LEWRIE)","review":"For those with in interest in tall ships and the sailing navies, this novel covers a time period not well covered by other authors, i.e., the period between the American Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, when most of the British Navy was laid up out of service and pirates roamed the West Indies. Lambdin does an excellent job researching the information for his novels. While this book is one out of a series about the naval and amorous adventures of Alan Lewrie, the main plot stands alone and Lambdin fills in the reader with any incidental information on events from earlier books. A highly recommended book for filling in that time period of history."},{"Title":"GUN KETCH (ALAN LEWRIE)","review":"Lieutenant Alan Lewrie is enjoying a few weeks in England, in between the completion of his anti-pirate adventures in the Far East (as recounted in The King's Privateer) and taking up his new assignment in command of the gun ketch ALACRITY as part of the Bahamas Squadron. Such a small vessel doesn't ordinarily rate more than one commissioned officer, but on the Navy's books it's a &quot;sloop,&quot; so Capt. Lewrie finds himself with a first officer, the rather prim but engaging Arthur Ballard, who actually is Lewrie's senior in terms of naval experience but seems to harbor no jealousy about their relationship. (In fact, the two soon become friends as well as trusting colleagues and it's apparent Ballard is destined to become &quot;Bush&quot; to Lewrie's &quot;Hornblower.&quot;) Alan spends much of his time ashore with the Chiswicks in Surrey (the family he helped rescue in _The French Admiral_) and is dismayed to find that Caroline Chiswick, for whom he has a soft spot, is being matched off by her uncle to the swinish heir of the local baronet. Suddenly, Lewrie finds himself doing what he never expected: getting married. And, rather than leave his bride in Plymouth, he allows her to talk him into taking her to Nassau with him. Naval novels set in peacetime sometimes have to go far afield to find an entertaining plot, and Lewrie's domestic adjustments, together with a struggle against another set of pirates (and the corrupt civil and naval officials with whom they are in league) make for an engaging yarn.However: The author seems not to understand the distinction between an exclamation mark properly used in dialog (&quot;Kill them!&quot;) and its thoroughly annoying, rather gushing use in narrative (He killed them!). Though perhaps that's just sloppiness after the initial success of the series. And while he has become quite good at descriptive passages, especially those of the sea around the Bahamas (where he obviously has spent some time sailing himself), he also seems too willing to limit most of his principal characters' conversations to the same period slang, used over and over again. Lewrie is brighter than that. (I'm getting awfully tired of &quot;ram-cat&quot; and &quot;caulk&quot; and &quot;putting the leg over&quot; and &quot;buttock-brokering&quot; and &quot;heel-taps&quot; -- that one always in quotes, for some reason.) I don't much care for the smugness of Lambdin's Introductions and Afterwards, either.Still, it's a good series with good plotting and (mostly) good character development and excellent detail on ship operations and tactics of the period, and I shall certainly keep reading."},{"Title":"GUN KETCH (ALAN LEWRIE)","review":"IF YOU HAVE NOT MET EITHER LAMBDIN OR LEWRIE IN EARLIER BOOKS, YOU SHOULD FIRST READ The Kings Coat, The French Admiral, The Kings Privateer or The King's Commission BEFORE YOU READ The Gun Ketch. I issue this caution because you cannot possibly appreciate the shock of learning that Alan Lewrie is married (!) without first reading at least one (preferably all) of its predecessors. I was HORRIFIED to find in the opening pages that LT Alan Lewrie was being married on the first pages. But then, so was he! (The author shares with you the thoughts of Lewrie -- which is what make him charming.) The story that follows is a delightful story of the sea, pirates, good (and ACCURATE) sailing descriptions. Alan Lewrie is lovable because he is so real and down to earth. He is more of a person than Hornblower or Bolitho, although I commend to anyone either of their authors (Forester and Kent, respectively). I note with interest that a previous reviewer has the same opinion (see RPE01@AOL.com from Cleveland, below.), although we would differ on what the &quot;Trilogy&quot; consists of. In any case it doesn't matter. This is good, solid writing; well-researched, greatly peopled with colorful characters that you come to care about, and the sea adventure is unparalleled. THIS IS GOOD STUFF!! READ IT. You won't be disappointed. And I think you will come to like Dewey Lambdin, as well. I suspect there is a bit of Alan Lewrie in him."},{"Title":"GUN KETCH (ALAN LEWRIE)","review":"This review is only to cover the quality of one of the two available Kindle editions. The rating applies to the quality of the writing, not the quality of the \\"printing\\" that is so poor in the edition I purchased.I recently purchased this book for my Kindle. Because I purchased it on a mobile device website, I did not notice there are two Kindle editions for this book...the first time I've seen that and I purchase a lot of Kindle books. The cheaper edition, (both are from \\"McBooks Press\\") which is dated April 1993, looks like a poorly scanned document, with numerous reproduction errors like pages folded so the scan didn't work leaving words and sentences that are illegible in some areas and parts of letters chopped off on every page. I'm requesting a refund from Amazon for this version and hope to purchase the more expensive and hopefully better quality ebook. Overall the typeface in this edition is really awful and hard on the eyes.Otherwise these are an excellent set of naval adventures that I'm very much enjoying."},{"Title":"GUN KETCH (ALAN LEWRIE)","review":"I love historical fiction, and this book is time traveling at its very best. The author does an amazing job of taking you back to this fascinating time period immediately after the American Revolution in both Britain and the British-held colony of the Bahamas. Life on a British naval vessel comes alive, as does life onshore. The book is extraordinarily well researched, the characters just jump off the pages, and the action/adventure story line will keep you reading long after bedtime. One aspect of this book that will throw you for a loop is the dialog, which is all written in late 18th century phrasing, sprinkled with lots of slang spoken by sailors on British ships of the time. I found myself wondering what they were actually saying ... but that just added to the realism and thrill of this fantastic read!"},{"Title":"GUN KETCH (ALAN LEWRIE)","review":"Dewey Lambdin does an excellent job portraying the image of living and working a wooden sailing vessel as well as give a feeling for what it was like in the British navy of the late 1700s. Unlike other authors who use the British navy as a setting for a plot, the author evokes the feeling that you are part of the character and the story is happening to you. The protaganist is a normal young man who was kicked out of the house for being to hard a child to handle (supposedly). Part of the assocoation with the protaganist comes from the down to earth situations he gets himself into. Like any other young 'buck' in his late teens, early twenties, he doesn't always think with his head on his shoulders when he is looking for a good time. This is definately the series for you if you want an honest look at life in the King's navy with the attending comradere, boredom and technical details. It is not for those who feel that thinking/acting like a sex a sex starved young man is unacceptable.I suggest you start reading as early in the series as you can. Start with 'The King's Coat' (if available, it might be out of print), move on through 'The French Admiral', 'The King's Commission', 'The King's Privateer', 'The Gun Ketch' and 'HMS Cockrel'. 'For King and Country' is a trilogy that begins where the protaganist begins to settle down and contains 'The King's Commission', The King's Privateer' and 'The Gun Ketch'.It will be interesting to see how the author handles the young man coming of age. That telling of that kind of transition is what will really determine if the author is as good as he appears to be."},{"Title":"GUN KETCH (ALAN LEWRIE)","review":"I began reading the Alan Lewrie series hoping for something similar to Patrick O'Brian's astonishingly good, truly definitive 18th century sea-faring novels. Given O'Brian's superb language, plotting and characterizations I was probably aiming too high, but I found Dewey Lambdin's tales enjoyable in another way.If attention to detail is the mark of a serious historical novelist then Lambdin scores very highly. The Gun Ketch is no different than the earlier works in the series in this respect, laced liberally with nautical and period substance and minutia, sometimes self-consciously so as if the author paused every now and then in his storytelling to consult his authenticity barometer and decided the page need a fresh lashing of sailing terms and background detail. This doesn't seriously add to or distract from the story because the story itself is pretty much by the numbers: our hero Alan works his way through several set pieces, spends too much time pondering if he really wants to be a sailor and ends up a bit better off than before. In the process he meets and defeats pirates, enjoys some domestic pleasures with his wife, and becomes a father. And there are several exciting ship to ship and ship to shore engagements that Lambdin excels at depicting.The great thing with these novels is that as one reviewer commented, they are morish, without engaging the same sort of loyalty I feel for O'Brian's characters. If you enjoy late 18th century seafaring tales, with generous helpings of bawd and bravado, packed with rich detail, but occasionally in need of an thoughtful editor, you can't go far wrong in picking up Lambdin's novels."},{"Title":"GUN KETCH (ALAN LEWRIE)","review":"All of the the Lewrie novels to date have been good,with more realism (and much more sex) than Forester'sHornblower and much freer, less wooden writing thanall but the first few of O'Brien's Aubrey/Maturin.The sex gets a little obtrusive sometimes, but notoverly so.Many of the Lewrie novels are distressingly hardto get. Contrary to an earlier review, the &quot;Kingand Country&quot; trilogy consists of King's Coat, King'sCommission, and Gun Ketch and it is a great placeto start if you can locate it.If you like this series, see also the followinghistorical naval series -- James L.

G. Fulford on her own as an answer to that plea.Debbie Fulford gives you stories from her family storehouse, encouragement, perspective, and tips.

That book has many questions to trigger your memories for writing.This book (One Memory at a Time) builds on the earlier book but the emphasis is on showing us how easy it is to write a small descriptive memory. The author inspires and reassures us that we can get those onto paper and that our families will thank us for the effort.I liked her tone in the book and the advice was very encouraging. She says the writing doesn't have to follow a timeline. Just record bits and pieces as they come to you, then later arrange those for your family history.The book's fairly slim and would be most useful to have both books at the same time."},{"Title":"Sahara","review":"Part of the fun of this book is indeed the fact that it is dated. This is just my personal opinion, but I don't think these classic Saharan landscapes lend themselves well to the ultra-modern high gloss photographs you find in so many pictorial works, about say, the national parks of the United States, where the pictures of Glacier National Park look more like paintings. No, the pictures found in \\"Sahara\\" look like they were taken in the 70s - there's a sense of age, imperfection, and graininess about them that seems well-suited to the Sahara.Which is not to say that these pictures are poorly taken or technically incompetent. They are not. It's just a matter of working with what is available at the time, like Matthew Brady and the Civil War, which happens to suit my aesthetic tastes just fine.In any event, this is probably my favorite pictorial work I've read and viewed on the Sahara. I prefer it to the fine works of Michael Palin and \\"The Call of the Desert\\" by Philippe Bourseiller, which is also very good. This book delivers up all you could want out of a pictorial book on the Sahara. I especially find its emphasis on Algeria (the country with the most stunning Sahara scenery, in my humble opinion) to be quite in line with what I was looking for. And I must say what fascinates Nomachi falls in well with what fascinates me: the Hoggar Mountains of Algeria, the Air Mountains of Niger, the Grand Ergs Oriental and Occidental (The Grand Erg Occidental is particularly wondrous).Nomachi also does a fine job of recalling his experiences in a time when Sahara travel was in some ways more rustic and difficult, though in some ways, it has been more difficult in areas like Libya, which until recently was very difficult to travel in, and the civil war in Algeria makes personally seeing the most beautiful of the Saharan landscape more dangerous than it has any right to be at the time of this writing. So we must content ourselves with fine pictorial works like these. The photography and text on the great nomads of the Sahara was charming and guileless.All in all, I enjoyed this work thoroughly because it seemed to cater specifically to my interests - I think your level of enjoyment will depend on what exactly interests you about the Sahara, but I think anyone who finds this amazing desert beautiful will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Gaylord Hauser's New Treasury of Secrets","review":"No secrets here but little known knowledge for sure.

In this slim volume, this is even more true for, if one has not read other works by Jabes, it would be difficult to place his primary vocabulary - page, book, Nothingness, etc. - in the intended context.If you are familiar with his work, however, you will find all the usual reasons for loving the book. An example of an unforgettable image: &quot;Serpent may be a word so drawn out that it cannot help crawling along its own shadow&quot;.His look at death and freedom is etched in thought provoking images of frail birds that provokes a deep melancholy, an emotional thread much stronger than in his other works.There is a mention of Auschwitz as a formative moment for those living in the second half of the twentieth century, but the Holocaust does not inform the whole work as it does in the Book of Questions. Rather, these aphorisms reflect on the inevitable, individual death in the face of the only truth known to us - Unknowability.An absolutely brilliant book that marketed as his &quot;last substantial work&quot; reminds one how great a writer was lost in his death."},{"Title":"Desire for a Beginning/Dread of One Single End","review":"Desire for a Beginning/Dread of One Single EndJabes is endlessly exploring the Word as cause, proof and question in the enigma of existence, particularly the existence of the individual. The Word as a primal element in Judaism is caught, examined and revered in all his works. The near-universality of the Word as a primal element in religions and cultures gives Jabes' work enormous breadth beyond the Jewish tradition in which it begins. This is, however, probably not the book with which to begin reading Jabes; it is even more cryptic than most of his other works. Start with The Book of Questions."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"Having read many different types of devotional studies, I was pleased to find that Women of the Bible by Ann Spangler &amp; Jean E. Syswerda exceeded 90% of them in content and readability. Not only did I find this book very well written, but it is thouroughly grounded in solid biblical principle. The reader starts the week off with a women from scripture, not just the ones everyone is familiar with, but others also. One such study is of Rizpah, a concubine of Saul's. On Monday you learn her story...On Tuesday you read of her life and times. Wednesday covers the legacy she has left in scripture, Thurdsay covers her promise and Friday ends with an overview of scriptural references and devotional questions. I originally picked this book up for myself. However, I liked it so well that I have already given three out as Christmas gifts and I am ordering 2 more copies for others. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"I agree with the other reviewers who enjoyed Women of the Bible as personal devotionals -- leading the reader towered Scripture passages, suggesting prayer, etc. -- or as the opportunity to learn more about the personalities and accomplishments -- and think of applying the lessons from their lives to today -- of biblical women.However, I do not this book is a good choice for a small group study. My small group chose to do this study; we were flipping through the book at the bookstore and liked the organization and amount of study/discussion questions. Our weeks went like this: review the accomplishments of the woman, generally discuss her attributes or failing, then on to the study questions. We found that the study questions were just unable to spark meaningful conversation -- in many cases they were yes/no questions. On a good week, one of us would bring up some great topic to discuss that just tangentially related to the woman's life, and were able to have a more lively and interesting conversation.At the end of the study, we confessed to one another that we simply did not enjoy this book -- that it not group study material. There are just so mnay excellent small group study books, books where you can't wait for the group meeting to discuss your revelations over the week and how the book can impact you life. For starters, look at anything written by John Eldredge. The Sacred Romance or Journey of Desire, for instance, are just womderful and will make an impact on your lives. If your group doesn't want to do a &quot;book study&quot; but more of a Bible study, just pick a book of the Bible and do that. A group at our church spent an entire year studying Revelation on their own. But there are also studies that correspond to books, such as the New Inductive Style Series published by Harvest House.So, if you're looking for a nightstand devotional, this may be the book for you. Skip around chapters and find the people and themes you find most meaningful to your life at that point. And it's an easy devotional to put aside and later come back to. But in terms of a small group study, look at some other books and formats (especially if you're the group leader -- you'll get points by choosing something that'll make you group running late every meeting and where group members meet informally during the week as well)."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"I recently started reading this book. I am very impressed. Each week focuses on a different woman of the Bible, some well-known and some not well-known. I like the way the story is first told in today's language and the information about the culture at the time that woman lived. The questions for each week are not the type that have a wrong or right answer, but they get you to think about how you feel and what you believe. As another reviewer said this is the first woman's devotional that does not focus on being a wife and mother. I think many men would also find this a great book to read and study from.I highly recommend this book and will be sharing it with my Sunday School class in a few weeks.

I have a lot of trouble following a lot of study books b/c its just information, although interesting, it's hard to keep my attention. The way this book is written really kept me going--I absolutely fell in love with this book. I didn't follow the everyday planning although that is an option (it puts the days of the week at the top) I usually did one week in one night since each day was so short.

This book focuses on women that I already knew (Eve, Ruth, Mary), but then so many more women who are less well-known (Tamar, Rizpah, Joanna). These women have so much to teach us, and have often gone ignored. These authors do a wonderful job of combining knowledge of Biblical times with modern applications.

Then all the ladies just sit and look uncomfortable.Also, some of the women of the Bible are so obscure, it's hard to \\"learn\\" anything from their lives - i.e. Potiphar's wife, Lot's wife - both were particularly hard to study for an hour. The narratives are interesting, but sometimes take too much creative license.For more spiritual depth, I suggest \\"Lifetime Guarantee\\" by Bill Gillham. That's the one I wish my group was studying right now."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"I found this book to be an excellent beginning to learn specifically about the life and times of women in the Bible. I did not have a good foundation in this area and yearned for a concise way to focus and get started. The book's readings and additional Biblical references were helpful in becoming more familiar with the Bible. In addition, it has served as an encouragement to read other books about women in the Bible. Some I have found to be better than others. The Q&amp;As were helpful for my journal writing as I mediated on the meaning and message of these women in their lifetime and our times today. All in all, I encourage women to read this book and and experience their own revealations found in these very special women's lives touched by God. Peace and blessings"},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"I received the book, \\"Women of the Bible\\" and am so pleased. It is new, at a great price and exactly what I wanted and at a reasonable price. Because there are so many versions of this book, we have different ones in our class, but this version is the best.It has more questions at the end than the others and they are so much fun to answer. I was able to see the inside before I purchased it and knew exactly what I was getting. It is a fantastic devotional as well as study book for anyone interested in studying the interesting women God chose to be in His precious Book.Women of the Bible: A One-Year Devotional Study of Women in Scripture"},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"I ordered this book for my Mom and her friends who have a reading group, discussing women of the Bible. So far they really like this book. So happy I found it on Amazon."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"I bought this book for my sister, but after skimming through it, I wish I had bought one for me. This is a very good Bible study for anyone that leads a busy life. If a man would do this study, he would be reminded of what an important role women have played in the history of Christianity. After all, if God didn't so love women, He would not have let one give birth to His Son. Amen."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"I highly recommend this book for Bible study. It is exceptional in presenting the Women of the Bible and the way they lived in their time periods."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"I am using this in a women's Sunday School class. The women are enjoying the stories and we are able to link the issues that arose in these Biblical women's lives to our own. Great study!"},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"In 2001 I taught a one year course on Women of the Bible to a group of 60 women, using this book as my text. Every woman in the class had a copy of this devotional book. The women of the group were highly satisfied, as was I, with this book. The authors have done an extrodinary job of acurately presenting 52 women from the pages of the Holy Bible, giving cultural and social background information on each one, showing how their lives relate to women today, and formulating great discussion questions. I am at present using the revised version of the book as a text for a smaller group of women. As a personal daily devotional, this book is excellent. The daily readings are short, biblical, informative, inspirational, and thought provoking. In fact, last year I gave each of my daughters and granddaughters this book for Christmas."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"Just got the book last week. Currently on Sarah and I absolutely love it. I think it is pretty awesome and I love the way that it details the life of every woman along with the key scriptures for study. A lady at work saw the book on my desk and actually ordered it. This is truly a blessing to all women and a great way for us to learn more about these important women and the roles that they played. I'm excited about what this year will bring for me as I embark on this journey of \\"Women of the Bible.\\" This is a great guide as well as a great gift. highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"Our Ladies' Bible Class was looking for a book to use for our Tuesday morning class. We looked at several different books, and decided on this one. We have loved it! We had just lost our previous teacher to cancer, and we all decided to step up and participate more. Each week we announce who the next teacher and subject will be. It has proven to really be a blessing. Everyone seems to have their favorite Bible woman and we have seen our ladies come forth and teach who normally would never have been in this capacity."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"We choose this study as a group and are very happy with the results. We have found that the individual studies have found us wanting to know more about these women and their lives. We have researched the influence of their faith and the mores of their time in history. We are looking forward to a year long study that gives us all an enrichment of our own lives and our faith."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"I received this daily devotional a few weeks ago and have greatly enjoyed every day of it. This is a perfect Monday-Friday daily devotional for people with limited to extended amount of time to spend. You can go as indepth as you want. Each week focuses on a different woman of the bible and goes into the story as told in the bible, relating it to the times of the bible and relating it to our time today. It also presents God's promises for us as seen in these stories and provides us with simple prayers to present to God. LOVE IT!!!!"},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"I loved reading about the women who have shaped the history of Christianity. Easy to read and an in depth account of each woman. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"I always seem to be buying books by Ann Spangler. This book is just another of her many books to keep you in God's Word and to not only draw you closer to Him but allow you to learn His character. I love the way she always finds different ways to go about doing it. Thank you Ann and keep up the good work!"},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"We are using this book for a Bible study at noon. The material takes us through the scripture one woman at a time and through the periods. She adds good insight to make it current."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"I am currently using this book for our Adult Sunday school class. It has been well received and has proven to stir many conversations. We are studying a chapter a week so this book will last us a year. It is so nice to compare their lives in Biblical times to our modern day lives. GREAT RESOURCE!"},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"Full of interesting information about the women in the Bible....Went to several major book stores in my area and was unable to obtain their workbook,said they did not know anything about a workbook and check their system to......strange....since one of the ladies have already purchase the wookbook. Oh, well...went on line and was unable to find a workbook either. Just bad timing, will check again later...."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"The book is to be used for a women's bible study. We are all very happy with the book. It is a wonderful guide for each lady to study independently all week and then meet to discuss it at our designated time. Excellent book!"},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"This book is great for my needs in my women's bible study group, and we are currently studying women of the bible. The chapters are well written and do a great job on discussing and provoking thought about the woman it describes."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"I have the hard book of this and I enjoy it. It was a Mother's day gift several years ago and I continue to find new things to enjoy. I can not speak to the formatting on Kindle. For that you will need to read the reviews of those that have the Kindle version. The content of the book is excellent. I have decided to buy the book on Kindle. Love it!!!"},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"I really enjoyed this book,I think in order to be a Godly woman, we should follow, examine and understand the women of the Bible, this book breaks down the main points about each woman (good and bad), and it creates a scene around biblical facts. She often suggests for you to follow along and provides the bible verses, she also includes a prayer at the end of each woman.I learned a lot about the bible that i didn't know before, because not only does it talk about the women of the bible, it also talks a little about their husbands or relatives, which is very helpful to understand their individual stories. This is a book I highly recommend for any woman wanting to know more about God, and the kind of plans he has for us. The importance of being patient, putting God first, be obedient, and overall put our trust in him!!! :)"},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"I am very pleased with both the condition and content of the book and am enjoying sharing with others in our women's Bible study group."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"I ordered Women of the Bible because I've heard so many wonderful things about this book over the years. I ordered one for my mom and me. We both are getting so much out of it and growing in our walk with the Lord. The book focuses on the women who made such a difference in there lives leaning on the Lord. It was also a great book on just being able to relate to someone from the Bible who is a woman. The parts that have impacted me have been on women who were struggling with fertility. It was nice to know that they were dealing with this issue even back then. This is a must read for anyone wanting to grow and learn more about the Bible."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"This is an amazing book that highlights the women of the Bible. Too often these women are overlooked in sermons and Bible studies. I love learning about the details of their lives and how they shaped their world. Must have for private devotions or great for groups too. I think men should read it and get a better scoop on the women of the Bible."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"Women of the Bible is a nice devotional for Christian women that specifically discusses the lives of biblical women. By looking more indepth at the women that are mentioned in the bible, we can begin to analyze what their strengths and weakness were in the Lord and see how that relates to us. It is easy to sometimes gloss over the stories of some of the women as the reference is short and seemingly uneventful. But every woman's story has meaning and this book does a good job of teasing apart some of this and helping the reader apply it to their own life."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"I already owned this devotional but bought it for several of my friends as gifts. I have enjoyed going through it week by week and have learned a lot about women I have heard about before as well as those I am less familiar with. Although there will be some questions in every devotional that are a little cheesy, this one does a good job overall of asking relevant questions. I would recommend this book for any Christian woman (single, married, divorced, etc.) who wants to learn more about women of the Bible and continue to grow in her faith."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"I bought this book originally for myself after an acquaintance bought it. During one of my women's ministry meetings, I posed the questions from the book, and we had an excellent hour of discussion. Everyone was so impressed that I bought one for all the women in the ministry. Everyone loves it. It helps you to understand what that woman must have gone through during her lifetime and also how she relates to us in our daily lives or other women around us. I recommend it to every woman I meet. I also recommended it as a Christmas present for a coworkers wife, and she loves it. This book is simply great."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"I enjoy this book very much. It is a very good study of the women in the Bible. It goes through from the beginning to the end, in order, explaining each woman's role."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"Women of the Bible: A One-Year Devotional Study of Women in ScriptureA One-Year Devotional Study of Women in Scripture]]This year long daily devotional speaks to women living in today's world. Done either as a group study, as I am doing, or as an individual study I find this book provides a way to look at and learn from the women of scripture. It is a way to improve relationships today by understanding the past. My group comes together having read Monday and Tuesday pages; which look at the biblical woman's story as well as some information about the cultural times she lived in; to focus on the Wednesday page of each of the women studied. That day digs into the scripture and and discussion questions. The group grew dramatically through a newspaper article which for me demonstrated the relevancy for this type of study today. There are an additional 8 women, unable to attend the group, using the book. They have provided me with feedback that it works well as a personal devotional by providing them with inspiration and encouragement in their daily life."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"Okay I have to retract that statement in my title to a degree. I believe this book gives a very balanced look at all aspects of each of the women but I found the amount of study/reading etc for each day to be imbalanced. Some days I'd be finished in 30 seconds and other days it would take me 30 minutes to do the scriptural study of the woman. I'm not sure if perhaps I just misunderstood what I was supposed to do to \\"fill in\\" the time and get more out of it but I just kinda either dreaded finding the time to do the Bible study or got annoyed that I had already finished reading for the day.I ended up doing each of the weekly studies in 2-3 days and split the Bible study up over those days while reading and meditating on the other readings contained in the book.However, the writings and what is contained in each of the week's studies are well researched, thought provoking and enjoyable thus I will still give it 4 stars."},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"this is a very modern way of presenting stories of women in the bibe absolutely love this book and will read it over and over again"},{"Title":"Women of the Bible","review":"This book helps a person understand who's who in the bible.
