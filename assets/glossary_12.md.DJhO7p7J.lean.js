Always an excuse not to see the world from a larger/different perspective. So unfortunate for their children. I grew up not far from where Keillor did and small town life is definitely a different perspective that fewer and fewer these days are able to wrap their heads around. Sad, really.

A face and eyes and tongue and feet?Most of us don't. We are trapped in the amber of age-old duality of mind vs body, feelings vs thoughts and Soul vs everything else already mentioned. Most discussions around the Soul are a variety of \\"Do we have one or not?\\" Imagine that! We are like monkeys chattering away about whether bananas grow on trees or trees grow out of bananas.We don't just have a soul. We are one. We don't have a body, our body has us. As many of us are beginning to see, the Cartesian distinctions between various aspects of our being are not only silly, they are disorienting and harmful. They keep us in a tight, small place that is confining, constricting and deadening-often literally.The new book, \\"Flexing Your Soul\\" by authors Jalieh Milani and Alessandra Shepard goes a long way to bring us back to our senses-all six of them! And gently and refreshingly--and with fun to boot--helps us reclaim all of who we are as human beings in a simple, step-by-step and enjoyment-filled manner.This straightforward book brims with simple and amazing things to do with your body, not to your body. It brings exercise up out of the physical fitness category into a spiritual practice of psychic and emotional wholeness. These \\"Dances with Self\\" help us inhabit more of the 70 trillion cells that make up our presence in the physical plane.\\"Wish I had the time to do something like this!\\" is a common response to genuine self-care. Many of the techniques to step into yourself more fully presented here take only a few moments and can be done anywhere.Behind the step-by-step exercises outlined in easy-to-follow photographs is the astonishing liberating power of Core Energetics, founded by John Pierrakos MD. This awareness tool frees up blocked energy and feelings trapped in layers of muscular armoring and emotional defense with breath-taking ease and breath-giving results.Core Energetics helps restore vitality, strengthens our sense of who we are (and who we are not!), restores our natural ability to feel pleasure, rejuices our chi and can activate healing of a host of ailments that are related to blocked energy and that great silent killer, stagnation.And best of all, you can do it yourself-or with a partner, or with your kids. The movements are about as complicated as getting out of your TV chair and going to the kitchen for more chips and dip, with infinitely healthier results.What is becoming more and more clear is that inactivity is the enemy of health--physical, emotional and spiritual. A number of recent studies have proven that exercise is often as effective as medication in giving relief from depression.Core Energetics isn't just exercise, however. It's a way of allowing yourself to be more alive, more free, more whole than you can imagine. Jalieh and Alessandra's book is poetry for the body, a songbook for Being.Most of us lead very busy lives that leave us breathless and tired, and yet the root cause of our fatigue is not that we do too much, but that we aren't doing what will give us the very energy and vitality we are so hungry for.\\"Flexing Your Soul\\" is a recipe for just that-an authentic pause that refreshes body, mind, heart and Spirit by bringing us into an experience of being more alive, awake and expressive in ways that are energizing and de-Light-full."},{"Title":"Flexing Your Soul: Moving with Energy and Consciousness","review":"I have been keeping Flexing Your Soul in my purse, finding it helpful to do the exercises during down-time, such as when I was waiting at a doctor's office yesterday, or while I was on a plane traveling during Thanksgiving vacation. Its exercises, at different times, have helped me by, to give some examples: 1) inspiring me to move, so that I found myself the day after reading the leg and thigh exercises portion, dancing around my kitchen using empowering movements based on the movement vocabulary from the book, 2) releasing tension when my energy had been blocked for some time, after a difficult life event from practicing the Full Body Explosion exercise), and 3) introducing me to a new level of grounding, and the enjoyment of walking and being in that state, from doing an exercise in the feet and ankles section.Flexing Your Soul is accessible, nurturing without beingco-dependent, and has a clarity with which it expresses intuitive understanding, poses questions for reflection that can truly help people transform, in the moment, and over time, into what they want to become on all levels. I cannot review the entire book, because it has a million nooks and crannies of consciousness, with which to explore as a regular regimen, or as the spirit moves. While reading it, I have felt as if I was the kitchen with a warm, nurturing, and very clear friend. At times I felt that the author was quite intuitive, anticipating my feelings just as I was feeling them, during the exercise.As a social worker/educator, who uses movement based expressive arts therapies, I appreciate the contribution a rich book like this can make to the field of somatic/body awareness, revealing potentialities for people enlivening various areas of their beings - enkindling passions, gently healing areas of past woundedness or limitation, and opening of more spaciousness, aliveness, embodiment and enjoyment of being - all this consciousness opening possibilities as they do easy movements that enliven their bodies.

However, the binding on the new paperback fell apart before I was half way through it."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"This book is one of two I routinely give to people who move to northern California. The other one is The Ohlone Way, by Malcolm Margolin. Ishi was the lone survivor of a doomed tribe of Yahi Indians on the slopes of Mt. Lassen. Other members of his tribe were murdered by a planned campaign of genocide during the settling of the West. When Ishi stumbled out of the hills of his birth in 1911, he landed in the 20th Century, huddled in the corner of a cattle corral on a ranch, dressed in rags, starving, desperately lonely, and probably certain he would be killed. Instead, a wise sheriff in Oroville called on some anthropologists from Univ of CA in Berkeley, and Ishi eventually came under the benevolent but somewhat demeaning (he was made the centerpiece of a museum exhibit) protection of Alfred Kroeber. It is Kroeber's wife who wrote this touching, heartwarming, illuminating and ultimately tragic history of Ishi's life in the 'modern' world.Most moving for me was a long middle section that recounted a magical summer when Ishi took Kroeber and his teenage son back to Mt. Lassen and showed them his native territory. They lived together as unspoiled and free Native Americans for the summer, hunting deer, swimming in cold streams, living in huts and caves, building fires, making bows and arrows... An experience that was destined never to be repeated.Wonderful archival photographs supplement the imminently readable text.Don't miss this very special and quintessentially Californian piece of history. But there's no rush: this book is destined to remain in print forever."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"Imagine this: it's the 20th century, we have electricity, movies, telephones, trains, cars, the latest audio recording devices, indoor plumbing, and access to the usual luxuries and amenities of our western world. Then one day - here in the United States, out of our own country - a man appears out of the wilderness, almost magically transferred from the stone age to the steel age. Truth is said to be stranger than fiction, and the story of Ishi is one such example. Ishi was the last of the Yahi Indians, living in Northern California under a cloak of fear, secrecy, and evasion from white men, carrying on this lifestyle for the better part of four decades. In this thoroughly researched book, Theodora Kroeber tells Ishi's story. She covers the historical and geographical background of the Yahi Indians, how their lives began to change and their numbers decimated with the coming of the caucasions in the mid- 19th century, and how Ishi and the few remaining people of his tribe lived until Ishi was the last one left. She then tells us about the man himself, the last (happy) five years of his life in San Francisco, and the adjustments and learning Ishi went through in his new home. The author does a superb job of comparing and contrasting Ishi's stone age world with the steel age world, without the tedious prose often involved in such writing. This book is highly readable and strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"I've read this excellent book three times now, and each time it is rewarding. My family has vacationed near the area where Ishi walked out of the woods, and his story became even more real and more tragic to me when I saw the beautiful land that his people lost. Kroeber has provided an important last glimpse of a Native American living in the old way. In addition to the obvious issue of our decimation of indigenous peoples, the book also raises important questions about the treatment given Ishi when he came to live in white culture."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"This book tells a true story of a common science fiction theme, How would a Stone Age person acclimate himself to modern civilization, if suddenly transported there. Ishi was the last remnant of a California hunter-gatherer tribe. He was starving and near death when discovered by a California rancher. Thus began his journey from primitive beginnings, to journalistic sensation, to scientific curiosity, and finally as a working member of society in the California of the 1920's. and \`30's. As the subject of scientific study, Ishi shows that basically people everywhere and for all time are the same, but it is the differences that of course makes it interesting. One example is that at first anthropologists thought Ishi could not count above the number ten. It was later found that he saw no reason to count abstractly. He had a numbering system that extended quite high when physical objects were present. One of the most shocking revelations for Ishi, were not the buildings, cars, trains or machinery of modern life, but the number of people that existed. This is a man who had never seen a crowd of people, he had watched his remote lingering tribe-members die off when he was a child . A hunter-gather lifestyle can only support a sparse population. From Ishi's perspective the largest crowd and perhaps the world consisted of those fifty tribe members when he was a young boy. The book gives a humorous account of Ishi's shock of seeing a crowded San Francisco Beach on a hot summer day. The book is very well written, an easy read and very entertaining. It is surprising that this book is not more popular."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"This poignant portrayal of the most dramatic culture clash in American history reads like a literary bio-drama. Theodora Kroeber's exhaustive research and respectful treatment of aboriginal heritage provide accurate details of a successful Indian culture, which so-called Civilization had effaced from the earth by 1911. Starting with the geology and anthropology of the Yana and Yahi tribes (north of San Francisco Bay), she recreates their vanished lifstyle.Part One describes the relatively peaceful existence of local native American tribes who learned to coexist both with Nature and each other. But the advent of the white man destroyed the fragile ecological and social balance which had existed for centuries, as Yankees and Hispanics gradually encroached on Indian territory--scorning their customs as &quot;savage.&quot; Ishi's tribe was hated and ultimately hunted into extinction. Himself the last survivor, he staggered into a frontier town, gaunt, ragged and in mourning-- expecting instant death. Having lost touch with the last human beings who understood his pre-Columbian world, he had nothing to live for.Part Two compassionately depicts his amazing metamorphosis from the last wild man to Mr. Ishi. He never revealed his true Indian name to any white man, but accepted the generic word, &quot;Ishi&quot; as his new name which simply means, Man. He emerges as a surprisingly gentle person, who adapted successfully to life in the modern world. Making friends with selected Americans, learning to live and almost thrive in the municipal jungle, he earned respect and admiration for his &quot;primitive&quot; skills. In fact Ishi left indelible memories upon those who were privileged to know him well and enjoy his company. His sentimental jouurney back into his past and former territory was well documented in photographs and (now disintegrated) film. What a privilege it must have been to observe this calm and dignified man demonstrate lost customs and survival skills.From warrior to janitor/custodian this honorable man maintined his human dignity in all aspects of 20th century life, until his untimely death from TB five years later. In fact Ishi-made artifacts are treasured in Bay Area museums. One wonders if we of the modern world could adapt so well or philosophically to conditions so foreign as a trip through generations of Western achievement; how would we cope if we were transported forward in time by several centuries? Ishi adapted with grace and courtesy, inadvertantly causing us to wonder who the real &quot;savages&quot; are/were. But this book is not a racist guilt trip--rather it proves a personal odyssey which can teach and touch us all."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"This was one of the most fascinating and thought provoking books I have ever read. It is a beautifully written book that brings with it an entire range of emotions from rage and disgust, to hope and forgiveness.I thought that the best part about this book was the look into Ishi's Yahi and Yana culture, and its overview of California indian tribes in general. The myth that the Californian indians were a simple and childlike race subsisting on what they could dig from the ground is thoroughly debunked by this book.California's varied geography produced one of the most culturally diverse places on planet earth prior to white settlement. Interestingly, this belief that California is made up of many sub-states still exists, and books have been written about the various regional differences within California. The same was true for the aboriginal tribes, and Kroeber brings amazing facts to light about this. According to Kroeber, California was made up of 250 distinct tribes, many with their own languages, culture, and customs. Of the six super-languauge groups of North American Indians, 5 were represented in California. According to best estimates, these five language groups divided themselves into 113 distict spoken languages. Only Sudan and New Guinea have comparable cultural and linguistic diversity. One fact that floored me was that the Yahi language was bifurcated between a male and female dialect. Males and females used these dialects when they were in groups of their own sex. When a male reached puberty, he was taken from the care of his mother and other women, and lived in almost an exclusively male world were he learned the male dialect and hunting skills.Kroeber opens the book with this linguistic/cultural look at California indian culture just prior to white migration, and goes into great detail about Ishi's tribal culture in particular. (We even get a lesson on the term \\"glottochronology\\" which is the study of the roots of a particular language). About a third of the book is this background, and I found it to be absolutely fascinating.The book also spends considerable time on the extermination of the Northern California indians and Ishi's tribe in particular. Of course, these accounts are horrible and no less disturbing than accounts of the Jewish holocaust. The indians were seen as varmits, and they were exterminated with the same attitude that the wolves, grizzlies, and other unwanted wildlife were exterminated. Of course, this was not the attitude of all whites, but not enough of them stood up to stop the carnage.Beyond the stories of human slaughter, racism and genocide, the greatest tragedy was that cultures, which existed with amazing complexity and richness for centuries, were obliterated and replaced with a white mono-culture within 15 - 20 years.The last third of the book deals with Ishi's discovery and how he lived his remaining days under the care of the authors husband, an anthropologist at UC Berkeley. The relationship between the anthropology department at Berkeley and Ishi was one of the only beneficial outcomes of the collision between Anglo and Native cultures. Ishi (not his real name, but a pseudonym he adopted after capture) is given a room at the anthropology museum and is made assistant janitor to help cover his living expenses.It is during this time that he imparts his language and culture to save it from oblivion and to provide future generations, like myself, the ability to learn about Yahi life. Ishi is also treated with respect and dignity, and despite a life of mistreatment, Ishi shows no resentment or bitterness towards white society.I believe the main injustice done to Ishi by Berkeley was that after his death they allowed the removal of his brain for study, in direct violation of his cultural beliefs about keeping the body whole for cremation. His brain was sent it to the Smithsonian Institute where it was kept in storage for almost 100 years. This was unnescesary, and it has taken almost an entire century to return his brain and provide final dignity to this man."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"This is an incredibly well-written account of a solemn, sad, stone age man, calling himself Ishi, who wandered one day out of the forest into 20th century California civilization. For background information -- the author, Theodora Kroeber, was the wife of one of the men privileged to be Ishi's friends, Alfred Kroeber. Dr. Alfred Kroeber was a very important American anthropologist early in this century -- a student of Franz Boas, and a parent, with Theodora, of the writer Ursula K. (for Kroeber) LeGuin. Theodora Kroeber, at any rate, was in an excellent position to tell Ishi's story from the inside, and she does a fantastic job of it.Perhaps it's significant that this, the most impactful account of Ishi, was written NOT by an anthropologist, but by an anthropologist's wife. She was able to think simply as a non-\\"objective\\" fellow human being, and she talks about Ishi with great warmth and sympathy. Think for a moment of what it might be like to be wholly unacquainted with even the rudest, most fundamental elements of civilization, and to need to fit in. Ishi met this challenge, in his own time, and in his own way. You will never forget his story.I would just like to add, very quickly, that even today Ishi's story is sometimes lived out anew. In Massachusetts, several public schools have taken in students from tiny villages in the Sudan. These students are learning for the first time in their lives of such things as writing, money, and shoes. Stairs, of all things, are very confusing to some of them. I don't even want to think about what they make of such overwhelmingly powerful modern developments as the atom bomb, shopping malls, or Britney Spears.Ishi's story is timeless, yet timely for all who choose to ponder it. This book is amazing. One billion thumbs up."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"\\"Ishi in Two Worlds\\" tells the tale of an Indian man who was used to living a normal (to his people) way of life and then was pushed into the full brunt of modern American life by a cruel accident. This book looks at how it is the story of a man who dwelled in two worlds, how he spent most of his life in the ways and sphere of the Yahi Indians, and how, after his tribe's eradication, he was forced to live in modern civilization, in the context of the modern American university among well-meaning anthropologists who wished to study and learn from him.\\"Ishi in Two Worlds\\" is rather dense for me, a thirteen year old in the 8th grade, but once I started reading, I could hardly put this book down. I loved reading this book, and watching how Ishi changed over time, but at the same time, didn't really change at all. (If that makes any sense.)I would highly suggest this book to anybody over the age of 13, especially if you are interested in learning about the last wild Indian (or to be more politically correct, Native American) This book is a great read, and it will provide a great look at a very specific piece of California history."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"At the beginning of the 20th century a half-starved 50-year-old Indian was found in a remote farm in California. He was the last surving Yaki Indian. Before the arrival of white settlers there had been probably more than 2000 Indians of that tribe in the area. They were wiped out in less than 80 years by the diseases carried by europeans, the reduction of their natural environment and periodical retaliatory expeditions organized by band of vigilantes to revenge a stolen cow or horse or the killing of one white settler. The last surviving Yaki was lucky enough to be \\"adopted\\" by the curators of the Museum of Berkeley University. There the Indian lived happily for 5 years, working as janitor and a sort of living exhibit. The anthropologist studied him and his world, and he studied the world of whites, showing a remarkable degree of adaptability to modern American society. He was called Ishi (=man) by the staff of the museum because he always refused to say his own name. Loved by everybody and friend of everybody, he died of the tubercolosis that his natural defence did not recognize. The story was written 50 years after his death by the daughter of the museum's director through the notes of her father (she had never met Ishi). Even being a perfectly scientific book, it has the power of moving of a novel and contains a terrible caveat for the modern man."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"It isn't too common for me to start crying by the ending of a book. But this story brought me to tears. I really came to admire this reticent and dignified man, and the people who befriended him, and it saddens me to think of all the other people like Ishi who were mercilessly slaughtered. Ishi is really a representative of that hunted and slaughtered class, a class that existed right here on this California soil, and a slaughter which was perpetrated by people I thought I admired: the good old cowboy types.This is a story of epic character (Ishi's) and epic cruelty. Please do not misunderstand me: this is not a book which has any intent of guilt-tripping anyone. But it did take me by surprise, because you can talk about slavery all day long, or the Nazis, and I feel no relation, no nexus between myself and those crimes. But, here, I felt a little weird. The degenerate conduct is very close to home, literally and figuratively. I had cowboy guns and chaps as a kid, and I pretended to shoot Indians. And that is a really pathetic thing to pretend, because Ishi was an Indian, and I've learned he was just like you and me. He and his people were rational and empathetic. There had to have been a more humane way to co-exist.\\"The true ghastliness of these events is that they were carried out not by alien monsters but by people shockingly like you and me.\\"--Karl Kroeber in the Foreword to the book written by his mother. That's exactly right. This book describes how Ishi's family and tribe was basically hunted down and exterminated right in front of his eyes as a child, in at least two major massacres and a few other lesser atrocious moments. It breaks your heart. I always thought the Indians scalped the settlers. In this book, it is the local sheriff and his gang of quasi-criminals that is scalping the Indians, including their children, in retaliation for a theft of some beans or the killing of a cow, or some other handy excuse. \\"No state in the Union surpassed the Golden State in systematically and shamelessly harassing, murdering, and stealing from its native inhabitants.\\" Since I live in California, this strikes a painful chord as well. The data cited by Ms. Kroeber is compelling and I suspect unrefuted. The conduct she describes is well documented and uncontested. These Indian peoples were treated like vermin, just a little over a hundred years ago, right where your wine grapes are now growing, or nearby.I'm perhaps unduly emphasizing negative themes. I just learned of these events, or perhaps I should say I just finally comprehended them while reading the book. They struck me out of the blue. This education about nearby and recent enormous cruelties is just a part of the reading experience, however, and isolating these events does this fantastic story no favor, and I apologize. Rest assured, this is a life-altering book, and I've mentioned only the part which shocked me in a negative way.Ishi the man is a wonderful character, he is warmly introduced and developed here, and I can think of no character, real or fiction, which I came to care about more than Ishi. He was capable, strong, polite, free from bitterness, totally alone. His champions and protectors, Professors Kroeber and Waterman, and Dr. Popey, I came to admire and respect and envy. I loved the depictions of wild nature, and Ishi's ability to make handicrafts, a skill-set described in fabulous detail by Mrs. Kroeber. You may want to make an arrowhead or a bow based on her description. Ishi recommends Mountain Juniper for your bow-making, so heed his advice, he was master.The writing is first-rate. Mrs. Kroeber was herself a scientist, and her book takes an artful but methodical approach to the events--both tragic and hilarious-- it describes: the way of the Indians; the way of the Yana (Ishi's tribe); the experiences Ishi endured during his hard life in the wild; the discovery of Ishi; the revelations from Ishi; the \\"camping trip\\" with Ishi in his old home territory (and his anxiousness to return to the city: he learned to love beds, toilets, stoves, towels, and the other \\"clever\\" inventions of the white man); and Ishi's demise from tuberculosis.I am one of those people who marks up a book as I read it. My copy had virtually every page marked up by the end. This book is so thought-provoking and idea-rich on so many levels it will take me years to fully asimilate it.One of the newspaper reviewers is quoted on the cover: \\"A book every American ought to read.\\" True. And, I suspect, every American will be deeply enriched and rewarded for the effort. But the ending is still sad, when you think of what Ishi endured and how little time he had in his hard, hard life to enjoy things. I kept imagining the things I would show Ishi if I had the chance: Disneyland; a Rolling Stones concert; a Benny Hill video, lasagna, a motorcycle ride.He only spoke about 600 English words by the end, but you will understand him very well. And, I'm confident, he will be someone you deeply respect."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"A reissure of an interesting book. (Maybe a tad repetitious.)This chronicles in the USA a type of &#34;Stone-Age&#34; Native American who, dying of hunger stumbles into &#34;modern&#34; America. How he sees things and what fascinates him, interests us,"},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"I didn't get the chance to read this book yet. I'm not really sure if I will be interested though, it was just for my class."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"If you're anything like me, you are interested in this book because you want to know about the man called 'Ishi'. Who was he? What was his life like? What did he think of our world and how did he adapt? And while this book does contain some of this information, it is not much like most biographies you may come across.Certainly a big part of this has to do with the subject instead of the author. Ishi was a modest, reserved individual, and perhaps further hemmed in by custom or taboo. According to the author, he often had to be coaxed to discuss his past much at all, and there are many, many things that he simply would not talk about, not the least of which is his actual name. Another big part has to do with when the book itself was written: well after Ishi's death... so long, in fact, that only one person was even alive at the time of writing of the people who knew him, the author's husband, who himself refused to compose a biography of Ishi because he, too, felt too emotional and involved. So basically almost nobody can or will talk, which is very unfortunate.The text is essentially in three sections. The first and largest details the large historic and geographic view of aboriginal people in the Californias before and just after American settlers arrive. After that is a partly speculative section attempting to describe the specific events leading to the extinction and isolation of Ishi's tribe, including as many encounters and as much evidence from settlers in the region as can be found (which is still often more than Ishi himself indicates). The last and smallest section is a collection of stories and remembrances of the four years Ishi remained in our world until his death. Again, not much like a diary, a chronology, or even a record in all but the most general detail except for a few events.The book includes a few photographs of Ishi and his tools. The cover and a few others are drawn from a single trip back to the wilds where he re-enacted many behaviors from his former life.Although this may be the best account there is of Ishi, it unfortunately left me wanting more... a more which sadly probably does not exist."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"The first half of this book is a general history of California Indians leading up to Ishi's appearance in 1911. The second half is general information about Ishi's personality, lifestyle, and relationships with people at the museum he lived in. It is overall very informative, with many tidbits of really interesting stuff. A quick read. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"In 1911, Ishi, the last member of the Yahi people, emerged from the mountains, hungry and frightened. Taken into custody, he was passed into the care of anthropologist Alfred Kroeber and passed the rest of his days as peacefully as could probably be expected.Ishi is a cypher at the center of this excellent book. Author Theodora Kroeber presents a fascinating and well-written account of his life at the University of California, as well as a moving reconstruction of his final years with a dwindling band of fellow tribesmen, but she is unable to penetrate his point of view. This observation is not intended as a criticism of her or her book. Ishi was intensely private, and his feelings regarding his white caretakers/captors must have been very complicated. It also seems likely that he may have suffered from something akin to post-traumatic stress disorder. In addition, he was raised in a culture with values and assumptions very different from technological society and a magical view of the universe. It may have been impossible to know him. The men who formed the closest bonds with him would have known him best, but their relationships are not available to us. The human mystery known as Ishi is fascinating to contemplate and will no doubt make this a book that rewards further reading."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"This book is a must read for anyone interested in pre-Columbian life styles. Ishi was the last of his kind and communicated much of what was wonderful and tragic for his people."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"Got to talking to my Mom-in-Law about an article about Ishi in TRADITIONAL BOWHUNTER, which she read in its entirety. She is from that area of California and didn't know the story, which she found fascinating. Ended up buying her a couple of Ishi books for Christmas. If you're a serious student of the subject you'll consider the original books \\"foundational\\", as they show the cultural biases of the period. Still spellbinding reading."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"Stunning. Only 100 years ago and the atrocities were numbing. Don't read this if you don't want to be ashamed of how our ancestors dismissed the rights, culture, and wisdom of native Americans. By the end of the book, I felt as though I was sitting with Ishi, quietly appreciating the abundance of nature and the solace of family and tribe. The book is fifty years old and some of the vocabulary and phrasing is quirky, but there is a reverence that is unmistakable."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"Ishi in Two Worlds: A Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North Americahttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B48CS6/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleOutstanding!This should be required reading not only for everyone in California, but also the entire U.S.No one should graduate from middle school without having read this well written and easily understandable saga."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"This is a very important book and a very sad book. It tells an extraordinary story of a man who was last man of his tribe. It also an honest history of the white man's inhumanity to the red man in California during the second half of the ninetheenth Century.The story is: Ishi hid in the mountains nearly all of his life. After his Yahi tribesmen died, he drifted into a small town. He was rescued by an anthropologist and lived the remainder of his short life on the grounds of a San Francisco museum."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"I could write an enormous review, but I want to keep it very simple.Just read the book!The most intriguing part is when Ishi walked out of nowhere into &quot;civilization&quot;.AWESOME, AMAZING, GREAT, WONDERFUL."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"ALL humans can benefit from reading this fact based book. ISHI was a real MAN, and his humbleness and genuine qualities are what young people should strive to match!"},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"Of all the books that I have read about Native Americans, this one gave me the most personal picture of day to day, non-warfare life. It also provides an intimate glimpse of how Ishi thought and felt, about himself, about others, about the world.Although Ishi's story is tragically sad, and his death seemingly premature and ironic, his resilience and optimism are an inspiration. Despite the incredible hardships of his life, he apparently entered the foreign world of white California without harboring any deep resentment or even bitterness. I found his enthusiasm to be both incomprehensible and very moving, which served to temper the sadness of his story. In the end, I was left with a more positive than negative aftertaste, in contrast to other books about Native Americans which tend to focus heavily on issues of injustice, warfare, humiliation, etc.While all those negative themes are undercurrents to Ishi's story, the way in which he coped with his trying life is the most fascinating aspect of the book. In fact, the only negative thing I would say about this book is that a large portion of the beginning is dedicated to historical background about Ishi's tribe, and I felt anxious to read the more personal accounts of Ishi the man. However, this background information is clearly necessary to understand Ishi's life, and is written as colorfully (but acurately) as possible. Even though the historical details are researched (and referenced) carefully, this does not read like an academic text.This book left me feeling that if Ishi, a man accustomed to living in verdant tranquility, could find peace living in a bustling city, then he should serve as an inspiration for everyone struggling to cope with the hectic pace of modern life."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"Countless native Americans were hounded to death by settlers from back east, in the name of \\"Manifest Destiny.\\" This is the story of one who survived--barely. Ishi's people were all dead, mostly from genocide, when he stumbled into the white man's world in 1911, fearful and half dead from hunger and exhaustion. He knew no English, only Stone Age survival skills. He was enough of a novelty to find help and acceptance, becoming a kind of resident freak in an anthropology museum in San Francisco. The Wild Man of Oroville, people called him. Naturally he was perplexed by the strange new world he found himself in, and some people treated him like a child. But you've got to admire him. He was a survivor, and his way of life, unlike ours, was sustainable. Did he have more to teach us than we to teach him? A sad tale that all Americans should read, because Ishi's tragedy was repeated so many times in our history. This book is a scholarly work, dry and academic at times, so don't read it for entertainment."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"Where was the Pulitzer committee the year this biography appeared? Mrs. Kroeber captured a difficult subject with historical and technical command and emotional and human depth. One comes away with a sense that if Ishi was representative of primitive man, civilized man does not compare all that better. I disagree with the review below that Drs. Kroeber, Waterman, etc. used Ishi somewhat demeaningly. Ishi had an ethic of self-sufficiency. His museum work enabled him to earn board and room plus a sufficient salary while working in his own field of expertise. In this way, he and his friends left an immense contribution to anthropology, one that Mrs. Kroeber has described in one of the most compelling biographies any adult or child will ever read."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"This book is very enjoyable, informative, and enlightening.

It does not matter which version you get, but the content remains the same.I had to read this for my California history class. Part 1 is the background about Ishi; however, it is long, boring, but it is interesting, and not an easy read. Part 2 is fascinating really, but I found some odd typos. This book is great and all, but to think they came out with so many versions that this book still has \\"off the topic\\" subjects. For instance, the book talks about Ishi's people, and then talks about other Native American tribes. The transitioning and context are quite confusing and irrelevant. I felt that they wanted to add random facts to make the book longer; this is just confusing.The book needs be revised for sure, since the evidence were based of the early 1900s documents of the author's husband."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"This is a painful book to read. . It is written with enormous intelligence sensitivity and skill. The painful part is the first section which tells of the destruction of the last Indians of California. The cruelty and inhumanity of this slaughter is presented in convincing detail. The white settlers and miners aimed to completely exterminate the Indians and succeeded. The subject of this book Ishi was at one point the lone survivor of this slaughter. He had lived with his mother sister and two other Yahi Indians when a raid of whites left him alone. Once he entered the world of white civilization he became a subject of enormous public interest and curiosity. Fortunately for him he was also immediately put under the supervision of the anthropologist Alfred Krober, and Thomas Waterman. They became his close friends and won his trust. He in time came to make his home in the Anthropological Museum in San Francisco. There he would live out his remaining years while he transmitted much of what he knew about his nature culture. One special friend Dr. Pope became very close to him especially in their practicing with the bow and arrow. Ishi also transmitted his tool- making skills . During these years there was only one break for Ishi when he went somewhat reluctantly back to his home territory. This for him the land of extermination of his family and culture was in a sense difficult. But the sensitive and understanding group led by Dr. Kroeber helped him nonetheless enjoy this trip into an area where he could practice again many of his hunting and fishing skills. But he would not live long after this expedition as he came down with tuberculosis. After a time in the hospital a special room was made for him in the Museum where he could spend his last days. His friend Pope penned this moving tribute to him.\\"And so stoic and unafraid departed the last wild Indian of America. He closes a chapter in history. He looked upon us as sophisticated children- smart but not wise. We knew many things, and much that is false. He knew nature, which is always true. His were the qualities of character that last forever. He was kind, he had courage and self- restraint and though all had been taken from him there was no bitterness in his heart. His soul was that of a child , his mind that of a philosopher'."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"this book, published at the beginning of the sixties, continues to affirm human dignity in the account of the life and fate of its subject. the writing is without parallel and the story of 'ishi', necessarily affecting all of humanity, must be universally known. this book is authentic and truthful and manifestly deserving of reissue."},{"Title":"Ishi in Two Worlds: a Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America","review":"There is much in the history of the United States that we do NOT hear about in school. (The \\"victor\\" writes \\"history\\".) For example, how we treated the Native Americans. In the earlest part of the twentieth century, in places in this country, Native Americans (human beings) were still being treated as wild animals and hunted for sport on weekends. (Successful \\"hunters\\" received a monetary \\"bounty'\\" for scalps!)Is the only good Indian (Native American) a dead one? Is there such a thing as \\"Manifest Destiny\\" or \\"The White Man's Burden\\"? I see NO evidence that a \\"Stone Age\\" culture was respected at all. Every--every--culture that I have investigated has an explanation for the origin (creation?) of human beings. Did the \\"Great Spirit\\" really blow smoke across sticks to \\"create\\" man? Did it take six \\"days\\"? Did \\"creation\\" take place at 10:00 AM on a date in April six thousand years ago? Are \\"scientists\\" fabricators? Are dinosaur skeletons fakes? Were those stupid \\"primitives\\" not smart enough to build the pyramids in Egypt or in the Western hemisphere? Were pyramids built by \\"extraterrestials\\"? Is there such a thing as \\"independent invention\\"?Does the word \\"illiterate\\" mean \\"stupid\\"? (In our present culture, the word does seem to imply stupidity.) Although I wasn't there at the time, I am reliably informed that Charlemagne, as an adult, taught himself to read, but that he never did get the \\"hang\\" of writing. Some exceedingly intelligent persons--even in nomadic cultures--did not read or write.Our house guests have ALWAYs received a copy of ISHI. Theodora Kroeber's book(s) about ISHI give insight into our treatment of Native Americans. In retrospect, it shows a skilled appreciation for a completely different culture.

Similarly, the author presented no scholarly reasons to back her assertion that Wicca is 6,000 years old.

It's hard to believe this book was written over 20 years ago, it is still fresh. I'm so glad she came out with the reprint, so it can be circulated again. I use Words of Power to help myself in school, in my job, with my relationships, finding a house, my kitty's health, my garden, just about everything. Enjoy your own copy of this book, and Blessed Be."},{"Title":"Positive Magic: Occult Self-Help","review":"Everyone should read this book! Even if you have only a passing curiosity about Wicca, Ms. Weinstein provides a wonderful primer on &quot;the Craft&quot; and its history that makes for compelling reading. Plus you get delightful instructions on tossing the coins (I Ching); reading the Tarot (a tool for opening up to your own intuition); and writing &quot;Words of Power&quot; (think of these as incantations, prayers, or affirmations, depending upon your personal beliefs). Best of all, Ms. Weinstein writes in a witty, down-to-earth style with one-liners that are sure to crack you up!"},{"Title":"Positive Magic: Occult Self-Help","review":"Whenever someone asks me to explain more about how magic works, I always start with two steps:Magic 101: Watch the _Star_Wars_ trilogy (Yes, the movies) and listen to every word they say about &quot;The Force&quot; - it is exactly how Magic works. (Yes, it sounds strange, but trust me on this one)Magic 102: Read _Positive_Magic_ to take the basic _Star_Wars_ introduction and get it explained in more detail and in a more &quot;traditional&quot; learing environment.There are many books on the subject, but very few would I recommend to a beginner as most are exploitive or sensationalist. _Positive_Magic_ is always my first recommendation in reading materials. It provides a clear, logical explanation to Magic, Wicca (a magical religeous tradition), I Ching (a Chinese divination oracle) and Astrology (a divination tools used by various cultures throughout the world).It provides a very balanced, thorough and non-judgemental view of its topics in an easy to read and understand format.Buy It. You'll love it.Blessed Be,Brian G."},{"Title":"Positive Magic: Occult Self-Help","review":"With humor and skilled writing, author Marion Weinstein weaves the beginning occult searcher through the myriad nooks and crannies of magic. Words of power and wisdom delve into introductions to many occult traditions, including the I Ching, Tarot, Wicca, and more. Focused entirely on the positive aspects of magic, Weinstein even has the &quot;Ten Foot Pole&quot; chapter to advise beginners of her personal taboos...and they are an excellent rule of thumb for us all. If you are interested in exploring the world of the occult, start here. &quot;Positive Magic&quot; gives you tools to send you on the next steps of your journey. You can start here as a novice and find your path to being an adept. Highly recommended as a &quot;first&quot; occult book. Take the first steps of your journey!"},{"Title":"Positive Magic: Occult Self-Help","review":"This book is a must read for anyone interested in practicing magic. This book teaches you how to keep from hurting yourself or anyone else while you learn how to effect the world with your desires. I am very serious about this. If you want to influence the world of form with your desires, read this book before you try any form of magical acts. There are more complicated books on magic, but, there are none that work any better than the magic taught in this book. This is a mandatory first read for all our coven dedicates. Highest of recommendations."},{"Title":"Positive Magic: Occult Self-Help","review":"I've considered myself pagan for 9 years now and dip back into Positive Magic once in a while for a reminder. It was one of my earlier books introducing me to magick and I wish I had found it sooner, could have saved me from some dumb mistakes. The how magick works and what to avoid sections are very helpful to a beginner. Certainly it shouldn't be the only pagan book to rely on, but if you don't have any teachers or pagan contacts yet, this book will feel like a good friend. As for her dislike of Crowley, I don't _quite_ share it, at least I don't think he's that scary, after all I have his Tarot deck. However, I would never recommend one of his books to a beginner!"},{"Title":"Positive Magic: Occult Self-Help","review":"I read this book in the 1980 when I was a student. Since then I have handed it as one of the first two books I give every student of mine. It is mandatory reading.Is it fluffy? Well, to some extent yes. There are some &quot;airy-fairy&quot; parts but overall, this book is solid groundwork for someone beginning their magical training. The &quot;10 Foot Pole&quot; chapter is always a discussion starter with my students."},{"Title":"Positive Magic: Occult Self-Help","review":"If you're looking for a book on fluff bunny Wicca crap, this is it.Ms. Weinstein's history is wrong, her math is wrong, her practice is wrong. She's contradictory, she's condescending, and most of all she so frikken fluff I wanted to throw this book out a window.How can cusp be unknowable, during the time of Jesus and happened during the last (apparently during the 60's) 40 years? She tries to combine Christian influence, vague Celtic notions, and Margret Murray's debunked theories into a pile of s*** so high you'd drown in it.Her Tarot history is abysmal. She apparently skimmed Pictorial Key, and then guesses the rest of it. She had no concept of who \\"gypsies\\" actually were or the history of playing cards and tarot cards. And the suggestion that you \\"trade out\\" cards that you don't like during a reading. For a good look on why that's screwy (even after she shames people for doing the same thing on the I Ching!) try watching the series (not the movie) Escaflowne for a fictional example of changing out cards to make a happy reading. If you want to change your future you do something about it....just messing with the reading is a dangerous way to practice magic.Her assertion that Christianity is the only influence that counts is absurd. Her claim that Wicca is a 5,000 year old Celtic Religion that stems from Atlantis is just silly. Saying that the internet is an earth element because of wires in the ground is just stupid.As far as I can tell everyone skips the first 200 pages of pure crap and gets to the Words of Power section.The first part of the Words of Power is more stuff about Atlantis, which is wholly fantasy and conjecture. She lays down a misconception of the Name of God. (I feel like I should call her and tell her what it is, since she didn't bother to read a bible to find out.)Then we get to the Words of Power section.Once you throw out the crap about Atlantis, you have Weinstein describing a spell system which, while useful in any religion, she describes in the context of her brand of eclectic Wicca.The system itself seems solid and adaptable. It is a simple formula which you can adjust until you feel it working. Not so bad, and really why I believe people recommend this book.Then she goes in to a practice of creating a blessing every time she hears something negative. She gives it an Egyptian name, but in reality all it is a twist on the Christian evil eye which is fine if you're that insecure.Her last chapter deals with some networking issues; a Toltec inspired rant on responsibility and a semi-retraction.It's really the semi-retraction that bothers me. Weinstein state early on in the book that since Western culture and Christianity dominated the world for most of history, we should only worry about that influence. She said this despite her use of karma and the I Ch'ing. In her last chapter she calls Eastern practices superstition and then says there are some reputable ones out there to examine, Africa being her choice.Despite the contradictions, and obvious lack of direction sense, she then goes on to call other forms of magic and ritual practice using any type of, well, anything negative magic.Weinstein hardly has the one true way here, despite her belief to the contrary. I'm surprised such a condescending book has worked its way into the consciousness of eclectic Wiccans. However it is an attitude that most beginners have."},{"Title":"Positive Magic: Occult Self-Help","review":"This is a great book for the novice. There's nothing wrong with someone reading this book who is looking for a pagan intro. This book was one of my first 13+ years ago. I have since delved into witchcraft/paganism much, much deeper. Looking back, the advanced student will see the 'fluff', but we all need to start out gently on this path as it is not for everyone."},{"Title":"Positive Magic: Occult Self-Help","review":"Positive Magic predates the current witchcraft fad by at least a decade, and so is mercifully free of the more embarrassing comercial packaging and is in itself a work of real substance. You won't agree with everything the author says, but putting aside some of the more unusual contentions (real witches never work widdershins; witchcraft is a purely Celtic tradition)and reading the \\"historical\\" overview with a grain or two of salt, there is still some very helpful information here. Of particular use to me were the clear explanations of the concepts of karma, Form Contingencies, the law of three, the Invisible World, the importance of establishing and clarifying intention, and the philosophical foundation of the way magic works. This book really delivers on its title: there is much for the reader who picks up this book for the \\"self help\\". I found especially useful the section on Ma K'heru (Word of Truth). Per the author's instructions, when I catch myself in a self-defeating expression or thought, I can undo the energy by stating, mentally or aloud, \\"I take that out of the Law.\\" The point of course is to learn the practice of only saying and thinking what one means, but in the meantime, isn't it nice to have fix for those \\"it'll never work\\" moods?"},{"Title":"Positive Magic: Occult Self-Help","review":"Mic tosh ta koor ta neka"},{"Title":"KnitLit: Sweaters and Their Stories...and Other Writing About Knitting","review":"My sister bought this book for me out of the blue, and it reminded me of the reasons I used to knit so passionately.

As I dropped stitches, knitted it the wrong size, and looked at some instructions as though they were in some secret code, I would read a few stories and find myself pcking up the knitting and truly having a new outlook on life. I highly recommend this book for anyone who has ever considered knitting. Don't miss out on these GREAT stories."},{"Title":"KnitLit: Sweaters and Their Stories...and Other Writing About Knitting","review":"I credit this book for part of the reason I am currently knit-obsessed. Wonderful stories within about how knitting connects us to past generations, eases our pain and surrounds the person we give our handcrafted item to with love.While I truely enjoyed most of the stories, the somber ones relating to loved one's passing away seemed grouped together making it a bit depressing at times.All in all, a good little book to tuck into your knitting bag for when you don't have time to stitch, but you do have time for a quick story."},{"Title":"KnitLit: Sweaters and Their Stories...and Other Writing About Knitting","review":"I enjoyed reading these knitting stories. They were diverse and showed that knitting is not your just your grandmother's craft. I especially liked the charity knit stories and wrote down the address of the group that knits hats for the poor children.I started knitting last year, and have truly fallen in love with it.

And there are many of these short essays in this wonderful collection.Are these tales just about \\"When I learned to knit and made a funny-looking sweater?\\" No--though there are stories just like that. There are also stories about how knitting is intertwined with life and death.The most meaningful story for me was by a man whose beloved grandmother INSISTED that her yarn stash be knit up into a warm afghan as she lay dying from cancer. She was at a ripe old age and had a full life, and the way she tied up the loose ends of her life, lovingly and with great passion and determination, was inspiring. This is like \\"Chicken Soup for the Knitting Soul.\\"If you like to read about people who knit and about their real-life experiences and deep feelings, this book is for you.

(I'm working on knitting without looking, but so far am only successful with worsted weight.) Many are evidently not written by professional writers; this is a democratic and inclusive book. The essays come from all different perspectives, embracing those who are NOT philosophical about knitting along with those who are, and even those who hate knitting or don't knit. Some are hilarious, some are sad, some are boring. This book is great."},{"Title":"KnitLit: Sweaters and Their Stories...and Other Writing About Knitting","review":"This book is a collection of brief essays, averaging about two or three pages each, by dozens of people. There are very few pieces that I'd call weak; even these 'weaker' pieces uniformly maintain a chatty, conversational tone that gives the reader a smile or two.Most of the essays are very well written. They provide snapshots of wildly different people who find common ground through knitting. Some of them knit as a form of creative self-expression, some of them knit to provide comfort to themselves or others, and some just knit to keep their hands moving. There are tales of joy and loneliness; there are triumphs and disasters; and for one special knitter, there are worms. While there are some pieces I wish had been longer, the format of the book is an overall wise choice. The brevity of each essay makes it a perfect excuse to put down your knitting for a few minutes and rest your hands while you read a bit. I recommend this book to every knitter."},{"Title":"KnitLit: Sweaters and Their Stories...and Other Writing About Knitting","review":"If you are knitter like me who also loves to read, then you'll surely want to add this book to your library.

A very persuasive and compassionate as well as impassioned document. It will be good to read Ms. Noonan's critique of HRC over the next several years. I give it one moon because of the incident mentioned in previous reviews---the fictional witness of HRC from Eisner's kitchen. When HRC's speech was finished, I was ready to move to NY just to vote for her. Then it turns out the speech and accompanying dialog were piped. Makes one feel foolish for fawning over it. Also indicates what a master of dialog Ms. Noonan is. She has got to be working on a novel, one hopes."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I want to start by pointing out that I DO NOT LIKE HILLARY CLINTON. She is an arrogant bigot and a LIAR.However, Peggy Noonan is doing her a favor by writing a book where while trashing her, she offers little evidence in the sense of footnotes and very few references. Definitely not even close to a scholarly work.What makes it worse is that some chapters are total fantasy, like the one where Clinton gave a speech to the film and television magnates - a speech she never gave because the entire chapter was a \\"dream\\" of the writer, as confessed by her at the end.Although I agree with Peggy in certain points regarding the Clintons, her gossip tabloid style takes any seriousness away and makes me feel like I am reading pure slander (Once again, I agree with her main points). This could have been so much better and could have included so much more other than fiction and lack of evidence; The useful information fits in a single page fold-out.This is by no means a reference work nor an entertaining piece to be taken seriously.You can find a lot more useful and interesting information about the Clintons by going to the PRAVDA.RU newspaper website and doing a search on them.This is one of their articles;Hillary Clinton: five facts you never knew about her06.02.20081. In 1969, after Hillary Diane Rodham graduated with departmental honors in political science, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthy conditions).2. It took Bill Clinton 4 years to make Hilary become his wife. They started dating in 1971. Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton were married on October 11, 1975, in a Methodist ceremony in their living room3. Bill Clinton returned to the Governor's office in1982. Only then Hillary Diane Rodham began to use the name Hillary Clinton, or sometimes \\"Mrs. Bill Clinton\\", in order to have greater appeal to voters.4. From 1986 to 1992 Hillary Clinton was enjoying six-year tenure as a director of Wal-Mart, the nation's largest company.Fellow board members and company executives say Mrs. Clinton used her position to champion personal causes, like the need for more women in management and a comprehensive environmental program.5.

To those who thought that Bill Clinton's book was more than something to revise history, I'm sure you don't like Peggy Noonan. But the fact remains that Hillary and hubby were little people who would stab anyone (meaning ANYONE) in the back for personal gain. The Clinton coolaid drinkers won't like this book because it does get out the truth. And truth to that bunch is only something that you step over for personal gain.Read the book. I would venture to say that 90% of the coolaid gang hasn't read the book.

This short book criticizes the \\"narcissism\\" of the Clintons and their need for power and adulation. Noonan mentions the various scandals and political power plays but it is a stretch to claim a \\"case\\" is put together. It may reinforce the feelings of those already put off by Ms. Clinton but I doubt it will convince any Hillary fans to become members of the vast right wing conspiracy.The book is somewhat unsatisfying in its' lack of detail and superficiality, no index, no photographs and no notes. However, admirers of Peggy Noonan -- I am one -- will find it a quick and entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"ANY book written by Peggy Noonan is well worth reading.

What a Commie! She's worse than that former president of Oilaban, Shakmanafar Ratsiraka, that dude who stole all the ybns from the zoos of the country bordering country, Prantascran, and reapholstered his furniture with their valuable hides. Now thanks to Shakmanafar, there's no more Oilaban, no more Prantascran, and the the ybn is nearly extinct. Noonan really got to the bottom of Hillary's character and exposed the commie hiding behind that &quot;Big New Yorker&quot; exterior. We all saw what happened to Oilaban a few years back, and if Hillary seizes this country, we'll probably be just another of Iraq's territories. Maybe if more people would read this book, America can be saved."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"This book was obviously written to convince New Yorkers not to elect HRC to the U.S. Senate. Did her efforts pay off? Nope. Noonan says she doesn't hate the former First Lady, but she slices and dices HRC into tiny little pieces in her highly biased, villifying book. She exposes HRC as an ambitious, ruthless politician who is hellbent on making the history books instead of doing real good for the people. I agree with Noonan on many points about HRC, but I would have respected Noonan's book more if she would have stuck to the facts and not decided to venture into fiction writing. As a way to pad this book, Noonan attempts to tap inside the First Lady's head and record what the First Lady MIGHT BE thinking during actual events. And if there aren't enough real life events to &quot;record&quot; HRC's thoughts, she invents situations. To me, these ficitonal fantasies cheapens Noonan's book and are a real turn-off. Whatever convincing arguments and valid points she makes are GREATLY diminished because of this outrageously ridiculous gimmick. Stick to nonfiction, dear Peggy, because fiction and mindreading are NOT your foray."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Peggy Noonan's book is seriously flawed because it is overwhelmingly based on the premise that the author can know what Mrs. Clinton is thinking and feeling. Nobody's psyche is as penetrable as Noonan would have us believe; most of this book is, in fact, a mental and psychological exploration that is improbable because it is impossible. Furthermore, Noonan's writing is chock full of fallacies--red herrings and ad hominem attacks abound. Furthermore, Noonan overworks the fallacious technique of trotting out isolated examples to prove a larger claim. This mocks the well-accepted tenets of good persuasive writing that demand a certain weight of evidence to make an argument plausible. At one point, Noonan even imposes a psychological diagnosis of &quot;narcissism&quot; on both Clintons based on the words of a &quot;political professional&quot; friend of theirs. I was not aware that journalists and political careerists were now qualified to deliver clinical diagnoses. Because the book is entirely structured on these ill-reasoned, fallacious, and purely speculative techniques, I find its credibility and worth to be critically compromised."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"The cult of Hillary Clinton, with one deep admirer, HRC!

Noonan has included lots of far out unproven allegations she has lifted from Rupert Murdoch's New York Post. She wants us to accept them as fact.

Ms. Noonan, apparently snubbed at some point by HRC and out to get revenge, tells us why we (New Yorkers, in the short term, and the US at large in the long term) should not vote for HRC. However, Noonan does not present facts. She peppers the book with phrases such as: &quot;Let us speculate&quot; what HRC will do if she were to become senator (president). &quot;Perhaps a conversation with HRC might go like this . . . &quot; It is true that a few facts are included, but most are Noonan's very biased thoughts transposed as HRC's. I could not finish reading the book. I was tired enough of mud slinging from the recent campaigns. I did not need to read fictionalized bashing, whether you, me, or Noonan like HRC's political views or not."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Peggy Noonan, author of over-praised prose for Reagan and Bush, puts her poisoned pen at the service of George W. and Rudy G. in this hastily written, poorly-sourced, and totally irrelevant &quot;anti-campaign book&quot;. If you've seen Peggy hawking this piece of tripe on the FOX NEWS CHANNEL, you know just how impressed with her own words this woman can be. But without the added spice of MS. Noonan's excricuatingly inimitable, dime-store charm-school delivery, her prose is exceedingly dull and uninteresting. The words sit on the page like dead, ugly things. Things to be hated, things to be despised.Peggy should give it a rest and get to work on her next project, a crypto-religious study of the Elian case and the &quot;miracle of the dolphins&quot;. That should at least be funnier than this warmed-over collection of last-century's news."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Those below that have suggested that this book reveals more about Peggy Noonan than Hillary Clinton are absolutely correct. It reveals Ms. Noonan to be one of two things: an incredibly politically nave ideologue or a cynical wordsmith who is obsessed with her hatred of Hillary Clinton.And yes, it is hatred not contempt, as Ms. Noonan would have it. (Those who have contempt for another by definition put themselves above that person morally. This is more appealing to people like Ms. Noonan because it implies that she is more rational and decent than the person who hates is since hatred implies ignorance. This is all well and good except that the tone and techniques of this book reveal Ms. Noonan as perfectly willing to sling mud with the best of them. Claiming she feels contempt is like her saying her hands aren't dirty because she wore gloves.)And what are the tone and techniques of this book? First of all, Ms. Noonan feels free to repeatedly accuse the Clintons of scandals but provides NO documentation. It's all &quot;in the public record,&quot; according to her. So why not provide citations? (Possibly because the public record isn't so damning. For a good look at the Clinton &quot;scandals,&quot; read &quot;The Hunting of the President&quot; by Joe Conason and Gene Lyons, who meticulously examine the public record and document how a good number-but not all-of the Clinton &quot;scandals&quot; turn out to be the invention of right-wing ideologues (including Ken Starr) with a grudge.)Ms. Noonan can't be bother with this. Instead of facts, Ms. Noonan seems to think dime-store psychologizing by former Clinton staffers with copies of psychology textbooks and comments from members of the press counts as firm evidence. (The mainstream press doesn't come off very well in Lyons and Conason's book.) She puts words into Hillary's head to &quot;explain&quot; her--including a long chapter on how Hillary is supposedly thinking regarding the New York campaign. The one example where she extensively quotes Hillary (on education), she refuses to let the few quotes she provides stand for themselves. More revealing, she claims, are the negative commentaries of people like Christopher Lasch.The tone is snide and grating. If Clinton's record is so bad, simply stating and documenting it ought to be enough. Instead, she repeatedly provides lists of &quot;scandals&quot; unrelated to her current argument in order, presumably to make sure you remember the pejorative name, but not the details.This book is also terribly organized and edited to the point where Ms. Noonan contradicts herself. For instance, in Chapter 4, she discusses Hillary's attempt to craft a national health care program. Chapter 5 then opens with Ms. Noonan complaining that she has NEVER seen Hillary spend ANY of her political capital. Excuse me, but anyone who tries to reform health care MUST spend a lot of political capital to even get people to discuss it! Similarly, she criticizes Hillary for holding the initial health care reform meetings behind closed doors, but then has a fantasy sequence where she wishes Ms. Clinton had held a secret meeting with Hollywood execs to encourage them to monitor their products for sex and violence.The WORST thing about this book is Ms. Noonan's arrogance regarding the state of political debate in this country. She derides the Clinton's for distorting and lowering our political life, yet publishes this book which offers innuendo, name-calling, cheap psychologizing and self-righteous breast beating as legitimate criticism. There IS a books to be written about the price (and rewards) of cynicism in politics, but Ms. Noonan isn't interested in that.What she IS interested in (and why she hates the Clintons) is revealed in the final chapter. Here, Ms. Noonan imagines what a great Clinton presidency would have been like. She lists the things he didn't address that he could have. He didn't address entitlement programs &quot;in ways that his party's left had balked at but that he knew were promising and practical.&quot; He didn't create a missile defense. He refused to accept Republican welfare reform. He didn't encourage &quot;school liberation&quot; proposals. &quot;All he had to do was be a sound steward...love his country, put it before his passing interests, go for the long haul, think long-term, be a patriot,&quot; she intones.Pardon me if I translate: All he had to do was be a Republican.Ms. Noonan and others hate Clinton because they are offended that he single-handedly stopped the Republican revolution. (Well, the inept Republican leadership helped.) What is amazing is that Ms. Noonan seems stunned that the Clintons didn't let the Republicans have their way. She is offended that he was a far superior politician than Newt Gingrich and she hates him for it. Grow up.(As a final comment, politics needs both calculating politicians and idealistic zealots to work properly. Too much of either leads to corruption. Too much venality leads to things like Travelgate. Too much ideology leads to a President wrapping himself in the flag while Iran/Contra is carried out by his subordinates. Bismarck got it right when he compared the making of laws to the making of sausages-you really don't want to see how it happens.)"},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"This is a great expose about one of the biggest frauds of all time - Hilary R.

One hundred and eighty dreadful pages of a conservative elitist savaging a so-called liberal elitist. Noonan is so obviously everything she claims Clinton to be with one difference: She's a Republican. You can absolutely cut the jealousy with a knife as you read a woman whose time has passed lashing out at a woman whose time may be now.&quot;Preaching to the converted&quot; isn't exactly accurate. Noonan still seems to believe that fans of Hillary and Bill Clinton will flock to her cause after all that has happened in the past eight years. Much of the book is pitched at the New York soccer mom, including a truly embarassing appeal to a fictional (of course) Massapequa mom. Noonan continues the familiar Republican refrain: &quot;I'm appalled that America continues to accept these people. But they will eventually come over to the side of good.&quot; If that's not elitism, I don't know what is.The hatred I feel for Peggy Noonan after reading this sewage is tempered only by the embarassment I feel for her. Not only has she written a poor book, she has sprinkled it with some of the most laughable rhetorical flourishes ever committed to the page, things an eighth grader might write with a 102 fever.And believe me, there is a reason this thing is 180 pages of large type. It's a Wall Street Journal op-ed stretched over the length of a book in a cynical attempt to make money. I can just picture Noonan repeatedly bringing back the manuscript to her editor. &quot;Sorry Peggy, it's not long enough, we need a little more.&quot; &quot;Not yet, Peggy. Why don't you put in that Hollywood dream sequence we had decided to leave out.&quot; &quot;OK, Peggy. We were hoping for 200 pages, but it's been a year and we might as well get this thing out.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Noonan's book on her experience as a Reagan speech writer was a wonderful book. One need not turn misty-eyed or view Sen Clinton thru rose colored glasses, to conclude that Noonan's book is just another vile tract from the &quot;get Bill, get Hillary&quot; camp of late-night cable TV right-wingers. Talk about &quot;politics of personal destruction&quot;! Hillary was dead-on accurate about the vast right wing conspiracy, judging from this unpleasant work. I hope Noonan will turn her considerable skills on other &quot;character&quot; issues -- may those on her side of the street: e.g., &quot;W&quot; getting rich off the Texas Rangers (just imagine what they would have to Hillary if she had turned $600,000 to $13mil with the help of her daddy's buddies; and the dirty job done on Sen. mccain during the primaries, etc. Gee, suppose Hillary had done what Linda Chavez did -- break the law, lie to the vetting group .... it would keep the late night &quot;get Bill, get Hillary&quot; crowd busy for years!

None of them new, just more clearly presented. ... The last chapter is the best sumation of what this adminitration has done to our country. No true American regardless of party affiliation should be willing to support leaders like the Clintons just to stay in power. The reviews easily point out Clinton nonsupporters and Clinton supporters will not be changed by Ms. Noonan's book.

It is time for both Clintons to be retired, permanently."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Boy, Ms. Noonan has nailed the Clintons in a way that is to the point and minus any gratuitous sleaze. A fast read, this book should be carefully considered by partisans as well as the more neutral bystander because if the Clintons mirror what America holds dear in their politicians, we're in a heap of trouble.

Scary and sad at the same time."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"In reading TCAHC I was immediately struck by the whole phrase &quot;Clintonism&quot; and how deadly it could be for this country. Ms. Noonan has written a very convincing arguement against any further promotion for either of the Clintons or Gore. The simple fact is that to elect Mrs. Clinton to the Senate is to reward her for her ability to tell half-truths and lies with much more power than she will ever need.

Apparently one is good and one not.I have followed Ms. Noonan's work since the Reagan years and have never been disappointed at her intellect, understanding and great writing ability.

[A]s a Democrat, I grew weary of expending more and more energy in a vain attempt to maintain my ignorance, believing that the Clintons must be, after all, good people. No more.

But the rest of the book demonstrates her political unfitness to represent a state she has \\"no connection to, no history with, no previously demonstrated interest in.\\" Anticipating the charge usually leveled against anyone who doesn't stomach their prevarications as a 'Clinton hater', she quotes Christopher Hitchens: \\"I do not hate them, I have contempt for them.\\"Of course, it doesn't hurt to have on your side an all-forgiving press that doesn't mind being played for a fool. The media were willingly complicit because they shared the Clinton's left-wing utopia of big federal and world government, and their distrust of working-class citizens to make decisions regarding their own lives. This distrust was reflected in the Hillarycare fiasco, where the courts were required to crack the obsessive secrecy surrounding her Task Force. In the end, the lack of public consultation produced a behemoth of unworkable complexity that was doomed from the beginning.Nor does it hurt to install a staff with steamroller mindset, utterly and blindingly loyal, unafraid to flatten anyone that gets in your way, chewing up anybody who is not willing to sacrifice their integrity to the cause. Hillary showed no compunction about destroying the lives of the White House travel office staff who had served loyally for decades. Hillary's staff illegally held hundreds of classified FBI files that could be used against Republican officials. Years of Clinton governorship and presidency taught that you can get away with absolutely anything if you deny, evade, prevaricate, attack, and smear.And it certainly doesn't hurt that your husband barters his office for your campaign. The book goes into some detail about the Americans killed or injured by the FALN terrorists who were pardoned by Bill Clinton in return for campaign donations.Peggy Noonan drives home the obscenity of their behavior by an ingenious application of fictional device. For instance, we see how the Clintons debased our own standards of governance when she transplants George and Barbara Bush into their roles. When she presents a hypothetical meeting of Hillary using her influence with the entertainment industry, we begin to comprehend the tragedy of a squandered presidency. The Clinton legacy is the pursuit of power for its own sake, having no perceptible loyalty or ideology, and having no other goal than to perpetuate itself.Peggy Noonan with an endearing tone relates a story about the woman who channels Eleanor Roosevelt, and sadness at the lack of humility that is the mark of a great leader. It is the story of a woman who sold her soul and our trust for a shot at power. \\"Then there came the moment when I realized: They're never going to leave.\\""},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"the case against hillary apparently includes imaginary moments invented by the author involving hillary standing up against the media big wigs, and \\"candid\\" campaign moments that didn't actually happen. Peggy's talent as an author does have a nice tinge of classiness to it, and the book doesn't scream sexism like the other anti-hillary literature out there, but the overall quality and impact of the book is tacky and reeks of something out of the national inquirer. Peggy enjoys being melodramatic and while it makes for an entertaining read, The reliance is on prose and not on facts. Therefore, it is difficult to be taken seriously. For example, she states that she can't think of a single time that Hillary has \\"jeopardized her position with her base\\". Excuse me? The Iraq war vote? Hillary Clintons stance on flag burning? It's a very grand statement that she makes here, but it isn't true.

Then I strongly encourage you to read this fabulous book by Peggy Noonan, who in a very concise, clear, honest, and dispassionate manner, tells us why it is time for the Clintons to be gone . . . and forever. Whether you are a Democrat, Republican or independent, you will clearly see why this nation deserves better. If you read only one book this year, let it be this one."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Peggy Noonan's book does not explore new territory about this awful woman. Most people who are interested already know the sordid facts about her political ascent, about her lust for power, and about her fundamental mendacity. William Safire has called her a \\"congenital liar\\" in print, and he was probably being restrained at that. Noonan's work is a meditation on the nature of evil as it is embodied in this woman. It is a short and powerful indictment.For those interested in examining the pernicious effect of Hillary upon her followers, do read the comments of her partisans, below. Not a single one offers any factual argument against the book they pillorize. If any reasons to lambaste the book are stated, they are \\"ad hominem\\" arguments, attacks against Ms. Noonan; never a comment on what she says.

Hillary Clinton is very good at that.And Noonan is very good at showing us, via narrative &amp; vignette thru 12 chapters, how devilishly skilled Hillary has become at dissembling and pretense.Anyone who votes for her should expect much more of the same.

She does after all have a better picture of what goes on behind closed White House doors than the rest of us. Peggy emphasizes how power hungry the Clintons are and the driving forces behind them. Ms. Noonan questions Hillary's ability to lead, and if she does in fact have leadership qualities, why she has accomplished so little during her tenure in the White House. Peggy leads the reader to think that the New York Senate race is just the first step to bigger and better positions.

Of course Hillary wants to be President, and, if she achieves that goal, as the author so skillfully suggests, we will find it infinitely more painful than the first Clinton Era. After 8 years of Hillary's self-created and self-promoted image of herself as just about the smartest woman alive, it is refreshing to see other intelligent women pointing out how mundane, ineffective and just plain mean Ms. Clinton has proven herself to be. Ms. Noonan writes beautifully, and her comments regarding Hillary's use of language to obscure rather than enlighten echo a similar and equally beautifully-written essay by Janet Scott Barlow in her book, The Nonpatritoic President: A Survey of the Clinton Years.

Now we are faced with the prospect of their return to power, only this time their power will make the Bill Clinton Presidency look like nothing. Bill wants to be Secretary-General of a U.N. infused with greater international power in light of American unpopularity, which the Clintons are delighted about.

Peggy Noonan has written a sober, thoughtful analysis of Hillary Clinton which notes her virtues - however, these are very few - as well as her numerous flaws. She accurately portrays a woman who is more obsessed with acquiring more political power than with any genuine desire to help her country.To her immense credit, Peggy Noonan makes her strong, persuasive case in clear, lucid prose. It is regrettable that a sizeable majority of my state was hoodwinked by Hillary Clinton; I regret that many are still entranced by her illusion of power, not at all dismayed by her utter lack of statesmanship, grace, and dignity. Peggy Noonan's fine, terse book should be read by all who hope Ms. Clinton never realizes her Presidential ambitions. And more importantly, it should be read by those who remain convinced that Ms. Clinton and her husband are fine, decent folk. Indeed, Ms. Noonan's book is the finest indictment against Clintonism that I have yet read."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Noonan's beautiful, experienced voice makes this book a sharp but lush synopsis of Hillary's career, or lack thereof. (She also has a lovely audio voice. &quot;What I Saw at the Revolution&quot; on tape is tops). These 180 pages are perfect for a first time examination of Hillary's issues (or lack thereof) or as a refresher. Noonan goes way beyond typical &quot;who, what, where,&quot; books on the Clintons that read like a series of 2-D newspaper articles by mixing in some creative fiction and a dream sequenceThe book's voice is simple but poetic and concerned. Like Reagan's speeches, maybe? National Review wrote that the voice of Reagan eerily calls from the pages of this book. This seems true at times and this is a credit to Noonan's past work as speechwriter. Still, I think at times she projects Reagan onto Hillary. She focuses a lot on Hillary as image crafter, as photo opportunist, as contrasting issue stands with words and pictures that say something else. Sound familiar? Noonan writes that &quot;Reagan used words to cut through the fog&quot; where Hillary adds to it. I think Hillary! has a lot more in common with Reagan than Noonan might think. This is a great book about Hillary! but perhaps it is also about Reagan and the current political era he helped shape."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"This is a very good book; it lays out the problems with Hillary. I liked it because it was not a biography on the cLIEton's. The author gives you the facts and statements of Hillary without the spin from the press and the talking points of the left-wingers. Some people believe since she was a Reagan writer, therefore she is disqualified. There is one problem with that; those same people want us to believe all the people who came out of the cLIEton's Whitehouse and the books they wrote. An example is George Stephanopoulos book. I am saying just be fair. Buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I appreciate Ms. Noonan's statement up front about herintentions in this book. It really is a must-read for all of usliberals who want to see good done for the left-out people of this country. With the Clintons, somehow our party has been hijacked, diverted from genuine compassion, and become devoted to self-serving politicians. Noonan is gentle and provides easily verified information for us to consider."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"In what is is an intellectual yet straightforward argument, Ms. Noonan has written a book that I just couldn't put down. Objectively, I think Ms. Noonan has captured the very essence of Hillary Clinton and has done so in a fair, non-gossipy manner. Indeed, she backs her argument with facts which make her opinion all the more persuasive. Every New Yorker -- rather every American -- should consider this a must read!"},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"This is a very short polemic on the character of the former first lady by Reagan speechwriter and author of \\"What I saw at the revolution\\" and other works. In this book the writer is alleging that Senator Clinton feels entitled to power, Noonan summarizes her involvement in a number of scandals. So many scandals and a good teflon suit. This book shows once again, as many other do, that Hillary cares about only one thing, Hillary. As with any book about Hillary Clinton, this book conatians some strong language. And is a fast read, so spend an afternoon and read it."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Before I read this book, I hadn't given much thought to the unfolding scenario of another Clinton presidency. I thought it was unfortunate that Hillary was running for, and would undoubtedly win, the New York Senate Seat, because I don't think she has accumulated much of a track record on her own. In this slim book, Peggy Noonan articulates why it is that people like myself just get kind of sick to their collective stomaches at many more years of the Clintons. Ms. Noonan argues that the Clintons are incapable of listening to their constituents. Instead,they believe that they are inherently better than Americans because they just know what we need. Take a look at the excerpts from Hillary's early writings on children. Before you dismiss them as immature writings of an unworldly young woman, review the failed health care efforts and figure what she has learned. An excellent book - and thin so it can be read before the election."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Peggy Noonan's decision to write a book about Hillary Clinton was inspired. Noonan is a gifted writer and uniquely qualified to judge Hillary as a lifetime New Yorker. Noonan's analysis was top notch. Why does Hillary get away with blanket statements like &quot;vast right wing conspiracy&quot; to explain the presidents lies? How could Mrs. Clinton have believed Bill's public lie about Monica Lewinksy after Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Juanita Broderick and a hosts of others?Much of the book is a psychoanalysis of the Clintons and their need to be loved and hold power. It was very much like her analysis of Reagan, in a previous book, in which she analyzed him as an adult child of an alcoholic. I agree with the pscho-analysis of Hillary, but Noonan many times relies on unnamed friends of the Clinton's as source material. While I have no reason to disbelieve these quotes, I kept wondering who these friends were that would talk to Peggy, but remain friends of the Clintons.The speech written (dreamt) by Noonan in which Hillary talks tough to Hollywood moguls was brilliant in pointing out the first lady's lack of concern over real issues and their solutions, but the book may have been stronger without the distraction of such a device on the heals of Edmund Morris' semi-fictional biography of Reagan. Though, this was probably the best way for a speech-writer (Noonan) to describe the flaws of an opposition candidate. All in all a good look at why Mrs. Clinton should find an early retirement."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Peggy Noonan exposes the truth about Hillary Clinton's drive for power and shows the ugly underbelly of Hillary's character without getting ugly herself.If you're short for time, read chapter nine first and see how Ms. Noonan uses Hillary's own words and writings to tear down the myth of &quot;Hillary the champion for children&quot;. Noonan exposes Hillary's hidden agenda by citing her own words and does the the job that New York journalists seem reluctant to do; make Hillary back up these ideas or refute them.The &quot;dream&quot; sequence didn't bother me as much as the invented character in the Reagan biography. This sequence, shorter than a chapter, shows the possibility of a Clinton administration, if only their concern was truly with the betterment of the country, and not only with their own hold on power. It had me fooled for a while, and when I found out it was a fake, I wasn't mad at Noonan for imagining it, I was mad at Hillary for not actually confronting the Hollywood power players as Noonan illustrates.While reading this book, I began to feel that it would be wonderful if Peggy Noonan would run against Hillary for the Senate seat. I kept trying to imagine Hillary's comebacks to the stinging points Noonan makes on page after page.Anyone thinking of voting for Hillary should be required to read this book. Anyone concerned with the future of America, who wants to know how the liberal media elevated this mediocre, power hungry, back-woods lawyer to a super star should study it and hold onto it as Hillary makes her run for Senate, President, Supreme Court Justice, or Ruler of the New World Order."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Beyond the specifics of Hillary Clinton and her ambitions and actions, this book is about our culture, our nation, our world and the jeopardy we place them in by investing power in people whose values are narcissistic fulfillment and the assuarnces found from wielding power. Peggy Noonan catalogues how those things have cost us in the past and how present circumstances portend to repeat that catastrophe if we make that mistake yet again. We are often captivated by the superficial: how people talk and look and seem. We don't plunge beneath the surface in quest of substance. Noonan's description of Hillary Clinton highlights that tragic flaw in our national consciousness. She warns us about the possible courting our own doom, now and worse still later. Brava! Ms. Noonan"},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"The case against Hillary Clinton is well known. She's a lying, enabling, trashing, condescending, egotistical reprobate--a virtual clone of her spouse. A book devoted to her plethora of negatives could easily get bogged down into pleonastic screed, but this work soars. Anyone who read Peggy Noonan's recent widely distributed op ed piece &quot;Why Did They Do It?&quot; about the government's nazi-style kidnapping of Elian Gonzalez knows that she is nothing short of a maestro with the written word. She does with a paper and pen what Michaelangelo did with a slab of concrete.Even though Hillary is the title character, Ms. Noonan realizes that the Clintons--unconventional as their marriage may be-- are inextricably intertwined. They may not be the typical man and wife, but they are full-fledged partners in slime whose misery and misdeeds will keep them together unhappily ever after.Unlikely many political conservatives, the author reveals an initial respect for and hope that the Clintons would prove successful and good for America. Like many liberals (as well as conservatives and moderates) she became disgusted by the profligate shenanigans to which they subjected the country that he was entrusted to guide. The book subtly captures the irony of a militant feminist who demurred disinterestedly while the world learned the perverse details of her husband's sexcapades with an intern barely older than their daughter. Hillary, whose disdain for the uxorial role is well-known, must have boiled over privately that her greatest public support came when she was forced to play the part of a wronged wife.Especially delectable is the description of a fantasy palaver between Hillary and Hollywood's most powerful magnates at Michael Eisner's house. Although the scene is too bizarre for belief, Peggy perfectly captures the cadence of Hillary and her show biz cheerleaders that readers are completely pulled into the surrealism of it.Suffice it to say that this is a must read. In Peggy Noonan's magical manner, she masterfully outlines the enigma of the Clintons. Their depravity is their strength. They do not have a willingness to lie; they have a need to. They are experts at believably telling the most brazen stories without any hint of verisimilitude and are equally skilled at condemning anyone who dares to scoff at their nonsense. While Hillary may not share in her husband's unrestrained concupiscence, her lust for power is every bit as potent.Ms. Noonan has written many great speeches and mind-expanding columns, but this could be her most important effort yet. If it convinces any open-minded, wavering New Yorkers not to select Hillary as their next senator and retire both Clintons to New York, Arkansas, or whatever state draws the short straw, then we will all owe her a huge debt of gratitude."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I've read the book and facts are stubborn things. It's clever to write a review asserting that the book is Sean Hannity with a thesaurus, but the book is not just opinion. It's about facts. Facts that won't go away.Hillary's two major policy initiatives, health care and education in Arkansas, were complete failures. And they both say volumes about how she would govern.The Travel office scandal is also instructive. Rather than just remove the people under the President's patronage power she had to ruin them with false accusations and a criminal trial.Miss Noonan touches on the cattle futures scam. The failure of the American people to understand that these arranged trades were nothing more than a bribe still stuns me. And Hillary had the gall not to pay all the income tax on her bribes. I doubt the Clintons would have pulled that crime off in New York.Chapter five is brillant. I laughed out loud. Twice.The author also raises a very important point with her culture of death reference and fish analogy.The best thing she does is that she pre-empts many of Hillary's upcoming campaign tricks and scams. Maybe the elite media will call Hillary on it.Did you ever wonder why HRC has so many different hairstyles? Answer provided by Noonan.Her point about honest liberals is well-taken. I don't agree with Senator Bob Kerrey but I respect him. Not the Clinton-Gore crowd. They called him a &quot;cripple&quot; and threw mud at him in NH. It's all about power for the Clintons. And less freedom for you. Because we aren't as smart as the Clintons and their crowd.She's already been to Nebraska getting money from Warren Buffett. But first she stopped in a local store, Borsheim's, to buy china and silverware. I guess the New York stores weren't good enough. Or maybe she didn't want to pay the high NY sales tax."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Peggy Noonan is one of my favorite writers. (Sometimes I think she is the world's most wonderful woman). Having read &quot;What I Saw At The Revolution&quot; I was really looking forward to reading this book and was not disappointed. Peggy Noonan is an artist with the english language and a conservative treasure. Needless to say if you adore the clinton's you probably will not like this book (no pictures...haha). Basis of book is Hillary Clinton said she was going on a listening tour to find out what New York thinks of her possibly running for the senate seat. Well, since Peggy Noonan is from NY she thought she would speak about Hillary (but I dont think Hillary is listening to this). Book does not so much deal with Clinton policies as to who they are....the lies, the deceit, the pretending to be &quot;one of us&quot;. One of the best parts of book is where she talks about Hillary giving speech to Hollywood elites, Noonan writes about Hillary scolding these people on not putting out better more wholesome positive entertainment. Problem is, it never happened. It was Peggy Noonan tribute to Edmund Morris. All in all this is a good read and only those who consider the Clinton's to be diety will be upset."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"This, like Barbara Olson's book, is one that Hillary's supporters don't want to read themselves and don't want you to read either. It is compact but full of facts and opinion nicely woven together in Ms. Noonan's very readable style. This book should push a lot of fence sitters off their perch."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Hmmmm, How many other recent books received either one or five stars, with almost nothing in between? Ms Noonan is one of the best wordsmiths working today; this book confirms it. Those who have criticized the writing, rather than the subject, are showing their bias. And the subject? This book clearly shows that Hillary! can comfortably take her place beside Al Gore, Al Sharpton, James Carville, her husband and other leading lights of the Democratic party. I wonder if the Rev Jesse Jackson is still her spiritual advisor? Buy the book!"},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Ms. Noonan has simply spelled out for us in an elegant fashion what any person who has an ounce of common sense and whose mind isn't closed to the truth already knows. Mrs Clinton cares about nothing other that the accumulation and exercise of power. The gullibility and willingness to be lied to of the American people never ceases to amaze me. This woman has no shame. She will say anything to defer guilt from herself no matter how strong the evidence against her or the President. It has been a very long seven years and I for one will be glad to see the scandal-ridden shameful Clinton years draw to a close. That is, of course, unless New Yorkers are willing to let Hillary pull off her Senate scam. Thank you Peggy Noonan for reminding us just how blind the American people can be when it comes to Ms. Clinton."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"This is an interesting read full of facts but that is the problem,because nobody on the left wants to believe it.They would rather continue to buy into her phony charm which is a Clinton trademark.However,Liberals should not worry because phony charm is what wins the day in the new millenium.Remember,it's not who you are that matters anymore,it's how good you can pull the wool over everyone's eyes that count."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"This is not a mindless &quot;I hate Hillary Clinton&quot; tirade. ... Anyone who paid attention to what they were reading, and has studied the Clintons for the past eight years could never say such a thing. Peggy Noonan has written an engrossing and cogent dissertation on why Hillary Clinton should not be Senator from New York, or hold any other high political office. Hillary is an unambiguously amoral, uncaring, power mad individual who wants nothing more than to stay in power and the public spotlight. She is a socialist who believes that people are not capable of running their own lives, and that the government should do it for us, to protect us from our own stupidity and incompetence. She believes she is far superior to us. She is nothing like the people of New York, or anywhere else for that matter. She knows nothing of the trials and tribulations most people endure, of working hard, trying to save money for our retirements and our childrens education, wondering how we'll pay our bills, if we'll lose our jobs, if we'll be attacked on the way to the grocery store, if our children are being well educated, and are safe at school etc. She's never had to worry about those things due to her wealthy upbringing and her life as the wife of Arkansas's governor, and then as the First Lady. She just can't relate. And that's reason enough to vote against her, since how can she represent people she doesn't understand and empathize with? But it's more than that. Noonan shows that Hillary just doesn't care about anyone but herself, and makes a good point for Hillary being psychologically disturbed. It's not far fetched at all. The book is absolutely chilling. This is not a person you want setting public policy."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Peggy Noonan is a talented writer - clear, lucid, witty, always engaging. Her book offers ample insights into why Hillary Clinton and her husband will hopefully &quot;just go away&quot;, rather than continue to inflict their special blend of arrogance, hypocrisy, and deceitfulness on the country.Ms. Noonan's case could have benefited from stronger editing. I felt, for example, a hypothetical conversation snippet imagined at Hillary's future gravesite was regrettable and tasteless. More concerning - especially after Ms. Noonan wrote negatively (and accurately) about Edmund Morris fiction/non-fiction Ronald Reagan biography - was an extremely interesting portion of her book set at Michael Eisner's home; a scene which turns out, in the end, to be entirely made up by Ms Noonan. She describes how she wound up watching this (fictional) scene, as the friend of Eisner's housekeeper! I felt disappointed and manipulated after reading this fascinating scene to find out at its close that Ms. Noonan had imagined it entirely - including fictional quotes from Ted Turner, etc.The whole thing left a bitter taste - much like Edmund Morris' fictional footnotes. I felt similarly concerned about Ms. Noonan's repeatedly telling us, sometimes with quotes, what the Clinton's were thinking during various scenes. Can we have a collective moratorium against fictional excursions set unannounced in in purportedly non-fiction, serious books? Ms. Noonan is a wonderful speech writer - I feel she may have succumbed to the temptation to write Hillary a good speech here and have some fun in the process - but she could have done this and made her point far better by just saying &quot;Here is the kind of courageous speech I would love to hear from Hillary but never will.&quot;Clearly the case against Ms. Clinton is strong enough that one doesn't have to rely on fiction - the unembellished truth about the Clintons is scarey enough.Despite my reservation about the long fictional scene. and and a number of comments about Hillary's appearance and the like which seemed to me to be unnecessary and a touch mean-spirited, I certainly support Ms. Noonan's basic contention that Hillary Clinton should never be Senator from New York or any other state, and join her in wishing the Clinton's a long, un-event-filled. retirement somewhere where they will do the least damage to the country and the people around them."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"The subject and target of Peggy Noonan's new book The Case Against Hillary Clinton is not so much Hillary Clinton, but rather Clintonism, the corrupt and cynical philosophy of politics as a means for obtaining and maintaining power that has damaged and divided the country over the past seven years.Ms. Noonan admits that the book is a polemic written by someone who is very much one of the &quot;Other People&quot; and not &quot;My People&quot; in Hillary Clinton's Manichean ethos. As a polemic, The Case Against Hillary Clinton more closely resembles Christopher Hitchens' No One Left to Lie To than it does Barbara Olson's unflattering biography of Mrs. Clinton. Peggy Noonan does not have the temperament of Hitchens, whose contempt for William Jefferson Clinton literally drips from each page as he punctuates his points with stinging epithets. One gets the impression that she treated this book as a necessary duty. She takes no joy in examining and explaining these joyless and empty narcissists who are unable to live without the adulation and attention of others. In another context, we might feel sympathy for them, but not when they play out their private issues on the world's stage and at the nation's expense.The Case Against Hillary Clinton makes a convincing case why the people of New York should NOT elect Mrs. Clinton as their Senator. She shows that Mrs. Clinton possesses above-average intelligence, below-average character, and virtually no accomplishments of her own. The only substantive venture for which she was given responsibility, the misguided and health care task force, ended in political disaster, which directly led to Republican control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years. Prior to that, Mrs. Clinton was a partner in a politically-connected law firm in a state where her husband was attorney general then governor. She brought two of her partners from the Rose Law Firm to Washington, D.C., one ended up committing suicide and the other committing felonies.Ms. Noonan skillfully argues that a person of such low character and meager accomplishments as Hillary, who has no connection whatsoever to New York State, would seek to be its senator is a mind-boggling display of mad Boomer narcissism. That she has a good chance to win speaks volumes to the moral decline of the character of the nation under Mr. &amp; Mrs. Clinton's stewardship.Mrs. Clinton's dubious achievements are strikingly at odds with her inflated opinion of herself. Ms. Noonan contrasts the Clintons' extreme arrogance, sense of entitlement and moral superiority with the humility of great men like Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II. Mrs. Clinton's candidacy is significant because it foretells an ominous thought: that, unlike other presidents who gracefully left the world's stage and pursued quiet dignified lives -- witness for example Jimmy Carter -- the Clintons will have to be dragged kicking and screaming from the limelights and the attention they crave.I only gave the book 4 stars out of 5 because it covers little new ground. As a polemic, it falls short of the rhetorical brilliance (and excesses) of Hitchens' prose. It touches on a number of themes, which have been developed more fully by other authors. Finally, Ms. Noonan could not resist the temptation to include an Edmund Morris-like incident, which fooled me badly and illustrates the opportunities squandered by people who wanted the power of the Presidency not to achieve great things but to be big people."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Noonan has done a wonderful job of describing what most of us have come to know over the last seven years. I thank God that someone has put into words what Clintonism and its founders have done to this country. This is a must read for anyone who wants the unvarnished truth about Hillary Clinton, and without the left-leaning filtering that the media usually performs when it comes to the Clintons."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"The facade is shattered in Noonan's wonderful book as the First Lady is exposed as empty and as hollow as her rhetoric. The author succeeds in laying bare the truth and is unflinching in her analysis. An excellent job and Noonan deserves high praise. With Hillary, there is simply &quot;no there there&quot;, and in that sense this book's revelations of hypocrisy and valuelessness are quite disturbing. This deserves wide attention during an election year when Clinton's empty hyperbole has replaced substance, a tactic that is cited as typically self-serving by Noonan."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"The Clinton White House, its acolytes and apologists, and its Hillary-led, Mao-like driving sense of entitled victory at all costs has scraped the national consciousness bloody. Much like a doctor removing bits of glass from a patient furious with discomfort, Noonan will be vilified by segments of the public tired of their collective skinned knee, and she will be demonized by the thought police on the Hillary payroll and best-friends list. Noonan's intellectual and personal courage in writing this burning indictment of a Stepford Stalinist who has more in common with Napoleon the boar in Orwell's &quot;Animal Farm&quot; than with Elizabeth Cady Stanton is to be more than applauded. It is to be gravely surveyed as the first book to coolly, and not a little sadly, mine the psyche of a First Lady who devoted her considerable intellectual firepower and Oscar-worthy charisma to the ignoble end of her own personal advancement on the backs of the disenfranchised and needy, and to the destruction of those who stood--and still try to stand--in her way. Continue to wield your surgical tweezers in the service of the national consciousness, Dr. Noonan: we, the easily charmed public, may snarl at your unpleasant pathological findings, but someday when the Clintons finally have their superegos pried from the national podium, we'll read this book again, and marvel at your insight, wit, and fearless icky surgical exploration of the &quot;Being Hillary Clinton&quot; national psychosis. And if Hillary wins the Senate, and then runs for president, we will all shake our heads and think, Peggy, you tried to warn us."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"To be sure, Noonan's critique of Hillary Clinton is an tough argument, but it is not a personal argument, and it is not lightly made. And it should not be lightly dismissed.Noonan's book is a critique of Clintonism -- as practiced by him for the last decade,and also by her. The essence of Clintonism is not liberalism, it is egoism. It is an utter willingness to say or do anything -- or un-say, and undo anything. And it works more often than not, facilitated by the likes of James Carville, George Stephanopolous, and countless other spinners and trimmers. That's why people should read this book; if Clintonism is rewarded at the polls in 2000 for a third straight time, American politics will be further transformed -- for the worse.It's been a long time since I've read a book that stuck to one simple but profound truth in such a crisp and cogent manner. It is indeed a polemic, but it is a polemic with a purpose - - a polemic in the public service."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Beware, New York, beware! In her trenchant &quot;tribute&quot; to the ubiqitous Hillary Clinton, Peggy Noonan heaps some well-deserved opprobrium on this woman with the acquired sense of entitlement, this &quot;selfless&quot; woman who is &quot;running [for a US Senate seat (NY)] for the children.&quot; Noonan cogently details what eight years of Clintonism have built: A seamy, tawdry, Camelot-knockoff. Would-be Senator, you're no Jackie Kennedy! (Oh, please...can we focus on the issues and get back to doing the work of the people of New York?) Bottom-line: There are no coincidences in the Clinton White House. And as for some reviewers calling Noonan's blunt work a &quot;screed&quot; and &quot;character assassination,&quot; Hillary needs no help from Ms. Noonan. She's done very well on her own."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"This is an oftentimes sad, sometimes beautiful little book--it's amazing that such a dense, on-target portrayal could rest between the covers of such a slim volume. Noonan is a very good writer: measured yet passionate; fair yet surgically precise with her well-informed exploration of the Clinton psyche--and thus our own. I recommend this book highly. As a Democrat, I long ago gave up attempting to figure out the Clintons and their awesome selfishness. Noonan has finally allowed me to let go and accept the past eight years. I'm giving copies of this book to all my New York friends--the embarassing era of Clintonism must end. Buy this book now, read it, highlight it, talk about it."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"As an Arkansan and an acquaintance of the Clintons and an amateur student of their governship/presidency, I especially welcome Noonan's masterpiece of insight on the issue of &quot;what the Clintons are&quot;. I have attempted for over twenty years to articulate that definition, and have found that if I had just waited for this book, I could have saved myself the trouble. The Clintons are everything Noonan says they are, and it's not a pretty picture.For the reviewer from New York: if you don't know the facts about the Clintons, with an emphasis on Hillary, read &quot;Hell to Pay&quot; and &quot;Partners in Power&quot;. If you then want to read a book that brings together all the scandals, all the dissembling, the unprincipled opportunism and the sleaze, and explains, in clear if majestic prose, what the result is: &quot;what the Clintons are&quot;, reread this book. It will mean much more to you.A great many of us outside of New York pray that you all will end Clintonism, and the Clintons will then just go away and leave us alone.Tim Watson"},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"After reading all of the reviews at Amazon.com, I had to see what inspired the left to such mean spirited reviews (one woman even drew Anita Hill into it all! ).

This country has rewarded the foward-thinking centrism of Bill and Hillary Clinton with approval ratings that put even Ronnie Reagan to shame. That is the essential dillema Ms. Noonan and her co-conspirators face. It's nice to know the American mainstream has rejected this uglier part of the conservative movement. I hope the John McCain forces can reshape a party that once had a proud tradition. Instead they've settled for George W.

Hillary's gonna getcha!&quot; Her tone is snide, and her words are heavily dipped in the leftover aura of her obsessive love affair with the Reagans and the Bushes who probably put her up to this.

Otherwise, I'd be asking for a refund."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"The ability to write is a great gift and no one can deny that Ms. Noonan has a gift. Having said that, I found her gift used to trash someone for whom she has only contempt (I'll take her word that she does not hate Mrs. Clinton). Does this book bring anything new to the discussion? No. Does the book bring any insight? No. This book is a screed, full of sanctimony and condescension. I also find her use of imaginary conversations and thoughts disingenuous; is this not the writer who condemned Edmond Morris for the practice? Ms. Noonan is just another of those blinded by partisanship and/or hate for anything Clinton. My advice--grow up."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"A book written about the Clinton &quot;legacy&quot;, and Hillary's place in it, might have been an interesting read if it had been written by someone without a partisan axe to grind. Peggy Noonan is clearly not such a person. So what threat is Mrs. Clinton to the continuance of the Republic should she be elected Senator for New York? Ms. Noonan predicts all but the second coming of the fall of the Roman Empire, particularly were her victory in the Senate to propel her to the Oval Office. Oh, come on. The idea that Hillary has her sights set on the White House causes hysterical laughter in my social set. Even if such were her ambition (which I seriously doubt), there's not one person I know (including some who would, to our universal amazement, still vote for Bill could he eligible for re-election) who would vote for her. This book is litle more than a piece of republican campaign literature for Rudy Guiliani, and that's &quot;The Truth&quot;. A dispassionate overview will have to await an author with more distance from the subject(s)."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Former Reagan/Bush speachwriter Peggy Noonan is one of the manysore losers who should be spending their time apologizing for thecampaign of lies and unfounded accusations that have characterized their campaign of Orwellian &quot;Truthspeak&quot;. Even Peggy's former co-worker, Ken Starr, with an unlimited budget, time, and agenda, could not find any facts or proof to substantiate the claims made in this book. But no matter. Peg has a job to do here, and she's not going to let a little thing like facts or accuracy get in her way. Recommended reading for right-wing ostriches who refuse to pull their heads out of their, er, sand. END"},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I love reading differing intelligent discussions of opinions on relevant issues, but this was not it. Noonan's assertion that she does not hate Clinton is a bigger bit of bull than everything she later says about Clinton. I pride myself on being a staunch independent, but this book could steer me from Republican opinions for years to come (nothing but partisan ramblings) not to mention the worse sin of the lot...it's boring.For all who think that this should influence us in New York, remember that the most popular book on her opponent is &quot;Nasty Man&quot;. If you have an opinion of who we should pick, why don't you read the NY Times and see the headlines about what Rudy is up to before you tell us who we should or shouldn't vote for.You can have your opinion, but don't be so stupid as to think that it's worth my 20 bucks."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Peggy Noonan's jihad on Hillary Clinton would be laughable if it wasn't done with such a serious intent to destroy. Last week, independent counsel Robert Ray announced that &quot;There was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official,or first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, was involved in seeking confidential (FBI)background reports.&quot; So, after years of investigations, spending millions of dollars, the special counsel finds no wrong. Like Ms. Noonan's book, it was all a waste of time and money--this witch's hunt is over."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Most of what Noonan writes is not new information--but it is a good compilation of what has transpired in Hillary's public life. The book is well-written, yet an easy read."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I am no fan of anyone named Clinton and I welcome any and all critiques of their activities, but seriously: this book is just so poorly written as to be almost unbelievable. I suggest that Ms. Noonan enroll immediately in a Basic Comp. class at her local community college.Also, and maybe this is irrelevant, but is Peggy Noonan not the most obnoxious human ever? I mean, has anyone seen her on television? Everything about her (especially her voice) is so . . . put on, affected. She is, as Holden Caufield would say, a phony.I guess what I'm trying to say is that this woman deserves to suffer a great deal of sustained pain. Not killed or maimed or anything like that. But someone should give her a big and hideous bruise, and then spend like 10 years straight just pushing on it. I'm sure there wouldn't be a shortage of volunteers."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book because I admire Peggy Noonan's gifted writing skills and I certainly agree with the premise of the book. But, this book seemed to me to not present enough material to justify being published. I think she had enough good material to produce a very fine magazine article or series of 2-3 articles, but, I guess she and her agent had sold a publisher on a book deal. By the time she gets through trying to stretch her ideas into a short book, the result is not pretty. Was she just lazy or couldn't she come up with more solid material? The travel office material was very good, but, not much else was up to that quality level.Overall, a lost opportunity to speak out well on the issues and a lot of lost credibility for the author."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I am no fan of the Clintons, but have a voracious appetite for American History in general and presidential politics in specific. I have been a huge admirer of Peggy Noonan for many years (her speeches for Ronald Reagan were both clear and poetic (such as when the Challenger exploded), but this book came across primarily as a hatchet job. There were no new revelations; while I think that many of the things said were likely true, they were mere rehashings of past history. Ms. Noonan's coy &quot;meeting&quot; between Hillary and members of the Hollywood/entertainment glitterati was annoying at best. I was left feeling that the book was written primarily for a paycheck."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"This book makes it clear that we could have the kind of mind control that was seen in the original book about Big Brother. The book is called 1984 where there were NO individual freedoms. Big Brother could electronically watch your every move. Reading this book is a must for anyone who cares about individual rights."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"For some of you reviewers who feel that a &quot;hatchet job&quot; was done against poor hillary..think again.The only hatcheting was a self inflicted one. Greed, misplaced power, deceit, and undignifying the institution of the executive office, were not on the people's agenda. What goes around comes around. Ms. Noonan has presented the FACTS that most of us are already familiar with. There is not anything new to find in this book. She simply states it for the record...an overview of most concerned citizens who are disgusted with the clinton bunch.We have had a wanna be Kennedy in office for 8 years and he did not make it....guess hillary thinks she can become Jack?....(do I see an operation in her future?)...The only legacy the clintons leave behind is a full waste disposal. We may need to find a location far far away for elimination of its contents.I am reading the book at this time...almost completed it....simply written, an easy read, and the facts are no surprise to anyone....Can't wait for a book about the clintons...say, in about 10 more years....&quot;The clintons in Cuba&quot;????...watch out Fidel!!!"},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I amazed by the public and some reviews on Hillary and the author. It seems if you loved the Reagans' you hate the Clintons' and if you love the Clintons' you hate the Reagans'. Now this book does not depict Hillary as an evil person, it explains why some people have come to doubt her. On the other hand, people seeking power of all kind often lose themselves in the process, including Alexander The Great and Alexander Hamilton and no women is immune from such vanity. It is because prowling for power in a Democratic Society sometimes makes good people to make mistakes. Hillary has been a good mother, loyal wife and an able professional lawyer. She had every right to promote her ideas, offer counsel and advice to her husband and defend him on her own terms. Did she go to far and cross the line of decency or even the Rule of Law, well that has yet to be determined. Therefore, read the book, gather more insight and while we await the investigation and election outcome, please let Hillary win or lose on her own words, agenda or platform. It must be remembered, that Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford hated each other in 1974, now they are best of friends. President Truman destroyed papers on Eisenhower's affair even when Eisenhower refused to meet with him. Sometimes in the heat of political battle we often fall victim to judgments that are formed by rumors and emotions. This book is not filled with hate towards Hillary and its pity may be misplaced too. However, like Carter and Ford, I think the same will happen one day to Hillary and Peggy becoming the best of friends. Both are accomplished women regardless of what any critics say. The book is worth reading and will change your views one way or another about both women."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I read this book in one sitting, not because it was so engaging but because it was so brief--and so full of vitriol. What in the world would possess someone to sink so low in the realm of public discourse? In truth, this is not worthy of a book...it's really an editorial essay extended into book form, and neither the essay nor the book is very good. It's full of unsubstantiated claims, lots of ad populum appeal, and is clearly preaching to the choir of hateful conservatives--no doubt Christians--who can't get enough of this sort of Clinton bashing. Don't get me wrong: the Clintons are worthy of well-researched, well-argued bashing, but this book doesn't succeed even remotely. And as other reviewers have noted, it's mean-spirited and tasteless at times. It's like listening to your ignorant neighbor who's full of passion but is almost wholly uninformed (except for whatever snippets from TV and radio he's assimilated). The best news for me is that I didn't have to buy this; I read it in the library. I thought Noonan was recognized as a pretty good writer. Can she really be this awful?"},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"i loved this book. Buy it, it was so good."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Noonan admits that this is a polemic. But it is rational and eloquent, not rabid. She believes that the Clintons's essential selfishness makes it dangerous for them to wield power. She offers no new revelations but takes the facts already on the record and asks us to see the pattern they make.She demonstrates that opposition to the Clintons does not have to be irrational but can be fact-based and coherent. Unlike many anti-Clinton books, Noonan's case does not depend on wild allegations, shadowy conspiracies, or strident rhetoric. One can disagree with her conclusions but they cannot be easily dismissed."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I am no fan of anyone named Clinton and I welcome any and all critiques of their activities, but seriously: this book is just so poorly written as to be almost unbelievable.

I do, though, hate this book. Noonan, who has no business writing laundry lists, much less public speeches or books, is yet another snooty, upper-class twit who has it in for the Clintons. I read half of this book, became angry at the author's unfounded biases toward Hillary, and then I flung the thing across the room. A bevy of adjectives come to mind in describing this book: unimaginative, &quot;superior,&quot; elitist, narrow-minded, pro-wealth, jingoistic, mediocre, forgettable, cheap. And chances are that these same adjectives apply to the people who like this book."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Great writing, but where is the content? She tells us nothing, absolutely NOTHING, new. Okay, so she doesn't like Hillary's personality, appearance, friends, husband and so on and so forth, which is fair enough, but never ever does Peggy Noonan give us a good reason WHY. In fact, the only slightly interesting part was the fiction scene with the entertainment execs in LA. That was actually my favorite part of the book, because she surprised me - which the rest of the book definitely failed to do. I agree with whoever said this book deserves 0 stars. An extremely un-intelligent effort from an otherwise bright woman."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"The cult of Hillary Clinton, with one deep admirer, HRC! She will go to any lengths to keep it going, and at the expense of the American taxpayer!It is shocking that our country has fallen to such a point that we don't care what is behind a person so long as ... well, you fill in the blank. We're out of control, we all know it, and least of the likes of Hillary are any help out of it.The mock meeting with the media giants is worth the book itself!...Marvelous piece of investigative journalism. She certainly writes with a wit and sharpness which anyone would dream of as a speechwriter."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"When all else fails, incriminate the messenger. Another legacy of the Clinton Administration."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"This book should be listed as fiction. Most of it is imaginary. I do not understand. If this were a homework assignment, it would be in Creative Writing class. How did Ms. Noonan and the publisher justify this work?"},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Peggy Noonan is one of a number of conservative women who just cannot get over Hillary Clinton (others include the highly intelligent Laura Ingraham and the late Barbara Olson). As a conservative, I happen to believe that their insane obsession cheapens the quality of conservative discourse in our country at a time when real issues need to be debated. Noonan is a fraud. Her mannered and affected way of speaking implies to me a desire to put real distance between her present and her past. She detests the Clintons for their morals, yet she was one of the biggest advocates of state-sponsored, political kidnapping when she insisted that Elian Gonzalez NOT be returned to his father in Cuba. That to me is not only inconsistent but perverse. She would prevent a natural father from having his son because of her politics. What a phony. I wish conservative women would GET OVER IT. Hillary is never going to be president. Move on to important issues."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"The number of writers that would jump on the slander bandwagon is amazing. There is no honest attempt to represent the facts; just to make money. Will Ms. Noonan write about Enron and it's supporters in the administrations."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I would have given this book no stars if it were an option. It's sad that someone so well known is trying to make a name for herself at the expense of another."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"A serious exploration of Hillary's public behavior and bizarre personal life would be welcome, but this isn't it. Noonan clearly has her own ax to grind, as the Clintons have made her beloved &quot;Reagan Revolution&quot; a target in their own propaganda since the 1992 campaign. Moreover, Noonan has zero credibility to write this kind of treatise on Hillary, not just because of her politics, but because of the presumptuous first-person techniques she employs--who's the one with the real &quot;gall&quot; here? Even Kitty Kelly got nailed for indulging in this kind of crap.On a broader note, one wonders just whom this growing cottage industry of anti-Clinton tomes (Regnery et al) is aimed at--certainly not liberals, and most independent voters who I know don't read political books at all. It appears, therefore, that these books are written by and for a community of sycophantic conservatives who only want their own beliefs confirmed and fed back to them--and Noonan, who is every bit the hypocritical figure she believes Hillary to be, seems happy to serve it up. What vapid literary and intellectual lives Noonan and her compadres must lead."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"This book is supposed to appeal to conservatives. You can tell by the title. That's why I thought it would be better, especially having read her first book, \\"What I Saw At the Revolution,\\" her odyssey in the White House as a Reagan speechwriter.Her ominous book dedication to Eleanor Roosevelt notwithstanding, I hungrily opened to the first chapter which began with the discredited (I thought) device of reading the mind of the main character. One expects this in fiction. Here, it created the impression that Noonan had to invent a Hillary, as if the Hillary we already know isn't bad enough.Or do we really know her? She has undergone more cosmetic changes than Michael Jackson. So why should conservatives bother reading this book when we already have a catalogue of her sins in publications like National Review? Because Noonan graces her book with piquant observations, phrases and anecdotes. My favorite: \\"the soul of an East German border guard.\\" Others include \\"Gargoyles have taken over the cathedral,\\" \\"phrases that pop out of her mouth like tarts from the toaster.\\" When someone remarked that a Clinton speech was a triumph of spin, Noonan rebuts, \\"They've forgotten that when someone calls you a liar, they are not praising you.\\"Noonan also has an excellent section regarding the FALN Puerto Rican terrorists, and another exposing the past Hillary pieces in law journals. If these two sections had been distributed in pamphlet form before the senate election, she'd be throwing vases at Bill's head in Little Rock right now instead of New York City or wherever the hell they decide to dig in their heels.Let's hope a sequel will be more EXpose than INspose."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"This book is not so much an account of the misdeeds of Hillary Clinton (of which there are many) but a rambling, disjointed speculation piece about her. The author gives far too little factual material (which I was expecting) and far too much hypothetical fluff. There is no structure for this book. It seemed more of a lamentation than a &quot;case&quot; against anyone."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Peggy Noonan's book is a contradiction of many sorts; starting from the cover, which depicts a poised, actually attractive photo of Hillary Clinton - which is contrasted with her scathing rebuke of a former First Lady that was anything but poised, and very much out of control. I think there may be some symbolism involved in the choice of the Chairman Mao jacket, as it may imply the years of pandering that the Clinton's did with Red China.Her style of writing was concise, and though other reviewers discounted her use of inner dialogue and fictional speeches, I felt that her understanding of Ms. Clinton was such, that at times I actually thought that I was listening to the inner thoughts or Hillary or reading a never-published speech that would have made Hillary an amazing political figure and a noble person.Her insights were very helpful in researching a chapter for my recent book on amazing contemporary propheciesAmerica, You Will Be Destroyed !: Thus Saith The Lord - and Other Amazing Prophecies.Well done, Peggy."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"This is a good but flawed book. It was not meant to be a fair book but rather a polemic. A polemic against a person of bad character in a position of public trust is a service to the public. Noonan grasps the core values of Hillary and displays them clearly for us all to see: It's all about Hillary. It's not about the United States. It's not about the various constituencies whose issues she milks. It's not about honesty. It's just about power for Hillary, a woman whose values are vastly different and inferior to the common man or woman on the street. Even though I share Noonan's disdain, even contempt, for the Clintons I thought that the passage that depicted an imaginary speech by Hillary to the Hollywood powers was disengenuous. There is plenty of perfectly awful evidence at hand with which to indict this malicious woman without recourse to fiction."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I love Peggy Noonan. I had not thought too much about Hillary and her Senate race, except that I was glad that I was not from New York. Then I read this book. Maybe Noonan clarified why I have always resented Hillary at some level. I guess it is because I always have compared myself to her as we are both politically active female attorneys and I have never felt her equal. This book, and Gail Sheehy's, have made me feel better about myself. Peggy emphasizes that Hillary has really accomplished little on her own - there has always been a state-hired babysitter or housekeeper and the prestigious law job may have evolved because of her husband's status. Noonan's comparison of Hillary with her childhood friend from New York was particularly good. Those who are quick to criticize Noonan's obvious bias should read Gail Sheehy's book, &quot;Hillary's Choice.&quot; Most of Sheehy's observations about Hillary, her lust for power, and her belief that she and Bill know what is best for the rest of us are common threads in both books."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"This book is such a great summary of some of the important reasons that Clintonism must stop now. I would hope that even liberals/Democrats could put aside their partisanship and recognize that the Clintons, and others of their ilk, are damaging to our country and our freedoms. Rejecting them does not necessarily mean you have to reject the ideas they supposedly stand for. (But many follow the opinion that many of my Democrat friends expressed during the impeachment - &quot;Yes he's scum, but I can't stand the thought of those Republicans winning!&quot; - and continue to support the Clintons despite the evidence of their lack of integrity and the harm they've done to this country.)I really appreciated the way Noonan clearly portrayed Hillary's elitism, which is, I am convinced, a particular flaw of liberalism - to think that you should decide how everyone should live, rather than giving people the freedom to make what you might consider the &quot;wrong&quot; choice.I loved the Hollywood mogul meeting - that speech was right on target! And unlike some of the critics below, I think it and other similar examples helped to drive her point home. This book was not written to be a comprehensive, scholarly biography, and therefore should not be compared to &quot;Dutch.&quot;Thank you Peggy!"},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I thought this was the most eloquently articulated explanation I've read of why people disagree with the Clintons. Noonan is right to group them together, &quot;two for the price of one&quot;, as it were, however is careful to point out the differences between Bill the consummate politican and Hillary the true believer, the ideologue. For those that continue to support the Clintons and their vision of America, this book should be a troubling polemic that details why so many reasonable people remain opposed to the First Couple, despite the many, many accomplishments they take credit for.I believe at issue for Noonan and those of us that agree with her, whether 100% or somewhere less than that, is the fundamental dishonesty and manipulation that Hillary and her husband have subjected the country to over the past eight years. She is right when she labels it arrogance, and in the various scandals, offensive to the fairness of the American people. One facinating example is the section in which Noonan documents Hillary's use of words to &quot;fog&quot; and obscure, rather than &quot;clarify&quot;, her positions and beliefs. Perhaps even more damning, however, is Noonan's claim that Hillary is no more than a &quot;credentialed rube&quot;, &quot;a mere operator&quot;, and that she is nothing like Eleanor Roosevelt, nor any of the strong women she models herself after. This, in the long run, will be harder for Clinton's followers to accept, given that Hillary ran on her &quot;record&quot;; however I believe that Noonan's book goes a long way to call that record into question, and cautions New Yorkers and Americans in general to take heed. Secondly, Hillary's claim to represent the needs and issues of American women in general is called into question, as Noonan considers Hillary's background, hard-left politics, and writings on society and the family which seem very much detached from the true needs of women in our society. Finally, memorably, Noonan compares Hillary to a classmate from Massapequa, Long Island, ending with the phrase &quot;She is not like you. She was never like you.&quot; That phrase now always comes to mind whenever I turn on the TV and see my new senator-elect smiling robotically, icily."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"You don't have to be a Hillary Clinton fan to know dreck when you read it. David Brock, who wrote his own book on Hillary Clinton (and despite being paid by RW attack dog funders, he used FACTS and stuff Peggy Noonan wouldn't even consider), has summed it up better than I, and probably anyone, can:\\"Much of The Case Against Hillary Clinton is literally made up. Page after page is littered with imaginary dialogue and fantasies that belong in a 50-minute session---a 17-page Hollywood speech that Mrs. Clinton never delivered, a fake interview with Tom Brokaw after she loses the Senate race, a fictional scene in which movie producer Harvey Weinstein disrespectfully lights a cigarette in the First Lady's face, a moment when it dawns on Hillary as she flies into LaGuardia that she looks like the Statue of Liberty, a conversation between James Carville and Harold Ickes at Mrs. Clinton's graveside, even a passage where Noonan channels Eleanor Roosevelt to tell us what she would say about Hillary Clinton: \\"One senses there is something strange there.\\" In the few places where Noonan attempts to deal with real facts and events, her only named source is the fabulist Dick Morris, which leads one to wonder if anything in this book is true.\\"It's better to be entirely illiterate than to have nonsense like this be your reading material. Why review it now after all these years? Because Peggy Noonan refuses to slink away into whatever swamp Lucianne Goldberg has her lair in. Because everyone who is unlucky enough to have to confront her brain-dead op-eds or worse, her blather on TV, should be reminded that in addition to being a fact-free mudslinger, she's also a nut case. Eleanor Roosevelt's was neither the first nor the last of her \\"channelings\\" to see print in the mainstream media."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Beautifully written with intelligence, wit, clarity and charm. A must read for anyone interested in our country."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Short on facts, big on the author's imagined version of events, both past and \\"future\\". The author \\"plays\\" with the reader by presenting scenarios which turn out to be the author's imaginings of how events COULD have played out. Very little in this book is based on fact. I am certainly not a fan of Hilary but this book is simply ridiculous and unfair."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"The truth will make us free. This book should be required reading in every high school government and/or political science class. This book dwells on the obvious facts which people do not seem to experience in other media formats."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I voted for the Clintons, and have thus been disappointed by the past 8 years. I've noticed other reviewers didn't like Ms. Noonan's stylistic choices, and I guess you have to &quot;get it.&quot; These devices not only work very well, but her facts are on target and strongly supported, and her statements convincing. I usually don't read &quot;these kinds&quot; of books (for every book knocking the Clintons, there is another praising them...), but after numerous people recommended it, I bought it. You should buy it too. Not only for Ms. Noonan's sad but dead-on portrayal of Hillary, but also for her beautiful writing. I enjoyed it, despite myself."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"... I thought the Malibu episode (p 74 - 92) was one of the best things about the book. It illustrated what Noonan says in the preface, that HRC's greatest failing is that she could have used her life (and particularly the last 7 years) as a platform to accomplish much good. However, Clinton doesn't want power so she can accomplish great things for humanity (whether you consider her agenda good or bad for humanity), she wants power solely so she can be powerful and idealized. That is the difference between her and Eleanor Roosevelt, who she adores.This book is replete with examples demonstrating that both Clintons are narcissists who's entire lives have been spent in a never-ending quest to satiate their egos and insecurities.The bottom line is that if you hate the Clintons you will love the book and if you love the Clintons you will hate the book. On the other hand, if your opinion of HRC is not yet fully developed you will find a lot of information in the book that will help you make a decision.Finally, don't misunderstand this book to be a hate-filled screed against HRC by a rightwing nut. If anything, Noonan treats her with more pity than she deserves.I enjoy Noonan's columns quite a bit because she is a very talented writer capable of painting a very colorful tapestry (like p. 74 - 92). I would rank this book above &quot;Life, Liberty...&quot; and below &quot;What I Saw At The Revolution&quot; in terms of the quality of her writing, independent of the subject matter. That's why it got a 4 star rating instead of 5."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"After almost 8 years of living through the santimonious pretense of virtue displayed by the Clinton Administration, we finally have a book with the guts to &quot;tell it like it is!&quot; Ms. Noonan has obviously done her homework, and has managed to put Hillary Clinton in clear view for all to see. I applaud Ms. Noonan's courage, and I welcome her astute and intuitive vision of what might come to pass if we allow another Clinton to come into power. Thank you!"},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"This book is not a biographical tract but a personal statement on Hillary Clinton. Way to go Ms. Noonan, you have put to words what I have thought all along!Noonan cuts to the core of her argument with a caustic wit and great flare. Modern liberals and other dupes of the Clintons' truth-spinning vortex will whine that there's &quot;nothing new here&quot; (hmm... there's alot written about gravity but that sure doesn't invalidate the theory... funny no one in the mainstream media gets tired of talk about vast right wing conspiracies...)and the author is yet another &quot;Clinton hater...&quot; but they never seem to get around to making a persuasive argument defending these people other than 'they haven't been proven guilty'. It stirs the passions to know that leadership in the new millenium can now be summed up as &quot;indicted yes... but no convictions!&quot;If you're looking for a dull biography complete with timelines and old family pictures move on but if you've been suspect of the Clintons you'll find this a great read and if you're Clinton fan then I'm sure you'll be able to easily refute the author's arguments (but given the unfavorable reviews that I've read I personally won't hold my breath)."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"There is no &quot;hate&quot; in this book. What there is, is a cool and skillful summation of the activities of Team Clinton, their methodology, their use of friends and sycophants, their willingness to change their &quot;story&quot; until it takes and much, much more. I am sure that Clinton supporters &quot;hate&quot; to see such a well done piece in print and being popularly received. As the sun sets on the administration of Wm. Clinton, Peggy Noonan's summation of it's shortcomings, it's misdeeds and indeed, it's corruption cuts through the talk of legacy and spin and lays the whole sad experience out in the sun like the rotting fish it is. You have no doubt surmised that I am not an admirer of this president or his wife and you may believe that my enthusiasim for this book is motivated by this. What has provoked my enthusiasim is the compelling case that Ms. Noonan makes without insulting our intelligence or torturing the facts. I invite you to read it and be the judge."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Ms.Noonan writes beautifully. Like or dislike the Clintons, it's a good read. My favorite part is the comparison Ms. Noonan uses between Hillary Clinton and a friend Ms. Noonan says is unsure if she will vote for Hillary. It is done so well and really shows the drastic difference between the two. Hillary, using the poitical stump piece that she was just like you, the people of New York, when she was growing up. Not so, a middle-class intellectual raised with privileges that most did not have. She's an Ivy Leaguer. She was given opportunites because her husband was attorney general and governor of Arkansas. She's lived in public housing most of her life. She's never worked a job to pay for college. She never got the kids off to school in the morning then taken a few college courses to earn a degree and then work a part-time job to help her husband pay the mortgage and then get the kids off the bus and make supper and then help them with their homework before she does her own and then puts them to bed. No, Hillary had nannies for her one child. You gotta read the book. Then, you decide if you want to vote Hillary in as a senator and endure more of Clintonism."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"This is a straightforward, no-nonsense book that is the best of it's kind. The writing is dynamite. The techniques used to tell the story and make points are superb. If Mrs. Clinton read this book she could learn an enormous amount about herself and her public. The book is an easy read and goes right to the point of each issue. I've read dozens of books on the Clintons - and this is by far the best. Ms. Noonan doesn't belabor the points nor does she smear Mrs. Clinton. She is honest and forthcoming about her perspective and supports it with hard hitting evidence. The best review I've seen about this enigmatic lady.

Acclaimed by the left-wing press as a feminist, Eleanor Roosevelt clone, Hillary Clinton is a spoon-fed, cruel, parody of Eleanor. Her greatest accomplishment to date is making a deal with Bill Clinton in order to gain power for herself. Instead of actually helping the poor, she makes speeches about the poor. She plows over those in her path and all those whom she believes will be in her path. Peggy Noonan lays all the facts about Hillary Rodham Clinton in a personal and clear style which will leave the reader with no doubts about Hillary's character and the vast deception Bill and Hillary Clinton have performed on the American public."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"It isn't often we get to read truth about a most controversial political figure, Hillary Rodham Clinton.

This is a must-have for all those following the Clinton saga."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"How can anybody like Peggy Noonan formally writing for Reagan and Bush, have the guts to write a book about a person she donsen't know and don't like.

Instead it is a hatchet job just like that Olsen book. What a hack."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Ms. Noonan's random, pretentious musings on the First Lady read like Sean Hanity with a thesaurus. What you get by the end of this book is a facile collection of built-up resentments and petty gripes. It's too bad Noonan takes the Clinton's so personally. It's not their fault Peggy, it's yours."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"This is the easiest review I've ever written. If you hate the Clintons, you'll love this book and you'll give it 5 stars out of 5. If you don't hate the Clintons, or if at least you don't hate Hillary Clinton, you'll probably find this book to be a joke.The biggest joke of all is that Peggy Noonan spent way too many years writing speeches for Ronald Reagan and doing her level best to make him look good. So would she be writing about Hillary Clinton other than diatribe?She denigrates both Clintons by whining about all the damage they've done to the country. What I remember is that at the end of 8 years of Reagan and 4 years of Bush (Sr.), we were in the middle of the recession and times were pretty grim. And after nearly 8 years of the Clinton administration, the economy couldn't be better, Gore hasn't philandered, yet Bush (Jr.) seems to be doing better in the polls. But never mind all that. The Clintons are just the worst imaginable people and Hillary's just as guilty of whatever as Bill. (And if we're not exactly sure what she did that was wrong, we can always appoint an co-dependent persecutor to find out, because, well, she must have done something!)I suspect the real intent of this book isn't so much to keep Hillary from becoming a senator but to boost the right-wing, fundamentalist and redneck vote for &quot;Anyone But Al Gore,&quot; which candidate happens to be . . . . well, you figure it out.I find that Peggy Noonan is about as ingenuous in her little attempt at right-wing boosterism as, well, Linda Tripp was in her maternalistic love for Monica Lewinsky."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Peggy Noonan hasn't ever recovered from her prediction that Bill Clinton would lose in 1996. The resentments that have clearly built up in her since then have resulted in this condescending, unbalanced, unintentionally-hilarious and ineptly-written diatribe against his wife. However, it could serve as the basis for a satiric monologue about a bitter and irrelevant woman jealous of another woman's success."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"This book is amazing in only one respect--does Peggy Noonan think we don't know her for her right wing agenda already? She clearly is jealous of our First Lady and tries to make her appear wrong or bad in every instance. This simply is counter- intuitive to anyone with an iota of intelligence. However, the hatemongers and vitriolic sorts will love this and buy it up!

It is well written, easy to get through and thoughtful. It would have made a more powerful impact, nonetheless, if she had woven in more facts from the vast body of information about the Clintons. Her improvised sidebar in chapter five was a wonderful flight of fantasy. Importantly, in the end, the book makes its point very well."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Ms. Noonan's book about Hilary Clinton was very disappointing. I looked forward to reading it and by the end of the first chapter, I realized that fantasy scenarios prevaled. The author would state an event in the past and then project that into an imagined event in the future. Because of Mrs. Clinton's actions in the past, she will a certain way in the future. For instance, in an elaborate way, the author goes into great detail when she tells of Hilary's response to her election in November of 2000. As a result, the book left me very disappointed. Since Ms. Noonan had personal experience with Hilary, I was hoping that she would narrate these experiences only. Fantasy had no place in her book."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I like the premise of this book. There is indeed a strong case to be made against Hillary Clinton and at times, Noonan makes it well. Unfortunately, Noonan too often tries to get into Hillary's head and launches into extended imaginary conversations Hillary has with herself. Noonan also creates other imaginary scenarios which detract from the book. These scenarios border on the surreal and guessing what Hillary may be thinking does not make the case against her. Noonan is at her best when she sticks to the facts and analyzes Hillary's record such as Hillary's alleged commitment to children. The book is still worth reading but I do not give it more than a moderate recommendation."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Some Liberals have attempted to smear Peggy Noonan as a &quot;Clinton hater&quot; hinting that she is unable to write an objective and honest book concerning Hillary Clinton. On the contrary, the Republican speech writer may very well have understated the situation. This work was released before the election and Noonan hoped that Mrs. Clinton would fail in her quest for the U.S. Senate seat from New York. Noonan describes HRC as a woman who enjoys wealth and power. The need is so great that she has endured betrayal and humiliation by her husband that would have ended most marriages years ago. Did they ever love each other? Has the Clinton relationship always been primarily about the acquisition of power? Noonan cites an incident where an exhausted Bill and Hillary perk up immediately when alerted that an adoring crowd awaits them. The Presidential couple seem to truly enjoy adulation similar to a drug addict enjoying his latest high.&quot;Mrs. Roosevelt did not think,&quot; adds Ms. Noonan &quot;as they say, that it was all about her.&quot; She distinguishes between the committed self sacrificing Liberalism of Eleanor Roosevelt, and the self indulgent actions of HRC. Noonan perceives the now Senator Clinton as someone totally absorbed in seeking power for its own sake. The question whether Hillary has any substantially well though out positions is indeed legitimate. Mrs. Clinton never engages in vigorous public give and take discussions. Noonan also contrasts the Clinton White House staffers with those of recent Democrat and Republican administrations. The former come across as childishly immature while the latter engaged in dedicated seriousness. The Jimmy Carter Democrat Presidential era, for instance, was always strait laced and adult. She argues the Clintons surround themselves with ruthless and amoral followers who virtually will stop at nothing to do the bidding of their masters. Even the outrageous behavior of Nixon's top Watergate people pale in comparison.Peggy Noonan even devotes a few pages to the questionable pardons granted by President Clinton to the FALN Puerto Rican terrorists. Many speculated that this was done to increase his wife's election chances in New York. Was Noonan peering into a crystal ball? The very recent uproar over &quot;pardongate&quot; has greatly vindicated her conclusions regarding this dysfunctional political family.Hillary Clinton will now have power for the next six years. Have individuals such as Noonan blinded themselves to Senator Clinton's virtues and talents? Are they prematurely writing her political obituary? Peggy Noonan is so far winning her case against Hillary Clinton. The current New York Senator, though, has a splendid opportunity to prove her wrong. However, my bets are on Noonan. Leopards rarely change their spots."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I read this book looking for some new information but all I found was foolish prattle. The book reveals more about Ms. Noonan than it does about Mrs. Clinton."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"This bit of vitriolic character assassination gives readers an interesting perspective into a former Republican speechwriter (one hears that Noonan is a writer of achievement): she hasn't the discipline to do her homework or provide even a vague semblance of balance. This is like reading David Duke's considered opinion of Jesse Jackson."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"While the auther does go on about the misdeeds of Hillary and the Clintons a bit, there is a lot to cover. I believe the book, and some others that I've read builds the case for a new source of facism in American society. The sense of the author that power is the end game and that in their (Clinton's) minds they can justify anything, is very pervasive.The author goes on to show that the Clinton's polarized the races, making your color omni-important over your individual abilities. Promising you more if you just keep voting the Clinto machine more power. It touches on the suppression of dissent, and the actions taken against &quot;all enemies&quot; of their state. That is facism pure and simple."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I must say that the woman-woman bashing and back stabbing that goes on is more ferocious than any that goes on between men. Be warned-Noonan holds no bars. However, when she goes to make a case against Hillary I find that her \\"facts\\" are just not supported. I'd love to see a well-researched attack on Hillary because I think find her a conservative \\"Republicrat\\" who doesn't stand for liberalism like she should. But to label her a raging liberal? (As a liberal, I'm insulted!) Ms. Noonan should stick to writing worshipful \\"books\\" on the Gipper. They're not good, by any means, but at least that way her ... is benign."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"As usual everything about the clintons is out for themselves. The press hides everything about these people! The only way these people can get ahead is to be CROOKED!"},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"There is nothing quite so delicious as two smart women in a personal catfight, clawing and scratching at each other with a pure vicious spite that frightens any male who thinks they might be serious.Peggy Noonan is one of those very smart women, a gifted speechwriter who was able to make Ronald Reagan act and sound presidential on occasion. When anyone considers the number of B-movies where Reagan was himself, and the height of his career in 'Bedtime for Bonzo' where he was only upstaged by a monkey, it produces a genuine sadness that Noonan didn't use her talents in Hollywood instead of politics.It's what makes this book an absolute delight some six years after it was published on April Fool's Day. America was then at peace, with a budget surplus and respect throughout the world -- as Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter are still widely respected throughout the world. Noonan may well be the most articulate example of how the politics of hate produces pure incompetence in the White House -- as deftly detailed by President George H. W. Bush's former Treasury official Bruce Bartlett in his 2006 book \\"Imposter\\".One of Noonan's favourite targets is the 'President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform', chaired by Hillary. President Bill Clinton said, \\"the American people will learn, as the people of Arkansas did, just what a great First Lady they have\\". Noonan savages it, blasting the secrecy by bureaucrats who shut out the private sector. In the end, about $15 million was spent before \\"Hillarycare\\" was dropped.Okay.In the current administration, meetings of oil company officials to develop a national energy policy were secret and have remained secret. Plans for the War on Iraq were done in secret, based on fantasies, fictions and foolishness. The drug program for seniors is total confusion, if not quite outright fraud. Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and the last tatters of White House competence. Federal domestic spending has gone up 8 percent per year since 2001, a rate of increase not seen since Lyndon Baines Johnson. Instead of compassionate conservative, Bush is a con-man conservative.It raises the question: Is America better off with an administration that drops a controversial program if it becomes untenable? Or is it better off with an administration that listens to no one and plunges almost alone into quagmires such as the War in Iraq. Hillary's \\"folly\\" cost America about $15 million. Bush's \\"folly\\" has cost about $260 billion so far, plus $2 billion a month, plus almost 2,300 dead US military personnel.Is America better off with a president who listens? Or one who doesn't?This is what makes Noonan's book so worthwhile; it's a wonderful example of the politics of hate, spite, claws and calumny in action. In six years, Hillary has proven herself in the Senate and is now a leading contender for the presidency in 2008. In the same time, despite her vast talents, Noonan has accomplished little of constructive merit or note.It brings me back to me opening observation, \\"There is nothing quite so delicious as two smart women in a personal catfight, clawing and scratching.\\" Such vituperation is often based on jealousy of another's blatant superiority, instead of on any issues.Noonan's talent is elegant, which makes this book delicious. It's timely, because of speculation Hillary may seek the presidency. It's relevant, because it's a perfect example of the \\"politics of hate\\" that cripples America. It's poignant, because America is on a slippery slope to insipid irrelevance unless it returns to the politics of optimism and hope so beautifully written in Noonan's speeches for Reagan in the 1980s."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Tim Russert's interview with Ms. Noonan about her book and the book itself only confirmed my belief that the right has strayed very far afield indeed. The right's position has always been that if we, the American people, only new the Clinton's the way they do we would hate them as well. Well, after years of misinformation, so-called scandals and this latest foray into psychobabble, the Clinton's still rate very highly in the polls, much higher than Bush or Reagan. This drives the right and, apparently, Ms. Noonan nuts. Ms Noonan's thrashing around, hands in the air, psychoanalyzing Hilary and attempting to explain why the Clinton's simply must be bad people was amusing and revealing. Never has Hilary demonstrated the degree of condescension and conceit as has Ms. Noonan in both the spoken and written word."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Let me first state that I am no fan of the Clintons, Bill or Hillary. I believe that he is both a liar and predator and that she is his chief enabler. Therefore, books (and articles) that are negative about either of them attract me.However, although I found Peggy Noonan's book very interesting (and quite clever in a few spots), I also thought that it defined for me the term &quot;screed&quot;. It may be well researched but it is not well written. It has all the appearance of having been hastily dashed off to get to market in a hurry."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Instead of building a case against the First Lady in \\"The Case Against Hillary Clinton,\\" Noonan provides a stale rehashing of well-known information. The author make general claims about Mrs. Clinton, such as \\"[h]er boots are made for walking, and they'll walk all over you,\\" without providing specifics about Mrs. Clinton's merits. Noonan fails to convince the reader that she knows more about Hillary Clinton than Americans who follow the evening news. While there is much to criticize about the Clintons, Noonan does a shoddy job in terms of providing useful information for thoughtful readers.Another point of frustration for thoughtful readers who might venture to read \\"The Case\\" is what passes for \\"evidence\\" in this book. One notable example is Noonan's claim that the Clinton's both suffer from clinical narcissism. Using information supplied by an former friend of the Clintons who cites a medical text, Noonan writes \\". . . this clinical description, coming from a thoughtful associated of many years, seemed both believable and somewhat chilling.\\" Noonan's assessment, based on information from a layperson on the subject of mental health, is representative of what passes as \\"fact\\" in \\"The Case Against Hillary Clinton.&quot;Several thoughtful books critical of Hillary Clinton have come out in the past year, and Noonan frequently pulls information from these texts. This \\"borrowing,\\" dedicating an entire chapter to a hypothetical scenario of Mrs. Clinton \\"being truly serious, truly earnest. . .\\", and the absence of \\"new\\" information suggests that the research for \\"The Case\\" was minimal. This book is not Noonan's best, and is not a suggested read. If this book were a college essay, it would fail for its lack of focus, failing to substantiate claims with even the most minimal evidence, and a stark absence of commas in appropriate places. Voters in New York would be better served by following the news and drawing their own conclusions about Hillary Clinton's merits."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"This seems like the rave rantings of a person obsessed with the subject of 'Clintonism'. I am not saying that Mrs. Clinton is the most ideal visionary or best suited leader for this nation. But Peggy Noonan, given her career, should be well aware that this is the dirty business of politics where people are motivated by power rather than the idealistic sentiments that she seems to constantly refer to. Peggy Noonan has a wonderful story to tell, although it lacks any credibility since a lot of it is her own figment of her vivid imagination. May be if she had stuck to facts and been objective instead of trying to color it with her own impression of what Mrs. Clinton's thought process, there would have been more believers of her 'left wing conspiracy theory'. The 'Case against Hillary Clinton' has some valid points, but it is my 'judgemnent' that the authoress is overly prejudicial, completely partisan (against Hillary, of course) in her analysis and is at times, a little delusional."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"The only thing THIS BOOK helped me decide is that Peggy Noonan is a very POOR writer and that she obviously has a jealous RAGE in regard to Hillary Clinton. Too bad she didn't use many FACTS but turned it into a strange diatribe about Hillary's clothing, gestures, and even went so far as to project 'WHAT SHE WAS THINKING' at key moments. If I were Hillary I'd get an order of protection to keep this nut at bay. I'll look elsewhere for a FACTUAL book written by a stable individual to help me make my mind up on Hillary.

This is after all a dyed-in-the-wool Reaganaut who specializes in hagiography of her idol, having written two worshipful books about the Reagan administration. She even went so far as to entitle one \\"When Character was King,\\" apparently unaware that her hero was reportedly having an affair with Christine Larson, a starlet, at the same time Nancy was giving birth. This is character?The major failing of this book is that it is all rant and few facts. What really seems to gall Noonan is Hillary's sense of entitlement, allegedly deriving from a secure life of privilege.To her credit, she doesn't repeat some of the more outrageous charges bruited about by the right wing against the Clintons (murder, drug-smuggling and the like). But most of the other charges are recycled here, frequently with imaginary conversations that are supposed to be persuasive.If readers want to know what really happened they will need facts, not fictional conversations that Noonan ginned up to discredit Hillary. The best documented case is presented by Joe Conason and Gene Lyons in The Hunting of the President. A primary source for that book is David Brock's Blinded by the Right.

As one reads portions of this book or watches her present herself on the Judith Regan show (as she did recently), one is just struck with how deeply this woman truly does hate the subject of her book. In spite of what she may say, her words speak loud and clear, not on the subject of Hillary Clinton, but on... Peggy Noonan. It's my hope that this book goes largely unread. Reading it feels in some ways like how it feels to read neoNazi propaganda: the reader is given a glimpse into how dark and irrational the human heart can become when it chooses to hate something or someone. The reader is left depressed and anxious -- and nervous that others may be actually taken in by someone so clearly full of hatred."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"As a recent review of this book by Sean Elder points out, the book appears to be the required homework assignment of the GOP loyalty squad.

But how does it do this? On a slew of opinion articles written by mostly other GOP operatives.Ms. Noonan destroyed her credibility when she wrote President Reagan's contra speech. In it, you might recall, she referred to the contras as &quot;freedom fighters...like our founding fathers.&quot; Well, we have since found the contras to be more like our founding Godfathers. This book does nothing to restore her credibility."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"While Peggy Noonan does a good job of telling us what the Clinton's are up to and how awful Hillary is, she goes off into a couple of raves that make about as much sense as voting for a Clinton.

When she appears on the talk shows she purrs out nicknames to wilting male talk show hosts and flips her yellow mane and coos her venom. This she has done in this short work of fiction. She writes pages of bogus dialogue only to tell you at the end of the long fabricated section that this is not what Hillary said, but SHE SHOULD HAVE, as far as Ms. Noonon is concerned. She is outraged because Hillary does not act, say, do as Ms. Noonan thinks she should. Why doesn't Hillary just stand up and tell us truthfully how evil she and Bill really are? Well, Peggy, because they don't believe it is so as you do and if they did, it would ruin their persons and plans.

But I liked the author interview and so am buying it.Until amazon puts some kind of Proof of Purchase requirement on the ability to review a book, I'll give all the books I am buying five stars so as to average out at least one of the liars.Review to follow."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Amazon has not put up my first review of this (hmmm...a little early to shout conspiracy theories, but considering the other reviews on this page I am curious why), so let's try it again.This slim book is well written. I do not argue with the quality of the writing itself. Indeed, it raises several disturbing points about HRC, which have been reiterated through any number of currently posted reviews. But I think it is important to keep in mind two things.First, as Noonan herself has pointed out, this book is a polemic. That is, it is not intended to be a balanced, objective work (and all you poststructuralists out there can object all you like to the word &quot;objective&quot;), but rather a work with a single point of view intended to prove a single point: ooh, isn't that HRC a bad woman? However, the problem with a polemic is that it is, in essence, preaching to the choir. Noonan raises some interesting points, but nothing that we haven't--including a number of investigative committees--heard ad nauseum. Instead, we are treated to imaginary conversations that she &quot;dreamed&quot; up (and how pathetic a rhetorical device is that may I ask? or perhaps we should ask &quot;Dutch&quot; and see what he thinks), plus a pop psychology point of view attributing thoughts and emotions and motivations to HRC with no facts to back them up.Second, and I find it very interesting that no one has brought this up in the context of this book being a polemic, Noonan is a very well compensated POLITICAL SPEECHWRITER for the Republican Party. Did anyone expect this to be anything more than a character assasination written to convince knee-jerk conservatives who hate everything that both Clintons represent that they are right? Really, how tiresome. Couldn't this have been condensed into some article for a rightwing magazine? Ah, but how many people would buy it then, huh?As a New York City resident, I am not thrilled with either HRC OR RG as a candidate. But nothing in this wafer thin book--both in terms of pages or in argumentative weight--is either surprising or compelling. I have nothing but disdain for most politicians. Neither is likely to get me to care enough to vote. And yes, that is sad. But many, many Americans apparently feel the same: just check the actual percentages of people who vote. That may be due more to both Republicans and Democrats who desperately need to be &quot;right&quot; rather than do what is best."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I read this book hoping to learn more about the First Lady from someone with a critical eye. I learned nothing about Hillary Clinton reading this book. I learned a great deal about Peggy Noonan and it is not a pretty picture. Miss Noonan seems to have total contempt for democracy. She simply cannot accept the fact that her president was defeated by We the People. She has never gotten over it. The book is full of innuendo half truths and rumors lifted form Rupert Murdoch's New York Post. Miss Noonan wants us to accept lies from less than credible sources as fact. Ironically after reading this book I have more respect for Mrs Clinton. She is lucky in her enemies."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Once again, the opponents of the Clinton's purport to save America from an allegedly unparralled evil, only to come up incredibly short.Judging by the lack of research and quality writing in this book, one would have never guessed that the author is a regular commentator for Time magazine. I am unfortunately familar with her work, but this type of journalism seems better suited for high school or junior high.In fact, a suprsing amount of bile stems from Noonan's dislike of Hillary's fashion sense and her constitutional right to run for office (I am happy that she won)Really, most educated people realize these are rather childish reasons to declare somebody a threat to the nation's best interests, and I strongly suspect Noonan knows this too.Her ultimate attempt of course is to appeal to the angry and ignorant who cannot pinpoint why they dislike Hillary so much. Instead of at least attempting to explain policy differences, she knows it is easier to get people whipped up over the new political woman."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"What a surprise! Noonan has written exactly what you would expect her to write. If you are a conservative, this book will fuel your anger over the Clintons. If you are a liberal, it will confirm your fears of the &quot;vast, right-wing conspiracy.&quot; As a former White House speechwriter, Noonan never strays far from the script; instead she takes all the predictable shots and establishes nothing new. One hungers for the relatively balanced Hillary bio by David Brock."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Predictable Clinton bashing by a right-wing patriarchal woman. She wants the Clintons to fade into the sunset and play golf like Ford, or go to Japan and sell themselves for $2,000,000.00 like Nancy and Ronnie Reagan...

But good writing does not validate her case against Mrs. Clinton. On the contrary, this book is quite transparent in regards to the political agenda Mrs. Noonan is attempting to further. Mrs. Noonan miserably fails to provide the reader with an accurate account of Mrs. Clinton abilities and achievements in the public arena. This book is full of hate and driven by paranoia about an uncertain future."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"First, love her or hate her, Hillary Clinton is a fascinating woman, and Noonan's main problems are that, rather than presenting an in-depth study of a lawyer, governor's wife, activist, president's wife and candidate, Noonan has to fill 180 pages with projection and fiction. Second, she writes for the people who fantasize that the Clintons have &quot;ruined&quot; our country, and who are are content not only to live in a dream world, but to project it onto others, some of whom are apparently incapable of anything but reflexive hate for anyone who doesn't buy the conservative good, liberal/centrist bad motto. So, I encourage those people to waste their cash and buy it. Use your new tax refund.Aside from that, the HRC that Noonan writes about is so one dimensional as to be pointless. Perhaps Noonan should go back to writing romance or westerns.Noonan has been so thoroughly discredited by her gushing love for Reagan, who really was a criminal, that her criticism of the Clintons is laughable. Overall, so is the author herself."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Can a First Lady who has the temerity to not have an astrologer really replace Al D'Amato? Probably not, according to a former Reagan speechwriter. That is the latest theme of the new rash of anti-Hillary screeds to we are being besieged with.Noonan breaks no new ground here. We are left with picture of Hillary as a chronic underachiever who can do nothing right. However, if Hilary is elected she will singal-handedly take the entire country down the path of world socialism. (Easy work for underachievers).You would think that Clinton critics would haved learned one thing in the last eight years. Mainly that the Clintons thrive on the excesses of their enemies. While the Silly Billy Bennetts and Peggy Noonans rant on, Bill and Hillary keep right on winning elections. If Hillary wins or loses this fall it will not be because of this book.

I wanted more facts to back up my feelings for Hillary, but instead Peggy Noonan's book is filled with speculation about what Hillary and others are thinking at any given moment or situation. It is stricktly a good guess to put into dialoge what is going on in someone else head! And the chapter that was \\"a dream\\" clinched it for me! Unexcuseable! I'll keep searching for the info I need."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Okay I don't like Hillary but this Noonan woman is bonkers. She actually writes thoughts in Hillary's head. Uh, pardon me? And she complains that Hillary could have done good things and instantly suggest some liberal cause as if it would be a \\"good thing\\". Heck that's just the kind of stuff I didn't want her doing! If Noonan thinks she is a Republican I suggest somebody better explain to her that means more than thinking Ronald Reagan is a nice guy. There are actual ideas involved.I gave up after a hundred pages but my wife stuck through to the end.I still remember when she finished the book, turned to me and said, \\"this woman's an idiot\\". And we're life long Republicans. 'Nuff said."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Personally, I think the former first lady represents a dangerous combination of boundless ambition, cynical opportunism, a strong intellect, and Eva Peron-like self-deification. Ms. Noonan's book, however, written in the heat of Ms. Clinton's Senatorial campaign, reads like a hurried first draft dictated into a cassette recorder between media appearances. Noonan replicates the worst trait of the &quot;new journalism&quot; by mixing pure speculation about what might have gone on inside of her subject's mind with &quot;hypothetical&quot; (read &quot;made up&quot;) quotations, amidst some factual material. The &quot;current events&quot; category often yields breathless story telling, and this book has little lasting value beyond the heat of the moment. Worse, in those areas where we might fairly expect some new, insider knowledge about key scandals (the health care debacle, for example), Noonan tells us much less than we learned in the reportage of the times. While she shines brightly as a speechwriter, Ms. Noonan does not meet even minimum standards as a journalist."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I was hoping to read an informative, yet entertaining study on the history and impact of Hillary Clinton, whom I'm no fan of. But the author constantly digresses into a pendantic rage. And ruminations follow one after another on Hillary's powers and why they should be stopped. Yet she fails to make a case for why one should support or not support her views on Clinton. The final 200+ pages take the reader through a thoroughly boring, month by month overview of Hillary's duties as First Lady. By the final chapters I could barely keep awake."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I have read other works by Peggy Noonan and found interesting and insightful elements in them. This book does not meet her previous standards. Noonan presents a case with virtually no evidence. She claims that the Clintons are motivated only by ambition, yet, even though the political risks were crystal clear with anyone with a smidgen of historical understanding, they tried to create a system where millions more Americans would have access to health care. Whether or not you like the plan they put forth, it was clearly politically risky, and was brought down by a 100 million dollar campaign by health insurance companies and by a Republican leadership which killed it to improve their electoral prospects (see Haynes Johnson and David Broder's excellent book on the health care policy debate, &quot;The System&quot;). Noonan continues to cry &quot;scandal,&quot; even when nearly every one of the purported scandals has proved to lack evidence. It is rather a stretch to blame Mrs. Clinton for the Monica scandal, and Mrs. Clinton (see &quot;The Hunting of the President&quot;) was largely right about the effort to destroy the Clinton presidency. Noonan also charges that Mrs. Clinton is an awful person because she did not pursue significant &quot;missed opportunities.&quot; However, it becomes clear that these constitute taking policy steps with which Mrs. Clinton disagrees. Only if Mrs. Clinton pursued Republican policies would her efforts seem sincere and unburdened by personal ambition. While this book injures Noonan's reputation among fair-minded persons, it will clearly make her a great deal of money in book sales and speaking engagements."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Ms. Noonan begins very well by achieving a gently scathing tone with conclusions which are inarguable. However, the best way to combat a textbook narcissist like Hillary is not to engage in a sort of generational narcissism by pointing out the ways in which the elite Ms. Hillary is unlike Noonan's teacher friend from Massapequa, NY (someone who is not scolded for being a Clinton supporter, and whose stance on impeachment is not disclosed). I didn't vote for George Bush, Sr. because he was like me; neither Reagan, nor Kennedy, nor FDR can credibly be claimed to represent &quot;the people&quot; in the bogus manner of Perot-populism. This, it strikes me, is essentially an unfair criticism of Hillary, and I say this as a self-described Clinton-hater. It's her corruption and her radical ideas that I object to. I am also dubious of the invented speeches that Ms. Noonan says Hillary could give; even if you agree with their content (warmed-over Dan Quayle/Joe Lieberman Nanny-state conservatism, designed to curry favor with the Weekly Standard editorial board), were Hillary to give a speech attacking Hollywood, she woudln't be Hillary, and she probably wouldn't be a Democrat, either. Would you vote for a senate candidate who could recite the plot lines of a dozen shows, ranging from &quot;Just Shoot Me&quot; to &quot;Felicity?&quot; Personally, I'd worry about that candidate, and that's regardless of party. Furthermore, Ms. Noonan betrays a level of ignorance and perhaps dishonesty by referencing the famously un-aired &quot;Manchester Prep&quot; as a show which Hillary is supposed to have watched in this imaginary diatribe. Do we really want to re-live Dan Quayle vs. Murphy Brown, or are there more pressing issues out there, like Mrs. Clinton's serial lying? If Noonan had a better editor than Judith Regan (who recently interviewed her on the Fox News Channel without disclosing their relationship), then this would have been a much better book. As it stands, it has a great opening 30 pages or so, and a great final chapter, both of which read like above-average magazine pieces. It's dismaying that this extremely gifted writer didn't receive any constructive criticism before going to press."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I couldn't put it down. This book is the book to read about the Clintions and their Scandals. This book explains the &quot;weird psychic energy&quot; which empowers the Clintons and explains their behavior."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I'm all for attacking the Clintons, and I frankly expected this book to be a vicious partisan hatchet job when I picked it up. What I didn't expect was that it would be completely without merit and utterly pointless. Noonan is not concerned with the ideology that Mrs. Clinton espouses nor with what she has actually done. She simply uses the book to promote her own absurd beliefs (i.e. TV causes violence and dirty sex) and to assign Mrs. Clinton an agenda and a set of bad actions based on nothing more than her imagination. From the very beginning Noonan uses imagined events (like Mrs. Clinton's victory speech in the first chapter) and projects thoughts into The First Lady's head, much like a fiction writer would. Frankly, that is all this book is, a poorly written work of fiction. Frankly no fiction writer worth a damn would end a chapter with the phrase \`and then I woke up'; it would be insulting to the reader, an unacceptable, distracting and pointless device. In a nonfiction book it is completely inexcusable. I suppose that the most devoted enemies of the Clintons might enjoy this groundless attack on The First Lady, but any normal person, even those who despise the Clintons as I do, will be insulted. Indeed, the idea of Noonan, herself the author of the most famous political lie of our time (George Bush's \`No new taxes' pledge) would attack anyone's integrity is absurd on its face. The worst thing about this book is that it might be mistaken by some as a serious book on the subject, rather than the flight of fancy that it is."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I found this book fascinating! Noonan gives facts to back up opinions. Very well written! A must read for the next few years before 2008 when the Clintons must be stopped from infiltrating America."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I picked up this book (actually audio cassette) to learn more about Hillary and, perhaps, confirm my suspicions that Hillary is not exactly the most honest of people. I enjoyed the book but was not overly impressed with Peggy Noonan's style of writing. I enjoyed the stories about Hillary's manipulating others and the &quot;case&quot; Noonan builds to support her premise that Hillary is a self-serving, lying, career politician. In support of these great stories she goes on and on about how disgusted she is with Hillary and why the New York voters should consider before they vote. Not being a Hillary supporter myself, I don't mind a a small amount of preaching but cut out the preaching and the book is about 80 pages long. I prefer Noonan's and others' personal experiences and anecdotes with the Clintons. Oh this book does, by the way, confirm my suspicions."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"read the title, buy the book."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"\\"Misrepresenting\\" the truth, abuse of power, unprincipled, shameless, self-aggrandizement, cynicism, conceit, obfuscation, spin, entitlement and character assassination, all characterize the \\"two for the price of one'' Clintons in Peggy Noonan's account of the Clinton's scandal plagued political careers. While Noonan's writing style (somewhat akin to a meandering stream of consciousness) is, at times, disconcerting, the book's substance is compelling and frightening in that Hillary Clinton's campaigning strengths will undoubtedly continue to keep her dedicated and uncritical core supporters in the dark. The keys, of course, are twofold: whether (1) the liberal media will have enough sense of country over political persuasion to deny her support and (2) \\"swing\\" voters will have enough common sense to see the real Hillary Clinton. I'm more optimistic about the latter than the former.Hugh Kemper"},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Hillary is truly one of the great socialist women of the 20th century.

But I found little to enjoy. As I read the first part of the book, I kept hoping I might find something new, something of substance.... Finally, I came to a chapter which jarred me awake--grabbed my total attention. I read and devoured page after page--in fact, this section went on for most of a chapter. At the end, author Noonan tells us that it was all a dream she had. That did it for me--bad enough that I'm wasting my time reading about fictional dream sequences, but when that sequence is also the best part of the book, I knew it was time to quit.Get &quot;Hell To Pay&quot;, by Olson; much better."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Though Peggy Noonan attempts to make a case against Hillary Clinton, all this book accomplishes is a case against Peggy Noonan. Ms. Noonan shows herself to be a bitter woman with a modicum of writing talent. The Case Against Hillary Clinton doesn't even rise to the level of mere propoganda...it's nothing more than slander from a woman who is clearly jealous of Hillary Clinton's eloquence and success."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"The most notable thing about this book is that it is a mix of fantasy (hallucinations?) and very shallow looks at stories that are already widely known. The story of the health care task force is related here but only in vague terms as in a student doing a current events assignment for class.However, the intro is a doozy as it is all fantasy. This could be considered a (lame) device to get the reader's attention if it wasn't for Chapter Five. This is made up as well although the author drags you through pages of made up quotes from Hillary before confessing at the end.

Very little of the information that Ms. Noonan based this story on came from actual conversations or insider info that she received but rather through other publications by other authors and tended to read like a &quot;friend of a friend told me tale.&quot; If you are interested in reading about Ms. Noonan's opinions on everything from raising children to battling the Hollywood machine as well as her hearing her political views then you will enjoy this but if you are looking for any insightful information on Hillary Clinton it cannot be found here."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Another stream of poison adding to the vast river of irrational hatred against the Clintons. Short on facts, long on make-believe &quot;dialogue&quot; and &quot;real motivation&quot; written exclusively to cash in on the lucrative anti-Clinton industry, by a petty woman who has given up any credibility she may have once had as an intelligent commentator on the political scene.

She focuses on character, but also considers vision, competance, and ideology. She contrasts the spin with the reality, and asks the basic question: For whose benefit is Mrs. Clinton serving? The nation's? The disadvantaged? Her husbands? Or, her own?"},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Ms. Noonan has crafted a somewhat self-indulgent but also wonderfully pithy little tome here. Naturally, to write a strictly fact-based rendering of Ms. Clinton's bizarre &quot;career&quot; would require many more pages. Ms. Noonan's goal appears to be to set forth certain &quot;givens&quot; about Ms. Clinton (and by extension, her loathesome husband), and then speculate about both the inner life of these people and ruminate about the broader implications of their involvement in American society. It's quite an interesting read because there is really no longer any doubt concerning the Clinton's numerous scandals (petty firings in the White House Travel Office, Mr. Clinton's misogynistic and satyristic tendencies and Ms. Clinton's desperate dissembling and enabling of his pathetic behavior - over a course of decades, Ms. Clinton's involvement with Craig Livingstone who acquired raw FBI files on the Clintons' political enemies, improper &quot;task forces&quot; meeting in secret to craft Ms. Clinton's byzantine prescription for socialized medicine, etc., etc.) No one can honestly deny that we have a couple of pretty &quot;colorful&quot; characters now occupying the White House. But what Ms. Noonan does so well is expose, through frank discussion of the scandals, the kind of person Ms. Clinton truly must be and, also, reveal the kind of society that (sadly) we have become. In a prior era no American electorate (at any level - local, state, or national) would even consider a man like Clinton worthy of public office - even less so his untested wife. Ms. Noonan offers a &quot;quaint&quot; perspective from a bygone time - a time when truth mattered, character triumphed over celebrity, and morality wasn't politically incorrect. As America enters its twilight, that perspective is now rarely heard."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I am glad that this book is in the library and I did not pay for it. I do not care if a person hates or loves the First Lady. But I do care when facts and arguements are not hand in hand. If lies are such a big concern for her, where are the books to condemn Reagan and Bush? This book seems to be nothing more then bitterness in writing. Where are the facts to back up statements. I believe in being fair. I think the Clintons have made some mistakes. But they are small compared to the past two Presidents. They did not start a war to remove a drug lord that was supported strongly by the last two predidents. They did not sell illegal arms to hostile nations. Let us get a perspective. Hillary may not be a warm caring person but she is smart."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"This is a wonderful book for a lot of reason, but one is the breathtaking courage it took to really take on the Clintons, and say what a lot of us say in privacy and with our friends but rarely in public. It says it all. It is an indictment. And it gets to why a lot of people don't want to continue this president and first lady. Great read."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"I read this book in one sitting and passed it on to someone on an airplane, someone who was both amazed and relieved to find himself sitting next to someone who doesn't buy into the myth of Hillary's ability, but also doesn't appear to have any of the markings of a fascist right winger.I am a conservative and became one, after having been a liberal, in the pursuit of protecting patriotism. Ms. Noonan, throughout her book, expresses her own love of country and makes it more than clear that she had hoped that this dynamic couple would be fodder for her inspiration, rather than her disgust. The fact that the Clintons let her down, let down all of America, is not something that she paints broadly. She substantiates her points and a few times indulges in speculation, the denigration of which amazed me as those who defend the Clintons do so with the most outrageously extensive suspensions of disbelief and specious arguments as I have ever heard in my entire lifetime.Ms. Noonan's facts are painted as vitriol and so very unsurprisingly those who dislike the message can do no better than to slander the messenger with the most obscene and outrageous filth...a trait learned at the knees of their idols, the Clintons, among the most arrogant anti-Constitutionalists ever to so darken our nation's capitol.Brava Ms. Noonan. You wrote very well indeed and I say that with the confidence of a writer and English major. Would that any of the vitriol aimed at the author reflected even a modicum of eloquent intelligence."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"This short, sweet book is a real work of art. Those who complain about the speculative passages miss the point entirely. Noonan's eloquent verbal portraits illuminate - quite successfully in most cases - the harsh contrast between the promise and reality of Clintonism. They show how her comparisons are not to some impossible standard, but rather, to the kind of behavior that ought to come naturally to someone truly guided by the high motives that the Clintons proclaim so loudly as their own.Noonan is right on the mark with her assessment of what might have been. The Clintons swept into Washington before a great swell of prosperity that could have provided the fuel for their burning ambition to truly, &quot;make a difference.&quot; If the author seems harsh in her judgments, well... the Clintons offer much to be judgmental about. Noonan is more than charitable in assessing their ability and potential, if not their results. If her words bring pain, it is the pain of truth hitting home, the agony of an ugly secret being laid bare for all to see.Of course there is no &quot;new information&quot; here. Our great national tragedy is that facts such as these can be so thoroughly familiar while the spin rages on. You don't need footnotes when the premises are not in dispute... it is only the truly delusional who continue to see the Clintons as innocent victims of ideological terrorism and evil circumstance. What Noonan offers is the tapestry of the well-told story that organizes a blizzard of facts into the coherent facets of discernable form. She lays out a well-reasoned yet passionate and highly personal summing up of what it means to oppose Clintonism and why this remains a noble pursuit. In the end, the author gives honor to her political opponents by expecting more from them than quiet acquiescence in the face of the Clintons' unprecedented dishonesty, disrespect, and divisiveness. If you're up to the challenge, read this book."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"Why read a book that only covers ground you've already read about?First of all, Peggy Noonan can write well. She is interesting, informative, and witty. She is also not a blind ideologue. She has been able to work for Ronald Reagan and Dan Rather.Secondly, I feel that she has her facts straight. That didn't used to be an unusual trait, but these days, and especially on this subject, it's a wonderful breath of fresh air.Thirdly, she puts it all into a coherent whole. It's easy to hear something on the news and dismiss it as a mistake, or an unusual occurrence.

Finally, a coherent chronology of the moral degradation that the Clintons have created for all of us. Just wish I lived in New York so I too could vote against Hilary...

Peggy Noonan is a lot of things, but anyone who has ever read any of her books, or heard her speak, knows that &quot;hack&quot; is not one of them.This book is an eloquently written piece on a woman who has been, and wishes to continue to be, in a position to wield significant power and influence on the lives of the American people. Her modus operandi, as seen through the many fully documented and clearly presented examples, is consistent and ruthless. She is posessed of neither the moral character, nor the intellectual superiority to which she lays claim. Americans in general, and New Yorkers in particular, need to know these things.I have always wondered why the Clintons made me feel so...icky...as though there was a bug crawling on me as I slept - vaguely aware that something was wrong, but just groggy enough not to be able to identify the unwelcome visitor.

That's why Bill keeps on fund raising and HRC has to run for office now...it's all about staying on the stage, not on accomplishing anything worthy for our country. Most important for New Yorkers, Noonan points out the now-almost-forgotten Healthcare debacle in which HRC tried to hide the plan from the public and failed to build a consensus; it was an utter failure. Now, she tells us that Rudy's not fit for the Senate? Fact is, Rudy has a track record of success, and HRC's only real attempt at POLICY-MAKING was a debacle.

It is a very big job, a grand undertaking to become a United States Senator. The President is the most powerful person in the world.

The truth speaks for itself, and in this book, we see Mrs. Clinton for what she really is. I know that all her life she has cared about New York and its problems! Spare me! This book chronicles the constant scandals coming from the White House that Mrs. Clinton has been involved in. How could anyone with a sense of decency support Mrs. Clinton? She is an opportunist and Ms. Noonan makes that very clear. Mrs. Clinton can't be trusted. Anyone who has been to New York City recently realizes that Mayor Guiliani has saved that city. He has a more proven record than Mrs. Clinton. New York has had liberals before in their politics, but at least they were honorable people. Mrs. Clinton along with her husband have made a mockery of some of our national institutions. Overall, this book is great. I am a democrat who will not vote for Mrs. Clinton. She has disgraced our party and Ms. Noonan in a clear and convincing way has shown us why."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"It is very difficult to write a persuasive review of this book. The American people seem to have polarized on the Clintons. Perhaps one-third think the Clintons are the most corrupt figures in generations, surpassing even the Harding administration. Perhaps one-third believe either that the Clintons are great idealists who have done a wonderful job, or that they should be defended because the opposition is even worse. Probably at least one-third are sick of the whole business and don't want to hear about it any more. Still, there have been so many books published about Bill and Hillary that it is hard to escape notice.Peggy Noonan has written a book that is at once polite, respectful, contemptuous, articulate, too cute, insightful, banal, penetrating, and boring. How could a gifted writer like Noonan pull off such a contradiction? I think it is because she is trying so hard to give Hillary credit where it is due (which Noonan does give generously) while also trying to tone down her contempt (which is barely disguised). In a sense this book is an open letter to the voters of New York to put a halt to Clintonism. Yet it is written in a style that would appeal more to readers of The New Yorker than to readers of The New York Post or New York Daily News. It seems to me that the readers who could appreciate the style are already mostly in the Hillary camp.When my wife and I first saw Bill Clinton in the 1992 Presidential debates we thought him to be an \\"As-If\\" personality. This is a personality configuration in which an individual has no real core identity, but instead acts \\"as-if.\\" As if he really believed what he said, as if he were truly compassionate, as if he were actually brave, etc. It seemed to us that Bill Clinton's strength and weakness was simultaneously that he loved the political process yet had no core convictions other than winning. In a sense this can be good in that it can lead to flexibility and pragmatism. It can also be bad if it turns a leader into a chameleon. If you have no true core self then you must rely on polls to tell you what will win. If you are extremely gifted as a chameleon you can believe your own deceptions and this lie with total conviction.Compared with other books about Hillary Clinton, Noonan's book is rather mild. Gail Sheehey's book is riddled with even more psychologizing than Noonan's. Barbara Olson's is a more stinging indictment. Actually, Noonan's psychological references are quite strong, and one of the best chapters is the one in which she quotes the great psychoanalyst Otto Kernberg on the subject of pathological narcissism.Reading the other previous reviews convinces me that America is irrevocably divided on the Clintons. Perhaps future historians, even when armed with data that has been held back thus far from public view, may also remain divided.The book ends on a poignant note. Noonan states that the voters of New York will decide about Hillary's future before Hillary gets to decide their future. Given the constant high ratings of the Clintons I was left with the feeling that Hillary will get the last laugh.Finally, this is the only review I have ever written anonymously. Considering it is about the Clintons, you can figure out why."},{"Title":"The Case Against Hillary Clinton","review":"As a democrat who entusiastically voted for Bill Clinton the first time, and with slight hesitation the second time, I consider this book to be, among others, a must-read. Ms. Noonan has presented her argument cogently. Much as it saddens me to say, this book echoes the view of Hillary Clinton I slowly came to admit to myself with reluctance over the course of 8 years. If you find yourself with misgivings concerning the nature of the Clintons, read this book. Finally, in the end, we'll all have to face the true nature of these people, I suppose. Books like Ms. Noonan's are the first stage of the healing process."},{"Title":"Babe Ruth (Heroes of America: Illustrated Lives)","review":"Babe Ruth was born on 1895 at Baltimore,Maryland.

To have a book like this end the series the way it did was disheartening at best.

In addition, I found this book rather depressing."},{"Title":"Awakening; The Holts, an American Dynasty #10","review":"I too have read every book in all the series by Dana Fuller Ross. Cannot understand why in most cases each of the previous books only one or two years were covered and now all of a sudden there are decades covered in the one book (1901-1941). I thought that there would be at least an Awakenings 2-3-4 etc. which would lead right up to the present day.I guess the reason that the quality of the writing may have changed in the books because according to information I got at the local library someone else was writing under the name of Dana Fuller Ross as the original man who used the name Dana Fuller Ross passed away in 1976."},{"Title":"Awakening; The Holts, an American Dynasty #10","review":"Others have said it, and so will I; the series could have done with 1 less book...this one.It is obvious Ross just wanted to be rid of his characters. \\"Nonchalantly killed\\" is understating it. Morosly killing off Toby and Alexandra was not needed. Plus, all 3 main characters ended up wasting their lives. Had Ross decided to give Frank Blake a chance to successfully impacted Panama, and left it there, it would have been a finer book. Instead, years pass by with no real impact, and this book is a travesty."},{"Title":"Awakening; The Holts, an American Dynasty #10","review":"I, too, read the entire series but almost didn't read Awakening because of the negative reviews. Fortunately, I'm somewhat obsessive-compulsive and couldn't NOT read the closing novel.

Standing alone this book may rate as an average read. However, as the end of a series, the book lacked the depth and perception evident in the earlier volumes. The redeeming qualitiy of this book is that Dana Fuller Ross is able to present a finite period of history through a femine perspective."},{"Title":"Awakening; The Holts, an American Dynasty #10","review":"Fit nicely in the series, but I felt it was not quite as good as some of the previous books in the set."},{"Title":"Awakening; The Holts, an American Dynasty #10","review":"I have read every single one of the Wagons West &amp; Holts books, and I was very disappointed with this one. It seemed to be very rushed to me. Entire years happened in pages, and people died right and left. I didn't like it at all. I think it could have been a lot better. It was like the series just needed to end, and the author rushed it out. I don't think I'll ever read it again. Also, FYI, Dana Fuller Ross is a man. His real name is James Something.

What could have been a very complex and dreary subject--legal proceedings over the U.N. attempting to enforce a treaty regarding children supreceding the laws of the United States--is made alive and interesting. The author captures the real feel and attitudes of the kinds of people who are committed spiritually to Christian values while showing that the threat goes far beyond such people. The subplots are engaging and essential to humanize the characters. The role of the internet and chat rooms is both amusing and enlightening. The ultimate message of the book comes through vividly: there is a genuine and serious threat to American sovereignty by ratifying treaties that invade the personal lives of Americans."},{"Title":"Forbid Them Not","review":"In this book Mike Farris tells a legally accurate and gripping story about the potential harm the U.N. can do if it improperly performs its role in the world.

I don't mind a message, but beating people over the head with your moralistic message makes for bad reading.3. Stilted dialogue. I'm sorry, people just don't talk like this.4. Cardboard characters. The bad guys are \\"all bad\\" and have no legitimate reasons for their point of view. The good guys are the beloved of God, and everything they do is for a righteous reason.

Piri Thomas published _Down These Mean Streets_ in 1967. I just read it this past summer, my mother--right after I gave it to her. And the thought that has wondered in is, &quot;why wasn't I told about his book earlier?&quot; Is Piri Thomas' experience, a bond with African American culture that Juan Flores addresses in his book, such a marginal experience in American life, that it took a suggestion by Amazon.com for a man with 4 years of university education to be aware of the book? As the population of Latino/as in the United States grows to the levels of being the largest minority group in the country, there will have to be a shifting of Latina/o literature, theory, and any cultural products from the margins of American life to the center contemporary discussion. It is these products that Juan Flores probes and analyses with keen insight that places the Puerto Rican aspect of the Latino experience into mainstream intellectual thought. From &quot;the Madonna incident&quot; in Puerto Rico, to the ties that Puerto Ricans have with Hip-Hop, and the current status of Puerto Rico that he sadly calls a &quot;Lite Colony,&quot; Flores' book is one that should be read by anyone interested in the affairs of American culture."},{"Title":"From Bomba to Hip-Hop","review":"The title of Mr. Flores' book might be a little deceiving for those who are not familiar with the subject matter. Mr. Flores uses music as a jumping off point for some very thought provoking themes that pertain (in my opinion) to all Latino's. Juan Flores goes from scholarly themes like colonialism to thoughts on the funeral of Cortijo and the history of the Boogaloo phenomena in New York City.Mr. Flores makes you stop and think, then think again about issues you may have had preconceived notions about. I really enjoyed being challenged intellectually as I read this book.I recently attended a lecture/performance (at the CUNY Graduate Center in New York City) of &quot;From Bomba to Hip-Hop&quot; conducted by Mr. Flores, music historian Rene Lopez and Mike Wallace (who won a Pulitzer Prize for his book, &quot;Gotham.&quot;) True to form, it was a very unique, educational and entertaining experience."},{"Title":"From Bomba to Hip-Hop","review":"While Juan Flores is perceptive in his discussion of the Puerto Rican component of Latino culture, and discusses other major critics like Perez Firmat and Stavans, I was frankly surprised not to see any discussion of William Luis's Dance Between Two Cultures: Latino Caribbean Literature Written in the United States, which in my estimation is as important as those written by the critics Flores discusses. The value of Luis's study is that he addresses the same Puerto Rican community mentioned in Flores' book, but Luis also contextualizes this community by considering its relation to the Cuban and Dominican components of Latino culture. Anyone interested in understanding Latino literature and culture should also read Dance Between Two Cultures, which contains perceptive readings of Latino Caribbean literature unavailable in any other study."},{"Title":"From Bomba to Hip-Hop","review":"The book arrived in new condition.

This book is a powerful page-turner that provides so much inside info that you feel you are right there with Tom Stafford and his buddies, every minute of the journey. If you're curious about all the dirty little secrets behind counter-terrorism and how difficult it is to do your job if you are CIA or ex-CIA, then this book is a must read. What fascinated me most was the incredibly accurate details of the locations in Paris, descriptions of exactly what they ate and drank, the restaurants, the clothes, the disguises and how they go about capturing their prey. Weisman writes about all of it in depth and so well, that you're always kept wondering what is truth and what is fiction. Yet with all of this, he still keeps the action at a breakneck pace."},{"Title":"Direct Action","review":"A friend recommended a novel to me that I probably would have overlooked without his advice... Direct Action by John Weisman. A good espionage thriller...Tom Stafford is a former CIA officer who quit the agency when things became far too bureaucratic for his liking. The private firm he works for has uncovered an al-Qaida terrorist who has been a mystery figure to everyone who has tried to find him in the past. When they bring this to the attention of the CIA, they are inexplicitly told to back off. What makes this even more frustrating is that the terrorist is launching a suicide bombing plot involving designer backpacks and undetectable explosives. Unless this is stopped and the explosives analyzed, all the preventative measures in place around the world will be rendered moot. An unusual mix of private contractors with shadowy pasts and mixed loyalties have to come together to flush out the terrorist, find the explosives, and steer clear of whatever powers in the CIA are preventing them from doing what's right...Weisman writes with the perspective of someone who has spent plenty of time in the world of covert actions. The plotline of the story is meshed into real CIA personalities and activities, so it's often a little difficult to draw the line between what's story and what's actual history. He also blacks out certain names and activities in the book, much like you'd see in a declassified document. It may sound a little hokey, but it works well to make the writing feel even more real.Prior to this read, I hadn't even heard of Weisman. Now he's moved into my \\"so what else has he written\\" list... A good read to allow you to escape for a few hours..."},{"Title":"Direct Action","review":"Weisman does it again -- Direct Action is brilliant. This book is smart, timely, authentic and extremely realistic. If Weisman ever worked for the CIA, he'd probably be in significant trouble for all the tradecraft, sources, methods, and analysis revealed in this book. Fortunately for us, he's just got tremendous sources...allowing the rest of us to glimpse what only a very few are cleared to know.Direct Action should absolutely be on your summer reading list!"},{"Title":"Direct Action","review":"This is a pretty good read. Its got a ton of detail about covert operations, spy devices, and the intelligence apparatus to make you feel like this is what really goes on. The story line is pretty good, too. It slightly annoying that the authors' political views are so obviously on display."},{"Title":"Direct Action","review":"I hadn't read Weisman before, but trotted out and bought an earlier book right after finishing this. It's a very readable, intriguing book, with somewhat under-developed but appealing characters, and convincing plotting and ambience. I agree with the reviewer who said if half of this about the CIA is true, we're in big trouble -- and some non-fiction I've read recently suggests it is at least half-true. In that sense, the book was disturbing and frustrating, but since that was the author's goal -- good job!"},{"Title":"Direct Action","review":"John Weisman wrote a very good spy/terrorist story. Worth the price of the book. It's got everything a story of this type suppose to have action, suspense and on and on. Our hero has to go it alone with no help from the people he works for, and it's not the C.I.A."},{"Title":"Direct Action","review":"The best (so far) of John Weisman's recent batch of post Rogue Warrior thrillers that will take readers inside the CIA and the War on Terror. The story detials how the CIA is hiring independent contractors from private security firms to perform tasks that the agency is not able to do on its own, either because of a lack of qualified officers or because of the leadership bureaucracy at Langley. The story revolves around efforts to track down an al-Qaeda bomb maker planning a series of upcoming attacks, combining fact and fiction. Aside from being entertaining, the narrative also includes tons of details on the current state of the CIA and past intelligence operations. It is also a primer on how the War on Terror needs to be fought effectively. Weisman has done for the War on Terror in novels what Clancy did for the Cold War. Hopefully he'll continue writing books like this."},{"Title":"Direct Action","review":"Mr Weisman's latest novel is outstanding. A very well written story covering the turbulence of the intelligence community of the United States. Few can cover the special operations and covert-clandestine worlds better than Mr Weisman. He has related the \\"second\\" front of the intelligence war - ourselves. Giving up spies for satelites, tradecraft for technology, and a reliance on zero defect mentality vice leadership. The story fills in the gaps since the day America changed, September 11th, to present time. It is not always fun to read if you have half your brain tuned into the current events. It will upset you with pretty accurate description of managers and bureaucrats poorly filling in for leaders and opertives and re-assure you that many sleep well in their beds at night for the few warriors that man the \\"walls\\" remain. The set up and flow is excellent. The explanation supportive to the story, not tedious or insulting. The theme is clear and well presented. If you enjoy the covert action story that is clearly related to our present situation as a nation of people, you will enjoy this book. If you do not regulary enjoy this kind of reading, take a chance on this one - it is well worth the time."},{"Title":"Direct Action","review":"John Weisman is an excellent author, and Direct Action will not disappoint. After listening to the author in a lengthy radio interview, I realized that he was telling a tell-all about the CIA couched in a fictional storyline. That approach seems like the best approach, since no author can name names of real operational field agents. It is the story of the gutting of the CIA in the previous administration, where the president wanted to \\"clean up\\" the CIA by getting rid of field agents who by necessity had to interact with \\"unsavory\\" people as sources. The presidential directive was to rely largely on signals intelligence and satellite imagry. The result was a CIA who falsely said about WMD in Iraq, \\"it's a slam-dunk\\". It is the story of a CIA that was broken.Direct Action is not a dry story, but a compelling story of \\"outsourcing\\" intelligence fieldwork, and the daring efforts of former CIA agents who now do the same work but without the stifling bureaucracy in \\"the company\\". It's a page-turner, but keep in mind that it is largely fact in a fictional story."},{"Title":"Direct Action","review":"...this work by Mr.Weisman.

(I did not like his Rogue Warriorseries - the covert actions are his best)This book I consider a keeper and a re-read."},{"Title":"Direct Action","review":"This novel painfully points out the problems with the CIA during the terms of Directors such as Webster, Gates, Woolsey, Deutch and George Tenet. Seasoned intelligence professionals left the agency in droves or were forced to retire. Directives were issued that in effect prevented the clandestine service from spying. Positions were filled by individuals few of whom had the experience, ability or inclination to recruit agents to spy for America. Tom Stafford, a former CIA case officer, can't stand how things have deteriorated. He joins up with a group of former CIA agents who now are independent contactors calling themselves the 4627 Company. This group contracts projects that the rather impotent CIA would not be capable of handling. This plot centers around a genius terrorist bombmaker who has miniaturized parts so they can be hidden and carried undetected onto to commercial aircraft. This is really an almost impossible to put down read. My only complaint is that there were at least ten pages where portions of the text were blacked out as though by a censor. I find that rather disconcerting. Plenty of espionage tips and tricks. And plenty of excitement as they hunt down and terminate the enemy."},{"Title":"Direct Action","review":"Direct Action is, without a doubt, the most entertaining book I've read in a year. John Weisman is well known for leveraging his deep connections in the intelligence community and a thorough commitment to authentic detail while writing his novels...His knowledge of tradecraft, history and current events is remarkable -- and he masterfully weaves them all together...making the reader wonder if the story is fact or fiction. The result, in this case, is that Direct Action is one of the most authentic, insightful, and exciting spy novels in print today. You'll love it."},{"Title":"Direct Action","review":"If only a fraction of what John Weisman says of the incompetence and bungling of the CIA, the United States faces serious problems. To Weisman's credit, he is a skilled storyteller. He begins with a highly publicized fact about the CIA and then weaves the story further. The question is whether what he weaves is true or not?But, of course, \\"Direct Action\\" is a novel, a thriller and a very good one at that.The initial theme is that the CIA has grown so incompetent after its devesatation in the 1990s that even its most basic intelligence gathering functions must now be outsourced, primarily to former CIA employees. One of these, McGee, has developed a source in Gaza. Told that he needs photographic evidence of a certain terrorist reputed to be in Gaza, McGee is blown into smithereens on his way there.Enter Marilyn Jean O'Connor, an analyst in the Counterterrorist Phtoto Interpretation Group at the CIA. One almost suspects that Weisman included this ultimately minor character in order to heap more abuse on the CIA. But MJ does serve a pair of small purposes beyond depicting an organization that can't do anything right: she further identifies the mysterious terrorist who allegedly doesn't exist and she leads us to her boyfriend, Tom Stafford.Stafford, formerly CIA, now works for 4627, one of the private companies providing the CIA with its human gathered intelligence. Stafford is an appealing hero. Smart, but not too smart. Cynical, but not too cynical. And possessed of a very workmanlike manner in his spying.Conveniently, MJ is due to visit boyfriend Stafford in Paris and she just happens to bring along the classified material identifying the terrorist which the CIA has rejected. Yeah, MJ is a little loose when it comes to following orders, but you know how it is. Weisman is to be forgiven this major stretch: he had to make the story work.Even more conveniently, at the same time MJ is arriving in Paris, Tom is tipped by a long time informant about --- you guessed it --- a mysterious terrorist who, by the way, has developed a sneaky new way of making virtually undetectable bombs. The informant is shot dead as he walks with Tom.Weisman moves his story along quickly. Once the preliminaries are over, he shifts into an even higher gear and \\"Direct Action\\" becomes a total page-turner.The action moves from Paris to Israel to Paris to Washington. There's lots of spycraft involved; plenty of double-crosses and close escapes and the clock ticking down to the next major-league terrorist attack.Weisman, in a word, is superb. The plot, though it has a few small black holes, is tightly woven. The backstories about the CIA are frightening. The characters are interesting.All in all, a truly well done thriller. And if wht Weisman writes about the CIA is true even in substantial part, a very frightening thriller.Jerry"},{"Title":"Direct Action","review":"John Weisman (best known as the co-author of the rogue warrior series) writes with great detail, drawing the reader into the exciting world of a CIA subcontractor. The main character races around the globe, uncovering details of a plot to utilize a new kind of untraceable explosive. Problem is the action fizzles at the very end. Its like Mr Weisman had a goal number of pages to write, and as soon as he reached it he ends the book.I will still give Weisman's other books a try because he has potential."},{"Title":"Direct Action","review":"This book made it past the censors and yet gives the layman an inside look at the frustrations for operations personnel in the CIA.

You participate with Sherman in the decisions he makes and realize he was the greatest General in the Civil War . Unlike Grant and Lee he avoide the killing of troops , ( on both sides ). He realized that the way to Peace was to destroy the economic underpinings of the South . The concept of his march across Georgia was contrary to the conventional wisedom both North and the South . It is fascinating to read his correspondence with Grant and Lincoln on this subject.Readers interested in Sherman might want to look at a book by renowned British soldier and writer B.H.

Every time there are figures and tables in the book they are hopelessly mangled. This is very annoying, since Sherman uses tables extensively to describe his divisions as well as dead, wounded and prisoners after battles and campaigns.Furthermore, there are very many typos which are obviously the fault of the OCR (optical character recognition) process. Simply put, Amazon didn't bother to proof-read the text that came out of the OCR of the scanned pages of the original book. Lots of u's have become n's, lots of c's have become e's, etc., etc.This book is open source due to its age, so it is FREE for Amazon. If they sell it for 14+ dollars AT LEAST they could have cleaned up and proof-read the scan someone did of the original book.

Sherman","review":"William T. Sherman was one of the most fascinating, unique characters of the American Civil War. Explosive, profane and brilliant, he was surprisingly cautious on the battlefield and never incured the casualities of either Lee or Grant. Sherman's strength was in manouvering to avoid combat and he generally succeeded.So, how does Sherman hold up as a writer? Surprisingly well. Though the book is not as well-written as Ulysses S. Grant's Personal Memoirs, it is still a solid, riveting piece of work. A small criticism is that Sherman included copious amounts of correspondence which are printed in small letters at the bottom of many pages. The correspondence is frquently difficult to decipher and not especially edifying. The acual text, however, is stellar. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman","review":"Clearly historians and civil war buffs will acknowledge the brilliance of this memoir for its obvious window into the mind of this most important figure of his time.I didn't come to this as either one of the former,but as a reader interested in understanding how this man accomplished the most decisive strokes in the war with such skill.The greatness of book lies not so much in its explanation of military strategy(which it is) but the powerful definition of the principles of freedom as expressed through a common foot soldier.Sherman understood that no elitist and patrician society could stand however strong there reputation ,against a soldier who fought for this principle.I found it inciteful that Shermans experience in the prewar south,and his views of its imbalanced society, became more valuable in breaking it than his geographical knowledge.That Lincoln approved Shermans plan to march through the heart of the confedreacy at the disapproval of all his advisors shows his wisdom to Shermans argument that the south was a shell,and hollow inside.Grants reluctance to this plan,which he approved only out of his loyalty to Sherman, is poignant to read.Grant thought he'd never see his best friend again.The genius of Sherman was his utter conviction in the goodness of men to destroy that which was evil,knowing that when his men saw not the soldiery of the south,but its hideous society,he needn't do more to motivate them.The miserable condition of slavery was known,but the site of 90 percent of a white population virtually no better off provided Sherman with a civilian population unable and unwilling to resist.Noone but Sherman thought this important,and that his diary records this as a current fact and not analysis years later is powerful reading.Defeating the confedracy on this march with no major battles and losing but 100 men of his 62,000, told the south, as well as the north the myth of southern military advantage.Sherman became so feared ,Southern commanders as well as thier soldiers fled before him,offering almost no opposition.Shermans Army of the West,recruited and trained by him,became the most feared army in the world,for it fought under the true belief of a free people against real evil.His own words to that effect are awe inspiring."},{"Title":"Memoirs of General William T.

Sherman","review":"I just finished reading this book (from the library, a 19th century edition) and came to search for other books. There are modern histories, but reading the original memoirs is very satisfying. The book by Julius Ceasar of the Gallic wars comes to mind. Sherman is a clear and satisfying writer. He does remind me of Ceasar in his matter of fact recollections.I enjoyed the section on the taking of California during the Mexican war. Talking about hundreds of ships abandoned in Yerba Buena (to become San Francisco) due to the desertion of all the crews was interesting.The period between California and Louisiana and secession is less interesting, but he was preparing a memoir of his life.The war is what everyone will be looking for, and specifically the March to the Sea. The advance down from Tennessee to Atlanta is more militarily interesting. After the fall of Atlanta the battle was all logistics. Could such a large army separate from it's supply lines? According to W.T. Sherman this was all his idea and he documents it exhaustively. Presumeably this was due to disparagements of his leadership in the decades after the war and the presidency of Johnson.The extensive documentation of lines of battle and effective strength and copies of tremendous amounts of coorespondence can be tedious, but are easily scanned for what is of interest or skipped altogether.Great read, interesting book. Tecumseh Sherman is one of my heroes."},{"Title":"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman","review":"Time travel is fun. Some authors are extraordinary for being able to transport you to another time period. Some authors don't have to transport you to another time because they are already from another time.A few years back I found myself reading the Memoirs of U. S. Grant. It seemed that for a few months I kept running into statements claiming that General Grant had written the finest set of memoirs ever penned by a Unites States President. I took and plunge and discovered a fascinating life described in a beautiful clear lucid prose. Grant could write!I only mention Grant's memoirs because they were the incentive to tackle General Sherman's memoirs as well. Much to my surprise (though I don't know why I was surprised) I discovered that Sherman could also write. The prose is a bit wordy but straightforward, clear, and penetrating. You can see how such thinking made a real difference in the outcome of the Civil War.There is something beautiful and simple about reading Sherman's accounts of the war and the times. He tells of captured officers being invited to dine with the Union commanders and offered horses to ride befitting their rank. At other times he muses about how cavalry can never overcome infantry but will always be necessary for a successful war campaign. He talks about the need for a good supply of coffee and discusses the merits of some coffee substitutes.You also discover that General Sherman did more than march through Georgia. During the Mexican American War he was stationed in California. This assignment placed him in the bay area in 1848 when gold was discovered at Sutter's mill. Later he managed a bank in San Francisco when the vicissitudes of the gold rush created severe panic as well as boom times. It would surprise many to learn that when Lincoln was elected Sherman was leading a small military school in Louisiana that would later become LSU.Anyone who has even a passing interest in this period of American history will find this a fascinating read. There is much to feast on here. My two favorite moments are probably Sherman's encouragement likely keeping Grant from resigning after Shiloh and the striking circumstances surrounding Sherman being notified of Lincoln's assassination.It's a fairly long book and filled with a lot of source material such as letters and battle reports, but altogether a book well worth reading."},{"Title":"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman","review":"As a writer Sherman was a natural. This book is a wonderful read and I've heard that it is the most important of all of the Civil War era autobiographies and I believe it. Everything that can be said of the book has been said in the many reviews, but I would just like to add my approval. Highly recommended book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman","review":"Beauty often is in the eye of the beheld and while this wonderful memoir personally was tedious at times in Sherman's California memories and very in depth in naming corps in battle for the novice to try and keep straight, this work is thee best historical writing of the American period in the 1800's.Sherman's attention to detail shows in his work and why he was successful in battle. If one has read Patton's memoirs, it is like reading Sherman's ghost. The same lessons Sherman learned are what every soldier has to learn to win in a war.There are though wonderful insights from personal revelations on Grant, Lincoln and the mood of the nation which Sherman gives frankly to provide the history as it really was.The one absolutely surprising thing in reading this is that Ken Burns, historians and our history classes have the Civil War fought backwards. From Sherman's view, the war was never fought from the Potomac south by the Union army against Lee's Virginia Army. The war instead from Grant's and his direction was fought in the west to the east. The Cumberland gained first, then the Mississippi, then the central south, then Georgia, the Carolinas and finally to Virginia.Grant only held Lee in check to the last while Sherman carried out the battle plan in taking the Confederate army apart of Johnston.There is alot of detail in this book, so it might be difficult for any but advanced history readers, but it is well worth the effort for all as this book is delightful in explaining real history from pre Civil War to post Civil War.The one amusing thing about Sherman is some of the most horrific battles which others mourn over, Sherman instead simply is unmoved like at Shiloh, calls them skirmishes at Atlanta or even Custer which was under his watch is not even mentioned.He does literally come across as the real life incarnation of John Wayne's characters mixed with the legendary Greek warriors. This book is hard to master, but you will be pleased in completing this read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman","review":"Having recently read Grant's exceptional Memoirs, I wasn't sure what to expect from Sherman. Grant, for example, wrote gracefully, was surprisingly \\"personal\\" in his recollections of his early life and, while providing an excellent account of his involvement in the war, still managed to create a uniquely revealing personal portrait. I wasn't sure that Sherman could live up to that high standard. I shouldn't have worried. Sherman's Memoirs are superb. Sherman is not nearly as \\"personally revealing\\" as Grant, which is odd because we get the sense that Grant was a private and sometimes reticent man (although Sherman goes out of his way to mention how much Grant liked to trade tales), whereas Sherman seems a true extrovert: always active, always talking, and never one to mind his tongue. Still Sherman is as fine a writer, if not a better one, than Grant. The book can be off-putting when Sherman relies too heavily on letters or orders (both exhaustively included) to tell the story for him, but he had a first rate mind and a mastery of detail, and when he allowed himself to do so (which is most of the time), he could construct a remarkable narrative. (For what it is worth, Sherman was a lifelong reader of Dickens with a real interest in the theater.)Two early sections of the book, on his experiences in California around the time of the gold rush, and in Louisiana immediately before the war, are especially interesting. If you have any interest in California before the war (or accounts of travel from the eastern United States to the West Coast by a combination of land and sea, complete with shipwrecks, illness, and every other imaginable complication), the memoirs are worthwhile for the early sections alone. It is also interesting to observe that (unlike Grant) Sherman was not only well connected (his \\"adoptive\\" father and his brother were Senators, and the President attended his wedding), but he was a success at a wide range of endeavors, from surveying, to banking, to real estate. But the Civil War section really shines. Sherman is very precise, but also very easy to follow as he charts his grand campaign. His meticulous attention to detail is attested by numerous summaries of what armies were involved, their commanders, their strengths and their casualties. (It is amusing that Sherman makes it a point, time and again, to dispute the numbers cited by Joe Johnston in his history of the war that allegedly demonstrated how many more casualties the Union suffered than did the Confederacy.) Still, it is a compelling narrative and I didn't find it dry or dull. Sherman doesn't, and probably could not, answer the grand questions about the \\"excesses\\" of his soldiers on their march, or whether the destruction they wrought was \\"necessary.\\" What he can and does do, however, is to describe the remarkable achievements of his army and compellingly explain his disdain for the cause of the Confederacy and his conviction that, if it is to be won, war cannot be waged half-heartedly and (at least here) must be waged upon enemy civilians both to destroy their resources and their spirit. Agree or not, it is compelling to hear Sherman on the subject, as when he talks of the intense dislike of the northern soldiers to South Carolina and the special devastation brought upon that cradle of succession. The book is also excellent in documenting the controversy over Sherman's surrender terms to Joe Johnston: how, in Sherman's mind, these were entirely consistent with Grant's terms to Lee, President Lincoln's instructions, and the exigencies of the situation, and how Secretary of War Stanton betrayed a trust, failed to inform him about certain standing orders regarding surrender, and used the press against Sherman for his own purposes. Of course, that is Sherman's side of it, but it is well documented and the book gives the reader a great confidence in the man's integrity. Of course, the book is most notable for Sherman's many opinions, on almost everything, including other commanders, journalists, politicians, causes of the war, the proper organization of the army, etc. The book closes with an interesting if rather brief account of Sherman's role with the transcontinental railroads and the \\"settlement\\" of the west, including the dislocation of Native Americans.all in all, the book is superb. It may bog down a bit in letters or official reports, but Sherman's voice is unique and colorful, and gives real insight into an extraordinary character in extraordinary times.FYI: the Library of America volume is typically well done, with a fine chronology and helpful notes. HOWEVER, the maps are atrocious. Rather, the maps are probably very good, but they are impossible to read without a magnifying glass and, so, not very helpful. This is especially regrettable because Sherman himself commented on these fine maps that graced the 2d editions. As with the Grant volume. LoA should be able to do better."},{"Title":"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman","review":"But, what an historical figure. No Presidential aspirations, nothing. But destruction and devastation to win a war. Hmmm. Today, his actions would be considered barbaric and uncivilized. Consider what's going on at the Mexican border, now.... Maybe Sherman could straighten it out, hmmmm..."},{"Title":"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman","review":"After the Civil War, there were many public misunderstandings and misrepresentations about General William T. Sherman. Secretary of War Stanton had caused to be published certain opinions of his that Sherman had messed things up, and many supporters of General Grant gave him all the credit for Sherman's famous march to the sea and Atlanta campaign (which was entirely Sherman's idea). Partly to dispel popular misconceptions about him, and partly to provide future historians with a great primary resource (which intention he states in the opening pages of this work), General Sherman decided to undertake the writing of his memoirs, and this is the result.The historical value of these memoirs is enormous. Sherman contributed a great deal to the war, and was partially responsible for the war ending when it did. He conducted one of the most brilliant military campaigns in modern history (actually, they were three campaigns--Atlanta, Savannah, and the Carolinas) and accomplished what many considered to be the impossible. His policy of total war, applied in the South, was utilized by Sheridan in the Shenandoah, and was later slightly modified to be used against the Indians. Thanks to his memoirs, we have a step-by-step account of how this policy developed.Sherman's work is engaging and very to the point. He is meticulous almost to a fault in his quest for accuracy and detail. His writing is very, very good, and easy to read. Also, Sherman truly (I believe) endeavored to be completely objective in his evaluations, and accomplished this end better even than most modern historians. He is quick to give praise and slow to censure, but is not afraid to record the failures of his subordinates when necessary. He sometimes points out things they could have done better, but is never overly critical of them. He even admits that he made mistakes sometimes. In fact, I believe this is one of the most objective and fair autobiographies I have ever read. Sherman had much reason to dislike many people, but never, in reading this work, did I find a single instance of him trying to debunk the character of any man. Even Stanton, the man who falsely represented Sherman's actions, receives fair treatment at the general's hands.William T. Sherman is a very colorful figure in Civil War history. He may well be one of the most complex and intriguing individuals of the war. To some, he is a barbarian; to others, a deliverer. He is immensely quotable, and was very opinionated and outspoken. If you're contemplating studying the Civil War, do not be put off by this book's length. Far from being a dry account of a man's recollections, this is a very engaging and very worthwhile autobiography, and any student of the war will profit by reading it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman","review":"I am reviewing the Library of America edition of Sherman's MemoirsIn 1875 General William Sherman published the first edition of his Memoirs. They were controversial. Eleven years later Sherman published his second edition, with two new chapters, and appendixes. To be sure the memoirs remained controversial. Even today there seems to be no middle ground. He is either a great general, or an overrated one. He is either &quot;hailed as a prophet of modern war or condemned as a modern barbarism.&quot; There have been full scale biographies and books about his campaigns, but none are as rewarding as these memoirs.The chapters which interested me the most were the ones where Sherman is most emotionally involved. In Chapter 7 Sherman writes of his time at the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning and Military Academy. Sherman gives a &quot;Clay Whig&quot; description of that state's secession, and how hard he took it. Another chapter which I found thrilling is Chapter 19. On page 601 Sherman quotes a letter he wrote to Atlanta's Mayor James Calhoun and others: &quot;You cannot qualify war in harsher terms than I will. War is cruelty, and you cannot refine it; and all those who brought war into our country deserve all the curses and maledictions a people can pour out.&quot;I recommend the Library of America edition of Sherman's Memoirs because it reprints the second edition. Make sure you buy a reprint of the second edition because the it includes information that was not included in the first edition."},{"Title":"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman","review":"Unfortunately General Sherman did not share General Grant's natural ability with the pen. General Sherman's book is a collection of his major wartime correspondence linked together by his narrative. This provides a quite fascinating look at Sherman's career for the historian of both the professional or &quot;armchair&quot; variety, but may make for a more tedious read for the common enthusiast. Nevertheless, many gems are contained in the pages of this blunt and straightforward story. The memoirs are the source of all his famous quotes and misquotes that are popularly repeated, such as &quot;War is cruelty, and you cannot refine it&quot;."},{"Title":"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman","review":"&quot;What Dercyllidas said of the court of Persia may be applied to that of several European princes, that he saw there much splendor but little strength, and many servants but few soldiers.&quot; So Adam Smith (although it was not Dercyllidas but Antiochus). In an anecdote, he thereby captures the essence of classic small-r Republicanism: a society of individuals who are fit, self-sufficient -- and armed. It is the model that gives such sentimental appeal to the campaign for the right to bear arms.Was there ever such a society? Doubtful. But if you wanted to find one, you would have done well to show up on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C. a little after 9 a.m. on the morning of the 23d of April, 1865, to review the Army of the West in review formation behind its commander, William Tecumseh Sherman. Here, from his memoirs, is Sherman's own account.&quot;When I reached the Treasury-building, and looked back, the sight was simply magnificent: The column was compact, and the glittering muskets looked like a solid mass of steel, moving with the regularity of a pendulum. . . . It was, in my judgment, the most magnificent army in existence - sixty-five thousand men, in splendid physique, who had just completed a march of nearly two thousand miles in a hostile country, in good drill, and who realized that they were being closely scrutinized by thousands of their fellow-countrymen and by foreigners. . . . The steadiness and firmness of the tread, the careful dress on the guides, the uniform intervals between the companies, all eyes directly to the front, and the tattered and bullet-riven flags, festooned with flowers, all attracted universal notice. Many good people, up to that time, had looked upon our Western Army as a sort of mob; but the world then saw, and recognized the fact, that it was an army kin the proper sense, well organized, well commanded and disciplined, and there was no wonder that it had swept through the South like a tornado.&quot;Sherman had reason to be proud. One assumes that his name still evokes bitter memories around Atlanta where he tore up and twisted so many miles of rail track. But Sherman was, ironically, the kind of general who is good for victor and vanquished alike. He had the temperament of a fighter, but he knew that the goal of fighting was not to shed blood, but only to win. His campaigns inflicted legendary damage but most of it was swift and highly focused. There was some pillage, but even the pillage seems to have been planned and organized and permitted only to the extent necessary for the campaign. In all the accounts that I have seen, there is little or no talk of rape.It is a commonplace that good soldiers make bad writers, but the evidence is not so clear. There is a reason why Caesar and Xenophon persist as staples of the classical curriculum. Ulysses Grant, who was said to write military orders so clear that they could not be misunderstood, himself produced a military memoir of great vigor and force. But it is hard to think of anything that will compare with Sherman's own account - particularly his narrative of the long march from Lookout Mountain across George and then up through the Carolinas to the Capital and the end of the war. If there ever was a time to be optimistic about the future of a free citizenry, surely the day of that great parade was the day."},{"Title":"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman","review":"Sherman wrote well.Compared to the flowery prose of others from this era, Sherman uses clear and simple words that carry well to the modern age. Further, he has a fascinating story to tell of shipwrecks, banking disasters, gold discoveries and then of course The War.I would recommend this to those who are already more than familiar with the American Civil War. What we see here is one man's view and you need to understand that he had his own opinions.The Battle of Chattanooga is perhaps the most obvious example of this. Was Sherman's attack really the cause the Rebel center collapsed? He seems to have honestly thought so. Most scholars take exception.This is simply a limitation of the memoir form. You should not take all that he has written as historical fact, but as the honest recollections of a man who was there at the critical moments of the War.I recommend it. At its best, it is like reading a letter from a long-gone uncle about his long-ago adventures."},{"Title":"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman","review":"After reading Shelby Foote's huge narrative of the civil war, I was fascinated about Sherman. This book did not live up to my expectations, partly because I wanted more feelings, and reasoning behind the actions. I wanted to get into his head. What you get instead is a real detailed account, obviously taken from journal entries and official correspondence. The only candid or in-depth portions of the book are when Sherman gives derrogatory accounts of the performance of some of the officers. Given that criticism, it is still fascinating, yet dry and long reading. His time in California during the Mexican War is fascinating. The real tragedy of the book is that it stops at the end of the civil war. I understand he did some interesting things after the war, but I guess you have to find another source for that."},{"Title":"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman","review":"The Library of America edition of Sherman's Memoirs is one of the most fascinating books I've ever read. The man had a brilliant mind. He was efficient in all that he put his hand too. And, if he failed in some ways, he cleaned up his messes and went on his way. The war would probably have lasted forever if he hadn't had the foresight, the leadership ability, the stamina, and just plain guts. But he knew how to end the war, and he had no illusions that he was playing at war. He knew it was hell, and he did what he had to do. I loved the dated letters and wires between the various players on the scene. Thank God Sherman saved these written pieces of history for us. If he hadn't, his memoirs would have only been from his point of view. And, when something he's telling us is from his memory only, he states it as such. If you are going to war, it's not a good idea to play at it. Sherman knew that. And biding his time, he was given the chance by U.S. Grant to end this. If he hadn't been elected to take his \\"show on the road\\" we would probably be living today in a divided, bickering country, and without the power we enjoy as a nation. And, by the way, Grant was brilliant enough and his ego was intact enough so that he was able to award the job of sweeping up Georgia and the Carolinas to the best man--Sherman.Regarding the publishing, it's about time I didn't have to crack open the binding to read a book. Because the binding is sewn, it opens flat to any page you choose. The paper is thin to keep the book from being too heavy and large. The paper is also acid free so it will not yellow and become brittle with age. The cloth binding is exquisite--designed and manufactured in Holland; it is Rayon, which probably will last forever. Even the dusk jacket is quality paper. That's how my books were when I was young, and that's why I don't remember ever having to break the binding open in any of my books, no matter how large they were. It's a pleasure to be able to lay on my stomach and read a book without having to hold it in place. If you want to write in your books, buy cheaper versions.

Sherman himself; first published less than a decade after the end of the Civil War. Although 1100+ pages, every paragraph of this book is fascinating. While it can't possibly be read in one sitting it's very difficult to put down.In character with the efficency of organization he was known for in managing every aspect of his life, this book is pure information, fact, personal insights, important correspondence, personal recollections of conversations with relevant historic figures and is, at times very amusing.Rather than dealing with his whole life, this book was written as a first hand account detailing events of the Civil War, particularly the armies under his direct command as well as events leading up to the Civil War and relevant political events after the war.Straightforward and efficient, no fluff."},{"Title":"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman","review":"General Grant wrote his memoirs and they were probably the best account of a war written by a general. In reading other memoirs of the war one thinks of Grant and one is usually disapointed.Sherman's book lacks the readability of Grant. There will be a narrative and then Sherman will quote verbatem series of written order or correspondence or quote tables of battlefield losses. It tends to break up the narrative and make his book more of a technical manual. As well he writes to a contemporary audience and assumes that most people know what he is talking about. Thus his account of the battle of Shiloh is brief with a note indicating that there is not real need to say more as everyone knew what happened.Despite these problems from the point of view of readability the book is fascinating history. To an outsider the role of a general is that of a dashing figure who leads troops to battle. Sherman's book illustrates how much the role of a general is a day to day slog filled with huge amounts of correspondence over supplies, allocation of trains, keeping subordinates informed of what is going on and the minuture of managing an army. He appears to have kept copies of all his correspondence, all orders and all troop details. When talking about his campaigns he quotes extensively from all this material. In reading it one gets a good sense of what his job was and the mechanics of leadership.The book is best when Sherman describes his campaigns after Grant moved to the East. The decision to march to the sea especially is good. It was a brave decision to break free of the railway system which had supplied Sherman and to live of the land. Grant was concerned but Sherman was totally confident that the confederates could not defeat him in the field and that it was more likely to end the war. In regard to each engagement Sherman does not waffle or generalise. He argues about each engagment and produces the casualtie figures to explain if he won or lost or how things went.Whilst not a narrative which keeps you spellbound it is a history which allows you to see how the civil war was fought. From that point of view a fascinating read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of General William T. Sherman","review":"This book is probably the most fasinating biography I have read. Sherman was an talented outsider whose abilty won the civil war. The book begins with Shermans early military career and civilain life before the civil war. Sherman crisscrosses the content to support his family and becomes a Dean of students, a surveyor, a banker, a rail road man and a partener in a law firm. All these skills and travels blend together to make a master stragist and leader.Sherman was a man always moving to survive. His plan of attack was to move quickly to destroy property and save lives of his men as well as those of the enemy. He stood for loyality and a chain of command, yet was willing to congole the president and U S Grant into allowing him to march through Goergia and the Carolinas while living off the land.This is an analytical story of stragidty and passionate story of a man who was unwilling to slaughter men and instead destroyed the means to war.All war is hell.

Please give it a try."},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Second Movement","review":"This volume contains the second three novels of Anthony Powell's masterpiece, A Dance to the Music of Time. Readers coming to this series for the first time should start with the first volume. Powell's work is social comedy in the tradition of Jane Austen and George Meredith. Contemporary writers with whom he is often compared include Marcel Proust and Evelyn Waugh. The 12 short novels of A Dance to the Music of Time give a panoramic picture of English upper-class social life from 1921 to 1971 that is both intensely realistic and amazingly funny. Readers either love Powell's work or can't understand what others see in it. My own opinion is that Dance is the best novel written in the twentieth century. Others share this view: A Dance to the Music of Time is #43 on the recently constructed Random House/Modern Library 100 Best Poll (of twentieth century fiction) and was made into a 4-part miniseries on British television just about a year ago."},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Second Movement","review":"_A Dance to the Music of Time_ is an extremely absorbing and well-crafted novel (composed of 12 smaller novels). Its subject is the decline of the English upper classes from the First World War to about 1970, a decline seen is inevitable and probably necessary, but somehow also regrettable.Such a description might make the novel seem stuffy, but it is not. _A Dance to the Music of Time_ is at times very funny indeed, and always interesting. always involving. It features an enormous cast of characters, and Powell has the remarkable ability to make his characters memorable with the briefest of descriptions. In addition, Powell's prose is addictive: very characteristic, idiosyncratic, and elegant.The long novel follows the life of the narrator, Nicholas Jenkins, from his time at Eton just after World War I to retirement in the English countryside in the late '60s. But Jenkins, though the narrator, is in many ways not the most important character. The comic villain Widmerpool, a creature of pure will, and awkward malevolence, is the other fulcrum around which the novel pivots.This second volume of the University of Chicago's beautiful trade paperback editions features books 4, 5 and 6 of the novel series. _At Lady Molly's_ is centered around the eccentric title character and her parties, as well as such other characters as her eccentric husband, Ted Jeavons, and even Nick Jenkins' wife-to-be, Isobel. _Casanova's Chinese Restaurant_ opens with a bravura prose set-piece of flashback within flashback, and deals with Jenkins' great friend the composer Hugh Moreland, and with the tragically unhappily married critic Maclintick. The subject of the novel is marriage. The last novel in this book is _The Kindly Ones_, which deals with the coming of World War II. It begins with a flashback to 1914, as the First World War breaks out and impinges on Jenkins' childhood, then continues in the late '30s as Europe heads again into war."},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Second Movement","review":"\\"A Dance to the Music of Time\\" is one of the great glories of twentieth century English literature, a sharply observed, highly literate, disturbingly entertaining series, originally published in twelve volumes, by British author Anthony Powell. It has since been collected into four mega-volumes, called movements, by its publisher. The second movement consists of three of the original novels: \\"At Lady Molly's,\\" \\"Casanova's Chinese Restaurant,\\" and \\"The Kindly Ones.\\"\\"At Lady Molly's\\" is set in the ferment that was pre World War II London. The war was noticeably casting its shadow forward: people were concerned about happenings in Germany and Spain, and were highly-politicized - never before or since has London seen so many self-proclaimed Communists. But Nick Jenkins, our narrator, is young and handsome, working as a screen writer in the nascent British film industry, and having a good time, as are most of his friends. Their lives are highly sexualized: in the frantic gaiety of the time, they're busy running off with other people's husbands, wives, and sheep, for all I know. Nick will meet the girl of his dreams at Lady Molly's. Widmerpool is continuing his irresistible climb to fame and power. It's one of the funniest of the books, and has some of its author's best-known witticisms, as when one character says to another, \\"Women may show some discrimination about whom they sleep with, but they'll marry anybody.\\"\\"Casanova's Chinese Restaurant,\\" finds Jenkins mingling with London's artistic and musical crowds, enjoying the life of a young married. People are off to fight in Spain and see firsthand what the Japanese are up to in China. And Widmerpool: well, in \\"Lady Molly's,\\" Jenkins muses, \\"I had always felt an interest in what might be called the theoretical side of Widmerpool's life: the reaction of his own emotions to the severe rule of ambition that he had from the beginning imposed upon himself: the determination that existence must be governed by the will.\\" He rises, still.In \\"The Kindly Ones,\\" the war has begun, but is yet still phony, as they called it: people have hung blackout curtains, but are still arguing about the Hitler-Stalin non-aggression pact. One character muses, \\"The Kaiser went to war for shame of his withered arm. Hitler will go to war because at official receptions the tails of his evening coat sweep the floor like a clown's.\\" The book opens on a flashback to Jenkins' pre World War I army childhood, and a glance at the extraordinary number of British lives claimed by that particularly bloodthirsty war. It also gives us an often-quoted discussion of \\"the kindly ones:\\" \\"....the Greeks, because they so greatly feared the Furies, had named them the Eumenides - the Kindly Ones - flattery intended to appease their terrible wrath.\\" The attentive reader must assume we will see the Furies - the Eumenides, if you prefer --at work in the third movement of the series, devoted to life during the very real war to come."},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Second Movement","review":"There are two hazards in reading Powell's A Dance to the Music of Time (12 books in 4 volumes or &quot;Movements). First, you may be too bored to continue (so buy only the first volume to start). &quot;Nothing&quot; happens in the first two volumes I've read. Fans of action, suspense, romance, light, or even historical novels may be most unhappy with this series. For the many characters living through the 1920's and '30's described in the first two movements, life is an endless round of parties and conversations over food, through which the characters, in ever mutating combinations, drift while insightfully discussing each other. In a sense this is high-brow and high-toned soap opera. Only in Book 6, as World War II impinges on the characters, does an outside structure of events impose itself on the actions and reactions of the characters. Previously they have seemed largely to float in an hermetically sealed world of university-educated gentlemen and their women (mothers, wives, and ex-wives). In this upper class void no chronological dates are supplied, although if you are an octogenerian the names dropped may supply a framework to the intricate sets of flashbacks and occasional anticipations Powell employs. We learn much about the main characters, but rarely see them at work or play, and never domestically or with children.The second hazard is that you may be forever spoiled for reading anything less well crafted. The next author you read after Powell may seem shallow, simplistic, juvenile, obvious, crude, banal, overheated, or even vulgar. Powell's writing is objective, distanced, understated, intricate, subtle, acute, and highly precise; the apotheosis of ordinary detail. Powell's strength lies in closely observed and particularized character development, our understanding of each person altering slightly from one vignette, glimpse, or reference to the next. Allegedly a masterpiece of comedic writing, &quot;Dance&quot; is not, however, funny, farcical, or obviously, satirical. I really think it takes an English person to see and enjoy fully the comedy of manners I sense behind the prose. I felt I was always on the outside, vaguely aware that people might be not quite right, or &quot;dotty,&quot; except for one passage in Book 5 where I laughed out loud. I probably need an &quot;Annotated Powell.&quot;You can see I'm deeply conflicted about this series: it is marvelously well-written yet I am not well entertained. An honest reviewer admitted that Powell &quot;evokes a wry poetry from drabness and boredom.&quot; It took me 5 years to finish the first Movement, and dogged determination to read the next, and still I want to read one more! Just not immediately."},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Second Movement","review":"The notion that \\"nothing happens\\" in A Dance to the Music of Time: Second Movement, is preposterous. True, there are no car chases, murders or coup d'etat. If that is what you insist upon from fiction, these books are definitely not for you. But plenty else is happening. People you met in the first three novels are growing up. Some are finding spouses, some divorcing them. A few are succeeding terrifically. A number are floundering or worse. The \\"Slump\\" (aka The Great Depression) continues unabated and continues to take its toll upon the upper-middle and upper classes. And Poussin's classical painting of the eponymous title and its depiction of unchanging grace and beauty seems increasingly ironic.Again, a triptych of novels (At Lady Molly's, Casanova's Chinese Restaurant and The Kindly Ones) depicts Powell's late 1930s. Nick Jenkins, hero and narrator, has moved on to screenwriting and from debutante balls to the more mature haunts of the drawing room. He continues (at first to my dismay--now I am simply resigned to the device) to continually and \\"coincidentally\\" bump into old acquaintances. ALM literally is a laundry list of these run-ins, and told with perfect comic pitch. Widermerpool resurfaces and is as great a buffoon as ever. The buffoon of youth, who seemed so hopeless before is still appallingly clumsy socially-- but successful otherwise. Love affairs that seemed so passionate and exciting have dissipated, and from the outset we are aware that Nick will get himself a wife before long. Why? Because that's what people do.Casanova's Chinese Restaurant is less comic. More a meditation on art, relationships and trying to find happiness. In my opinion it is the best in the series thus far realistically and plaintively depicting that ache of first love and the subsequent disenchantment that inevitably follows. The composer Moreland is depicted from the first stages of infatuation to the brink of an affair that could reck his marriage. What he decides and why is beautifully wrought. Jenkins's in-laws provide the comic relief in this volume, but here Powell is happier to stay focused on the more serious. The aside of Erridge going off to the Spanish Civil War anchors us in time, provides some amusing remarks about Lefties but doesn't really create concern for his fate. The focus stays on the Moreland marriage throughout with an ending that is and is not surprising. Very well done, indeed.The Kindly Ones abandons the melancholic for Powell's more jocular tone. Indeed the first chapter is one of the best send-ups of English Uppper Class life I have ever read. Quite hilarious and btw the only glimpse in six novels of Nick Jenkins's parents or his childhood. The comic tone is a bit \\"now or never\\" as we are teetering upon the onset of WWII. There won't be much to laugh at for years to come. The Kindly Ones though is no misnomer-- it's the name the ancient Greeks gave to the Furies, the bringers of disease, war and strife. And TKO does the same. It brings us to the beginning of the end--when empire and centuries' old ways are all threatened. We know it will all be swept away--the only question of course is how it affects the dozens of people we have met thus far in these splendid novels."},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Second Movement","review":"I shall begin this review with employing the caveat with which I embarked upon my review of the First Movement: This is only a review of this movement, not the entire opus. That's the way they were printed, and that's the way I shall review it.....Amen....Ahem, more to the point, I haven't read the other two yet.Thank whatever powers that be for the third book in this movement, The Kindly Ones---a translation of the Greek Eumenides, a euphemism, as related to us by Nicholas Jenkins in his recollections of Stonehurst, the home where he lived as a boy until the advent of WWI, used by the Greeks for The Furies, so terrified were they of naming them properly aloud. The significance of this particular book is not, to my mind, that the outer world starts to obtrude into the \\"hermetically sealed\\" life of the characters, as one reviewer has put it. It's rather that Nicholas Jenkins, our narrator, finally starts to display feelings of his own. He is no longer the detached cypher of the first movement.In retrospect, one can see that this \\"coming out\\" as it were of Jenkins has been slowly developing through all three books of this movement. But it is only in The Kindly Ones that he emerges from his chrysalis.Deeper themes abound, of course. Upon taking leave of General Conyers during a private tte-&agrave;-tte in which the General provides a quite rum venture into the psychoanalysis of Widmerpool, Jenkins describes it thus:\\"The change in his voice announced that our fantasy life together was over. We had returned to the world of everyday things. Perhaps it would be truer to say that our real life together was over, and we returned to the world of fantasy. Who can say?\\"Who indeed?I shall ponder such things as I begin to turn the pages of the third movement and The Furies descend across Europe."},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Second Movement","review":"Like the classical music to which the title alludes, the Second Movement of Anthony Powell's four movement, twelve part \\"A Dance to the Music of Time\\" builds upon the themes and ideas introduced in the first movement while not only introducing new concepts and characters, but also laying the groundwork for what is to come in the final two movements.While the first movement confined narrator Nick Jenkins world to the same eccentric (but large) set of friends and acquaintances, essentially limiting his world to the people we met in the first of its three parts, the second movement begins with a whole new set of people and personalities. The names are unfamiliar and the writing- mirroring the feeling of the times in which the book is set- is darker and not as frivolous. Europe is dealing with the rise of Hitler and the hedonistic living of the twenties is giving way to a more psychoanalytical and serious thirties. As a result, the fourth book (the first part of the second movement) feels as if it were a part of a different collection altogether. This changes once Nick encounters friends from the past- Stringham, Templar, and, of course, Widmerpool- and this mingling of his past with his present takes the book to a new level of humor and complexity.With the fifth book, Powell again confounds the reader by providing the first lengthy flashback of the series, an encounter and lengthy description of a long time friend who we had yet to meet. This friend allows us to catch up with Nick's own life- now married and quite successful in his own writing- by contrasting the marital complacency of Nick with the marital strife and chaos of this and other friends.By the time the sixth book arrives, the tone of the movement has become quite serious, as England is now on the brink of war and the lives and loves of those around Nick has began to crumble. Discussions about psychology and existentialism are taking over the conversations, and the lighthearted banter of the first movement (as spoken by twenty-somethings) has given way to weighty discussions about the meaning of life (as argued by rapidly aging thirty-somethings).Over the course of 700 pages, Anthony Powell has slowly transformed \\"A Dance to the Music of Time\\" from a slightly frivolous story about hedonistic English youth to a more somber tale of English adults approaching middle age. The writing, the humor, the characters, the slow yet engaging pace are each expertly executed, and when all is said and done, the stage is set for what looks to be an even more exciting and engaging third movement.If you read the first movement and enjoyed it, then the second movement should continue to thrill you."},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Second Movement","review":"\\"A Dance to the Music of Time\\" is Anthony Powell's sequences of twelve novels which follow the narrator Nicholas Jenkins and his social circle from youth in the period following World War I to old age and death in the 1970s. Jenkins' reminisces are inspired by Poussin's classic painting where the four Seasons dance with arms linked, and this second trio of novels do represent the summer of life. AT LADY MOLLY'S, CASANOVA'S CHINESE RESTAURANT and THE KINDLY ONES cover the period From 1934 to 1939. We see Jenkins settling into marriage, other characters divorcing and embarking on fiery second marriages, and yet more characters unable either from failure or unrelenting ambition to establish their comfortable niche in life.We continue to mainly inhabit upper-class drawing rooms and dinner parties. The tumultuous political events of 1930s Europe are only alluded to, and the characters who are caught up in the Spanish Civil War or appeasing Hitler do it offstage. Still, the plot continued to hold my interest, for Powell has a gift for depicting various personalities. Jenkins' schoolmates Templer, Stringham and Widmerpool return, and though Widmerpool comes more and more to seem the perverse antagonist of the series, Stringham and Templer fade in and out of Jenkins' life. A great many new characters are introduced, with Jenkins' wife's family, the Tollands, providing much of the drama.I've reviewed the individual novels in the Dance here on Amazon, and if you want more information about each volume, look at those listings. But I will say here that in general I am happy that I pressed ahead with the Dance after the first \\"movement\\". The latter two novels in this part of the sequence are especially finely crafted, and the outbreak of World War II in THE KINDLY ONES put me in such suspense that I felt driven on to the third movement."},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Second Movement","review":"The \\"Second Movement\\" of Anthony Powell's novel, A Dance to the Music of Time, contains three volumes that continue the story of Nicholas Jenkins and his acquaintances and family. The period is between the two World Wars and the setting is London and some parts of the English countryside. At Lady Molly's (1957) focuses on Jenkins' memories of his early childhood and his present experiences with the Tollands, a wide-ranging family with some royal distinction. Like Proust's study of the Guermantes family in In Search of Lost Time, detailed destriptions of Tolland family events with their overt and covert rules of thought and behavior are given by Nick as a mostly passive observer.The second volume, Casanova's Chinese Restaurant (1960), focuses on relationships pre and post marriage and Jenkins' consideration of the nature of love. He begins to see love and marriage as unpredictable aspects of the dance of time. The one consistent factor in relationships is the cycling of interaction with intimates even if years go by between meetings. As time continues after separation, only residual aspects of love remain when people meet again. The memories, though, are still charged with strong time bound emotions.The Kindly Ones (1962) is the final volume of the second movement. It concerns Nick's observations of the frequency of divorce among his friends and family members and how the formerly married individuals get out of step with him and other people. Unlike the feelings associated with relationships that do not lead to marriage, divorce seems to cause the characters to permanently spin out of their former social circles. They can return to the dance to the music of time, but only temporarily and with limited commitment.Powell's epic work continues in the second movement with the same unhurried narrative, with his observer Nick becoming more reliable as he matures. As I indicated in my review of the three novels in the first movement, this is an excellent continuing series and I look forward (with regret for what I will lose) to reading the second half of the saga."},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Second Movement","review":"The reader who picks up the Second Movement of A Dance to the Music of Time might be initially overwhelmed with the fourth novel of the series (At Lady Molly's). Whereas the three novels of the First Movement progressed in a fairly sequential manner and focused on four major characters, At Lady Molly's, the fourth novel of the series, introduces literally dozens of new characters and alludes to old ones probably forgotten by the reader. To complicate matters, the novel begins with a flashback involving characters never encountered before; in the hands of most novelists, this would create a barrier that could never be overcome and ultimately result in a failed work. But Anthony Powell is no average writer and the meticulous care he expended in creating his characters in the First Movement served him well, so that with only the barest character descriptions these shadowy figures slowly re-emerge in the reader's consciousness.And whereas Powell did a masterful job in the First Movement of bringing to life the supporting characters (particularly Kenneth Widmerpool) who interacted with the narrator, Nick Jenkins; he paid only passing attention to Jenkins as a character, using him primarily as a somewhat impartial observer. Recognizing this defect, the author now focuses on Jenkins, providing the reader with background information on his life and family and allowing the reader finally to get to know this character. In the three novels that make up the Second Movement - At Lady Molly's, Casanova's Chinese Restaurant, and The Kindly Ones - it is Jenkins around whom the action spins. We are introduced to his in-laws, the prodigious Tolland family, as well as to the composer, Hugh Moreland, and the music critic, McClintick, as well as witnessing his marriage (although taking place \\"off stage\\" between the fourth and fifth novels) and the birth of a child.As with the First Movement, Powell is more interested in personal interrelations than he is with political matters. The war in Spain and the ominous maneuverings in Germany are mentioned, but only act as background to the spate of failed marriages and relationships, sexual indiscretions, and economic intrigues that make up the majority of the story line. Powell does a fine job of describing the malaise that affected British society prior to the outbreak of war, and gives flesh to some of the absurdity that predominated British pre-war planning in the person of Widmerpool, who now appears in the role of a Territorial officer who is more interested in the practical effects of a military uniform and his own self-aggrandizement, than he is motivated by any powerful patriotic drive.Some readers will be put off by Powell's overly contrived meetings between his characters. It seems that Nick Jenkins cannot go anywhere unless he happens to run into an acquaintance or two with whom he carries on lenghty conversations. The best example of this is the meeting between Jenkins, Widmerpool and Hugh Moreland at the maternity hospital in which Jenkins' wife is recovering from a miscarriage, a meeting void of genuineness and contrived solely for the author's convenience. However, Powell can be forgiven these indiscretions as it is through these conversations that the reader becomes intimately acquainted with each of the characters; so acquainted, in fact, that by the end of Powell's sixth novel, one is unsure whether or not these characters actually existed."},{"Title":"Eternal Improv: A Memoir","review":"I am never sure whether to laugh or cry but I can't get enough of her writing.

Forever The Wild Mare is an engrossing story of a young student's encounter at the National Zoo with a Mongolian horse. Unfamiliar with this wild but lovely animal he sets out to discover all he can about its origins and along the way learns about Central Asia, Buddhism, our United Staes Senate, and the pleasures of living with nature and animals.This is indeed a captivating tale and the next time someone asks you to recommend something to read you will immediately say, \\"Read Forever The Wild Mare, its terrific and timely. You will just love it!\\""},{"Title":"Forever the Wild Mare","review":"Forever the Wild Mare is an unforgettable, beautifully written coming-of-age story of a young boy's love for a wild horse. Set in Washington, D.C. in the early 60's, Ann Cottrell Free's deft, lively writing grabs the reader from the first page and doesn't let go until the last. Jebby, the main character, a fourteen-year-old newcomer to Washington from the hills of Virginia, is the son of a single mother who has moved to the city to seek a better life for her son. His daily trips to the National Zoo soon find him obsessed with one of the last Mongolian horses in captivity. A richly-layered plot quickly places the sensitive, searching Jebby in entanglements with middle-school bullies, along with encounters with a brilliant old Scotsman, a Tibetan Lama, and an assertive young classmate named Katie, who happens to be a senator's daughter. Skillfully woven into the narrative are fascinating excursions into the history of the Mongolian wild horse, senate committee hearings on adolescent gangs, and the story of wild animals in captivity from American frontier times to the ancient world of Genghis Khan in Central Asia. Lessons on the fragility of nature and the tenets of Buddhism are also intertwined seamlessly into the narrative. The cosmopolitan aspects of life in the nation's capital are captured easily and with an insider's friendly, in-the-moment tone. But the passion of Jebby for Isabella, the wild horse, and the life lessons he learns in struggling to understand her, lie at the heart of this amazing book. A true classic, written by an author ahead of her time in her concern for the preservation of wild places and the animals who inhabit them. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Looking for Trouble","review":"General Sir Peter De La Billi&egrave;re ranks amongst the greatest of post-World War Two British military commanders. He served in every conflict from Korea to the first Gulf War and ended that career as a full General with two Knighthoods (Knight Commander of the Bath and Knight Commander of the British Empire - the latter of which superseded the CBE awarded previously) a DSO, two MCs and a Legion of Merit. He was in charge of the British special forces who so successfully stormed the Iranian Embassy in London in 1980 bringing swiftly to an end that very public siege. In 1990 he was the British Forces commander under General Norman Schwarzkopf in the first Gulf War. It is interesting to note that he failed Staff College (a pre-requisite qualification for higher military office.) at his first attempt.In this book, which has caused something of another storm - if only because the SAS do not like people writing about their activities (especially former members of the Regiment), the General tells it exactly as it was. As another reviewer said \\"it should be essential reading for anyone seeking to lead people\\" - and not just military personnel.Leadership and responsibility are, by their very nature stressful activities - especially for those who care. Whilst not wishing to belittle - in any way whatsoever!, the stress associated with civilian occupations, stress under fire is probably the greatest stress of all. As General Norman Schwarzkopf said when being interviewed on television; \\"It doesn't take a hero to order men to their deaths!\\" It was that single statement which revealed \\"his\\" own caring nature.Of course, there was a time when British (and other) generals did order men to their deaths in their hundreds of thousands. Today, that particular carnage is remembered as the trench warfare of the First World War. From this book, we are able to learn and understand the intricacies, professionalism and technical detail of how the SAS approach specific problems, how they deal with matters - even those which do not require soldiers operating in covert situations, and, in so doing, we learn how being a general has evolved since those unforgivable times of 90 years ago.Having once been attached to the SAS, I can certainly say that no state secrets are betrayed here. Instead we have an understanding of how and why certain people, with a certain background, adopt a very different approach to certain problems. It's all in the training, it's all a matter of understanding the principles involved and when those leaders of people from non-military occupations read this book, they too will begin to understand the very concept of leadership itself.I thoroughly recommend this book. It is written by a great man who will always prefer the background to the spotlight for that is his nature.NMRetired British Army Major"},{"Title":"Blue Heaven: Manchester City's Greatest Games","review":"You may think this will be a thick book to cover the massive history of such a great club. You are right, it is massive. It was great to relive the glory days of man city. Each match has been lovingly recorded in black and white by Ian Penney.This book covers it all. The electric European ties at Cardiff, Wrexham and Dublin. It features the derby games against Macclesfield. It features the wonderful skill's of Bell, Lee and Summerbee playing on the massive pitch, under massive floodlights. These were the days when Manchester was the Milan of England.I look forward to seeing a reprint of this book to capture the more recent past including the glorious 2001-2002 season and promotion back to the Premier league.

A brilliant, intense, and persuasively argued study, Popes and Politics covers a range of critical topics, including a thorough re-assessment of Pope Pius XII, the incorporation of Shoah into Catholicism, debate over German and Israeli \\"revisionist histories\\" and more. Popes And Politics is high recommended as an inherently engaging and informative study, and a seminal contribution to Papal Studies and Holocaust Studies supplemental reading lists and academic reference collections."},{"Title":"Popes and Politics: Reform, Resentment, and the Holocaust (Handbooks of Catholic Theology)","review":"Lawler's impressive scholarly detailing guides even those unfamiliar with the theology of the papacy through a series of reviews which focus in part on the difficult period of the Holocaust. While Lawler has constructed a carefully developed argument that responds to recent popular analyses of the papacy, the greatest value of his POPES AND POLITICS rests in his propositions for reform. He provides the meditative direction for necessary change in the future by moving away from the easy, \\"admire nothing,\\" fadist papal criticism of many theological commentators; and he offers paradigms which will allow the contemporary church to realize the lasting role of the papacy. With wit and comprehensive scholarship, Lawler can always be counted on to awaken and provoke thought in all but the most dead-minded readers."},{"Title":"Popes and Politics: Reform, Resentment, and the Holocaust (Handbooks of Catholic Theology)","review":"Lawler has impeccable credentials as a liberal Catholic and a scholar who is concerned with the reform and renewal of the Catholic Church. In this book, he takes on fashionable writers such as Gary Wills and James Carroll for the sake of real scholarship and real reform. He shreds the pretensions to sound scholarship of these and some others popular in the press. Citing not only their mistakes as &quot;researchers&quot;, he decries the ideology that has led to the poor history and analysis. Besides this kind of demolition, he proposes models such as Cardinal Newman and Cardinal Congar as alternatives to the media centered sound bites feeding &quot;papaphobia&quot;. The second to last chapter on the spirituality necessary for patient and enduring reform I found especially helpful."},{"Title":"Popes and Politics: Reform, Resentment, and the Holocaust (Handbooks of Catholic Theology)","review":"Lawler's subject is timely and could have been an important contribution to the Pope-Holocaust debate. But he blew it. His writing is offputting and inaccessible to most. He seems more interested in parading his erudition than enlightening his readers. It's a poorly organized, convoluted slog through obscure allusions and flat attempts to be clever. Even William Buckley would give up on it. I'm sure he has something worthwhile to say on a subject vital to many of us. As I might once have told my english students: Read E.B. White's \\"Elements of Style\\" and start over."},{"Title":"Traditional Palestinian Embroidery and Jewelry","review":"Traditional Palestinian Embroidery and Jewelry by Abed Al-Samih has text in both English and Arabic. The book is read from right to left, Arabic fashion. It is one, of the two, most informative books on Palestinian costume.The greatest asset of this book is that the dresses are shown on models, with the appropriate head coverings, face veils, and jewelry, both village and Bedouin (Bedu) styles. A number of the dresses shown are unique to this book, which adds immeasurably to the amount of information available on the topic of Palestinian costume. Seeing the dresses being worn is much more helpful to the collector or costumer, than simply seeing the them laid out flat in a museum display.The book also shows an excellent example of the Bedouin version of the wuqayat al-darahim, (money hat), worn by brides. The hat is both modeled, and displayed on a stand.Two of the other three books on Palestinian costume show only the village version of the money hat, and the third. by Jehan Rajab, shows the village money hat, and a very poor example of the style which she states was \\"reputedly worn by the Bedu at weddings.\\"Traditional Palestinian Embroidery and Jewelry beautifully complements Palestinian Costume by Shelagh Weir,which is the second of the two most informative books on the topic.The remaining two books on the topic are Palestinian Costume and Jewelry by Y.K. Stillman, and Palestinian Costume by Jehan Rahab. Stillman's book, while very informative, suffers from the fact that many of the photos are in black and white. This fact constitutes a major defect when the photo is of a white dress against a near-white back ground. The dress virtually disappears."},{"Title":"The Coercive Utopians: Social Deception by America's Power Players","review":"However anarchical their rhetoric, triumphant socialists unfailingly turn totalitarian. This is the message of The Coercive Utopians: Social Deception by America's Power Players, by Rael Jean Isaac and Erich Isaac (Chicago: Regnery Gateway, c. 1983). They argue that \\"utopianism, by its inherent logic, leads to coercion\\" (p. 8). The book comes commended by one of America's preeminent philosophers, Sidney Hook, who said: \\"I have rarely read a book which has contained such challenging information, and which raises so many troubling questions about the good will and bona fides of many organizations soliciting public support. The Isaacs' book should be read by all intelligent laymen who are active in public affairs.\\"Illustrating one of the facts that elicited Hook's alarm was a 1980 decision of the General Conference of the Methodist Church to financially support communist regimes in Cuba and Vietnam as well as the PLO. Aligned with the National Council of Churches, which encouraged its functionaries to disguise how the organization's funds were spent, the Methodists were simply one of the mainline denominations supporting Marxist movements that promised to inaugurate perfect societies. To one Methodist spokesman, the church's mission was to establish \\"'solidarity with the poor and the powerless'\\" (p. 20). Church delegations visited Cuba and inevitably found what they hoped for--a wonderful, egalitarian society. Other representatives visited Vietnam and wrote glowing reports of the communist transformation taking place following the war. They found grounds for praising Pol Pot's movement in Cambodia and gave financial support to Robert Mugabe as he began his brutal rule in Zimbabwe.Linking arms with radical religionists, environmental utopians sought to restore the planet to a pristine \\"Mother Earth\\" condition. With Earth Day in 1970 the environmental movement began to shape the nation's consciousness, prodding Congress to pass laws designed to \\"produce the perfect environment\\" (p. 49). To get clean air and water, to protect endangered species, to banish toxics of all sorts, became morally obligatory and justified a massive expenditure of public funds. Yet \\"no reasonable standards satisfy the perfection-seeking environmental organizations\\" (p. 56) and laws passed decades ago are now used to restrict personal liberties in unimagined ways. \\"The distinguished sociologist and historian of ideas Robert Nisbet sees environmentalism as a revolutionary social movement. Indeed Nisbet sees it as potentially the third great social movement of Western civilization after Christianity and socialism, and one, ironically, that strikes at the roots of that civilization. If environmentalists as such do not \`hate the system' they hate what is vital to the system--the development of energy sources, with the most environmentally benign source, nuclear energy, assuming a literally demonic character. Nisbet sees the reason for the movement's fascination with the sun as \`a form of spiritual purification, for there is a renascent primitivism in the envioronmentalist's characteristic approach to life'\\" (p. 60).Though a concern for the environment had shaped an earlier \\"conservationism,\\" the movement that emerged in the \`70s was largely guided by the New Left. Its sacred texts included Rachel Carson's Silent Spring and E.F. Schumacher's Small Is Beautiful. Its causes included the banning of DDT and nuclear power, despite the utter lack of hard evidence that they threatened anything. The environmentalist agenda, promoted by powerful groups such as the Sierra Club, successfully promoted a \\"utopian campaign against modern technology\\" (p. 70) that prevailed politically, despite counterfactual realities.The environmentalists' disdain for Western civilization was amplified by anti-American advocates in utopian think tanks such as the Institute for Policy Studies, which endeavored to destroy \\"public belief in the virtues of key American institutions, particularly those crucial to maintaining American power and influence in the world. An image of the United States is constructed as a rapacious imperial villain, the greatest single threat to the world's peace and prosperity\\" (p. 108). To make their case, they camouflaged their presentations under the guise of seeking \\"to preserve traditional American values and institutions\\" (p. 109). Thus Derek Shearer, an IPS representative, confessed that because it was imprudent to \\"'use the \\"S\\" word [socialism] too effectively in American politics, we have found that in the greatest tradition of American advertising the word \\"economic democracy\\" sells'\\" (p. 131). Such folks also claimed to identify with the \\"workers\\" whose welfare they championed. In fact, however, they harbored \\"'a tremendous elitist contempt for ordinary Americans, hatred of blue collar Americans because they weren't revolutionaries, contempt for them because they didn't want to smash and destroy, contempt for their pastimes, contempt for their marriages, contempt because they were Americans. Yet these elitists wanted to take that away from them, smash it, set up a system based on China or Cuba or Vietnam or Tanzania'\\" (p. 135). Equally counterfeit was the pacifism espoused by many of the radicals. Jonathan Schell's The Fate of the Earth elicited fanatical fever within \\"peace\\" movements such as Clergy and Laity Concerned. Such pacifism, however, was largely a guise of anti-American tirades and generally followed dictates from Moscow, mediated through compliant popular front organizations.Environmental organizations, along with other utopian groups, skillfully learned to \\"subvert the constitutional arrangements of the country\\" by infiltrating and manipulating governmental bureaucracies such as the EPA (p. 221). Here they saw themselves (though never elected by anyone) as \\"executors of the will of \`the people' as they intuitively understand it. Utopian bureaucrats thus feel free to reshape, circumvent and disregard the laws they are assigned to administer\\" (p. 222). This took place quickly under President Jimmy Carter, who allowed the Natural Resources Defense Council to effectively set the coal leasing agenda for the Department of the Interior. Federal monies flowed into various \\"alternative energy\\" schemes, many of which proved wastefully utopian. Even more gratuitously, the Legal Services Corporation has \\"consistently defied its Congressional mandate\\" (p. 234) and taken upon itself the task of reforming American society (as well as providing a comfortable income for thousands of lawyers). Taking money from the government, these lawyer-bureaucrats sought (always in the name of \\"social justice\\") to undermine it through class action suits designed to destroy industries they disliked! As one of the presidents of the National Lawyers Guild declared, as reformers within the system they espoused \\"anti-racism, anti-sexism, anti-capitalism and anti-imperialism\\" (p. 238).Much of this activity goes unnoticed because the media, enamored with environmentalism and hostile to big business, acts \\"as a filter, screening out most of the information that could damage the utopians in the public view\\" (p. 251). Consequently, the nuclear power industry has been consistently misrepresented by journalists determined to destroy it. When government officials pled for stronger defense policies, TV personalities such as Walter Cronkite dismissed them as alarmists. Few Americans heard of the genocide in Cambodia, as horrific as Hitler's holocaust, because it would have questioned the rectitutde of those who had opposed the Vietnam War. While millions died in Cambodia, the New York Times and Washington Post saw fit to mention it a total of 13 times in 1976! The next year, when the slaughter reached its zenith, America's TV networks noted Pol Pot's slaughter three times--and NBC said nothing at all. The networks were able, however, to devote 159 reports to human rights violations in South Africa. Shameful though it was, such media bias elicited no shame in journalistic circles. (Indeed, as the 2008 election showed, the media now sees itself as cheerleaders for the causes they support.)"},{"Title":"The Coercive Utopians: Social Deception by America's Power Players","review":"At first glance, you might think this book is &quot;dated&quot; - it looks old. Not many pages into it, though, you realize exactly how it retains its accuracy.A good American Christian might wonder why all his donations to the little white church on his corner seem to wind up financing another diatribe about the evils of American society, culture, and free market economics - while supporting radical revolutionary &quot;workers paradises&quot; from which the workers are fleeing in droves. He might wonder more why those diatribes and those sentiments of support for generic-Shining Path marxists come from his ostensibly &quot;religious&quot; leaders.This work lays out the &quot;who&quot; - but not necessarily the &quot;why.&quot; Knowing who is important - because good American Christians who think they are doing the right thing by supporting the National Council of Churches are being profoundly deceived. And the NCC is only one example; the Isaacs name many more names.If you choose to support violent left-wing revolutionaries, that's your choice.

The names of these modern utopians are names like Hitler, Stalin, Lenin, Roosevelt, Mao, the Kennedys, the Clintons, and now Obama.

A story ,until now, only found in scattered newspaper articles, memoirs, diarys, official records, and brief spotlight accounts.James McLean has scoured the available information for the past twenty years to produce a most complete and un-whitewashed account of the service,from concept to muster out,of these brave and able Bear Flaggers. His detailed research leads us from campaign to campaign outlining every move of the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry Regiment with detail from command down to personal insight from the troopers themselves. Along the way we meet many luminaries such as Col. John S. Mosby and boy General George Armstrong Custer both of whom's popular romantic shine does not glow as well under the objective light provided by Mr McLeans research.Other Personalities such as General Phillip Sheridan, Col. Charles Russell Lowell, L.T Col. Caspar Crowinshield, Maj. Gen. Henry Halleck , Gen. Richard S Ewell, Lt. Gen Jubal Early, and a host of others all take their turn under this able historians pen. The end result being a finely researched piece of true history unmassaged by the romantic fog of time.A must read for Californians and American Civil War enthusiasts alike. This is an almost epic story of California's most determined patriotic troopers and their adventures from San Francisco to Appomattox. Having researched this same group of Californian Troopers for the past ten years I was ,at times, amazed at the depth of his research as he mentions things about unit details I previously thought only I knew!! A very fine treatment of a much over looked group of American Heros, the California Hundred and Battalion ."},{"Title":"California Sabers: The 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry in the Civil War","review":"I am doing research on Confederate partisan leader, John Singleton Mosby and bought this book because of Mosby's involvement with the 2nd Massachusetts in Northern Virginia. Naturally, I accessed Mr. McLean's numerous references to the man first - for interest's sake - and discovered that in many instances, either his scholarship or his objectiveness was sadly lacking. Indeed, his negative feelings about Mosby appeared to have influenced the matter to the detriment of simple truth.Furthermore, some of the things he presented - had they been true - would have 'changed history', so to speak. For instance, in his reference to Mosby's shooting of a fellow student ('supposedly in self defense', itself a rather subjective comment for a 'supposedly' historical tome), McLean states that Mosby was 'tried and sentenced to prison..' Mosby went to jail, not prison. He was found guilty of a misdemeanor, not a felony. Had he been convicted of a felony, Mosby would never have become a Confederate officer so in that context, McLean's assertions are refuted by his own scholarship - i.e. Mosby was a Confederate officer.McLean then states that 'His family's connections and political influence got him a pardon after he had served only seven months...' Untrue! Mosby served nine months of a twelve month sentence. His family tried to get him pardoned earlier, but the Governor refused. Finally, after petitions from numerous citizens and after it was discovered that one of the jurors had a grudge against the boy's father and after two prominent physicians wrote that the boy was 'constitutionally consumptive' and further imprisonment would imperil his life, the Governor relented and released him. Hardly an act of political power on the part of Mosby's family.Insofar as the matter of the hanging of Union troops of Powell and Custer in retaliation for the hanging and shooting of six of Mosby's men in Front Royal: Mr. McLean again fails the test of scholarship. Mosby did NOT act in 'revenge'. When several of the condemned managed to escape (to the great relief of the Rangers and Mosby himself!), he did not replace them, but rather stated that he was glad that they got away so that they might carry the message to Sheridan. Unfortunately, McLean did not see fit to include the letter Mosby wrote to Sheridan which put an end to the cycle of hanging. Of course, had he done so, his own conclusions would have been rendered void.McLean then states that the drummer boy who had drawn one of the condemned lots was spared by one of Mosby's subordinates. Untrue! Mosby, when told that they boy had drawn one of the lots, went to him, took the paper from his hand, dropped it back in the hat and told the remaining men to 'draw again'. This has been substantiated by the fact that the boy himself when he was being repatriated, saw Mosby on the ship and ran and hugged him in gratitude. After the war, Mosby received a silver headed cane with a message that it was from 'the drummer boy'. These acts as well as the fact that many of Mosby's best friends after the war were men who had come under his hand as prisoners, reveal a very different Mosby than McLean would have us believe.And there are other instances where McLean intimates that Mosby lied in stating he had a greater effect that he actually did. Unfortunately, he uses the dispatches of Union officers to verify that statement, dispatches that other historians have proven to be themselves mendacious. Frequently officers who came against Mosby lied in their reports regarding how much damage he did, how many men he had and how much damage they did to him. Mosby stated that if he had all the men that they said he had and lost as many as they said he did at their hands, he would have had a larger army than Lee!The problem with all of this is that either Mr. McLean has allowed his personal dislike of this particular subject to color his scholarship or he has indulged in slipshod scholarship. Either way, it makes the reader pause when considering just how accurate the rest of the book may be."},{"Title":"California Sabers: The 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry in the Civil War","review":"A useful, highly detailed account of the troops, some of whom were from California, who made up the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry, and their actions during the Civil War. They did much of their fighting in the Valley Campaign of '64, and those battles are described at length.The writing here may be a bit too dry for amateurs. I had two major criticisms:As a Californian, I wanted to know more about where in the state the men came from. Normally, in a history of a unit, one gets a roster with places of origin, peactime occupation, where enlisted, how dismissed and so forth. This information would have been interesting to me.Secondly, the author is not to be trusted blindly on matters outside his specific topic. Especially, his statements on prisons and the treatment of prisoners should be qualified by examination of other texts (&quot;Portals to Hell&quot; is a decent secondary source). As befits a historian of a Unionist regiment, he is of clear Unionist sympathies and while I don't think he forsakes scholarly objectivity too badly, readers wanting to learn more about Mosby, the regiment's primary antagonist, will want to look at other sources as well.Though flawed, this book still will prove invaluable for anyone curious about Californians in the Civil War."},{"Title":"California Sabers: The 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry in the Civil War","review":"Good history on anyone with an interest in the 2nd Mass. cavalry or the Civil War in Northern VA.

Leadville, Colorado is home to &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot;, of Titanic fame, and of the lesser known, but very interesting Baby Doe Tabor. Ms. Tabor was born in Wisconsin and travelled to Colorado with her first husband during the silver rush. After her husband abandoned her, she took her fate into her own hands -- in at brave and pretty respectable way for a lady of the era -- and what happens after that has become legend. Ms. Bancroft's book is an interesting, if subjective, portrayal of Baby Doe Tabor.

The alien-turned-handler finds the tables turned on him as he realizes he has created an intellect and power superior to his own mind and technology. I first read this book when I was 15 and for years found it not even listed in Laumer's biblio. I would recommend locating this book for any Laumer fan due to its rarity, and definitely loan it to any avid sci-fi middle schooler."},{"Title":"Ultimax Man","review":"The other reviewers have provided good synopses of this book. I had the curse of reading the first half in Analog, where it went by the title \\"The Wonderful Secret.\\" The serial version ended with Dammy stealing the space vehicle to head out to the stars. Years later, when I finally read the entire book, I was disappointed that the second half really did not go anywhere, and I also found the stream-of-consciousness narration difficult to follow. Overall, an interesting book, with a humanistic premise that we're all capable of being the best in the Galaxy (or at least \\"Class 2, Special\\") and capable of kicking anyone's tail feathers who messes with us."},{"Title":"Ultimax Man","review":"In The Ultimax Man, an alien abducts a common criminal for an experiment - to imbue him with all of the knowledge and skills of human history...to make him a true superman; the Ultimax Man. But, once our hero reaches the pinnacle of all of this knowledge and all of these skills, what next? He breaks the bonds of his creator and sets himself free in search of where to go from here.This is an interesting story that is better at getting to the third act than finding a satisfying ending to our character's story. As another reviewer put it, once he is free it is all down hill from there. In the end I was pretty disappointed with what promised to be, but failed to deliver.>>>>>>>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;A Guide to my Book Rating System:1 star = The wood pulp would have been better utilized as toilet paper.2 stars = Don't bother, clean your bathroom instead.3 stars = Wasn't a waste of time, but it was time wasted.4 stars = Good book, but not life altering.5 stars = This book changed my world in at least some small way."},{"Title":"Ultimax Man","review":"This book is an easy read and slightly entertaining.

These are just a few of his talents and once gained he must use them to solve a mystery for all mankind."},{"Title":"Chantecler - A Story of Love","review":"A story that is challenging and unconventional, Chantecler! can be a delight to read, or disturbing. It depends on how patient you are as a reader. After reading the book once, I felt the author, Victor Thomas Salupo, was trying to send too many messages in one story. A blurb on the back cover by Dr. Glory Van Scott says, \\"Chantecler! is a microcosm of today's society ...\\" The story is about love, duty, heartbreak, feminism, betrayal, and more. That is a lot of life to cover in 237 pages.Set in a barnyard, the story features characters that include a rooster (Chantecler), a raven, a dog, pigeon and Chantecler's love interest, a pheasant-hen named Claudine who stole the golden plumage of the male pheasant and a scarecrow.Reading the book a second time, I was more able to pick up on all the messages the story contained. After both readings, however, the story's ending left me wondering. Chantecler! is not for everyone, but if you like stories with a philosophical twist that challenges your mind, it may be the story for you.Marilyn Anita Dalrymple"},{"Title":"The legend of the Christmas rose,","review":"My seven year old daughter loves this and just did a book report on it. An interesting, somewhat complex storyline with magnificant illustrations throughout. There are definitely religious themes herein, all within the historical context of medieval Sweden. Higly recomended."},{"Title":"The legend of the Christmas rose,","review":"This story is one of several Swedish legends explaining why the Christmas Rose blooms in winter. Robber Father has been exiled from his village for stealing a cow. One day, while Robber Mother is admiring the local abbot's garden, she tells him that every Christmas Eve part of the forest blooms. The abbot, taking this is a sign of God's favor, persuades the bishop to pardon Robber Father if the story is true. The abbot witnesses the forest blooming, but before he can pluck a blossom as proof, the lay brother with him cuts the miracle short with an outburst of unbelief and the bishop dies in the snow, grasping two shriveled flower bulbs. The lay brother plants the bulbs in the abbot's garden, and they bloom the next Christmas Eve. Robber Father is pardoned, and the lay brother spends the rest of his life in meditation and prayer, hoping to gain forgiveness.Although the story is well written and beautifully illustrated, biblically-centered parents will need to consider it closely. The story hinges on whether Robber Father can be forgiven, and in the end he is pardoned on the basis of the miracle, with no expression of contrition for his theft. The lay brother, in contrast, having realized his error in judging Robber Father, spends the rest of his life in penitence. Robber Father is met with warm acceptance, the lay brother with clinging guilt. This leads me to conclude that this is not so much a story about forgiveness, but is more of a moralistic story about religious self-righteousness.Two sins are dealt with here -- stealing and self-righteousness -- but only the latter requires repentance. Neither is considered in light of the basis for Christian forgiveness, which is that Jesus' death enables God to forgive sinners, and sinners are commanded to forgive others (1 Peter 3:18; Matthew 18:32-35). Apart from the grace that comes through the Cross, neither sin can be addressed biblically, and forgiveness rings hollow."},{"Title":"The legend of the Christmas rose,","review":"This is a Swedish legend that explains the origin of the flower known as the Christmas Rose. Lagerl&ouml;f was the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize for literature in 1909. This legend, retold by Ellin Greene, originally appeared in a magazine in 1907. The illustrations are beautiful. They capture the emotions of the characters splendidly. The story is not too long for advanced second graders to read in a single sit-ting. Younger children will be able to listen to it. Several times however the layout alternates from a two-page spread of text to a two-page illustration. The text pages can appear overwhelming for young readers, and because there is not an illustration on every page, it can be cumbersome to use in a read-aloud. The story does, of course, have a mention of the Christ Child and central characters include a Bishop, Abbot and lay priest. There is no attempt to influence the reader on behalf of the Christian faith however. Still, it may create some difficulties in a public school classroom. A well-written and illustrated legend, it is a shame the design features make it less appealing and it may create some trouble in a public school classroom.Why 4 stars?:This is a nice story, but has some logistical design flaws. The illustrations are well suited and many children will most likely enjoy it. However, the subject material may not always be accepted in a public school classroom."},{"Title":"Garnered sheaves,: Selected poems","review":"Garnered Sheaves by Stanton A.

It doesn't absolve them of the harshness that often makes up part of their lives, but it doesn't dwell on them either. I find it objective and balanced.The only real problem with the book is that, as others have noted, it is very out of date. The few pages added to this edition don't really cover the incredible transformations that have happened in the country since Ms. MacKey lived there. It really should have been re-written.A better, contemporary book is Thomas Lippman's \\"Inside the Mirage\\", current up to 2002. Even that has already been overtaken by political events in some regards, the information is far more applicable to modern Saudi Arabia."},{"Title":"The Saudis","review":"Actually, as a Western woman, living in Saudi Arabia for the past year, I found the book very interesting and well-balanced. It largely fits with many of my own perceptions of the country, and provided a very clear historical overview of the time between the old boom of the early seventies and the beginnings of political upheaval of the mid-eighties.HOWEVER, although calling itself an &quot;updated version&quot; -- with this stamped on the cover of the book -- there is little updating apart from the 3 1/2 page Introduction and the 11 page Afterword. I was so disappointed, for example, in the chapter on The World Creeps Closer to find NO updating, at all, as this book was written during the Iran - Iraq war.In fact, it jars the reader, because of this. The use of present tense in the chapters discussing things 15 years previous to the 2002 publication date is confusing, at best, and misleading at worst. I don't think the few pages tacked on at the beginning and the end, make up for this, unfortunately.It seems to be cashing in on the 9/11 tragedy, with minimal effort on the part of the author and/or editors. Very disappointing, that!"},{"Title":"The Saudis","review":"Since I lived in Taif &amp; Riyadh (Saudi Arabia) for 20 years, I believe I have a good grasp of the life in that country. I bought this book even though friends who lived in Saudi Arabia had warned me that I would be disappointed--that the writing was stilted, but most importantly, the author had missed too many important points about Saudi life. Actually, Ms. Mackey's distant observations made me feel she was out of touch with the real Saudi Arabia and with real Saudi Arabians.Once I realized that this book was written many years ago, and that the author had very obviously spent very few years inside the Kingdom and then has not been back for nearly twenty years, I was quite dismayed.As someone who spent many years as a guest inside the desert Kingdom, there are books on Saudi Arabia that I would recommend, including Robert Lacey's &quot;The Kingdom&quot; and Jean Sasson's &quot;Princess,&quot; but I would not recommend this particular book."},{"Title":"The Saudis","review":"I picked up this book a while ago. After living in Saudi for about 12 years I was curious to see how a western author would describe Saudi. My conclusion after reading it is that the book is full of inaccuracies and generalizations. Instead I'd recommned several other books like The Kingdom: Arabia and the House of Sa'Ud, by Robert Lacey, Oil Monarchies: Domestic and Security Challenges in the Arab Gulf States, by Gregory Gause, and the best book I've seen written about Saudi that shows some of the cultural nuances of the country: Saudi Arabia and the Politics of Dissent, by Mamoun Fandy."},{"Title":"The Saudis","review":"Referring to the older version of the book: As a trained Political Scientist who worked in the area of economic planning part of the time she was in Saudi Arabia, the author does a very nice job of exploring the real crisis of inflexible Saudi traditionalism when first really confronted with the demands of modernity -- the weird mix of naivete, arrogance, and fear. We can see the reverberations still.She's actually a lot less biased and more even-handed than a lot of newer books, and it's extremely readable and entertaining as well as informative. She touches on more aspects of Saudi lifestyle in one book than all of the half-dozen other books I've read combined -- urban and rural development, health care, economics, religion, education, sexuality, social psychology, and domestic and foreign politics. She is best as a political scientist-sociologist, OK as an anthropologist, and weaker as a social psychologist -- but even there, not bad.This is a solid and fairly comprehensive foundation for understanding how modern Saudi Arabia came to be as it is, but it is not the place to stop."},{"Title":"The Saudis","review":"Since 9/11 I have read everything I could read on the Middle East, and Saudi Arabia, in particular. I was thrilled when I saw this book. I was disappointed from page one.In my opinion, this writer did not spend enough time in the country to get a handle on it--a few years only--what I call parachute journalism--also, she writes that she lived closed in a Western compound. This is very limiting for a writer.The writing shows it. I felt I was reading what she had been told or had \\"heard.\\" I may be wrong, and if so, apologies.There are plenty of other great books out there about Saudi Arabia. As a reader of many books about the Middle East, I must tell the painful truth. In my opinion, this is not a book to bother with."},{"Title":"The Saudis","review":"This was a well written history of the country of Saudi Arabiaand the people who live there.You are able to get a concise history of the Royal family(Saud) and the Kings who have served in Saudi Arabia.One of the most interesting sections of the bookwas the formation of ARAMCO.This is a consortium of the four oil companies who developed the oil industry in Saudi Arabia.Anotherinteresting part of the book was President Roosevelt's visit tothe country during World War II.I also got a kick about thedescription of camel racing that takes place in Saudi Arabia.Thisis a very good book about Saudi Arabia. It is very readable andyou will enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Saudis","review":"As others have noted, this book was written in the late 80's, early 90's and, given the pace of change in our society, it's not just dated but, in places, it's almost quaint.That said, this book needs to be required reading for any serious student of the Middle East, or anyone who's wondering how we got where we are - and what can we do about it? \\"The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom\\" is a foundational primer on Saudi Arabia and serves as an excellent introduction for all your future reading on the topic.Sandra writes, \\"Without doubt, the West's view of Saudi Arabia is distorted. ... Much of this anti-Westernism is born of frustration with American policy toward Israel and Europe's inability to win something concrete for the Palestinians.\\"However, for the Saudi's, the frustration was much more personal. Much of the confusing relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United States grew out of a dawning realization of the part of the House of Saud that they literally couldn't protect their desert kingdom militarily. For many years, Saudi defense plans were based on what was called, the \\"American Option.\\" This was, primarily, having just enough troops to stall an attacker until American military might could swoop in to save the al Sauds, but not enough military to organize an effective coup and depose the royal family.Confidence in America's commitment to protecting its allies began to collapse with the events in Iran that lead to deposing of the Shah and the rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini. While Carter dithered, Saudi Arabia sent increasingly more blatant signals to the US that surrender to a radical Islamic regime would be a disaster for Saudi Arabia and the entire region. The tone deaf Carter did nothing and the anti-western traditionalists in the royal family triumphantly seized on America's failure to even grant the Shah asylum as proof of western perfidy. Even the pro-western elements in the family had to be nervous at this betrayal of a long-time (if problematic) US ally. This disaster was followed by Soviet incursions in Ethiopia and Afghanistan, with only weak US opposition (boycotting the 1980 Olympic games, held in Moscow, was strongest response the Carter administration could muster.)\\"The al-Sauds as a result came to believe that by tying themselves too closely to the United States they were guaranteeing neither the throne nor their personal protection in case of political turmoil. Furthermore, the United States not only failed to move protect the Shah but had allowed a regime to come to power that was determined to destroy American presence in the gulf and to pull down the House of Saud. ... [F]or Saudi Arabia, the United States as the ultimate security guarantor in a grand strategic design was a concept that had failed.\\"In 1986, Saudi Arabia got caught up in the Reagan administration ill-considered Iranian Arms imbroglio. \\"Every innuendo that linked Saudi Arabia to the affair added fuel to the widespread dissatisfaction within the Kingdom, for the revelations coming out of Washington tripped anti-Western emotions[.]\\"As a consequence of the serial mismanagement of the relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia (on both sides of the American political aisle), \\"[t]oday's Saudi is reaching not toward modernization but toward the security of Islam, the gateway to the past.\\"\\" ... [T]he great dividing line between the Saudis and the Westerners is religion. Islam for the Saudis is more than a theology, it is an entire way of life. Religion is the central force of their existence. Religion is life and life religion.\\"She writes respectfully about Islam and the Prophet (PBUH) who revealed it. She gets a few things wrong. In the quote above about \\"religion is life and life religion\\" Sandra acts as if this is something unique to Saudi Arabia and not the religious practices of every Muslim in the world. She also writes in various places about Muhammad (PBUH) founding a \\"new\\" religion (instead of a restoration of the authentic faith revealed to Adam, practiced by Ibrahim and all the prophets that followed - but that's another review for another time!).Sandra suffers from none of the west's prejudices towards Islam. Insightfully she quotes \\"... a Western-educated, middle class Saudi, \`The problem here is not Islam. The problem is too many young men with no job and no university and nowhere to go except to the mosque, where some [radical preachers] fill their heads with anger for America.'\\"[t]he portrayal of internal politics in Saudi Arabia as a contest between Westernized moderates and puritanical Wahabbis is grossly oversimplified. [...] In truth, the modernizers and the traditionalists occupy parts of each other's realm. No matter how Westernized they regard themselves, the modernizers neither are able to not want to escape their own culture, for Islam weaves it's way into every aspect of Saudi culture, mandating that every Saudi is to some degree an Islamist. By the same token, Islamists have not escaped or totally rejected the forces of modernization. As an example, the most militant and influential Islamists now post their sermons calling for a return to the past on the Internet.\\"Sandra Mackey writes with obvious love for the Saudis, their culture and their country. As a western woman, she can't help but shake her head over what her western perspective considers injustice (the status of women) or just undesirable (a love of exaggerated flattery.) These flavor her accounts, even though she struggles, and for the most part succeeds, to remain impartial."},{"Title":"The Saudis","review":"This is a fantastic book that gives you a great inside look into a country full of changes and hard to understand.Mrs Mackey really captures what happened in Saudi Arabia in the last years of the 1970's and the first years of the 80's regarding the oil boom in that country.She experienced first hand what the changes brought to the Saudis in their personal,cultural and religious life.This book not only helped me understand much better the Saudis and their economic impact in the oil business but also helped understand them as a people and as a culture.I believe that Mrs Mackey wrote a fascinating account that takes you deep in to arabian society.Her narrative is alive and her descriptions are sharp and capture the images and mood of the times.For me it was like i was walking thru the markets and bazaars with her at my side as a tour guide.Excellent book by an excellent author."},{"Title":"The Saudis","review":"While this book is quite informative and details interesting insights into the Saudis, I found it to be a slow read. The writing is very bland. I only continued to finish the book because I find the subject matter interesting, but it took a long time to finish, as my attention span wained. I chose to read this book after reading PRINCESS: A TRUE STORY OF LIFE BEHIND THE VEIL IN SAUDI ARABIA, by Jean Sasson. This book peaked my interest in Saudi Arabia. I was dissapointed to find that THE SAUDIS didn't provide the intense insight into the Saudi culture like Sassons's book does."},{"Title":"The Saudis","review":"This is a good introductary or pulp nonfiction book, if such a thing exists. It would be a typical best-seller. What this book does, however, is introduce readers and help them to understand the complexities of Saudi Arabian politics, economics and society at large. Sandra Mackey gives fine minute details of how women are treated, the norms of culture and traditions and the country's most powerful and lucrative export: oil. In terms of global economy -- especially for the United States -- a lot of power is tied to the actions of the Saudi government. The book explains very successfully the purpose of the Arabian-American Oil Company (ARAMCO), the Committee for the Protection of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, the Arabian's love of power and materialism, the lifestyle of the Bedouins, the Hajj, all the way through to the purpose (socially) to the assumed sexually active Hareems. The book is packed with useful information for anyone with a novice interest in the Middle East and Saudia Arabia specifically.The author also gives a very explict and colorful portrait of the Saudi's love of camel racing. The Saudis is a good source book. However, some of the provided information ia a little out of date.It is still a good, insightful read. I would recommend Sandra Mackey's other books: The Iranians and Lebanon: Death of a Nation."},{"Title":"The Saudis","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. If you want to know about the history and the people of Saudi Arabia, then this book is for you.Sandra Mackey lived and worked in Saudi Arabia during its boom days, and wrote about her experiences in Saudi Arabia under different names to hide her identity from Saudi officials. In the early seventies, any foreigner caught writing about Saudi Arabia without the authorization of the Ministry of Communication was either imprisoned or swiftly deported from the country. Sandra Mackey had to remain undercover, and used many different names as author in the articles she sent abroad. She recounts how there were tense moments when she thought she had been identified by Saudi officials, and had to take her documents out in the desert to burn them. She also gave her articles to friends leaving the country to give them to her publishers. Those were the early days when email was still non-existent!This book will give you a pretty detailed look at life in Saudi Arabia as lived by the Saudis and as seen through the eyes of the expatriates living there. Many situations will seem bizarre to people not familiar with this country or its people.Sandra Mackey traces the history of Saudi Arabia back to its founder, King Abdul-Aziz. She describes how he united the different tribes together; how he then ruled over his kingdom; how he averted an uprising that almost overthrew him; how he controlled his people by the use of religion; and his strategy of keeping Saudi Arabia united and under his rule. His motto was to pay off his enemies to win them over. According to the author, this strategy is still carried out till this day.The author then describes the lives of the next kings, the children of Abdul-Aziz. Their lives is quite interesting, and not without intrigue. One king, Saud, was overthrown by his brother, Faisal, who took the thrown. King Saud was accused of being a playboy and a drunk. He was exiled by his brother, King Faisal. King Faisal was later murdered by his nephew. King Faisal was regarded as one of the best kings Saudi Arabia has had, and the people mourned his death.The author describes how and why King Faisal was murdered, and how the country was moving forward under his rule. She also describes the oil embargo that King Faisal imposed on the US for its role in the Israeli war. This is really a fascinating chapter.After King Faisal came King Khalid, his brother (the crown is past from brother to brother). King Khalid was also liked by his people for he was a virtuous, religious, and just man. He was also a great poet. He did not rule for long for he suffered from ill health. Like his brother king Faisal, he was not a king concerned with the luxuries of life. He spent most of his time in the desert with Bedouins living the simple life.After King Khalid came King Fahd. Fahd was a city man, spending almost no time with the Bedouins in the desert, and enjoyed the luxurious high life. He built palaces in almost every city in Saudi Arabia, and many abroad. He spent lavishly, and under his rule, corruption flourished. He was also very unhealthy, and at one point was so fat that he had to be carried around in a wheel chair. The last few years of his life were spent in bed, and many said that he was unaware of his surroundings. King Fahd was not liked because of his lavish lifestyle and neglect of the well-being of his people.The chapter on King Fahd is quite interesting. She describes the effect the Ayatollah Khomeini had on the ruling family, and how scared they became of religious fundamentalists.The book ends before the death of King Fahd and before the events of September 11. Today, Saudi Arabia is ruled by King Abdullah, a man very much liked by his people.The author also describes the economic and political turmoil of Saudi Arabia since its founding King. She recounts the Mecca uprising, were militants took over the holy Mosque at Mecca. She also talks about life in general in this kingdom, as well as how business is conducted. A few things might shock the readers. For example, it is common to have public executions, where anyone of any religion or nationality can attend a beheading. There are stories of maids being imprisoned in their employer's homes and used as sex slaves. Some European and American workers, with their passports in the custody of their employers as per the law of the country, were unable to leave the country because their employer had a quarrel with them.The author also describes how lucky the Europeans and Americans who came to work in Saudi Arabia were. They were paid very high tax-free salaries, and were given paid holidays. Many used those paid holidays to travel around the world and to exotic places.I liked the author's description of the desert, and how most expatriates missed out on its beauty (as well as a few who died, underestimating the heat and dryness).This is really a great book about the history of Saudi Arabia and one that I really enjoyed reading. Keep in mind though that life in Saudi Arabia has changed since the publication of this book, and that under the just guidance of King Abdullah, the country is moving forward at a healthy pace."},{"Title":"The Saudis","review":"In 1970, Iraq was allowing women to fly fighter planes. Iran was preparing to \\"create a second America\\" in just a few years. Nasser was still guiding Egypt. And Saudi Arabia had virtually no paved roads, one rickety railroad, one ancient international airport, and so little port capacity that the few supermarkets in the country couldn't be stocked.By 1978, virtually every Saudi had a car, a new home, a farm, or whatever they wanted. Riyadh had a Saks store and toilet attendants gave people Chanel No. 5 to wash their hands with.Sandra Mackey details the upheaval of the late 1970s and early 1980s from the perspective of a female foreign journalist living in fear that the government would find out what she was doing. Now that Saudis are constantly accused of Xenophobia, this book gives an important glimpse into the treatment of Westerners (and all foreigners) in Saudi Arabia during the oil boom. It is not a tell-all insider's book, but rather an interesting description of how much (little?) an American women was able to penetrate the secrecy of Saudi life.[The book itself was written in 1987 and has not been updated, with good reason. The Saudi government would imprison Sandra Mackey if she ever tried to return there.]"},{"Title":"The Saudis","review":"At the beginning of Chapter 4, Ms. Mackey relates an incident that provides ample insight into the author's attitude towards a country, people and culture she presumes to report upon. Despite more than adequate signage that a non-Muslim is not to enter Mecca, which she clearly sees: \\"Immediately billboard-size blue and white signs in both Arabic and English appeared along the road, warning non-Moslems to turn back,\\" she coaxes her husband to drive on. Is it any surprise that shortly \\"We were forced off the road by one of the angry policeman\\"? and \\"each yelled and gestured at us with a passion only a Saudi can muster.\\" Only a Saudi can muster!?? Wow. The vast majority of Americans who have traveled into foreign cultures have been there before. One is on an Indian reservation in America's southwest, ample signage and even personal instructions that one is not to photograph certain buildings or objects and yet there is one of our \\"compatriots\\" who insists on ignoring the polite requests of the \\"natives.\\" Ditto the same scenario for the compatriots who refuse to remove their shoes upon entering a Buddhist temple in Thailand. The vast majority of Americans sensitive to the nuances and prohibitions of another culture can only cringe in embarrassment that such a person is one of our group.Ms. Mackey lived in Saudi Arabia for a period of four years, two at the end of the \`70's, and after a two year break, returned for two more in the early \`80's. She accompanied her physician husband who worked at King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh. She used the \\"cover\\" of a housewife to file freelance stories with Western publications, some quite respectable, such as the Christian Science Monitor. She is not a journalist by training, but clearly aspires to be one, which all too often results in adopting their negative traits, such as finding a story to fit the \\"party line\\" of the editor, accepting much of expatriate folklore as unassailable fact, and even reporting as facts items that strain the far outer envelope of credulity. For example, on page 311, she has the Crown Prince and her husband engaged in a conversation, and the Crown Prince is denying the validity of political rumors to him. In English or Arabic? Any physician addressing the medical needs of the senior leadership did not engage in casual political conversations. On page 362, she says that: \\"In the Saudi embassies in Cairo, New Delhi, and Bangkok, I pushed through corridors crowded with men squatting, anxiously waiting for a precious Saudi visa.\\" The authenticity of the first person? I've visited two of those three countries, and the very last thing I, or the numerous other expats, including almost certainly Ms. Mackey, would do while on vacation, is go to the Saudi Embassy! Would any book on Saudi Arabia be complete without resorting to the most tired clich&eacute; -that the Saudis are all camel jockeys, and so on page 169 she goes deep into the bigotry of urban myths that \\"the Toyota dealership in Riyadh was forced to build a corral where Saudis could jump off their camels and into their shiny new cars.\\" In a far wiser and factual book, \\"Passing Brave,\\" by Polk and Mares, reporting almost a decade earlier, they bemoaned the fact that it was virtually impossible to find Saudis who could ride camels, or the equipment necessary to do same.Her overall tone is so relentlessly negative. \\"The Saudis,\\" and all too often it is that broad generalization, are \\"arrogant,\\" \\"haughty\\", \\"sensitive,\\" \\"obsessed with saving face, honor\\" et al; in short the whole panoply of characterizations attached to the West's \\"Orientalist\\" view of the East. Like water torture, these same words and phrases are endlessly repeated. The book is filled with sentences like: \\"Science has failed to penetrate the minds of Saudi males.\\" (p.152). \\"The need to preserve each Saudi's honor may be the single biggest obstacle to the development of a modern economy.\\" (p 119) and \\"To begin with, a Saudi employer, loving exaggerated flattery, usually will regard intellectual honesty in the form of criticism as a personal insult\\" (p 119). Should it be any surprise that Ms. Mackey reports: \\"I, like all Westerners, found it almost impossible to become a friend, in a Western sense of the term, with a Saudi\\" (p 110). Perhaps the Saudi's \\"sensitivities\\" included detecting \\"the Ugly American\\" and avoiding same, since other expatriates were able to establish relationships of friendship. Overall, her book reads like a \\"reporter\\" visiting, say, Taos, NM, reading the police blotter, reporting only this, and believing they have captured the essence of this exciting town. Furthermore, there simply is no empathy for a people who endured the ultimate in \\"future shock\\" of economic development.She also engaged in much speculation on the political inner workings of the Royal Family that must cause chuckles among them if they have bothered to read this book. Clearly, unlike Tocqueville, they have not withstood the test of time.Early in the book, on page 10, after a brief tour of Syria, Jordan and Israel in 1997, she declares that \\"... I was, by now, inescapably addicted to life in the Middle East.\\" Why, one wonders? After enduring the \\"hardships\\" she relishes relating of their first two years, why return? Her second chapter is entitled \\"The Magic Kingdom,\\" but the \\"magic\\" other expats found is never identified. Upon her return, she does relate that there are a vast number of improvements, but never speculates how, with what she had previously identified as the \\"Saudi mentality,\\" that this is possible.I did not give the book a 1-star rating because occasionally she did see \\"arrogance\\" in Westerners, (though she apparently avoided the mirror); she was able to wisely discuss the Saudi form of \\"democracy,\\" i.e., their consensus building process p (205); identified, and longed for the beauty of the desert (p 227); and described other positive developments on page 265. Also, the book is not the utter fantasy that some books about the Kingdom are.\\"The difference is that when a Saudi fails he never accepts the responsibility but blames it on \`bad luck', the unfairness of the teacher, the difficulty of the material, and, in the end, the will of Allah.\\" (p119) America remains bogged down in two endless war, and is now commencing the worst financial crisis since the 1930's, yet we have a President who still believes that he made no mistakes, other than a few inappropriate expressions he once uttered, and we have Wall Street and Detroit lining up for government handouts, yet no leader seems to be willing to accept responsibility for their actions. It is the \\"differential diagnosis\\" that this book so painfully lacks.Others have detected the flaws and negativity in this book, including the posted review from the Library Journal. But it IS a book that should be read, critically, because it is another case which illustrates how faulty our \\"intelligence\\" is, and how Western attitudes towards this part of the world are formed. A revision of these attitudes is required, for the United States simply cannot afford to engage in endless conflict."},{"Title":"The Saudis","review":"Try not to look at this as a current day window into Saudi Arabia. While it might have been contemporary when it was published, it is now a history book. It has become a very good single volume read on Saudi Arabia up through the beginning of the 1980's. A lot of the culture and the paradigms still exist, but you don't have the Mattawan running around beating Western women for not adhering to the dress code, though they do expect decorum and conservative norms to be followed. The one time the Mattawan ordered me to tell my wife to cover her hair, she simply pulled a Red Sox cap out of her purse and donned it. The Mattawan thought that was just hysterical, but he went on his way. I lived in Riyadh for three years (just left) and while I missed getting a beer at a bar or having a glass of wine with dinner, life went on and we genrally enjoyed our stay.I read this book before I arrived in the Kingdom and I felt it gave me a very keen understanding of the Saudis. Yes, it is very dated now and Saudi Arabia has taken a lot of steps forward, but the book is rich in the history and political challenges of when it was written, and it is still useful for anyone wishing to better understand Saudi Arabia. You have to be very careful what you say and what you do here, and the book helps frame why this is so.I referenced it in my Master's Thesis to the disapproval of my professor, who did not consider Mackey a literary source. I argued it and in the end kept my references (I suggested the professor come out to Riyadh and see for himself if Mackey was right or wrong, and the matter quietly dropped).Finally, I thought it was very well written and well researched. I can see why it got negative reviews -- it is not always kind -- but I found it a very useful precursor to my arrival and the subsequent three years of residence that followed."},{"Title":"The Saudis","review":"This was a very good book. I was quite impressed.

While there, and under the guise of a male nom de plume, she smuggles out written stories about some of the incredible changes that are going on as these Bedouin tribes find themselves front and center in the worlds oil market. This is a well-written, fact filled book that reads like a good novel with humor and intrigue. I highly recommend it for those who would like to try something in the non-fiction genre.

Don't know what she got right or wrong with the facts, but it's a good story."},{"Title":"The Saudis","review":"Being a Saudi Arabian woman, I was totally amazed by the false information in this book. I don't think the author should write a book about a country when she lived there for few months. She missinterpreted so many things that happen regularly in our culture. She should know that women in Saudi Arabia choose to cover up. They are not forced to do so. The same thing goes to Catholic nuns, who choose to cover up for the sake of God. I think she should have talked to more educated Saudi women who could explain things better. She may have lived in a village where the majority were uneducated (that was in 1970's) and women were less fortunate.I'm currently working as an IT consultant in a huge company, my mother is a college professor and my father is really supportive and is proud of both of us. Nothing is stopping us from reaching our goals.I think people should look at a broader picture. I could have judged Americans by the acts of the KKK few decades ago. However, I lived in the US for two years with my husband, who is an engineer, and I had a chance to make good American friends. I cannot say all Americans are racists!!In concolusion, the book is a total waste of money. I do not recommend that anyone should buy it."},{"Title":"The Saudis","review":"I started to read this fat paperback, written in 1987, and found that a week and a half later, I had finished it.

I'm surprised the book is still in print, and I am even more surprised that anyone continues to be impressed by it.

She lived so briefly in the kingdom and did not even live in a native setting, so I do not believe she is a person who needs to be writing about the Saudis. She is assuming to be an expert when in reality, that is rather a joke. I think of this book as giving me a chance to be an outsider peeking in, for about five minutes. There are plenty of good books out there on the Middle East, but unfortunately, none are written by this author. She should find a new career."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Photographic Lenses","review":"This book contains the basics and the general concepts of camera lenses.

God was an awesome God to me before, and I didn't think He could be more awesome. But I was wrong. His awesomeness goes way beyond what I can even comprehend. I highly recommend this book. But I suggest that you start out with the first book, Rediscovering The Kingdom. (Also, I have ordered these two books for my daughter and son-in-law as well as \\"Kingdom Parenting\\" and \\"The Purpose and Power of Men,\\" because they have two sons, age 10 and 12. I have not read these books, but if they are equal to the teaching in the two books that I have already read, I know they will be excellent.

Wow...what a great deal we have. Just understanding the true meaning of knowing Jesus as LORD is a real eye-opener. Through this man's teaching Scriptures will begin to be enlightened to you in a far deeper meaning and you will have a stronger walk with the Lord once you understand and begin to live under God's Kingdom Principles.

Having grown up in a kingdom Dr. Munroe knows first hand the life of a kingdom citizen, something we Americans have yet to grasp. Dr. Munroe also knows what it really means to live in a kingdom. He is a gifted writer and explains the way a kingdom operates in a very practical and down to earth fashion. However, being completely candid, this book is not one to grasp in one setting.

The author is a hilarious storyteller with passages that make you want to grab the nearest person and read aloud. Nowadays so much gets hyped as \\"laugh-out-loud funny,\\" but Scheft's books deliver.Critics and fans have sung the praises of Scheft's comedic skills, but few have acknowledged his singular literary talents. Nobody writes like his guy. Nobody. He has a distinct narrative voice -- at times rich and inventive, clever and intricate; other times terse and snide, blunt and stinging. As a friend told me recently, \\"You'll be reading one of his sentences, taking it in on one level, and then all of a sudden you discover another level of meaning, another level of nuance.\\" The well crafted prose unites all the elements, and in his latest work, that's an amazing feat with the multiple characters and multiple plots (a bold decision for his second novel).Populating his story with real characters -- famed musicians Peter Wolf (J. Geils Band), guitar virtuoso Les Paul, legendary rocker Barry Tashian -- and a myriad of rock/pop culture references, Scheft lends authenticity to his tale. Starting with chapter one, Scheft makes the reader feel like you're eavesdropping on history, a talent reminiscent of Tom Wolfe. A dozen pages into the book and you're singing along with the Truant's big hit, \\"Get Psyched.\\" This is a hard book to put down, because you are always dying to find out what happens next on this wild, Carl Hiaasen-like ride. The author has a true ear for dialogue, and the brash, honest talk from the eccentric cast provides an effective counterpoint to the intricacy of the narration and the \\"ohmygod!\\" quirkiness and creativity of the plot.If HBO is smart, they'll turn this book into a series. And it will be a blast. But you'll lose the writing artistry that makes reading this novel such a memorable experience."},{"Title":"Time Won't Let Me: A Novel","review":"Bill Scheft's sudden assault on the memory and senses in the opening chapter will have anyone who has ever been in a band during their school years equally laughing and cringing.The story starts in 1967 as the garage band, The Truants, are the toast of Chase Academy, and the five members decide to record a vanity album. Several decades later, they all plan to reunite after being told that their album is now changing hands among collectors for a sum of $20,000 a time.The 30-year school reunion is fast approaching. With the lure of a nostalgic gig, and perhaps the chance of re-recording their vinyl triumph with the bonus of reaping the financial rewards, as well as giving them all a much-needed ego-boost, they plan to reunite.As you get further into the book, you also get further in to the band members' lives, and what makes them tick, and to a lesser extent, how they've found themselves where they are.All this is accompanied by an insightful wit that only first-hand observation can lend a story.This book is like a Dick Dale track, the notes (or rather words) rebounding inside your mind like a musical machine gun, with the undeniable kinetic energy of a good sixties track.This is Scheft's second book, but the first I've read. I'll be looking out for his first, and hopefully that'll keep me happy until his third is published.Armchair Interviews says: This book hits the right note."},{"Title":"Time Won't Let Me: A Novel","review":"Was looking forward to this based on his reputation and the subject.

But even those who enjoyed the author's first novel (\\"The Ringer\\") are likely be pleasantly surprised at the number and depth of the characters he's created this time around.The five Truants (a mid-1960's prep school band) begin the book considerably older, but little (if any) wiser then they were as teen-agers, unable to connect successfully with their respective families, or one another, and (for the most part) unable to afford the toys generally prescribed for midlife crisis.

As a high school band who released 500 copies of one album, their 15 minutes of fame is clearly over. But when they find our their album went for $10,000 on eBay, they're coaxed into reuniting for a big score and a bigger show at their high school reunion. One small problem -- they can't stand each other.The characterizations are compelling, memorable and you'll recognize the personalities from the band in your own life. You'll understand why the Beatles and the Eagles had to break up after reading this book. Just thinking about the character Pressure Chief still makes me laugh out loud. Read this book and you'll never look at Equal the same way again. If you don't enjoy this book, you need to find a tall, tall building.If you've ever been in a band, if you've ever known someone in a band, or if you've ever listened to a band, you owe it to yourself to get this book.

I finished this in three sittings, four days. I have been in and out of bands for about 40 years, starting in high school, and I loved all the nuances Bill brought to this story. He develops the characters beautifully and I guarantee you will never feel let down or set up by this tale. If you have EVER been in a band, had a brother or sister in a band, or were involved someway in a band, you will identify with this book. But don't pass this by if you had nothing to do with a band - I was pleasantly surprised by several of the twists and turns the book took, but again I must reiterate I was not let down or disappointed by any of the unexpected story lines that Bill developed. Every now and then I was reading something and said to myself, \\"Oh yeah and I can see that he will eventually ...\\" or \\"I bet this will play out like this...\\" and was pleasantly surprised that Sheft didn't take the \\"easy way\\" or \\"obvious choice\\".

Winding its way through the lives of the former prep school musicians who record a vanity album which is resurrected by a record collector who wants them to reform and hit the road, the narrative explores the failures and foibles of the guys in an effort to build towards that \\"big gig\\". I won't spoil the ending for those who still want to read the book, but there's plenty of reunions of old band members going on out there at clubs, weddings and the like and you'd be better served by going out and seeing the real thing....even if all you'll hear is a warmed over version of \\"We Gotta Get Out of this Place\\"...at least it's live."},{"Title":"Time Won't Let Me: A Novel","review":"Book arrived as promised, perfect shape, will order again no question!"},{"Title":"The Dark Horse (Tumbleweed)","review":"Not as famous as Black Beauty but certainly more true to reality.

Mrs. Samuel Lawrence of Santa Monica, a poor but proud widow, hires Archer to find her missing daughter, a young nurse named Galley. Archer goes where the clues lead and soon finds he is involved in something more than a simple missing persons case. Slowly but surely, the hardboiled PI becomes immersed in the sordid world of heroin addicts and dealers.The Way Some People Die contains plenty of good dialogue as well as numerous descriptive passages notable for their insightful detail. The intricately constructed narrative contains several intriguing plot elements that are ultimately tied together in the final pages. A 4 star effort, not quite up to the standard of Macdonald's best work, but nevertheless a worthwhile read for hardboiled crime fans."},{"Title":"The Way Some People Die: a murder mystery","review":"A master of the noir thriller, Macdonald captures the heart and soul of 1940-50s California, from Los Angeles to Palm Springs to San Francisco, his protagonist at home prowling the mean streets of LA. A former cop, Lew Archer, now a PI, is called to the Santa Monica home of a distraught mother, Mrs. Samuel Lawrence. Her daughter has been missing since Christmas and now, months later, Mrs. Lawrence is willing to invest in outside help to locate Galatea. Galley is one of those few remarkable women that draw men in like a black widow spider, all innocence and fresh beauty, virtually irresistible to the male of the species. Galley quit her nursing job after caring for a gut-shot petty hood, apparently running off with a small time gangster in his employ, Joe Tarantine. Archer resorts to the tried and true techniques that served him well on the police force, gathering bits of evidence until he can form a cohesive picture of the girl's activities and her possible whereabouts, not to mention the men in her lifeThe most likely place to start is with Tarantine's brother, Mario, but he is laid up in the hospital after a terrible beating that leaves him almost unrecognizable. Still Mario is the closest lead to his brother, although Archer gets sidetracked by a local drug dealer with influence enough to corrupt some local law enforcement. Surrounded by a grotesque band of thugs, Dowser, a former boxer, has Lew escorted to his fortified hilltop home between Santa Monica and Pacific Palisades. His intention is to enlist Archer's aid in locating Joe Tarantine, since they are both interested in finding the same man, offering a decent reward; the PI plays along since that is likely the only way he will leave the enclave in one piece. Tracking Tarantine to a bar in Palm Springs, an odd collection of characters spring up along the way, some unsavory, others with questionable motives; but before he has a chance to sort out the various factions, Lew finds Galley in a rented house outside of Palm Springs and is knocked out before her can question her, rescued from the roadside by a middle-aged newlywed.Before long, the bodies pile up, conflicting motives complicating the case, a handsome part time actor found dead in his apartment, a newlywed husband on the lamb, a boat piled on the rocks, fast-talking women, everybody with a hand out or a hidden agenda. With dialog and descriptions straight out of the past, Archer mirrors the stark black and white nature of the crime genre in its prime, tough guys and hoods, beautiful dames, pushy cops and nasty characters you wouldn't want to run into in a dark alley: \\"His face and body had an evil swollen look as if they had grown stout on rotten meat.\\" With a penchant for naming people by their looks (\\"Paleface\\" and \\"Judas\\"), Archer is the epitome of a dedicated PI, willing to work for his money but on edge when people take advantage, especially when they render him unconscious. This is a man with a heart, willing to scrape a junkie off the streets and deliver her to a hospital for treatment but unwilling to be anybody's sucker. For a few hours of escape into the ambiance of old Hollywood, this novel is a great escape into more readily definable days where good and evil were easy to recognize, women wore gloves and both good and bad guys wore hats. Luan Gaines/2007."},{"Title":"The Way Some People Die: a murder mystery","review":"P.I. work can be challenging, but Lew Archer wasn't prepared.It all started out so simple, an over-protective mother, looking for her adult missing daughter. She hadn't heard from her for a few months and was truly distraught. It was obvious by her humble surroundings that she had little money, but Archer didn't want to work for free. He was reluctant to get involved, but Mrs. Lawrence was adamant and showed him a picture. Galley was her name and she was definitely a looker. He agreed to do a little poking around if Mrs. Lawrence would pay him fifty dollars. But he was sure it would be a dead end.That was a bad call...Galley had left little behind to trace, but it was enough to get Archer started. It appeared she had unknowingly become involved with some unsavory characters. It was quite possible she was in definite danger. The more Archer dug, the deeper he was pulled in. Cross-country searches, illegal activities, and drugs weave a tangled web of deception-but that is just the beginning. Just when he gets close to Joe Tarantine, a major link to Galley, he often slips away.When Galley finally surfaces, Archer is determined to set her free. The stakes are high and the risks are chancy at best, but that's just part of the job. When things really get hot, the police are involved. But will they trust his instincts or write Archer off?Witnesses and sources turn against each other and Archer is stuck in the middle. Some times he's just ahead of the police but the next time he's to late. Sorting out the truth in between the lines is a challenge, will Archer's persistence pay off in the end or will the real truth slip away?This is one of 18 Lew Archer novels published between 1949 and 1976. Ross MacDonald, the pen name for Kenneth Millar, died over 20 years ago. At that time, he was considered the greatest American crime novelist since Raymond Chandler-also a literary artist-not just a detective storywriter.The Way Some people Die is full of unexpected twists and 360 degree turns.Armchair Interviews says: It will keep you hanging until the very last page!"},{"Title":"The Way Some People Die: a murder mystery","review":"Being a big fan of Ross MacDonald, I know that his early books (pre-1958) are solid but rather standard hard-boiled mysteries very much in the Hammett/Chandler school. MacDonald didn't really find his voice (and his power as a writer) until his amazing streak of successes that started with 1959's The Galton Case, and beyond.Having known that when I started The Way Some People Die (written 1951), I was still surprised to find it pedestrian and somewhat less than gripping. The plot is appropriately complex, but of all MacDonald's books this definitely comes across as undistinguished and derivative of Chandler in particular. The comings and goings of several characters (especially the daughter who Archer is hired to find at the beginning) make little sense, and the environment of gangsters, thugs and hired goons is not what MacDonald does best, and they're the kind of Hollywood stock characters that make this book feel tired and dated in a way that no other MacDonald books are."},{"Title":"The Way Some People Die: a murder mystery","review":"Poor old Mrs. Samuel Lawrence of Santa Monica doesn't realize what a can or worms she's opening when she hires Lew Archer to find her missing daughter, Galley. By the end Lew has traveled up and down the length of California and left a string of bodies behind, most of them well-deserving of their morbid fate. And Galley, well, she's not the sweet little nurse her mother thinks she is. This is a swell ride, start to finish. I'm now officially a Ross MacDonald fan and am looking foward to reading everything he wrote."},{"Title":"The Way Some People Die: a murder mystery","review":"I had read Ross McDonald's novels back when he was in his prime - 50s and 60s. I chose this novel (The Way Some People Die) as I wanted to remember what it was like to read his work. I had not previously read this novel.McDonald's work takes some adjustment for me. He doesn't write mysteries per se. This, and his other works, are not \\"who dun it\\" books as does another McDonald (Phillip) write. And this McDonald doesn't write of action and adventure as does still another McDonald (John D).His works are studies in the human character living in California at the time of his writing (~early 1950s). He digs into personal behavior through his character (Lew Archer) digging into the events of the story as he finds them.There is not a lot uncertainty about who did what to whom here. Archer uncovers evil around the heroin business and this novel is about what that evil is and what it does to the characters in this novel.There is a lot to like about Ross McDonald's work - principally character studies and characterizations of his times, as well as his flexible use of the English language - but I more enjoy novels where what happens next is the attraction which makes me want to turn to the next page. I more enjoy the early Dashiell Hammett Continental Op stories, Anthony Boucher mysteries, Ross Thomas adventures, Don Westlake's comedy-adventure-mysteries, and less enjoy Ross McDonald's character studies. But if they are what you enjoy this is probably a good one."},{"Title":"The Way Some People Die: a murder mystery","review":"This noir crime \\"mystery\\" novel is in the tradition of a classic Dashiel Hammet novel, but if possible has an even more gritty feel. I felt drawn into character, PI Archer, and his hardboiled take on solving crimes. The plot had enough twists to offer some surprises, and the gritty, period centric style, along with the colorful and flawed characters kept one interested throughout the novel. As is the case with literature of this period it doesn't have any gay, minority or dominant female characters, but the author does a great job bringing his characters to life.While I gave it 5 stars, the novel is still less than a masterpiece, and doesn't always flow quite as well as it should. However, it still admirably matches up, and mostly surpasses other comparable literature in this genre. I recommend this to anyone who wants to enjoy a great detective novel with a gritty feel to it."},{"Title":"The Way Some People Die: a murder mystery","review":"\\"The Way Some People Die\\" is a typical installment in Macdonald's Lew Archer series. Archer, a Los Angeles private detective of indeterminate age, always finds himself involved with denizens of the darker side of life, whether he is working on a case or just running into trouble unintentionally. In this book he gets wrapped up with true criminals--very bad people with malevolent intent.The plot begins with Archer succumbing to a widow's plea to find her missing daughter despite his suspicion that she doesn't really need finding. Searching for the girl leads Archer into a world of mobsters and drug dealers where treachery is the norm. Innocent people, few though there are in this plot, are used handily by the perpetrators of the criminal schemes. Archer is bamboozled at every turn until he finally puts the pieces together.One thing I like about this book is the full denouement, which is much needed for such a complex case. I also enjoyed the settings: the waterfront in Long Beach and a desert town near Palm Springs.One thing I don't like about this book and others in the series is that little information about Archer is given to the reader. He seems to be the vessel for telling stories of the evil in human beings rather than a real character in his own right. I also find it depressing there is no lightness, no relief from human badness, in this book or in any of those I have read in this series, but I guess that is normal for this noir genre."},{"Title":"The Way Some People Die: a murder mystery","review":"this book is very satisfying. the carecters are well fleshed out and lew archer is at his hard boilest. mcdonald has done it again."},{"Title":"The Way Some People Die: a murder mystery","review":"Lew Archer is asked to find Galley Lawrence by her mother, and the interesting thing is that he does within the first 50 pages of the book. After that, the story becomes a character study of Galley, and even though by the end Archer is able to pin three murders on her, he is never able to figure out why she committed them. The book also is a searing portrait of the underbelly of Southern California - the world through which Galley moves - filled with prostitutes, dope peddlers, and racketeers. MacDonald writes about this heart of darkness with the toughness you'd expect from a writer working in the tradition of Raymond Chandler. The long confrontational scene Archer has with Galley where he lays out the murders before her, but gets none of the answers he's really looking for, is excellent. The irony at the end involving the use of the $30,000 Galley got after killing her husband is a real kicker. The opening sentence of the book comparing \\"earshot\\" and \\"rifleshot\\" is a gem.

The story is written mainly through Malcolm's interaction with the characters he meets through the astrologer (Mr. Cox). But enough plot summery, from the opening paragraphs one sees Purdy's gift for a sort of heightened clarity that he writes with, which, when pulled together with the dialog between the rather inept and hilarious characters offers a unique experience.The novel is written in a more naturalist tone (think a modern Dickens) but don't let that fool you, Purdy is a gifted writer, with an amazing imagination, and excellent sense of irony. the reason i say it is not for all of you is that if you are looking for \\"ground-breaking\\" or \\"experimental\\" literature, or if you find you get bored when not being assaulted by an author you shouldn't buy it. If you have heard of or enjoy writers like Thomas Berger or Walker Percy then James Purdy might just be up your alley.Bottom Line: This book will appeal mostly to those with an established enjoyment of early American Post-Modernist writing."},{"Title":"Malcolm (The Noonday Press, 246)","review":"When I rated this book, I was tempted to give it two stars.

Inexplicable situation after inexplicable situation follows the boy on the bench,(Malcolm), throughout the book. The author never bothers to give a reasonable explanation about anything. I kept thinking that I would eventually discover some type of deep symbolism through further reading of the text, but to tell you the truth, I never found any. Like most intellectual snobs, I get disgusted when I waste my time reading inane works which end stupidly, and this is it.

And even today, many advertisers fail to get results when they stray from his teachings.One of the most famous examples of failing to follow his teachings: the \\"Got Milk\\" campaign. Sure, it seems clever and it's definitely high profile, but from a marketing standpoint, it's a flop. Milk sales have not moved upward at all despite the fact that milk producers are now several years into the campaign. Want to know why it failed?

David Ogilvy was another one of these pioneers, and he said, \\"no one should be in advertising that has not read Scientific Advertising at least seven times.\\" If you study any of the notable marketing gurus today (e.g. - Dan Kennedy), they are just positioning what Claude has said in a contemporary format. And even marketing for the Internet - if you look beyond the HTML bells and whistles - is still utilizing the basic psychology of sales letter generation, and copywriting, that Claude pioneered.www.randykempcopywriting.com"},{"Title":"Scientific Advertising","review":"This book is great!

Before this book and Claude Hopkins, there was no discipline called marketing. So you have to give the man the respect he deserves. In his day, Claude Hopkins revolutionized the world with his ideas on marketing. In particular, he created the science of marketing by applying the scientific principle to advertising. The very definition of marketing which is the ability to quantify and measure your advertising efforts (if you aren't measuring how well your ads are doing then you are not doing marketing at all but instead PR) came from this man, in this book.If Claude Hopkins was alive today, he would absolutely dominate Internet marketing.Yes, the concepts are way dated. Yes, the english used is hard to understand and follow at certain points. No, this book will not cause your sales to triple by giving you an easy, step by step roadmap to follow. But does that mean it isn't worth reading? I think not. Anyone who is on a quest to become a master marketer must buy this book.

However, in those few pages, Hopkins gets to the guts of the issue--advertising's intention is to sell products. So many advertising people these days think it is to win awards. If one were to learn the words in this little book, and then follow them, one would make a lot of money selling a lot of product or services.

Simply as an object, this massive edition command attention. Way over-sized and thick, it promises an intense experience in enjoyment of photography.It delivers. In fact, it delivers more than I have good words to describe. A fair part of Newton's work went to Playboy and other glamor outlets - venues that display women's beauty with little regard for the woman herself. Even so, the cover photo exemplifies the contradiction that Newton captured so often: the model as generic but unique, womanly but powerful, fashionable but animal. His diptychs might capture that sense best: one scene with some set of models fashionably clad, then the same scene with the same models fashionably unclad.Although Newton made great use of his models' lines and strength, his photos respect the woman in front of the lens. They capture her strength and elegance at the same time they record her high-heeled glamor. It makes for a complex mix, but one that I never find uneasy. Any collection of twentieth century figure photo needs to acknowledge this remarkable artist and his collaborators on the other side of the lens. This book might be the finest way to represent his work.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"Helmut Newton's Sumo","review":"Now that Helmut Newton's Sumo is available for the mass public, and no longer costing $5000+ for a massive podium-sized version, getting a copy is a no-brainer for anyone remotely interested in the king of kink's work. The book is fairly complete in terms of touching all of the major areas of Helmut's work and won't seem too repetitious for owners of previous books. While a lot smaller than the aforementioned original gigantic version, the reprint is still massive in comparison to most other coffee table books.

If one devotes an extraordinary amount of attention to a subject that is not able to carry the weight, the result is not deeply affective; it is, instead, mildly humorous. Pope called the sensation a &quot;sinking.&quot; Well, this 66-pounder is certainly sinkworthy. Also, although it tries very hard in every way, it is NOT the largest book ever made. There are many larger--the Havell edition of J.J. Audubon's &quot;Birds of America.&quot; And that book has the added advantage of genuine impact from consistently excellent art. Helmut Newton is a good celebrity photographer, but does one truly want to see a 2 by 3-foot enlargement of a woman's calf and heel? I suppose, at this magnification, one sees the wrinkles around her Achilles tendon which tell us that fashion can be painful--and vice-versa. Why not spend the price of this book on one very good photograph that you can view without a freaking table? Newton, I'm sure, has made such an image. I ended up feely very badly for him, being buried in this elephantine packaging."},{"Title":"Helmut Newton's Sumo","review":"I remember seeing the original version of Sumo at a Powell's bookstore and wanting it very much. I woulda, coulda, shoulda bought it but its huge size killed the deal; there was just no where that I could safely store it.Thus, when I stumbled upon this book here on Amazon it took me all of 30 seconds to decide to pull the trigger. Why the hesitation? Primarily because it is a Taschen publication and I have been disappointed by the quality of nearly every Taschen book I have ever handled. This one, unfortunately, is no different, and I believe that I shall return it for a different and, said hopefully, better copy for that reason (One of the pages in my book has errant ink lines running up a quarter of the page from what looks like a roller). I also have a problem with Amazon for shipping me a book with a large tear in the custom made carrying case in which the book comes, by the way, indicating crappy quality control.This is a an oversized folio book, large and heavy and imposing like the original in miniature. Its immensity indicates that it needed the space in order to do the photographic images justice. Well, I suppose that it does but the problem is that the plates are mealy looking, especially those in the front part of the book. I don't have the original to compare them to but I suspect that this granularity is due to poor reprodutions in the book and not from the original plates; although it is conceivable that the images lost some sharpness due to being blown up, but barely.Instead, I would argue, based upon my experience with Taschen specifically and Printed in Italy artbooks generally that the fault lies in the Italian printers. These days the best art books are produced in Germany or Japan. Back in the old days it would have been France and in second place Switzerland and USA. Prestel seems to consistently do the best art books these days and it causes me to wonder what the book would have been like if published by them.Anyway, you still ought to own this, I think, if you collect art books and you must own it if you collect art photography books.While a lot of the images are seemingly banal or a bit facile, others have a quirky absurdity or stark profundity that cause one to really look twice at these images.Interestingly, Newton's portraits are often absolutely brilliant. I think that the female Rolling Stone photographer whose name escapes me is generally the most reknowned portrait photographer but I think it would be tough to argue against Mr. Newton's genius.His Hockney is sublime, among others, one of his Taylor portraits captures her genius/appeal completely, and actually there are a dozen portraits that seem to have completely captured the essential nature of his subjects (Marianne Faithful, Marie LePen). Others are just inexplicably fantastic (Warhol...hmmm one wonders if there was professional envy/competition between the two, and John Malchevic whose filmic nuttiness is captured perfectly). I could go on but you get the picture.To be honest, I initially hoped and anticipated that the book would have a lot of this nudes because I can't think of another photographer who can put so much blatant sexuality into supposedly high fashion soft-core photographs. The overall quality of the non-nude pictures more than makes up for their absence.If the book itself were of higher quality it would deserve five stars."},{"Title":"Helmut Newton's Sumo","review":"\\"Sumo\\" is a wonderful collection of the best of Helmut Newton's unique vision. Fortunately, this edition is not as large and heavy of the original edition about which the fascinating documentary film was made (it's worth renting the film to see). If this was the original edition(\\"Helmet Newton's SUMO\\") it would be too big and too heavy for the coffee table and would need a special reinforced reading stand just to comfortably view the photographs. That original edition also had a hefty retail price in the $5,000 range. That original edition is now selling for $14,000 new and $9,353 used. This edition is actually a much more practical photographic book. And it won't collapse most people's coffee table. It's also a bargain price-wise.Helmut Newton had a fascinating life and his autobiography/memoir (\\"Newton Helmut: Autobiography\\") is also an amazing read. (Feel free to read my Amazon Review of that volume). It's great because the book documents his escape from Nazi Berlin and his flight around the world to escape the Nazi Death Squads. He obviously did escape but only because he became a nomadic gigolo and that tale (no pun) provides glimpses into the famous photographer's personality. It helps the reader understand why every Jew living in Germany didn't immediately flee the country before it was too late for millions of them.The biography also tells the stories behind many of the photos in \\"Sumo.\\" Now that \\"Sumo\\" is available at a reasonable price, every serious fan or collector of Newton's work needs to add it to their collection. Ditto for his \\"Autobiography\\" if a copy can be located."},{"Title":"Helmut Newton's Sumo","review":"I've never forgiven myself for not biting the bullet and snapping up the original Sumo book at what is now a rediculously cheap price. Thank you June Newton for making most of my pain (envy) go away. Your Sumo Lite version punches way above it's weight. Helmut Newton's images are so powerful they really don't need size to impress. Every image is a tribute to his unique ability to empower women, to make them look strong, in control, never making them appear vulnerable or weak. If anything, he, as the photographer, looked like the one being manipulated, directed, being told the way the women liked to be portrayed. And only a master can pull off that kind of magic."},{"Title":"Helmut Newton's Sumo","review":"This book is by far a conversation piece....I have had company that spends hours turning the pages. Even after having the book for several months, I flip through it and see photos I don't recall seeing the first time. I absolutely love this book and would highly recommend it to everyone. According to the folks at the Taschen bookstore in Beverly Hills, CA, there are fewer than 100 books left out of the 10,000 printed."},{"Title":"Helmut Newton's Sumo","review":"Well, as everyone else says, there's no other book like it. I had a look at a copy in an art photography store and thought it was ok, but would I pay two grand for it? Nah, I don't think so. Admittedly, the cover shot from the series 'Big Nudes' is impressive when you first see it, but these pictures were never meant to be printed at this size. Newton shoots fast and produces grainy photographs; at this size the pictures start losing clarity because of the extreme grainyness. There are also slight scratches and imperfections on some of the negatives, which at a normal size are miniscule, but here the tiniest scratch is blown up into a great white worm crawling over the page.Don't get me wrong, Newton is one of the great lensmen of recent decades. The work displayed here is of itself, brilliant. Even so, you could save yourself a packet and buy a quality 'normal' book of his work, where the pictures can be appreciated more easily. This book's merit lies in it being an art object in it's own right. If you actually want to savour and enjoy Newton's work, give it a miss."},{"Title":"Helmut Newton's Sumo","review":"Having just received my copy of Helmut Newton's SUMO all I can say is AMAZING. This is not just a book, but a work of art. As a bibliophile I felt I had to have what I believe is the most important book published this century...and I was not let down.

It is a definite must have in any photography book collection. Even though this is the \\"light\\" version of the book, it is still quite impressive. Still, the packaging for international shipping (I'm located in Mexico) was not the best for a product this size. The book arrived slightly bent in one corner. Not a show stopper, but it was annoying to have such a magnificent piece slightly damaged. This is the second time that large scale items sent from Amazon have arrived with minor bumps. I have never had problems with regular sized books. I would no doubt order this book again from Amazon since the savings are better than the damage suffered, but be warned.As for the quality of the pictures, it is simply and without a doubt worth the price. Could the print be better - yes it could; for the price paid, it is a good balance."},{"Title":"Helmut Newton's Sumo","review":"It's hard to believe that it has been 10 years since the Taschen art book house set the world of book publishing on its ear with the publication of the world's largest mass production book, \`Sumo' by Helmut Newton. The 66 pound, 20 by 27.5 inch book was originally issued as a signed, limited edition volume complete with its own chrome viewing stand designed by modern artist Philippe Starck.Now, upon the 10th anniversary of it's publication, comes \`Sumo' the coffee table sized edition for those who either couldn't afford the $10,000 first edition or for who (like us) the massive original was just too unwieldy to manage for ease of viewing. Either way, \`Sumo' is back and it exists to showcase and celebrate what is undoubtedly one of the world's premiere photographers and his most famous sexy, edgy, (largely) black and white work.Newton, who died in a car accident outside Hollywood's legendary Chateau Marmont hotel shortly after the book's original publication, was beyond compare when it came to his stark and somewhat controversial portraits of the world's rich and famous as well as many of the world's top models and even downright ordinary people. \`Sumo' captures all of Newton's most famous photographs including subjects such as Princess Caroline, Brigitte Neilsen, Salvador Dali, Iman, David Bowie (separately), David Lynch and Isabella Rossellini (together) Nicholas Cage, Darryl Hannah and countless others. His oft-times German (and even Nazi) influenced, S&M; images of models from Hollywood to Paris remain as strikingly vibrant and cutting edge as they were when originally shot. The full page and double truck layout of the photos add to the dramatic impact in both versions as well.In preparation for this smaller, coffee table edition, the makers (presumably June Newton) went back and reviewed each of the photo pages to see if any improvements could be made. The result are a relatively small number of substitute photos (Winnie on Deck, Cannes or Romy Schneider, for example) or alternative takes usually just a few frames apart from the original shot selection. The main pros and cons are basically that the new version is immensely easier to view than the poster size original, while the impact of the larger format pages is somewhat lost, especially on the double truck photos which are nearly larger than life in the first edition.Overall, the price tag is probably the great equalizer. Now, for the first time, the brilliance of \`Sumo' is available to the masses. After a ten year wait that may be the best news of all. Either way, this is easily one of the most impressive photo art books ever assembled. While the stand and weight add to the aura of majesty, \`Sumo' stands on it's own as one of the greatest art books ever. Yes, ever."},{"Title":"Helmut Newton's Sumo","review":"My art collector girlfriend bought the original which is how I came to know of its existence! I loved it from the start.

He's one of the best comic book artists working today. He has won countless awards for his amazing work on the DC comics series 100 Bullets. Though released a year ago from Dark Horse, this book actually precedes 100 Bullets. I believe this was originally released overseas in it's original language in either 1997 or 1999, i can't remember which. So it's older Risso, but still very good. Video Noire is a bizarre story with a female villain who happens to be the host of a children's television show. A detective is killed by her demonic child minions after he takes incriminating photographs of her in order to blackmail her, and his partner is out for revenge. To say anymore would be giving away too much. The writer Carlos Trillo has worked with Risso a few other times as well. I can only imagine what kind of stories those are.With the rising popularity of Risso continuing, i commend Dark Horse for reprinting his foreign work in english. November 2002, Dark Horse is releasing another black and white trade paperback through their Venture imprint by Risso called Cain, which i believe is an even older work than Video Noire, so it should be interesting indeed."},{"Title":"Video Noire","review":"A Xuxa-esque childrens TV-show hostess, \\"Miss Dready\\", is in reality a demonic being bent on using the boob-tube to ensnare her young viewers in her web of evil.

The plot verges on ridiculous, but the art, by Eduardo Risso, of 100 Bullets fame, is gorgeous, and there are enough good things about the book, especially the nihilistic ending, that I can give it a MILD recommendation to people looking for something VERY different.Fans of films like Angel Heart and VideoDrome will probably feel right at home with the lovely Dready....."},{"Title":"Video Noire","review":"Eduardo Risso is an awesome artist.

This is an important topic in natural healing and the word vaccination isn't even mentioned in the index. Since this book was written in 1998, perhaps the chickenpox vaccine was still very new and the measles vaccine was very commonly used. I understand that one book can't cover all topics, but this is a big one. I would think parents who are looking for natural alternatives to health and healing would like to at least question their options when considering when and whether to vaccinate their children.

I also gained a deeper understanding about what is actually happening in the body when an illness is present. I especially appreciate the complementary-therapy approach presented in the book; herb-drug interactions, when to talk to a doctor, HOW to talk to a doctor and a bit about allopathic drugs - when they could be helpful and when they are best left alone.

At last you could be more defined that simply &quot;elf&quot; or &quot;dwarf.&quot; This book loosened up the system a bit and allowed for player individuality and choice.

In addition to the dark races (such as the Drow, Duergar, and Svirfneblin), and the advanced classes (such as the Hierophant, Acrobat, Cavalier and my fave, the Barbarian), there's also new weapons, hundreds of new spells, hundreds of new magical items, the deities of the demi-humans, and much more.

I've run an AD&D; game within the past few years, and it's still just a blast, and a good break from the more mechanically-oriented 3e and 4e. While I was catching up on my AD&D; stuff, I ran across Unearthed Arcana.And ... hm. I remember loving this book in the 80's. It's still got some great stuff in it. On the other hand, it's also clear that the expected power level of characters took a huge jump between 1979 and 1985. I was a munchkin growing up, and this book indulged my munchkinism more than any book outside Dragonlance Adventures.There's some great stuff in here, like Weapon Specialization (to an extent) and a grappling/pummeling system that doesn't require a few weird percentile tables. And the polearm illustrations are fun; no longer do you have to wonder what a Bec de Corbin looks like! But outside that... well, let's take a look.* For starters, there's a new dice rolling system which not only guarantees you get the class you want, but makes it extremely likely you'll have a 17 or 18 in your prime attribute. 1e is a bit too stingy with ability score modifiers for straight 3d6 rolls (hence the 4d6-drop-lowest-assign default rolling method), but this goes way too far in the other direction.* There's broken races. How broken? Try \\"summon a huge earth elemental 1/week\\" broken. Try spell resistance broken. Svirfneblin and Drow way outclassed any of the other races in 1e, and with the expanded level advancement table, they really didn't have to pay for it.* There's broken classes. The Barbarian and Cavalier are both much mightier than even the mighty Paladin. (Though the Paladin gets a boost thanks to inheriting some Cavalier mechanics).* ...And there's broken spells. \\"Yes, a Level 1 Illusionist spell that gives a save-or-die effect once you hit 9th level sounds like a splendid idea!\\"I think the material was about on par with the sorts of stuff that had been appearing in Dragon, but it honestly throws the already-fragile balance of AD&D; straight out the window.Not all is bad, mind you. It's still a great book, and still seethes with imagination as the best AD&D; books do, but introducing the new options wholesale into an AD&D; game can throw your game way out of whack. If you're looking to play AD&D;, I'd stick with the Big Five - PHB, DMG, MM1 & MM2, and Fiend Folio. There's a reason a lot of AD&D; veterans avoid this one!"},{"Title":"Unearthed Arcana (Miniature AD&D; Collector's Edition)","review":"Unearthed Arcana is Gary Gygax's compilation of \\"extras\\" to be brought into the AD&D; game at the gamers' discretion.

I was about 10 years old and was playing AD&D;, which consisted of the Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, Monster Manuals 1 and 2, and the Fiend Folio. That year however, Gary Gygax and Jeff Grubb decided to try to add a further dimension to the 1st Ed game.This game not only adds dimensions, it adds a number of \\"fixes\\" to the game to raise problems that had come about from the initial books.Problem 1 - the level limits for non-human characters were too low. This book addresses this by giving higher ability score characters higher limits. (GOOD)Problem 2 - the fighter subclasses do not have distinct enough roles. This book separates the Paladin to become a subclass of Chavalier, and the Barbarian becomes a new class of fighter. Therefore, we have the \\"knight\\" style classes, Chavalier and Paladin, and the \\"warrior\\" classes - Ranger and Fighter, who get weapon specialisation, and the \\"tanking\\" brute class the barbarian. (GOOD)Problem 3 - charisma is not physicial attractiveness, but personal magnetism. Solution - introduce (redundant) seventh attribute = Comeliness. (BAD)Problem 4 - characters not heroic enough. Solution - make uber powerful characters who are rewarded for rolling high ability scores. Encourage players to cheat or do anything to raise ability scores. (BAD)It appears that after Unearthed arcana, for all its great new spells, magic items, class changes, and variation of the races (now you can play a Drow = dark Elf, and history was never the same again) fuelled the creation of mega-powerful characters. Ability scores rise in importance. The new race subtypes add an element of richness into the characters that was welcome. The new classes were generally good (with the exception of the comical Thief-Acrobat) but a DM might wish to be cautious before introducing all the changes here.

She loves its sounds, movement, color, ice, and even occasional floods. Her name comes from the Hoosier author's own family, mother's maiden name being Etta Hale. Elizabeth Hamilton Friermood was born (1903 in Marion, Indiana and served as a librarian in her birthplace as well as in Dayton, Ohio.My signed copy has this partial inscription: \\"This, my first book, is based on tales my mother told me about her girlhood when she lived in a two-room log cabin on the banks of the Wabash. Most of these events really happened, even the murder of my great, great grandfather, Edmond Williams. Naturally the story is liberally seasoned with my own imagination. E.H.F.\\"Henrietta's great grandfather's poem, written the day before he was murdered, was believed to leave a clue as to where the wheat sale money was hidden the day before. No generation has found it but young Henrietta decides to give it her best try. She knew the river would talk to her. She begins the search in 1892, the time at the beginning of the story, and searches into the next year during which also occurs a flood, ma's and pa's illnesses, meeting a Gypsy family (especially one violin playing boy), 2 family weddings, Christmas surprises, and expanded love for music and learning.It's a true tale of the old Indiana family life on a farm, of huckstering, and of 19th century community relations. Even with some hardships mixed into the delights of living, the book shares a time that becomes something readers will likely wish to visited.This book is for Midwestern historians, home schoolers, and anyone wanting just a really good, quick, enjoyable read. Will the Wabash give up her mysterious secret? The truth is, the Wabash story has given us the secret of another fine author of 18 books, Elizabeth Hamilton Friermood.The book is illustrated on the cover, frontispiece, plus on each of the 18 chapter beginning pages by Grace Paull."},{"Title":"The chakras: A monograph","review":"This book is important as a Western account of what is essentially an Eastern concept. The chakras are very important energy centres in humans, and are used in meditation and in cognition of the inner worlds. Leadbeater's book is fairly easy to read, and has really good colour illustrations which have since been often quoted and reproduced many times over the last 70 years. This book was written in the 1920s when the subject was little known in the Western world. Much of the material was obviously obtained from Hinduism, as the chakras are easy to see illustrated in temples in India. I must say I prefer Dr Hiroshi Motoyama's more comprehensive and recent book, but Leadbeater really did pave the way with this one.

How extremely vital it is for modern society to know the hidden system of man's anatomy!This book is a perfect and necessary complement to Samael Aun Weor's great book \\"Endocrinology and Criminology\\", which examines the chakras from a scientific/philosophic standpoint and how they relate to the endocrine system, nervous systems and the many aspects of human psychology.Forget about all the \\"New Age\\" pseudo-info on spiritual issues and matters and remember the true pioneers of the Occult like Blavatsky, Steiner, Heindel, Manly P.

The other two were crap; Nightwatch shone. Stephenson has writing chops. He moves the prose along at a breathtaking pace early and gets you well hooked into the story.

Here, Hinds' demonstrates he is not afraid to take chances with the medium. In keeping with the poem's increasing focus on aging, mortality, and the price of fame, this part of the series provides a visual contrast to the other two books. Rather than being constructed with vivid colors and bold shading, this book is done in a monochromatic scheme filled with blacks and grays. This is particularly fitting for Beowulf's world, where things are neither quite so vivid as in the first half of the poem (with the battles between Beowulf and Grendel/Grendel's mother), nor are they the black-and-white, easy answers of one's youth. Instead, Beowulf's life, his rule, his decision to enter into the last battle with the dragon is less clear. Is Beowulf doing the right thing in fighting the dragon? What are the costs and outcomes of this decision? What makes a good king and what makes a good life? All these questions and their answers, like Hinds' illustrations, are shades of gray. It's a beautiful way to address the themes of the Beowulf poem and Hinds should receive credit for this decision, if for nothing else in the series.However, that last statement should not suggest that there is nothing else to praise in Hinds' work. His illustrations of both Beowulf as an old man and the dragon, positioning them as foes more alike than different, is keeping well within the poem. As I've said in other reviews, Hinds' work is a near-translation into a new medium, sticking more closely to the essence of Beowulf than many prose versions I've read. Further, it reintroduces and reinterprets Beowulf in ways that show how relevant the Beowulf poem is comtemporarily. It speaks to its audience as much as the Beowulf poem did to its.Hinds' work can be enjoyed as a viable version of Beowulf or on its own. It's that good."},{"Title":"Luther's Last Battles: Politics and Polemics, 1531-46","review":"This book takes an extraordinarily unique approach to the discussion of the polemics of the &quot;old man&quot; Luther. Edwards proposes that many of the contemporary interpretations, of Luther's motivating psychological disposition as shaping the polemical work of the latter part of his life, from 1530 on, are incorrect. He insistently urges readers to put aside the pre-established views promulgated by Erik Erikson and his Crones- that &quot;young man&quot; Luther's troubled childhood had created a sort of ill-crazed, schizophrenic &quot;old man.&quot; Edwards consistently takes a contextual, historical, and political approach to his very extensive interpretation of Luther's post 1530 polemics, minimizing Luther's mental and physical conditions.&quot;Luther's Last Battles&quot; contains extensive interpretation of several of these latter polemical tracts. It is a task that few, if any, historians have undertaken. This being the case, it has allowed Edwards the freedom to promulgate his specific bent on the motivating drive of &quot;old man&quot; Luther.Edwards ultimately concludes, that by approaching Luther's works through his new approach, it becomes clear that he had indeed carried strong political and theological convictions. His vulgarity and apocalyptic rhetoric were ultimately a result of the surrounding circumstances of sixteenth century society in the midst of the first Reformation.Edwards's work deserves the highest praise. A reader ultimately gains an appreciation for the difficulty of such an analytical task. He has continually and effectively stressed the political motivation and interests in Luther's polemics. By attempting to provide a fresh outlook on the elder Luther, a task not often undertaken, Edwards has created an important new method for historians to use in evaluating polemical literature of the past. In so doing, he has demonstrated that the most complete evaluation of a person's persona and driving forces may be done only through historical contextual evaluation of primary sources. Goodbye Erik Erikson, Mark Edwards is here to stay!"},{"Title":"Readings in Family Theory","review":"Man, this book was such a waste of money and time and energy. The only reason I bought it was that it was required reading for a university class. It is extremely boring and overly \\"wordy\\" and just agonizing to force yourself to read. I have no idea why my teacher picked this book to teach her class with, but anyways, yeah... even if you are just interested in the topic, I still wouldn't recommend this book, but then again, I can't think of any book that I CAN recommend on this exact topic either. I mean, I'm no expert on books you can find on this topic, but you would not want to read this book for fun. If your professor forces you to get this book, you have my sympathy.Ah... and I would like to mention, specifically, that this was required for a Sociology class, and I am a Sociology major, psychology minor. I love my major and my minor, and have always been able to find something good in every book I've had to read for my major classes, until I encountered this one.

I was quite pleased with the material, which were to the point nothing garbage and you can quickly go down the road but well after i stumbled across some code defects, i came here to amazon to see what is the story.So yes while the book can be very useful. It has not been quite proofread (rather not at all). It seems it was upgraded from version 4 (my guess) without doing any work.For example I just spend about 3 hours and possibly more to read a record with encrypted password (chap 11) and it did not work. I was following everything according to the book so you can see how frustrated one can be. Online help did not help much so i was stuck.After browsing for quite a while, I found that the password field in the book was stored in 20 char (varchar(20)). When the password was encrypted and stored, it was converted to 41 char (or so) hence part of it was lost. Now when you retrieve this password, it will never work. So I finally changed the password field to 50 and everything worked fine then. Now this is just one big. In chapter 11 i found 2 more serious bugs, the code were not working (and is still not working). So i will not recommend a beginner to go through this book esp chapter 11. It will almost make you sweet! I really spent quite a lot of my time just to fix the bugs. The material is good though and track is good too. But I would recommend it only for reading and just for basic beginning programming. The code needs some serious work! You probably are better off with another book.

I am just starting the 3rd chapter and I am CONVINCED THAT THERE IS NO WAY this book could have gone thru an editor. It seriously seems like it was just written and printed! This book gets 2 stars because:1) Every code example I've done so far (about 4 in the 2nd chapter, WOULD NOT RUN, even though I copied and pasted straight from the book. I actually had to debug the book!!! The bugs were simple things too, like missing semicolons or concat (.) symbols. If I weren't already used to debugging, then I would've pulled my hair out trying to find out what's wrong.2) The solutions to the questions at the end of the 2nd chapter use programming concepts that they didn't introduce yet! A forloop is used in the solution, but loops aren't covered until chapter 4! When I went back to check my answer I thought to myself, 'Are you kidding me?!'Now, I usually don't write reviews on amazon, but I had to write one for this book.

The chapters seem to run on and on and on without fully explaining ALL of the code used in the samples [ie. code contains \\"this->var\\" but doesn't explain what \\"->\\" does]. There doesn't seem to be any consistency through out the book. Shame, the editing of this book probably suffered due to the transfer of ownership when Wiley took it over from Wrox Publishing.

I have wanted to get at least one language under my belt by the time I am 16. There are many languages out there such as Perl, PHP, Cold Fusion, ASP, Python, C++, C, and of course Assembly. Now I do not think anyone could learn Assembly right off the bat without learning easier languages first. I have a great interest in dynamic web sites and servers. Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, and free time of course are a prefect match! I have always had to learn everything I know about computers from researching by myself, whether it is Google or in this case a book.PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a language that revolves around web sites. With PHP developers are able to create a more dynamic web site then they normally would with regular HTML. An example would be a simple site with a user / login option / feature. What PHP does is although developers to code a script to handle such an option / feature.This book does a very theroe job of explaining the whole processor and background of PHP. It starts out explaining the apache side of things, showing how to set up a server on both platforms. Next it explains the syntax of PHP and has many examples. Then throughout the book it explains some functions and how they can be used. I epically liked the chapter on Dir / File manipulation. After it explains functions and examples it shows you how to use MySQL along with PHP. With is a must if you are going to be learning PHP. Also I like that it cover image manipulation.This is what I created using the knowledge I gained from this book.

That strategy is prone to SQL injection attacks, and just basic buggy behavior.

The same energy, boldness, and responsiveness to market opportunities that defined CNN's early years makes it today's company to watch and learn from in the business of international news. CNN: Making News in the Global Market chronicles how founder Ted Turner transformed his Atlanta-based company into a credible international news service in spite of his activist social agenda that challenged well-established journalistic traditions. Furthermore, his company's aggressive strategy of covering news whenever and wherever it happens, of breaking the news first, of going live from the scene, has frequently put the company in the uncomfortable position of shaping the events it relentlessly covers. This book uses first-hand accounts from many insiders, incorporating interviews with Ted Turner and company managers, with those who gather, produce, market and globally distribute the news, and with those who have signed on as CNN partners. The result is a revealing look at how an American company took shape around a strong leader, how it built and projected a world-class identity, and now prepares for stiff international competition."},{"Title":"Future Men","review":"Would you like to know how to rear sons (or teach others' sons) in such a way that their honor would refuse the lure of pornography? sons who would know how and when to fight, but would never fight for merely selfish reasons? sons with true godly masculinity--strong men who honor women, take responsibility, and refuse excuse-making? sons who honor their mother but don't become feminine in the process? sons who avoid the dual dangers of false macho masculinity and effeminacy? sons who gladly take on the role of fighting dragons, and see the Christian faith as a faith of warriors, not wimps?Those future men are today's boys, and Douglas Wilson shows great wisdom (and lots of humor) in showing how to avoid the pitfalls of our culture, our community, our media--and even our churches--in rearing truly masculine sons. He covers little and big things with equal wisdom and a charming writing style. I have no sons, but I have many nephews, and I care greatly about the fatherless boys I teach at church (but whom I cannot teach adequately by myself, without godly men alongside in their lives, their church, their community).

Wilson never makes excuses for immature behavior, but demonstrating how boys can be forged into men by teaching them through their adolescent foolishness. One of the other reviewers missed this key point, thinking that Wilson would have us believe that punching someone's lights out is his answer to Godliness. Wilson only points out that the child in the story about Teddy Roosevelt was acting on good principles, but did so in an immature way. Roosevelt rewarded the child, not for his immature action, but for his desire to preserve and protect the honor of his sister.

A masculine toughness is the only foundation upon which a masculine tenderness may be safely placed.Manners for boys should be a means of disciplining and directing strength, and not a means of denying it.And my favorite of the year...A young boy who is somewhat timid needs to learn the piety of courage.

True, it is unfashionable to structure one's family and church after the pattern laid out in Scripture, but is our aim is to please God rather than men, we dare not depart from His commands.Here lies the rub: if the Bible is fully inspired, and authoritative in all it teaches, then these \\"troublesome\\" passages from 1 Timothy 2 and Ephesians 5 are authoritative, clear and binding on the Christian family. My guess is that the negative reviewers above have a lower view of inspiration than Wilson (along with most conservative Reformed Christians) does.That being said, Wislon does an excellent job of explaining the importance of teaching our boys (I have 2) to be men. Not \\"persons\\", but men. Real men. His work is succinct, practical, and inspiring. He writes as an experienced elder, father and grandfather. God bless you, Doug, for this fantastic work.

We live in a society that wants to blame the gun for the violence instead of the person holding the gun. There is nothing wrong with guns, but we must be diligent in our instruction to our boys that they are not toys. They are weapons that can be used for good causes.(example: protecting our country) This book was a good reminder that our little boys will one day be men and the training must begin now."},{"Title":"Future Men","review":"This book gets right to the heart of raising sons, and does not pull any punches along the way. Doug is often brutally honest, but always leans on Scripture exclusively to make his points. There are parts of this book that I disagreed with, but the majority of it is great. Will definitely be referencing it in the future as my boys grow up.Some memorable quotes/chapters/points:\\"Faith is central in bringing up boys, but it is important to remember that the object of faith is no the boy. It is faith in God, faith in His promises, faith in His wisdom.\\" (11) This introduction to the book is one of the best parts of it. Great reminder about the danger of turning your children into your idols.Doug continually calls for men to raise masculine sons, but that should not be confused with raising chauvinistic sons. He strikes an excellent balance here and does a great job of distinguishing the difference. I suspect that anyone who says otherwise, including some of the other reviewers here, have not read the book.The age of responsibility starts at birth. Wise words on when to hold your kids accountable.The section on chapters on literature for boys, the sex chapters, and the sports chapter were especially good. In a culture where fiction is looked down, sex is a secret sin, and sports are little more than exercise, these were refreshing.By and large, a very good book. The only drawback is that it feels stretched to 200 pages. I think a 50-75 pages could have been cut and you would not have lost much. The book drags a little because of it, but it is worth pushing through. Highly Recommended to all fathers."},{"Title":"Future Men","review":"Thank God for Doug Wilson. What a fantastic author!Men are created to lead, to work, to protect, to become wise, and to be glory-bearers.There are two basic directions a boy can take in departing from biblical masculinity. Macho-man counterfeit masculinity and effeminacy.Macho-man masculinity accepts responsibility only for successes and shifts blame for failures.Boys are threatened from two directions: from within (not wanting to accept responsibility) and from without - a culture that is often hostile to biblical masculinity.As a young man prepares for marriage, he needs to be confident that he has the necessary strength. Women are created to be led by a strong man and marriage has many problems when a man is not strong enough or when his strength is not biblically informed.Our boys also need to learn humility AND they also need to learn boldness and courage. Our boys often veer into one of two ditches - they embrace humility without boldness which is effeminate, or they embrace boldness without humility which is destructive.Meekness toward God means our boys have a teachable spirit, and meekness toward others means, among other things, that they are not easily provoked.Boys tend to be lazy, which means that as parents one of our central duties is to teach them a strong work ethic in physical and academic labor. Boys can usually work much harder than they say they can.Mothers should blend respect with toughness so that their sons feel respected and thus loved and at the same time are not allowed to get away with things.Boys should be able to see masculine leadership throughout the life of the church. Parents who care about their sons growing up faithfully should place a high priority on finding a faithful, flourishing church - and if there is none, they should carefully consider finding a town to live in which does have one.Christians are a race of dragon-fighters. Our sons are born to this and we need to tell them.When should a boy fight? In life threatening situations, they should fight. In petty situations or when the authorities who could mediate the dispute are close by, a boy should not even think about fighting. Also, a boy should never fight over his own interests and yet be fully authorized to fight a bully when there is no other recourse.Boys must learn to treat girls and women with honor and respect. In dealing with the opposite sex, they should have a deep, abiding, and instinctive need to honor women. Christian parents must recognize that the temptation to lust comes down from Adam. They do not originate in the world or with Hollywood. They world can and does enflame these lusts, but the world does not create them. Our sons must cry out to God for a new heart - that is where true purity is found - and this true purity is needed by every boy. Fathers should check-in with their sons and not wait to be approached. Every son will benefit from father-son accountability. The purity of our sons ought to be a matter of regular prayer. Indicators of trouble can include a lowering in media standards. Scripture tells us that bad company corrupts good morals, and the movies a young man watches should be reckoned among his companions. A constant diet of pop culture is a recipe for immaturity.We must learn to ache for the blessing of God on our sons, daughters, fields and storehouses. Learning to do this without self-centered greed is a grace from God indeed"},{"Title":"Future Men","review":"I have sons, how do I prepare them?Future Men is an excellent read for knowing the basic principles that a father should under-gird his son with. It touches numerous topics such as girls, fighting, work, money, and laziness. The author, Douglas Wilson, begins by defining the obstacles that prevent boys from becoming Godly men, then enlists the fathers to take up the responsibility God has given them in the raising of a son, and finishes with several chapters on key topics, as mentioned above.I found this book to be principly sober. This book was short and concise, consisting mostly of biblical principles that sons must know and fathers must teach. Biblically, this book, was aligned correctly with the Word of God. I found all of Mr. Wilson's points to be exegetically correct and applied aply to any and all issues of our sons. Each chapter was short and carefully outlined in such a way that referencing it in the future for quick review on a certain issue is helpful. The book began and ended by establishing the truth that men are to be obedient to God. In fact, every chapter alluded to this very basic and absolutely essential truth - men are called to be obedient to God.If you are looking for a book with very practical applications to it, this is not the book. The principles outlined on each topic allow for personal digestion and personal application. For instance, Mr. Wilson does not advocate a certain type of education for our sons over another, i.e. homeschooling is better than public. He lays out the truth of what our sons need and then rightly applies the implications -fathers are to make sure their sons know the proper truth as future men.My favorite moment in the book was in the chapter on Christian Liberty. He carefully laid out the truth that Christian liberty is for the service of another, not our own personal self-will. We do have the liberty with certain practices, as mature adults distinguishing between good and evil. We are to train our sons to be able to distinguish the same and not give into their appetites for their own glutoness passions. As he closes out the chapter he tells the reader that wine makes a heart glad and that a father is to train his son to enjoy a glass of wine responsibly. He is not hypocritical in his position, just balanced and led by the truths of Scripture.I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to any father who needs a basic primer on the principles that are necessary for the training of our future men.I recieved this book from Canon Press for free in exchange for my review. I am not required to give a positive review and the opinions expressed are my own."},{"Title":"Future Men","review":"A thought-provoking guide on training up boys and young men in biblical masculinity.

Wilson's counsel is both pastoral and practical, and always tinged with his typical witty prose.His approach is very different from many other parenting books, mainly because he starts from a different perspective. Rather than beginning with the various challenges associated with bringing up boys, he challenges parents (and especially fathers) to give consideration to the type of men we want our boys to become. In every circumstance, he encourages us to think about how best to prepare our boys for mature manhood. This often results in a very different approach from what society typically advocates, in everything from discipline to roughhousing to education.If you have (or may ever have) a son or grandson, this is a very worthwhile book to have available as a reference (I expect to revisit it frequently as my son grows older and enters new stages of life). It would also be a great read for school teachers, as there is much that pertains to nurturing masculinity in the classroom."},{"Title":"Future Men","review":"Great book.

Thanks Doug!"},{"Title":"Future Men","review":"\\"As much as it may distress us, our boys are future men.\\"Douglas Wilson touches all the bases in this book. In chapter one, he outlines his premise. He points out that boys are future men and that as men their calling is summed up in five terms: Lords, Husbandmen, Saviors, Sages, and Glory-Bearers. He gives a brief summary of each of these and then moves on to show how Biblical masculinity is being replaced by effeminacy. This problem, Wilson shows, is not only existent in the world but also in the church. He presses the need for masculine hymns to take the place of romantic and flowery songs, the need for men to lead their households and be an example for their boys, and the importance of training boys to work. These are only a few of the issues addressed in \\"Future Men.\\""},{"Title":"Future Men","review":"I have enjoyed reading this book. It's nice and full of intellectual well thought out chapters.

Lot of verses from Proverbs,very insightful."},{"Title":"Future Men","review":"From the very beginning of the book, Wilson stays rooted in the Biblical view of masculinity. He starts the book by defining masculinity in the first two chapters of the book and gives examples of two extremes: either men can grow up to be overbearing jerks, or they can wimps with no backbone. Wilson shows that Biblical men are neither of these.But it's not enough to know what masculinity is without good parenting. After all, it is parents who raise children (and if they don't do the job, the rest of the world will surely pick up the slack, and with catastrophic results). So, chapter three is dedicated to fathers and their duty to raise good Christian sons. Wilson reminds us that Godly children are a great blessing and are glorious to God.It doesn't stop there, oh no. Wilson continues with chapter four which describes what a Christian home looks like spiritually. After all, the future men that Christians raise will grow up indoors surrounded by their believing parents. It is essential that boys learn to respect mothers and fathers with Scripture as the foundation for the mechanics of the house.The rest of the chapters in the book go into detail on some specific issues such as sports, dating, pop culture, school work, friends, and hard work. It of course would be in vain to try to cover every single topic that a young man will encounter during his life, but Wilson does a great job early in the book of describing the need for Biblical masculinity, how to achieve it, and covers quite a few topics as examples of applied masculinity.Overall, this is a great book to reference when raising young men of your own, or if you are curious what women-honoring, loving, Biblical masculinity looks like."},{"Title":"Future Men","review":"This book is one of our \\"often-quoted\\" books. We find the lessons coming back into our heads years after we read it. It has been very helpful for us raising our son. Although it is controversial, Doug Wilson's idea that you teach your son how to do things before the world teaches them is a good idea. I don't own a gun nor have any use for a gun, I will try to give my son an appreciation for proper and self-controlled enjoyment of alcoholic drinks before the world does. We do pray that he will be a Future Man."},{"Title":"Future Men","review":"Every book in Wilson's family series is good, but this is my favorite. It avoids current fads and deficiencies while addressing current needs and dangers. The section on men, boys, and worship is worth its weight in gold - truly a 'selah' section; and his bibliography/acknowledgments section is quite helpful too. Here is a video link of the author discussing the idea behind the book: [...].Here are some quotes:Masculine worship does not exclude women in the same way that feminine worship excludes men. Women flourish when men take spritual responsibility. Men wither or stay away when women lead in the church. So the church is not a men's club - men, women, children, and babies gather before the Lord together. Masculine worship is not worship for men; it is worship in which men fulfill their responsibilities to others. As a result of masculine leadership, women and children are free to contribute to worship rightly. But they do so because men have taken responsibility. In a Scriptural worship service, both masculine and feminine elements will be present, but the masculine will be dominant, in a position of leadership. When the feminine element leads or dominates, the result is that those who are masculine are encouraged to stay away......Church has become an activity for little old ladies of both sexes. Feminine piety is now considered to be THE normative form of piety. When the feminine element leads or dominates, the result is that those men who are masculine are encouraged to stay away.The individualization of piety has meant that individual men must try to learn how to think like a bride. They don't do this very well, and so they stay away. Those who learn to do it well may develop another problem - they may become effeminate.Music has been one of the chief culprits in the feminization of the church. THE CURRENT EMPHASIS ON 'FEELING WORSHIPFUL' IS FRANKLY MASTURBATORY, WHICH IN MEN PRODUCES A COWARDLY AND EFFEMINATE RESULT. The fact that the church has largely abandoned the singing of psalms means that the church has abandoned a songbook that is thoroughly masculine in its lyrics. The writer of most of the psalms was a warrior, and he knew how to fight the Lord's enemies in song. We must return to a world of vigorous singing, vibrant anthems, more songs where the tenor carries the melody, open fifths, and glory."},{"Title":"Future Men","review":"I am not quite all the way through with this book, but nearly, and I can tell you I went through it thus far with a highlighter! This book is excellent. It really speaks to both parents. In my view, it is highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Future Men","review":"(husband's review) To me, Mr. Wilson comes across as fairly legalistic in this book. He does not seem to offer much practical advice on parenting or mentoring young men. He spends a significant amount of time focusing on dangerous temptations and destructive cultural lifestyles, while often reminding the reader not to be overly legalistic. The book has lofty goals but fails to deliver. I am a conservative Christian, a new father with 1 young son & another on the way. I hope that I will find other Christian authors that will impart more wisdom on raising boys. Although I appreciate Mr. Wilson's aims, I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Future Men","review":"Have you ever read a book that starts well and then instead of finishing with a bang, it goes out like a whimper? That's the summary of Future Men. Great start - Wilson dives in and rescues masculinity from the onslaught of feminization. The theory put forth in the first few chapters was good, but as Wilson got more and more practical, his concept of manhood became more and more skewed and distorted. In fact, in one chapter on Christian Liberty, Wilson informs the reader that \\"one of the duties a father has is that of teaching his son to drink.\\" And, yes, he means exactly what it appears he's saying! Wilson gets so sidetracked that in his first appendix he revisits the whole Christian liberty issue again, this time addressing marijuana - and his \\"wisdom\\" on that isn't much better than on the issue of alcohol.Wilson is a huge home school guy who lives up in Idaho and I guess my impression of him is that while he is biblically-based, he is practically and culturally irrelevant. There are several books much better on the issue of raising godly young men and I would strongly suggest that someone considering this book check out some great books like Vaughn's Letters from Dad, or Ashcroft's Lessons from a Father to His Son, or the classic by J.C. Ryle titled Thoughts for Young Men, or even the short little book by the founder of Chick-Fil-A Truett Cathy titled It's Better to Build Boys than Mend Men. I have a list of books for Dads/Fathers that might be helpful.Of course, if you do decide to select Future Men, you'll probably mine some valuable gems from the book as I did - just be careful of the landmines along the way!"},{"Title":"Future Men","review":"Yes, our children have a hard time to know who they are because today's world is more complex than ever. That is a real problem, and the insecurity of so many Christians today comes from being afraid of a world they don't understand. But training our children to conform to gender stereotypes is not biblical, it's bigoted. And it will only make insecure people put on an awkward mask of hyper-masculinity.I want my son, and my daughter too, to be adults who are salt and light. I want them to have come to terms with the fact that we live in the 21st century, that many people are different, and that God's will for every human being might be a little more complicated than what Pastor Wilson might think. Security comes not from rejecting others, it comes from being at peace with yourself.So, basically, this is a book about the current culture wars. If that's what Pastor Wilson wants to participate in, too bad, but that's his choice. But please, let's not call it 'Christian'. Not only do Christians like me disagree, it might also turn many sons off Christ. And I am sure that God would rather have a boy wear a pink skirt than that he turn away from Christ - too many young men have left the faith of their parents because they were taught that they had to be a certain type of 'man' to be the way God wants them to be."},{"Title":"Future Men","review":"worthy of discussion (some points) and worthy of an answer as well"},{"Title":"Future Men","review":"Wilson has proven to be a man who prefers the old ages of male dominance to the current age of equality among the sexes, and this is not a good thing. In his book attempting to teach boys to become men, Wilson constantly warns against letting boys become \\"effiminate\\" and encourages teaching boys how to be tough. Now, of course I believe men have to be tough in order to be Christians and get along in the world, but it always irks me when a man labels almost all tenderness \\"feminine\\" and tries to avoid it at all costs out of fear that boys will become women.The cover of the book pretty well describes Wilson's feelings on the matter; in believing aggression to be a naturally masculine and God-given trait, he encourages what seems to me to be a sort of Christian bullying. For example, Wilson actually says it would be beneficial for a boy to want to \\"beat someone down to God's order\\". I can say with absolute truth that NO ONE ever became truly Christian by being beaten into submission. If my son knocked another child down at school, telling me that he did it because the other child was not a Christian would be more alarming than reassuring to me, and you can bet he'd be punished. That was only one alarming example of what Wilson seemed to believe was healthy aggression. When giving us another scenario, this time of a boy hitting another boy on the back of the head and calling him a fathead because he asked a non-Christian girl out for a date, Wilson actually said this behavior would be good! I see; now Christian children can hit other children because they're Christian? When did spontaneous aggression become Christ-like?Through all these passages advising fathers to teach their sons toughness, Douglas's typical female stereotypes ran very clearly. I guess he just couldn't resist pushing his submissive-female agenda while he was at it. His sentence that \\"women flourish through male leadership, but men wither when women lead\\" thoroughly disgusted me. If men have a problem with female leadership, that problem is taught, NOT inborn. God never once commands women to refrain from leadership; in fact, He placed many Biblical women in leadership over other people (including men), so if we really wish to to follow the Bible, Wilson's ideas are actually the opposite of what we should do.Unlike some seem to think, Wilson has a very low level of true inspiration; I've seen him shamefully twist Biblical passages out of context before and his tendency to deform God's design for women is quite obvious. Women are not born bad leaders, and any man who thinks female leadership will make his male parts shrivel and fall off needs serious therapy. Boys need to be taught to respect girls as their partners in Christianity and fellow heirs to God's kingdom, not as the people who sit in the back of church and shouldn't speak. As a Christian man with a place of leadership, Wilson should be discouraging male paranoia towards women and their ways, not encouraging a breach between the sexes. He is doing the latter, however; his statement that sexist stereotypes are actually HELPFUL in defining our roles made it very clear to me that God's influence is not what he is truly using in his advice or life.Here are some wise words from a woman I know regarding this agenda to keep women down:\\"Right now, it's a religiously and politically-popular thing to rail against the \\"war against boys\\" in school. The argument goes that unless boys get back the preeminence they used by tradition to receive, they will lose interest in school. It's not worded quite so bluntly, but that's the essence of the argument. If girls are free to excel, then boys will not want to and therefore won't. Oh, and while we're at it, say the critics of girls' academic achievement, boys need to be free to beat each other to a bloody pulp on the playground again, because sitting still at desks all day is such a girly thing and boys have no manly things they get to do. (Again, not worded so negatively, but that's the essence.)It's the patriarchy lie re-packaged for the juvenile set. Never mind that boys did well in structured, sedentary settings for centuries. Suddenly now, because a majority of GIRLS have managed to do well in the same kind of setting, it's beyond the poor, \\"sissified\\" boys. These toxic troublers of the children are trying to convince \\"the faithful\\" that the only way for boys to succeed is for girls to be absent or at least silent. Sound familiar? It's the old error of forgetting that the focus is on \\"let a woman learn\\" and majoring on the minor of \\"in silence\\" and twisting the specific, for-the-present report of the apostle not letting A woman teach or usurp authority into a for-all-time indictment against women ever learning for the sake of becoming teachers of other learners. Sure, they'll reluctantly tolerate a woman among the learners (so long as it's not among future-pastor learners), but she'd better not ever learn so much as to qualify to teach any of the men-folk!\\"The only reason I gave this two stars is that Wilson did say a few helpful things; his statement that girls who are sexually promiscous seek emotional attachment instead of sex was actually accurate and insightful, and I'm glad he advised fathers not to smother their sons with too much toughness. However, his comments that \\"righteous\\" violence among children is okay, that boys should be encouraged to bully non-Christians, and his degrading words of women and the evil of female power (even in this book which is supposed to be about boys) sink from Christianity to male preference which, unlike God's Word, should have been left in the dust centuries ago."},{"Title":"Future Men","review":"I was looking into classical christian homeschooling at one point, because I thought that it might have someting to do with re-establishing the rigor of earlier forms of instruction. After looking at people like Wilson at thought better of it. Much of what is called classical christian education is like this: worship of a bizarre fantasy of the past (espcially the old South and its pompous, lazy aristoracy) mixed with enough Latin, Logic, and Rhetoric to to make the students and parents feel superior to all those public school kids who waste their time learning the ideals of democracy. I will give this to Wilson: unlike many fundamentalists, he's pretty open about his belief in patriarchy. The only thing scarier than this guy are the people who idolize him. His ideas about manhood have nothing to do Jesus or christianity, and his ideas about women are downright evil."},{"Title":"Future Men","review":"All the sheep get in a line.This is a pretty sick perspective and may God help anyone who is unfortunate enough to be married to a man who follows these philosophies!

Holmes takes the time to wonder why the sense of smell is the quickest path to memory. He rails against puns in a way that is better than punning.

(it's also a quiet love story, by the way)"},{"Title":"AUTOCRAT OF THE BREAKFAST TABLE","review":"Two oral practices flourished in antebellum America: the lecture (or sermon) and the conversation. Lectures, such as Emerson's \\"The American Scholar\\" and sermons, such as the abolitionist sermons of Henry Ward Beecher, are well-known examples of this era. But it was also known as the Golden Age of Conversation, and its greatest practitioner was generally agreed to be Oliver Wendell Holmes, Senior.Holmes was considered an important American writer until the 1920s when he was excised from the American canon by the modernists. They depicted him as willfully provincial, and elitist. What those critics failed to understand was that the Autocrat is also a comic pose, and that Holmes is making sport of everyone, including elitists. Holmes' democratic view of conversation as an open, free-wheeling discourse where anyone could join the Autocrat at his table, as long as they enlivened the conversation, ran counter to the views of his more elitist friends in Boston's Saturday Club in Boston. Holmes loved to talk, and his love for talk made him a democrat, or perhaps a true republican.His Autocrat is a many sided character: stern and foolish, admonitory and celebratory, a polymorph who will don any temporaty mask necessary to keep the conversation alive. Holmes' playful metaphorical imagination is also a revelation. His gift for translating complex ideas into homey metaphors, aphorisms, and similes is nothing short of miraculous. In the words of another seriously comic American whom I'm sure Holmes would have delighted in, the Autocrat \\"floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee.\\"The Autocrat of the Breakfast table begins \\"in media res,\\" in the middle of a conversation, with the Autocrat attempting to set the rules for conversation at his table. They are generous rules, but even they are open to sabotage by his tablemates at the boarding house. He begins by banning \\"facts\\" from his table as impediments to conversation, (a condition that should prevail on today's too numerous current event talking head shows. But I, like the Autocrat, digress).Here's how the Autocrat starts: \\"I was just going to say, when I was interrupted, that one of the many ways of classifying minds is under the head of arithmetical and algebraical intellects. All economical and practical wisdom is an extension of the following arithmetical formula: 2 + 2 = 4. Every philosophical proposition has the more general character of the expression a + b = c. We are mere operatives, empirics, and egoists, until we learn to think in letters instead of figures.\\" \\"They all stared. There is a divinity student lately come among us to whom I commonly address remarks like this. \\"In other words, as Gibian says in his marvelous OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES AND THE CULTURE OF CONVERSATION: [The Autocrat] only asks us to study his beliefs the way a pragmatist would study the doctrines of any religion: \\"I don't want you to believe anything I say; I only want you to to try to see what makes me believe it.\\" How refreshing in this age of factoids and statisticoids recited with rancor and ideological certitude, to hear the Autocrat and his tablemates at the boarding house attempting to fashion a democracy through and by their conversation. Nowadays all we have are the unironic Autocrats, control freaks like John McLaughlin, Ted Koppel, Rush Limbaugh, and that guy on FOX whose name I have, pleasantly, forgotten.Listening to the Autocrat you can almost hear American singing. It's not exactly Walt Whitman's America, but it's still America in the hopeful, experimental antebellum era, and thus a good antidote to the cold technocratic chatter and lukewarm public relations cant we are showered with in this hypermediated century."},{"Title":"AUTOCRAT OF THE BREAKFAST TABLE","review":"The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table is a demonstration of New England civility in the 1850s.

Comprising a series of articles published in the Atlantic Monthly in the 1850s, The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table is a rambling but never disjointed first-person narrative of \\"conversations\\" between the narrator (the \\"Autocrat\\" from the title) and his fellow boarders in a Boston boarding house. I use the term \\"conversations\\" because the work is primarily monological, with the other boarders chiming in only infrequently to interrupt the Autocrat's musings and observations.The Autocrat is learned and urbane. He speaks intelligently on a diverse array of topics, including the rules governing the art of conversation (including the \\"pun-question\\", which he dismisses as \\"verbicide\\"), horse racing, writing, deja vu, the superior ability of the olfactory sense in recalling old memories, old age or \\"senectitude\\", laughter, poetry, knowledge, the benefits of rowing, boxing, hats, trees and other topics. Interspersed throughout the work are collections of verse as well.While not a page-turner, I found myself reasonably engaged throughout the work with two exceptions: (1) there are a couple of passages in French (I have no French), one of which is fairly long and (2) the budding and finally flowering romance at the end of the work I found to be rather dull reading and somewhat superfluous, given the nature of the work.While reading this book I felt as though I had escaped from my overly-structured, hectic existence - and the collection of (often vulgar) characters that pass uninvited across the stage of my life - to become a part of the much simpler yet richer world of the Autocrat. Time slowed down. Reflection and conversation were the order of the day. I realized with regret that the deliberate reflection that nourishes a flow of ideas, and from which yet new ideas oft emerge, had at some point been demoted in my own life to the status of a luxury."},{"Title":"AUTOCRAT OF THE BREAKFAST TABLE","review":"The imaginary scene is a boarding house breakfast.

First published in 1858, it is still refreshing. Don't wince at the potential for the rigid corset-style of Victorianism. Holmes casts it aside and even surprises you with the typeface in one instance. His language is often refreshing and is usually easy to read. Whether or not it is original or not I cannot say, but I recognize some of Holmes's words as influencing later writers, like Irvin Cobb and H.L. Mencken, and I imagine he influenced many more.Holmes writes charmingly. He is funny and philosophical. He also manages to transport the reader to an earlier Boston and New England. The only thing lacking is a plot.Holmes was an alumnus of Philips Academy in Andover, MA, and the library there is named after him. I'm going out on a limb here, but I think it was his genius and not his munificence that was being commemorated.PS: Do not confuse him with his son, Junior -- the famous justice of the Supreme Court."},{"Title":"AUTOCRAT OF THE BREAKFAST TABLE","review":"Delightful, because his ideas are so modern and so all-encompassing - the man thought about everything! - and yet expressed in a form genial and classical, and as non-dogmatic as you can get. His tongue-in-cheek style is a charming context for such far-ranging thinking. A grand insight into into the mind of a real American ante-bellum intellectual.But it is so endlessly rambling that I kept getting confused. Why divide it into 12 sections, when each section is indistinguishable from the others? If there is any theme or system to the material, I lost it in the intellectual underbrush. Also his style is rather turgid, even for the 1850s; I find it easy to read his contemporaries Dickens and Carroll, but I found myself having to go back from time to time to sort out Holmes' grammar.If you feel at home in unstructured literature, you will find much to love in the Autocrat.

I hope thats all you want from this, because like many other books, the software that comes with it may or may not be worth it. As the other reviewers stated installing linux can take a little patience. My best advice would be to find the right distribution of Linux. Mandrake came highly recommended to me and it has worked from the getgo, so please, if your just starting out ignore the CD's that come with this book.Now that I'm past the warning, I want to let people know that I found this book to be a good reference. For one, it doesn't give you too much information. When your just starting out, you don't need to have a bunch of useless information shoved at you. Also, I'd like to point out that if you are new to Linux, that you shouldn't expect to learn everything all at once. Yes MS Windows is easy to use, and most people can pick 75% of it up in one sitting. Linux is another story, and will take a little more time, but will offer a degree of flexibility and superior performance over MS Windows that will put you in awe.This book covers the basics, and by no means will make you an EXPERT. It will on the otherhand give you a springboard to new things, and with time it will help give you a greater understanding of Linux, and what you can do with it. Unfortunately the book is geared towards a specific Red Hat version, and as most people know, each version will be a little different, and distributions can differ greatly.

Boy, was I wrong.I realize that each Linux distribution and version has its own little percularities but when a CD is distributed with a book, especially one for beginners, the instructions in the book should be accurate for that distribution. I eventually got around the errors, but not until reading other materials on the subject.One example of this confusion is the chapter on Linux Customizing which involves recompiling your kernel. It would've been really swell if they mentioned that Redhat, by default, doesn't install the kernel source code so the instructions they tell you to follow to compile your kernel can't work.Despite what the authors say in the introduction, this is simply an awful book for beginners.

I know I wasn't and now I am compiling kernels after using linux for about two weeks. It doesn't get much simpler than this. Certainly you won't be a network administrator when you are done but that really isn't what the book is about. Thanks maddog.

Frankly that's the main reason someone may want to deal with Linux. The enclosed CD has an antique version of RedHat.Also, in a desperate attempt to be trendy some of the side bar articles are completely useless (ie 'Polish Connection', 'Alternative CD uses', etc.) They were out of place and a complete waste of time. The standard 'For Dummies' jokes are fine, but it should at least have something to do with the subject.There are a few technical errors, such as claiming NT isn't a multi-user OS (!) and a few minor hardware misprints.Bottom line: Great book to get you installed and started.

The most useful parts of the book were just reproductions of the Red Hat installation guide that walks you through installation when you boot up the first CD! The book made it seem like I needed to do all sorts of research and voodoo before engaging in such a software-guided installation, but in the end I junked the book and let the Red Had installation software be my guide. Perhaps the authors are Microsoft plants who want people to fail in switching over to Linux.Since half the book is such redundant installation 'help', I can't recommend buying it, with one exception. I give the book two stars because of the CDs: they contain full documentation and source code for Red Hat Linux 7.0, which is very convenient.

Fedora Core 1 is a powerful new desktop offering and I think you'll find that it's an exciting evolution in desktop Linux. A new chapter focusing on multimedia galore will especially knock your socks off!Thanks for reading!"},{"Title":"Linux for Dummies, Second Edition","review":"I read LeBlanc's 4th Edition book to see if it has been improved enough for Newbies. It is not. While including two CDs that have RedHat Linux v8, its installation section is still woefully inadequate with two chapters of 40 pages. For example on p22 the authors say that if you have Dell, Compaq, or HP, you should have no problem. In my experience with Compaq Presarios and HP Vectras, they use custom mobos, BIOSs, chipsets, sound, and win modems that will conflict with Linux. Another example on p31, the authors write 2 inches on video boards and monitors, the Achilles heel for getting the Linux GUI up and running.The authors' best suggestion (p65) is to get help from a local Linux Users Group; available in large metros; such as Minneapolis which meets monthly at the Univ of Minnesota's renown Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Dept! How can you get better help than that? They also have a daylong Install-Fest twice a year. I agree that this is the best way, but what about the rest of us (p2) which is this book's target audience?After researching, reading, and buying a half dozen books on Linux installation, I have yet to see a book that shows a cookbook approach for the Newbie. It would be based upon a reference computer hardware set that has been chosen for it's popularity and compatible processor, motherboard, cards, and devices. Since one can easily find and cheaply buy used, legacy components on eBay, used computer stores, electronic swap meets, flea markets, and garage sales, installation procedures could be simplified and would be direct and to the point. And be guaranteed to work! It would avoid the tons of frustration and wasted time by reading and attempting to follow all those books and Linux HowTos which are so generalized that Newbies finds them totally confusing and absolutely useless.Case in point, almost all Linux authors (p14) pride themselves that Linux will run on older, legacy hardware, probably what is in their DOS and Windows hand-me-down pile. However for a Newbie, they want to use a modern GUI, not type into a CLI. So in attempting to use this legacy equipment, the Newbie will run into the most common problem, which is carefully not mentioned by Linux writers, that the X-Windows probe for video board and monitor is not very robust compared to Microsoft Windows. Visually identifying chipset models on video boards and finding monitor sync information is one of the most critical items, yet it is rarely emphasized with step-by-step explanations and photos of reference hardware. The Newbie is not shown how to decipher the actual spec listings of popular hardware, locating the important parameters, and ignoring all the rest.Another example is dual boot (p26) Linux along with Windows, a common Newbie configuration. Again almost all Linux authors, including these authors, gloss over the interactivity required on the boot blocks by reconfiguring the MBR with the MSDOS Format command. Wannabe Linux users will find that just because you have a computer working in DOS, WfWG, or Win9X, etc, that it does not translate to a slam-dunk in installing and configuring Linux.The Newbie just isn't aware of the behind-the-scenes sophistication that Microsoft developed for Windows installs. Overzealous Linux authors don't warn the Newbie that incredibly more work is necessary to technically understand the details of each component. And if that component manufacturer has gone out of business, then avoid it with a ten-foot pole for his first Linux box.It now comes full circle that a reference hardware installation cookbook is sorely needed. Chapter 4, Installing Other Distributions, includes installation notes for Caldera, Mandrake, SuSE, and Debian, which is superfluous for the Newbie. These 10 pages could have been put to better use with a hardware cookbook because if the Newbie couldn't get RedHat v8 to install, then (s)he certainly wouldn't get the others installed either. The install troubleshooting Chapter 18, of ten (10) pages, is woefully inadequate and full of one-liners (jokes). The CLI log-in screen is here in the back (p296); why not in the install section on p62?Back to my purpose in reading these authors' book, I was expressly trying to find how to switch to the KDE GUI since RedHat's default GUI install is GNOME. The authors say (p84) that it is easy to switch and they have a Chapter 6 (p86-97) which explains the differences and similarities between the two GUIs. Yet the authors never tells HOW to switch; the Table of Contents, sidebars, icons, 20-page index, were all useless. The RedHat and GNOME Help were useless too.The critical thing that the authors left out was the GUI log-in screen, which had no pix. Although I discovered the secret with RedHat Linux 9 (March 03, Shrike release), the GUI log-in screen has a \\"Session\\" button along the bottom row. I had previously ignored them; but lo-and-behold! It is for the GUI startup selection. A serious omission on part of the three authors.An important area that the authors discuss adequately is the systems administrator account and user accounts, explaining that Newbies can crash the system (p98) by an inadvertent keystroke (mouse-click). The Linux OS can be pretty fragile as a root user. But further explanation of the superuser, especially application superusers, and users & groups is not well explained. As listed on p286, important applications that attract Newbies to Linux in the first place, such as a Samba fileserver, an Apache webserver, and MySQL and PostgreSQL databases are not covered at all.And last, but not least, the authors put in another one-liner to install and use a tape backup (p308) because Linux will fail, you just don't know when. The authors omitted installing a tape drive, neither using the Tar nor Amanda tape backup utility, nor explaining the disaster recovery process. From authors who have umpteen credentials, this last omission is almost unforgivable."},{"Title":"Linux for Dummies, Second Edition","review":"I installed Linux from the CD in the back of the book (5.2).

While the book started out very very easy in the Installing Linux Chapter, and in fact helped me more than the Linux docs on the RedHat 6.0 CD, it lost me big time when it gets to the Mount Point part of Disk Druid. It also failed to say that once you have used FIPS to partition spare space on your HD, you have to delete that partition in order to install it as a linux partition. This of course I didn't find out until I got to the Mount Point section of the installation instructions. The Mount Point instructions also are very very sketchy at best and I am completely lost with what I'm supposed to do here because I know nothing about Linux, hence the reason why I brought the book. Jon Hall assumes alot about people who know nothing about the Linux operating system. In all I'm dissapointed because not only does it slack of there but at numerous other places in the book as well. Please don't buy this book, rather Australia Personal Computer Magazine have a better learning system for Linux with the Linux Pocket Book, which covers everything you need to know on how to get started and installing.

The bad news is that it crashes several times trying to load before loading successfully. But seems like the computer gives in eventually and it loads up. The order of loading up did not match the book and the screens shown didn't match either. But that's mostly a nusance as you can figure that part out on your own. My main problem is that it's written from the point of view from an expert and not in the point of view of somebody totally alien to linux. I do think that once I get a handle on Linux, this book would be an excellent quick reference. Maybe it's not the book's fault. Maybe Linux is just a complicated subject.

I can see the reason for doing this, but for a Dummies book I think it should be simple and to the point. Also, the author states that you cannot use the included cd for an AMD or Cyrix cpu (Intel only). This is outright incorrect and has probably disuaded thousands of people from using the cd.

Some of the specific screen illustartions are either out of date or do not match those that come with the operating system supplied.Suggest obtaining the Que guide rather than This one.

Running from one end of the spectrum to another, if one was completely new to linux (aka, has just heard of it and thought this book was the answer), they would be completely let down, and cursing themselves for opening the plastic sleeve (meaning they could not return it).

I have about 16 years of computer experience, but I found this book very frustrating. I was able to load install Linux, but I attribute that more to RedHat than to this book.

Stay away from this stinker."},{"Title":"Linux for Dummies, Second Edition","review":"I love the Dummies books, but this book doesn't help much in understanding the main things a newbie wants to know how to do. I know, I am one."},{"Title":"Linux for Dummies, Second Edition","review":"I will try to add to what the others have already written. Even though there is absolutely no hand holding with this book, I was able to follow along and get the installation going (not easy). However, I continually received a mysterious &quot;input/output&quot; error about half-way into the installation. When I contacted IDG books for an explanation, I was pointed to Sun's installation website (where I should have looked before buying the book). However, if the person read my e-mail at all, she would have seen that I knew how to set up the partitions and get the installation running; I simply couldn't figure out the error message. I was finally told that they did not support Red Hat Linux! What a copout!!I then had to buy an Official copy of Linux (the install was successful) and figured I could at least get my money's worth by learning the basics of Linux. I wanted to edit a file so that xWindows could start automatically. However, the author fails to mention how to get out of a text file when you're finished! I combed through every page of the book including the index because I couldn't believe that an author could be so negligent. Believe me, it's not straightforward especially for a windows user like myself (you have to hit 'Esc' to get into edit mode, then type ':wq' to exit). I'm no dummy. I have a bachelor's in mechanical engineering and have designed a number of windows and dos-based applications. However, when the author doesn't have solutions to questions and simply neglects to fully explain even the most basic elements of Linux, it's time to look for another book. I'm simply writing this to make sure that no one else wastes their money on this poorly written book. It really gives a bad name to the other ...dummies books."},{"Title":"Linux for Dummies, Second Edition","review":"I was not as impressed at this book's attempt to be a beginner's guide for Linux, as Linux is a difficult OS to master. I purchased this book for our IS staff to get familiar with the OS or us to run the Apache webserver.

There have been plenty of times when I'd searched for quick, plain-English answers to everything from installation tips (when a search through Deja News served me better) to how to use glint -- only to find little if any use. I applaud the author's attempt to cover finding the lowest common denomenator for something as complex as Linux. This is not a book for total newbies, however. A better choice might be &quot;Using Linux.&quot;"},{"Title":"SAS Training Manual","review":"This book has a number of faults, but the most glaring fault is the title.

There are a few token \\"how-tos\\" thrown in like the diagrams for building snares in the wild that look like they were dreamed up as part of a Saturday afternoon Cub Scout project, or the ambush formation that would have allied troops shooting toward each other across a road.

Zonker is off to defend the freedom of the beaches, B.D. is off to defend the free press embedded with the American forces, and our CIA intern is off to defend free time activities like the annual post-game riot. The soap opera continues, as it has for so many decades now, about the way MST3K would if it commented on the news.

But Still A Must Read."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"It seems that general opinion of this novel points to disappointment in the similarity between Kane And Abel and this book. Though I must say I read this novel before Kane And Abel, I nevertheless enjoyed both books. It was brillance on Lord Archer's part and I think credit cannot be simply taken away from him. However, one drawback of this particular novel is its disappointing ending, at least that's what I think. And that was also why I did not rate this novel a five-star."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"As eager as I was to see which media magnate would come out on top, I was disappointed by the similarities between this novel and Kane and Abel and, like the reader from Wisconsin (below), I was also dismayed by the poorly developed storylines.

I was dissapointed however with the parallels found between this and Kane &amp; Abel and As the Crow Flies. I enjoy that kind of storyline, but perhaps a little more diversity than two men rising above all else.... Otherwise still a good read. It kept me turning pages yet I feel there were to many leaps without explanations. One thing though, Is that I would now like to read biographies on the two real life characters and compare 'notes'. Perhaps if anyone could recommend where I might find out more about who the two characters EXACTLY were and their lives."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"Jeffrey Archer (almost) never fails. This is one of his better works, with good character development and an intriguing plot. I especially liked the way he flipped from one protagonist to the other as he traced their separate but parllel tracks to success and power in the media (newspapers and other outlets) business. As usual, the plot is suspenseful and full of unexpected twists. You cannot put it down. I also appreciate the fact that Archer, unlike Ken Follett,or even (alas) Tom Clancy and John Lecarre almost never resorts to lurid titillation to capture your interest. He is a great and dependable writer who shows one needn't be crude to captivate the reader."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"The Fourth Estate had it's moments, but I have to agree with the other readers in that it's not one of Archer's best. There weren't the usual surprises, and I really didn't care what happened to the characters. If this was your first Archer novel, keep reading! I must recommend &quot;Honor Amoung Thieves&quot; and &quot;Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less&quot; as my favorite page-turners."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"I used to be an ardent fan of Jeffrey Archer. I have read Kane &amp; Abel and the Prodigal Daughter umpteen number of times. But his recent books are a big disappointment for me. I really wish that he comes up with a different storyline other than Kane &amp; Abel and builds on it for a while."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"This book is a fine novel,but I am slightly disappointed that Archer did not invent a storyline,and merely borrowed the events in the book from real-life &quot;battles&quot; between media tycoons.Having said that,it was an enjoyable read although,contrary to another reviewer\`s comment, the ending WAS predictable."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"I really thought Jeffrey Archer did a wonderful job with this book. The way he brought the characters into conflict to enhance their own lifestyles and lives was reminiscent of Shakespeare. Even though I am only 15, I thought this book was excellent in the way it showed not only two people's different rises to power, but how he developed these characters into people you could envision. I really enjoyed reading such a great masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"To those who have read Kane &amp; Abel, The Fourth Estate is a bit of deja vu. The plot is essentially the same. Two men - one a refugee from a war, the other an Ivy League-educated millionaire get pitted against each other and will not cease until the other man is driven out of business. The action is rivetting and makes the book a compelling page-turner.The book is actually based on real-life characters, and a few real incidents too. Readers will find it tough not to see the similarity between Keith Townsend and Rupert Murdoch.The way the story is woven is also reminiscent of Kane &amp; Abel, however the book does not sag one wee bit in action. I assign five stars to this book because that's the maximum!"},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"Jeffrey Archer is one of those authors - the kind that people love to hate. He writes fiction that requires no real thinking to get through, just a great sense of wanting to be entertained.In the Fourth Estate, Archer describes the lives of two ficticious (although clearly based on some well-known real life moguls) newspaper barons. He explains their differing beginnings (one humble, one rich) and intersperses this with the story of a battle to win a business empire.The story is every part the cliche &quot;page turner&quot;, especially towards the end, when the climactic chapters and the way they build up a great sense of suspense is testament to the enjoyable experience you have reading this book.This was my first Jeffrey Archer novel that I'd read - if you're in the same position it's a great place to start."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"At last, Archer brings us back to the classic man-against-man novel, as in his successful &quot;Kane and Abel&quot;. This is a must-read novel, full of wonderful character development, clever, yet manipulative story lines and riveting endings at each chapter.From the opening chapter the reader is totally immersed in the two main characters -- Armstrong and Townsend, from two completely different backgrounds. Their lives seem lifelike, and not plastic and phony, like many authors characters. The reader becomes emotionally attached to one of the charcters, and cheers for their favorite one, right until the bitter end. The plot twists are so remarkable, and riveting, it is easy to read 200+ pages in one sitting!One wonders how Archer continually comes up with such brilliant ideas. The only bad thing about this 750 page novel was reading the last chapter. If only all novels were this excellent"},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"This is my first Jeffery Archer novel, and it accumulated 2 strikes against it after the first two chapters. Why would an author chose to write the final two chapters and place them in front of the book? I felt like I knew the ending before I had been reading 30 minutes. When I read a novel, I need a &quot;good guy&quot;, a hero, or an underdog - simply someone to root for. There is very little of this in The Fourth Estate, because the main characters are despicable scoundrels. Read the book to learn how to bargain in open markets. Read the book to learn how a book gets on the &quot;bestseller&quot; list. Read the book to learn how penniless young hustlers survive with a combination of luck, opportunity, and talent. But to read this book for any other legitimate reason, you are likely to be a little disappointed. To be fair, I have to admit that this is a fast-paced read and has enough exciting moments to keep any casual reader entertained through a long, rainy weekend."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"We hear much of how the media of the world is controlled by the hands of a few men. THis fictionalized account of Rupert Murdoch and Robert Maxwells fight over the worlds media empires will help all those interested in how the media operates in the world today(or more precisely in the 1990s). This book is also a superb read, it combines the flair of real life with the fictionlized account of the private affairs of two great men, both of whom a flawed. A great character study. By far it is Archers best work."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"The best part of the novel is the early life of Lubji and Keith. They are really charming characters as young boys, but then they turn into disgusting adults.What I like most about Archer's books is the richness in cultural content. I can say that I learned more details about British culture from these novels than I could have done from any other source. I also learned to read and write English through Archer's books. Whenever I write a piece of text or speak in English I can't help making use of phrases and ideas I read in the Fourth Estate, As the Crow Flies, the Prodigal Daughter and all these books. I've even started to write my own stories following his style which I hope to publish someday.I think Archer should write the biography of a real-world leader like Helmut Kohl (rise and fall), Pope John Paul II or tycoon Bill Gates."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"Not recommended. The story could have been told in far less than 742 pages. The first part was intriguing, as we were introduced to the two main characters -- two children in different parts of the world with vastly different lifestyles, both clever and entrepreneurial. Their devious ways were entertaining. When they became mega-business competitors as adults, it was mildly interesting. But by the time I was half-way through the book, I realized that I didn't care about either of them. There was a great lack of character development. As businessmen, they were ruthless and amoral; as people, they were uncaring and self-centered. There was nothing likeable about either of them. The last 300 pages were nothing but repeated plotting and scheming against each other, ad nauseum. But because I had read other books by this author that were exceptionally good, I plodded on, hoping for an exciting conclusion. Disappointingly, the ending was extremely ho-hum. The only bit of satisfaction for me was tossing this book into my trash can."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"Jeffrey Archer is a master of the short story with a twist. This novel seems to be a number of short stories connected together in the guise of a full-length novel. And thus it loses the elements that could have made it a classic. In addition, it seems that most people who have negative comments on this book, are comparing it to &quot;Kane and Able.&quot; I confess to not having read that book (although I plan to soon) but have read many other Archer stories/novels. This entry is a good read but Mr. Archer misses the mark when he fails to keep the reader rooting for the main characters. As the novel begins, we are introduced to the two main characters and come to understand that they each have fatal flaws. We know from the beginning that they won't grow up to be likable characters and yet we hope to understand their view points. Instead I ended up hoping they would both drop off the end of the earth. I would refer uninitiated readers to Archer's, &quot;As the Crow Flies,&quot; for the ultimate &quot;good read.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"The format was vintage Archer--two &quot;heroes&quot; from completely different backgrounds climb to the top of their field and become archrivals. Sound familiar? While the alternating storyline style is entertaining, perhaps it is becoming a little stale.As usual, Archer develops the main characters exceptionally well and introduces a number of stunning women (how is it that his characters always find these women?). But the myriad of minor characters could have gone farther.Archer continues to make the occasional mistake of having an American use phrases that only a British person would use, but generally he gets it right.I was disappointed to find a couple of spelling mistakes (not the British vs American spelling variety, but genuine mistakes) in a bestselling book.There were also a few underdeveloped storylines (such as the KGB's role in Armstrong's life) or hurried and confusing lines (such as Armstrong's dealings in Berlin that began his rise to power).But the one thing that bothered me to the end was that the Armstrong character, who had been so attached to his mother as a boy, never once even THOUGHT of his family much less tried to find them after he was forced to flee from the Nazis. How could he spend his entire life without knowing what happened to them (or providing a better life for them)?In the end, it was a good story, but shallow in many ways. I have read all of Jeffrey Archer's novels since I was first captivated by &quot;Shall We Tell the President&quot; but either I'm getting older and more critical or he's failing to live up to his past successes."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"Seldom have enjoyed a book as much in which the main character was not female!!!! The major players in this story are at once, charming, repulsive, admirable and dispicable. Always kept me guessing. The plot exceedingly well laid as it plays across world history. My first Archer novel, definitely not my last."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"I was very disappointed with the state of this book. It was in very poor condition and stained. I knew that it was second-hand but it was stated that it was in \\"good\\" condition."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"I have enjoyed many of Mr. Archer's novels, but this one did not seem to be up to his usual standard. Like &quot;Kane and Abel&quot; and &quot;First Among Equals,&quot; it tells the life stories of ambitious men who become bitter rivals. However, the characters were not likable, which made it difficult for me to identify with their struggles.More damagingly, one of the characters was from a Jewish background, but the novel is full of the most elementary errors about Jewish culture. The author obviously did no research in this area. I can't help wondering whether the book also contains errors about Australian culture (the background of the second character) which I was unable to spot."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"I am an ardent fan of Archer's and have read every single book of his. However, this book confirmed my belief that Mr Archer is going senile. Am I the only one who noticed the likeness of the plot of this book to that of Kane And Abel? How can you rip-off your own book? I simply couldn't believe that any human, let alone an author, could steal his own story line. If you're an Archer fan and want to remain so, I STRONGLY suggest you stay clear of this book. It's reall ynot worth the disillusionment."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"After reading Honor Among Thieves (my first Archer book), I was extremely disappointed with this book.

If you've never so much as take a glance at a story by this master of storytellers, then go ahead take the plunge.

As for all the Jeffrey Archer fans, who is like myself, out there you will sadly be disappointed as this is merely like a merging of two great novels that spellbound all of us, &quot;Kane And Abel&quot; and &quot;As the Crow Flies&quot;.

A story of a lifelong battle between two newspaper tycoons, it is fast paced and entertaining. I enjoyed it immensely."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"I'm usually very fond of Archer's novels and particularly liked \\"Kane and Abel\\"...in fact, it is probably one of the best books I've ever read and it immediately moved Archer to my list of \\"favorite authors.\\" He's very much at home in multiple genres, ranging from multi-generation sagas to spy thrillers to political dramas to short stories.This book opens with nearly the same premise as Kane and Abel...two children born in very different circumstances on opposite sides of the globe who grow to become arch nemises. With expectations that we'd be treated to another K&A;, this book fell short in numerous ways...so short that I lost interest partway through and just skipped to the end. For me, the main problem was the characters themselves - like two self-absorbed asteroids hurtling towards each other, I just really didn't care if they obliterated themselves in the end.For those who know the industry, it isn't too hard to guess who Archer patterned his two media-mogul main characters after. They aren't the most lovable guys in the world, just like the characters in the book. Their business-is-war and take-no-prisoners attitude towards life and career isn't particularly endearing, and as a result, Archer managed to somehow give us two antagonists rather than dual protagonists as in Kane and Abel.There are other Archer novels that far surpass this one, most notably \\"As the Crow Flies\\" and \\"Kane and Abel.\\" I like much of Archer's work...just not this one."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"The backdrop for this novel is the greed for power and money found in the world of mass media conglomerates. It seems the primary motivation of the characters is greed and a lust for more whether its power or prestige. I'm not convinced that this book makes anyone think any original thoughts. It seems to be a basic plot that was not that difficult to originate."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"Wow! This was one of the most exciting novels I have read in a long time. I kept thinking as I was reading it how many of my friends would enjoy it, too. It's a Kane and Abel-type story, the clash of two titans in the newspaper business. What I loved the most about it was all the twists and turns of one-upmanship that each was able to pull on the other! This author's knowledge of the business world, and of human nature is just astounding."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"Once again Jeffrey Archer brings us a Kane &amp; Abel type of story, which he writes so well. He builds two very different characters and entangles their lives to present a superb story that can be easily read in one sitting... you just can't put the book down! The only bad part? when you finish the last chapter you'll be left wanting more!"},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"The world of the news media is entered into and explored in this mid-nineties Archer thriller, as the lives of two powerful media moguls are followed from the day of their birth announcement to the moment they land on the obituary page. Keith Townsend, an Australian newspaper magnate, has his eyes set on the big time with hopes of starting a national daily newspaper in his home country and purchasing papers, radio stations and television networks in Britain and the United States. Richard Armstrong, a Jewish holocaust survivor turned British army officer, turns his passion for the news into a successful publishing company, with personal dreams to one day becomes a major player in the world of the press. The lives of these two men come into contact again and again in professional circles, as each vie to control the same or rival publications and companies. In the end, only one man will be left standing. The only weak link in the novel's strong storyline is the decision by Archer to place two of the closing chapters at the start, apparently to keep readers guessing throughout the rest of the book as to how the two central characters arrive at the places we first encounter them. Unfortunately, it also leaves no mistake as to the path both will travel down with one hundred pages to go."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"I enjoy this book.

Thanks a lot."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"I have recently purchased this book, and can't put it down. I also have 'As the Crow Flies', which was excellent as well.

This story whips by, and will never cease to please or entertain. Pick it up, and let it take you along."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"This was not one of Archer's best. Being the third book I have read by him I was dissapointed. It was continuous storytelling.

While possessed with an engaging style which enabled me to power through over 700 pages, the novel portrays two unlikeable business titans in a way which leaves the reader with little to ponder (if only to use the book as a tool to repair their own business lives).The only really redeeming information is a side primer on how a book becomes a New York Times Bestseller: there is a secret list of 15 monitored book stores. This must somehow explain how this novel made the list"},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"THE FOURTH ESTATE by Jeffrey Archer (author of KANE &amp; ABEL, one of my favorite novels of all time) . . .this tale again involves two men . . . though from different backgrounds, they stand face-to-face in an attempt to beat each other and control the biggest media empire in the world . . .

This is a story of a conflict, in the sense, of the two main characters of the story. The emphasis of the narration is on their life and their &quot;love&quot; for success. The author maintains the pace of the story in a clever way. The reader is never allowed to form an opinion about any one of the characters until it is fairly clear whom the author sides with. The characters are sometimes unrealistic and farfetched and you rarely do identify with majority of their feelings, but having said that, this isn't an &quot;intellectual&quot; story about which you ponder after reading it. It is good to read with some coffee on a dull rainy Sunday.About the story. Keith Townsend is born into a well to do family in Australia, while Lubji Hoch is born into a poor Jewish family. Even as children, both know what they want from life eventually, and train themselves in their own but different worlds to realize their ends. At some point in the story they are pitted against each other. From here on they try to outdo each other and in doing so cross every possible limit and boundary.

Even though the chapters alternate so that one media mogul has every other chapter, I had to keep checking back to remember who was who. I didn't get to like--or hate--either one because I had a hard time really understanding them. The other characters were basically non-existent.

In fact, its almost a carbon copy of the great novel. Its weakness, and its sole difference from Kane &amp; Abel, comes in the poor character development of the supporting cast, with the exception of the adversaries.

A tedious tale from the master of the formula novel. Both the central characters are ruthless, charmless men, with whom it is very difficult to relate or empathise.

The plot is about 2 media empires and how they were built: by &quot;monsters&quot;, who did anything to get their way. By portraying the monsters first as boys growing up, we get to see how they changed and became the powerful figures as adults. Every scene is related to something that happens later, but because the men are immoral, only one side is presented. We don't get to see any redeeming qualities of the man who is the worse of two evils, and the man who survives is only too glad to gobble up the empire of the one who fails. That the two lead characters of the book closely parallel the actual lives of media moguls cannot be overlooked. The problem is discerning what is fact from fiction. Since the characters are so overwhelmingly immoral, it detracts from the being able to say &quot;so that's how it was.&quot; I can understand why Robert Maxwell wanted to stop the book, it can't be all there is to know about him, nor about his competitor. Overall, this is a minor drawback to a well-paced book about the real world and its power brokers"},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"A serious all-encompassing look at the rags-to-riches versussilver spoon stories as only Jeffrey Archer can do.

But then Armstrong's character was divorced from early development. From clever and observant and linguistically talented, Armstrong became an ill-mannered boor with Henry VIII's eating habits . . . all without explanation. Great opportunity for character exploration was sacked. Keith was never a mystery, driven with an occasional hormonic urge. There was no need to jump back and forth between the early decades of their lives. I kept on looking for the purpose of the jumping around but there was none to be found. Crisp but empty. The only good lesson was about bargaining around page 48. I finished it only because I'm compulsive. After all that disappointment, cutesy ending was insulting.

They are right. It's thinly disguested Maxwell and Murdoch. It's no wonder they sued to stop publicication of the work.Each character has their share of sleeze. Both were willing to do whatever it took to come out on top. But neither had the good sense to recognize when they should let it go... and let the other ruin each other.Indeed, ask yourself before the end - which man deserves to triumph.

He has betrayed the promise he showed in 'Kane &amp; Abel' and 'As the Crow Flies'. I am still to come to grips with the fact that an author who could write something as brilliant as the ones mentioned above, could sink so low as to produce such trash. In 'The Fourth Estate', Archer has tried (unsuccessfully) to combine an unauthorised biography of two leading media personalities with a reworking ok 'Kane &amp; Abel'. That a comparision with 'Kane &amp; Abel' has been made is in itself an insult to that book, and I have permitted myself to mention it here simply because the selfsame authore was responsible for that brilliant creation and the comparision serves to illustrate where he stands now. The only saving grace of the book is Archer's engaging style which, despite the lack of a powerful storyline or commitment to back it up, still makes for a reasonable fascimile of good reading.

I'm a huge fan of Archer's and within his portfolio of novels are gems like this one. This story has two main protagonists born at the same time but worlds apart geographically and socially. One a peasant, one a son of opportunity. Both have a common trait, the desire to succeed. Within that desire is a skill with people, a sharp mind and a clear cut vision.Archer colors in his characters by provenance. We follow the characters from their birth through their formative years and as we move with them, Archer teaches us about them. We follow them as they learn their various crafts and finally, when their worlds collide, we know all there is to know about them which allows us to, somewhat, anticipate their moves based on their individual motives.This is the beauty of Archer's work. Obviously a highly intelligent man, Archer writes at a level that draws you in by bringing text alive in your mind and putting you in the rooms with the characters. Maybe I sound overly impressed? Well, I have to admit, he is my favorite author.This book opens with what is, effectively, the last but one chapter then takes us to the start of a wonderful saga that spans many continents and many, many years. High finance is involved as our cast members evolve from humble beginnings to powerful positions in a more modern world. Initially driven by the desire to succeed, they clash over a business deal and one wrongs the other. So starts the feud. The feud fuels both men and, impulsiveness born of the desire to one-up the other brings about eventual downfall but ... who is the ultimate loser?Read the book, enjoy it, absorb it then, go get yourself another Archer novel.First class literature."},{"Title":"The Fourth Estate","review":"As with another of his books, Kane and Abel, Jeffery Archer treats his readers to beautifully developed characters in opposition, spicing up descriptions of their early lives with his gift for inserting believable accidents and coincidences that lead to what we now refer to as \\"six degrees of separation\\". The two men in this book, both media kings, will remind anyone of Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Townsend. What is always such a treat when it comes to Archer's work is that nagging suspicion that with his own high flying career as a member of parliment and access to a certain portion of the glitterati, he might actually know something about the real life people that inspire his stories that we don't. It is also a well researched look into the world of news production, the fourth estate, including edifying behind-the-scenes- information.

She was crying, frightened, in bed, because the story had scared her. I confess I hadn't read it, but since it came home from her Catholic school, I assumed it was okay. It's a frightening, violent story, especially for a little girl. There is time to deal with the explicit stuff (torture, a lance through the base of her skull, etc) when children are older and better able to understand. I am certain our Lord does not want children frightened in this way.

The author has standing from the totality of his life experiences as a participant in much to know the facts of which he speaks and the nuances of the Cuban (and Hispanic) culture; his story is also well foot-noted with citations. I first read this book back in the '70's or '80's, and got this copy to loan out because it is also so germane to today's struggle for America. Additionally, Lazo's observation, on page 419 that \\"An ideology,as I understand it, is a habit of thinking and feeling so ingrained and compulsive that it functions independent of reality. It involves such a strong commitment to a doctrine that if empirical truth conflicts with dogma, it is truth that becomes distorted\\" so fully describes the insane \\"political correctness\\" of today, when any manner of excuse is parrotted to avoid defending liberalism on its merits, or to ridicule truth or silence any challenge to its ideas.

Her plans include taking a lover, and not just any lover, but the handsome widower, James Valliant, Early of Kendal, who has been the object of her fantasies for many years. Lord Kendal's first meeting with Celia is awkward and embarrassing and she asks him to forget it ever happened. He believes that will be an easy task, however, forgetting Celia is not easy. Celia's moment of Grand Passion is thwarted by a misunderstanding and masculine pride and James runs back to the Continent and Celia back to the country to settle her late husband's estate. In the country, Celia makes the acquaintance of Christopher \\"Kit\\" Valliant and a charming little boy, Charley, Lord Paxton. Celia soon falls in love with the emotionally starved boy and the boy with her until James returns to find Celia has interfered with his strict regimen he has planned for his son. Celia discovers Valliant family secrets and tries to set things right, regardless of her interest in Lord Kendal. James can't help being drawn to the charming, outspoken young woman, yet their past and his pride could prevent Celia from experiencing the passion she's long dreamed of. This story has all the trappings of a Lifetime movie. It is incredibly cliched, and if I had known that the hero was a widower, I could have predicted the plot without even reading the book. Celia is a great character and I admire her for her actions and recognizing her desires, however, I hate James and don't understand why Celia loves him. Attraction/desire is not the same as love. I prefer stories where there's courtship and romance. The story has more depth than most novels with the same plot and it may bring the sentimental types to tears. I would recommend this book if you prefer the spice and melodrama of Regency Historicals."},{"Title":"Celia's Grand Passion (Regency Romance)","review":"I expected a pleasant tale but was not ready for the maelstrom of emotions this book contained. Every character was so well introduced and fleshed out! You were allowed to form opinions and then have them dashed as you found out each person's background.My slight relating of the story will not do it justice -- Lady Celia Greer, widowed and wealthy has arrived in London to take in the season. On her first day, she sees a man (Lord Kendal) who has dominated her dreams - they have never formally met. She had seen Lord Kendal (James) leaving a church many years before on his wedding day, beautiful beloved bride on his arm. Chance has thrown them together again. He is now a widower, and being an experienced diplomat, he possesses the ability to both charm, yet distance himself from everyone. Thinking to have a quick, meaningless affair with the beautiful Celia - James finds himself faced with much more than his icy heart can deal with. Their unorthodox first meeting and subsequent encounters and conversations are amongst the best I have ever read. Will Lord Kendal be Celia's \\"Grand Passion?\\"The romance will take you from London to the Lake District where you become better acquainted with Lord Kendal's son Charley and James's brother Kit. Along the way you will learn of Celia's disappointing marriage and Lord Kendall's disastrous union also. Some diplomatic adventures are introduced as you meet a Russian general and famous poet.

Looking in society in the 20th century makes you chuckles at the misdemeanors the youth of 1900s were held accountable for in their young lives. Aichhorn presents his ability to treat his institutionalized patients as simply applicable psychoanalysis. Although he stresses that it takes an educated psychologist to deal with the &quot;delinquent&quot; issues of the youth, I found his techniques merely to be reverse psychology. For instance, a juvenile choses to behave one way for revenge or ignorance, Aichhorn allows this behavior to continue in his presence without confrontation or modification until the juvenile tires of the behavior or comes to realize the behavior is not effective in its true desired outcome. Aichhorn's constant repetition of &quot;we will discuss this late&quot; was extremely annoying. He may have well just gotten to the point because the subsequent explanation was not worthy of the wait. For any student that may be required to read this book for a class, convince your instructor that there must be something more revelant to today's issues. If you must read it, make sure your chuckle (or cry) at the minor infractions juveniles of the early 1900s were institutationalized for. Society changes quickly."},{"Title":"Silence in the Snowy Fields: Poems","review":"This first book by Robert Bly is definitely a classic. It is certainly one of the best books in modern poetry--a landmark! Along with James Wright's The Branch Will Not Break, this book defined a generation of poets in the late 50's that decided poetry had become too dull and scholarly. These poems are alive and rich in vivid imagination.

The poems will leave you spellbound."},{"Title":"Politics or Christ","review":"I got this book because I was curious about everything I hear from Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell and the likes. It is a stunning confrontationl masterpiece. It is very blunt and to the point. I was shocked at the things that are in the book.I have heard that Pat Robertson resigned from the Christian Coalition because of this book. It must be true! There is solid biblical facts that NO ONE can deny! I now understand why Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, James Kennedy and John Hagee will not openly discuss the book with the author. It will EXPOSE each of them!I sat and cried and repented for my actions and ignorance. R. Johnston is a hard hitting reformer that future generations will read about some day. I must admit that the book just ate me up on the insides because I WAS politically active as a Christian. NEVER AGAIN!There is a chapter on Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and the problems in the BLACK community and church that is RIGHT ON! Being a black pastor I encourage every black pastor to read this book and make the changes that are needed and revealed to us by this TRUE Prophet from God.May God have mercy and help us all to change.Pastor Ron Wilson"},{"Title":"Politics or Christ","review":"Too often we easily accept christianities role in the political arena, without seriously investegating the biblical justifications for such actions. Christians throughout history in the name of different political and idealogical dogmas, have repeatedly found justifications for all forms of cruelty, persecution, and general wrong-doings. Even Christ's own crucification was a politically motivated event. It is very easy to want to pick up the banner of the latest politically motivated christian movement and wave your flag and beat your own drum in the name of all-holy christendom, without seriously investigating the biblical foundation of such actions. I believe if you take the time to read Politics or Christ, you will become more discerning and informed about this important issue in today's christianity.In many ways, Politics or Christ, is a hard read. It is filled with strong and direct language that could be easily misunderstood as accusatory and overly-stated. However, if you take the time to investigate the biblical foundations of what Mr. Johnston is saying you will find that his logic is clear and concise. It is stylistically overtly confrontational, it literally contains name calling and finger pointing, directed at some very well respected and popular leaders of many Christian movements. At first you may find yourself admonishing Mr. Johnston for his actions, but, more importantly. after reading this book, you may find that you are in complete agreement with him. Finally, if you have courage, and an open mind, I think that this book may change your entire perspective on Politics and Christ.At first I was disgusted, and then later I was intrigued and shocked, and then finally I laid the book down. I wasn't sure that I could finish the book without having to search deep down in my soul, groping and grasping for all my previously, and now shattered, beliefs. I did finish the book, and now I am proud to point fingers at those who do such great harm to the body of Christ. I know now that sometimes the greatest enemies of my saviour are those who proclaim to be his greatest advocates. Please consider this book, and read it to the end. It may change you more than you want to be changed."},{"Title":"Politics or Christ","review":"Johnston's book reads much more like a pamphlet than a text for three main reasons. Firstly, it is heavily repetitious. His introductory chapter promises that the book will prove the evil and unbiblical-nature of political positions held by famous Christian figures such as Jerry Falwell, James Dobson, Pat Robertson, and the Pope. We are introduced to drawings of the figures, along with drawings of Adolf Hitler and Ayatollah Khomeini. We will subsequently reread these accusations several times per chapter; we will see the drawings expounded upon in order to make numerous explicit similes (i.e. Pat Robertson with a small mustache next to Hitler). Secondly, there is much more promise-and-promotion than exposition. When Johnston gets to the scriptural references he says support his claim, more than fifty pages in, we have been coarsely persuaded to read them according to his sales pitch. Thirdly, the layout of the book with its integrated drawings, irregular font sizing, and frequently use of underlining make it appear less like an analysis of Christian political issues than a brochure designed to agitate.This book is almost completely negative in substance. Johnston has no theoretical construction to plug into the holes he claims to have poked. He will eventually get around to saying something about love and forgiveness, but will fail (or not attempt) to put the ideas to concrete use. An example: Johnston condemns black church leaders, in particular Jesse Jackson, for essentially pimping out the gospel for a buck and publicity. He rails on them for their political aspirations. Yet he casually mentions Martin Luther King, Jr. positively (i.e. to say that Jackson is not like MLK) without a description of the difference between Jackson's and King's political action. Surely here would be a good place to construct a positive theory of what Christians should do when confronted with situations of a political flavor; yet, none is given. This absence is also notable when Johnston mentions the abolition of slavery in positive terms without reference to why he esteems abolitionism so highly when it was propagated by some Christians engaged in political action. His passing remark that slavery ended due to the insight of American leaders is rather nave, in this author's opinion, and the interested reader is directed to excerpts of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, found for example in A People's History of the United States.The book's mild strength comes when Johnston urges us to refrain from legislating morality, but instead endeavor to make churches sanctuaries from \\"the storm\\" of life. But this one high point is not loftily made and is only notable relative to the ignobility of the rest of the book. It is tedious to wade through the barrage of character assaults with which Johnston peppers his inelegant prose. Moreover, his point on the appropriate type of Christian judgment (that it be only amongst Christians) may be taken; but his example of it (the majority of the book) is markedly hostile, devoid of loving overtones, and pointed directly at people themselves. This, I posit, runs counter to a main thrust of Romans: people are separate from their sin in some important ways. Jesus gives an example in Revelations 2:6 by saying that He hates the Nicolatians' DEEDS instead of saying that He hates the Nicolatians. Christian judgment should follow Jesus' lead - Johnston seems to not.Some other points of questionable Christian perspective include a sloppy theological rendering of God's sovereignty, a passing glance at Johnston's eschatological views, and an ambiguous stance on what Johnston believes abortion truly is.Hopefully, my long-windedness will not encourage your curiosity in \\"Politics or Christ.\\" It does not deserve it."},{"Title":"Politics or Christ","review":"Never in my life have I read such stunning truth!

In his life, Franklin founded the first major civilian hospital and medical school in the American colonies, studied the effectiveness of smallpox inoculation, invented bifocals and the \\"long-arm\\" to make life easier for the aged and afflicted, and became a proponent of improved preventive care, bedside medicine, and personal hygiene. Perhaps most fascinating is his personal battle to debunk the eighteenth-century medical fad of mesmerism. A handful of black-and-white illustrations intersperse this sober, thoroughly researched and singularly amazing account of a truly accomplished man who pushed forward medical innovations and improvements, with beneficial repercussions to this day."},{"Title":"Doctor Franklin's Medicine","review":"The author's stated objectives are to examine Franklin's medical contributions, show how his knowledge was influenced by eighteenth-century medicine, and describe how his life and medical views were shaped by his own chronic conditions.Franklin's views on the importance of exercise, eating and drinking modestly, breathing fresh air, obtaining a good night's sleep and avoiding things dangerous to the health are described. His improvements in stoves, furnaces and ventilation systems contributed to disease prevention. Franklin used Poor Richard's Almanac as a vehicle to make colonists aware of lead poisoning, and the importance of getting inoculated for small pox, after losing his son to this disease. He used electrical shock therapy to treat depression. His bifocals and the long arm made life easier for the aged and infirmThis book is more than a listing of Franklin's medical contributions. Dr. Finger recounts Franklin's role in founding the Pennsylvania Hospital and the first medical school in the colonies. The Library Company and American Philosophical Society were started by Franklin to foster the exchange of medical information to a much wider audience. Franklin favored hard evidence based on repeated observations and experiments when approaching his own chronic conditions of gout and a large bladder stone.This very readable book exceeds its stated objectives. The author often lets Franklin speak for himself, the annotations are scholarly, and the illustrations enhance the masterfully crafted text.Hundreds of books have been written about Franklin, but this is the first book to emphasize Franklin's contributions to medicine, a part of his life largely overlooked until now. It definitely should be read by anyone who wants to know more about Franklin, not just professional historians or people engaged in the healing arts."},{"Title":"Doctor Franklin's Medicine","review":"Americans have long had an appreciation and familiarity with Ben Franklin as a founding father and pithy author of catchy sayings, most of which appeared in his \\"Poor Richard's Almanack.\\" In this, his 300th birthday year, Dr. Stanley Finger shows that he was also an important man of medicinePreviously, Finger has written on other major figures in the history of science and medicine, including a number in his book, \\"Minds Behind the Brain.\\" But this is his most exhaustive study yet, and one which, in his opinion, was long overdue. Indeed, Franklin's many biographers make little mention of his contributions to medicine, although they helped to shape the 18th-century medical landscape in major ways. To aid him in his research, Finger examined some 30,000 letters to and from Franklin, as well as other historical documents.Benjamin Franklin comes across as consistently curious, empirical, and systematic in his observations about almost everything he encountered over the course of his 84-year long life. An element not often realized about Franklin was the degree to which he carried on correspondence and networked with other great minds of his era on a great variety of topics, including pertinent medical issues. This network and his own genius enabled him to see the benefits of early inoculation methods for smallpox, the risks of lead poisoning, the real causes of the common cold, and the importance of clean air. An accomplished swimmer and a weight lifter even into old age, he also recognized the need for exercise, and even noted the warming of the body and changes in heart rate accompanying different forms of exercise.Franklin also helped some bright American students to be accepted into European medical schools and to get additional training in major hospitals. These individuals, including Morgan, Shippen, and Rush, would then be encouraged by Franklin to start the first medical school in America. Interestingly, he was instrumental in founding the first major hospital in the colonies, a charity institution for the physically or mentally ill, also located in Philadelphia. It is no wonder that, with his honorary degrees and memberships in the leading learned societies in Europe and America, Franklin came to be viewed as a physician when, in fact, he had only two years of formal schooling!Ben Franklin has long been viewed as America's sage. As Finger shows, with his love of experiments and hard data, he was also one of Colonial America's leading men of medicine and a man willing to share his findings and views with a much wider audience."},{"Title":"Doctor Franklin's Medicine","review":"\\"Doctor Franklin's Medicine\\", Stanley Finger, Univ.

Franklin's brilliance, pragmatism & resorting to controlled experimentations establishes a uniquely high benchmark for Enlightenment, a characteristic of the 18th century.The book is replete with his enterprises as a printer, journalist (\\"Poor Richard's Almanack\\"), inventor (Franklin stove, lightning rod, armonica, bifocals), investigator (electricity, fraud), societal needs (poor sick hospital, med-school, sci. societies, libraries), medicinal queries (lead poisoning, variolation, colds, fevers, gout & afflictions).

(That's why you'll find e.g. John Steinbeck, John Cheever, and E.B. White represented in it.) He also favored stories that hadn't already been anthologized.His primary criterion, though, was that each story be a certain sort of fantasy written to a high standard of quality. As he states in his introduction, he was looking specifically for stories that 'show[] us the unreality of reality' and 'entertain us with our precarious state of equilibrium'. The fantasies he therefore chose are some of the most _haunting_ tales that were available at that time.The time was 1952, so quite a few more have been written since then. But Bradbury was right to call the stories 'timeless', and right also to regard them as stories for 'today _and tomorrow_'. For today, fifty-plus years on (and thus well past 'tomorrow' by the usual standards of the paperback publishing industry), I still have a copy of this marvellous collection and I am still haunted by the same stories that haunted me some thirty-odd years ago (when I first read it).Robert M. Coates's opening story, 'The Hour after Westerly', is one of those. There's nothing overtly 'supernatural' or 'fantastical' about the tale at all; it's a simple and straightforward account of an odd memory lapse suffered by Davis Harwell as he drives from Providence RI to New Haven CT -- the sort of thing that happens to all of us all the time. And there isn't even really a 'resolution' in a traditional sense; as the story closes, the truth sits out there somewhere in the murkiness, tantalyzingly beyond grasp. And to this day I've still read very few short stories that have hovered around the edges of my mind for so long afterward. (Another is George R.R. Martin's '&quot;. . . for a single yesterday&quot;' -- anthologized in _Epoch_, which you will probably also like if you like this collection.)All the stories are of similar quality. Oh, not all are equally haunting; my other personal favorites in this respect include Sidney Carroll's _None Before Me_, John Keir Cross's _The Glass Eye_, and John B.L. Goodwin's _The Cocoon_, and your mileage may vary. But Bradbury exercised exquisite taste here -- even having the wit to include Franz Kafka's _In the Penal Colony_, which at that time had been available in English translation for only about three years.This collection really is timeless. If it sounds interesting to you, scare up a used copy; you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"TIMELESS STORIES FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW: Putzi; Heartburn; Note for the Milkman; None Before Me; Enormous Radio; Portable Phonograph; Hour After Westerly; Glass Eye; Sound Machine; Mr Death and the Redheaded Woman; Laocoon Complex; Demon Lover; Cocoon","review":"By now, most folks recognize that Bradbury is one of the great practitioners of the modern short story.

(2 volumes)","review":"Surely this is &quot;The Biography&quot; in the same sense that to the Scholastic thinkers, Aristotle was &quot;The Philosopher.&quot;More to the point, it is an endlessly fascinating book, one of those rare works that can be opened at random with consistently rewarding results. Johnson, of course, is one of those rare characters who demonstrates that life is not necessarily less rich than fiction, and Boswell is an entertaining (and amusingly exasperating) chronicler. The &quot;Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides&quot; is also well worth reading and randomly revisiting.However, I'm somewhat alarmed by the comments below about the accuracy of this version. I bought this because it was a decent-looking hardback version--I had actually read a library copy (some long out-of-print edition). Could some reviewer please explain the deviations?

My British friends have a much better view of literature at large than I do so I listening and purchased this piece. I only appreciated Samuel Johnson for his work with the first English Dictionary which a first edition now retails for over $35000. James Boswell his biographer deplicts his life with such vivid respect and admiration so as to make me better understand what a true friend can be. They obviously had a great relationship for more than 40 years. Samuel Johnson is captured with all his great and abundant humor and deep insight. I love this quote\\" One man may lead a horse to water but twenty may not make him drink\\". All in all it is 1400 pages worth reading because its insight into 18th century life in London is so heart felt. Additionally alot of the their conversations took place at a Pub called the Mitre. It is located on Mitcham high street in Tooting, UK. I lived near by and spent a few nights their with friends. Little did I realize I was in the very pub where so many infamous conversations took place some two hundred years ago. A great read."},{"Title":"The Life of Samuel Johnson, L. L. D. (2 volumes)","review":"For those interested in a reliable text, I suggest the &quot;World's Classics&quot; paperback edition. The hardcover edition, while attractive, is somewhat suspect."},{"Title":"The Life of Samuel Johnson, L. L. D. (2 volumes)","review":"James Boswell's Life of Samuel Johnson is often called the greatest biography of all-time and may well be. Perhaps such a work can get no higher praise, but it is also highly notable as the first true modern biography - the first really resembling what we think of as biography today. Boswell set new standards for thoroughness, accuracy, and research, greatly expanding the very concept of what a biography could be. He was also very far ahead of his time in anticipating what was later called gonzo journalism - writers inserting themselves into real-life stories; it is of course not done in the same way as later writers, but the concept is similar. Most remarkable of all, though, is that the book is immensely readable, entertaining, and edifying over two hundred years later, which can be said of very few biographies. It is absolutely essential for anyone even remotely interested in Johnson, Boswell, or the late eighteenth century European intellectual circle.Johnson was perhaps England's best known writer during his last several decades and one of the most famous in the world besides being widely known and renowned for lexicographical and other accomplishments. However, this book's greatness and fame are such that he has long been known primarily via it. Many read it who have read very little or none of him, showing that, unlike nearly all biographies, it has earned a life of its own. There are many reasons for this, not least the fine writing. Even more fundamental is that the book vividly brings an exciting, integral, and profoundly influential era to life. It covers the late Enlightenment when many of the most important people to ever live were prominent. In addition to Johnson, we get first-hand glimpses of such illustrious personages as Adam Smith, Oliver Goldsmith, Pasquale Paoli, David Garrick, and many, many others. Numerous other heavyweights - Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, King George III, etc. - are only slightly in the background. We also get contemporaneous accounts of major events like the American Revolution and the lead up to the French Revolution. In short, though ostensibly the biography of one person, the book is as vibrant, lifelike, and memorable an account of a supremely important era as any history book.Yet Johnson is always the focus, shown literally from birth to death. Anyone interested in him will find a wealth of information about all aspects of his life as well as his thoughts, feelings, influences, intellectual background, and far more. There is also a great deal of information about his work. Unlike nearly all biographers, Boswell actually knew Johnson well; he was his friend for many years and spent several months annually in his company, essentially interviewing him and making voluminous notes of his conversation. This last is indeed the book's heart and by far its most famous element. Johnson was perhaps his era's most famous conversationalist, revered for wit and argument; Boswell heard many hours of his conversation and reports faithfully. His style here was again innovative. Rather than sprinkling isolated quotes anecdotally, he went to great pains to reproduce full conversations, not only describing the setting and others present but even using drama-like name headings for full verisimilitude. We thus not only see what Johnson said but where, how, and usually why he said it. Many world famous Johnson sayings that would otherwise be lost - i.e., \\"Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel\\" - are immortalized here, as well as some quotes by others. This alone would make the book of great value.Much has been made of how Boswell's presence affected this; knowing he would write the biography, or at least thinking it possible, he undoubtedly orchestrated much, drawing Johnson out when he might have otherwise been silent. Much of this would have been done in any case as he clearly admired Johnson and loved his talk, but there is no denying the question's importance. Some have condemned Boswell as a shameless celebrity whore or otherwise questioned his motives and veracity, but nearly everyone will consider this nitpicking, fascinating as the question is. For nearly everyone, it makes the book better - far more personal and engaging than biographies are usually even capable of being. Also, for what it is worth, such things mean the book in many ways tells us nearly as much about Boswell as Johnson, making it a sort of hybrid biography/autobiography.Boswell understandably focuses on the years he knew Johnson, meaning the book is greatly lopsided in favor of the later years after Johnson became famous and nearly all his major work was done. This will annoy those who want a more balanced overview, especially as Boswell makes short shrift of some important early events. Those wanting a more conventional balance should get one of several later biographies, especially as Boswell makes a few errors and, at least according to later sources, leaves out some highly interesting - if not necessarily essential - facts. He openly admits doing so at the start in order to protect Johnson's reputation, though much of what he says elsewhere is unflattering, but some of it may have been unknown to him. For most, though, this is the only Johnson biography that will ever be needed - and its greatness, influence, and importance are such that it is required for all readers with even the slightest interest in English and European literature and history and the art of biography even if they care little or nothing for Johnson or Boswell.As for this edition, it has a wealth of supplemental material, making it ideal for serious readers. An excellent, lengthy introduction gives substantial background on Johnson, Boswell, and the book plus some critical insight. There is also a worthwhile bibliography, a chronology, and a supremely useful index. As with other Everyman hardbacks, the book itself is also very high quality - clothbound with very strong binding and even a built-in bookmark. This is one of the best versions available."},{"Title":"The Life of Samuel Johnson, L. L. D. (2 volumes)","review":"I enjoyed reading this biography very much, finding Boswell an amazingly adroit reporter and his subject fascinating and wise. Johnson was full of shrewdness and good sense, along with amusing biases and unusual mannerisms, just the sort of person to ask to liven up a dinner. The book is both humorous and moving, written in a lively style, and good for repeated readings through the years."},{"Title":"The Life of Samuel Johnson, L. L. D. (2 volumes)","review":"I had heard since many years about Johnson, i had visited the museum in London, but only now I found the courage the read 'The Life of.....'. It was worth it.Boswell, to my knowledge, seems to be the first biographer in the modern sense of the word. He tries to give a rounded picture of his subject and also a structured account, structured by time but also structured by focusing on the body, the mind and the sould, usually in that order. What a time to have lived in London, to meet Johnson, Adam Smith, Burke, Gibbon. Johnson emerges as the central sun around which all other planets circle. This also makes for one of the weaknesses of this autobiography, that Johnson crowds out all around him. Yes, a biography should put the subject in the center, but not exclusively so. Boswell also neglects to explain the historical context. Like so many writers on contemporary history he assumes his subjects to be of such universal importance as to make them also common knowldge 300 years after publication. Clearly it is not so, and Boswell could have been helpful by putting more of what he is writing into context rather than leaving it to the footnotes of future editors.Delightful rather than annoying are his fights especially with Ms. Thrale about who might be the superior biographer. In 18th century style he does not shy away in calling the competing biographer names and casting doubt on her motives and moral rectitude.All in all a fascinating document, though for modern readers often tedious and only recommended for 'hardcore' readers."},{"Title":"The Life of Samuel Johnson, L. L. D. (2 volumes)","review":"James Boswell met Johnson when he (Boswell) was 23 and Johnson was 63. As a result, the emphasis of Boswell's biography is on Johnson's later years, but oh, what a record Boswell has left us. Boswell provoked Johnson to comment on a wide variety of topics, and recorded Johnson's doings with his circle of friends and colleagues. Boswell was a pleasant companion for Johnson, who usually accepted Boswell's constant probes (and even accompanied Boswell on a tour of the Highlands in 1773). Through it all, Boswell took notes, and jotted down everything Johnson said, recording many of Johnson's most famous comments. As a result, Boswell's biography of this great man of letters was a landmark biography, different from all biographies which came before, and still a point of comparison for biographies today. If you can get past Boswell's rather (in my opinion) obsequious tone, you will enjoy the ride very much. This Oxford World's Classics edition, edited by JD Fleeman, has a wonderful set of notes not found in other editions. It is a very affordable and thorough edition."},{"Title":"The Life of Samuel Johnson, L. L. D.

(2 volumes)","review":"If you feel obliged to wade through the canon once in a while, this won't be a waste of your time, though these days Gibbon's roughly contemporaneous history is a much better read, Boswell's extreme formality being a bit wearing over 1200 pages (in the edition I read).On the other hand, Boswell's telling of Johnson's life is sprightly and certainly not so tedious as the writings of Johnson himself. People who choose to read the Life will not be disappointed.On yet another hand, I can easily understand why the library copy I borrowed, though purchased in 1949, had not yet been read (the uncut pages showing me so): except to specialists, I would not recommend this book in lieu of, say, 1000 or so others.I guess this actually is a useless review: if you have already decided to read this, you shan't have gone wrong; if you're looking for a good read, you're probably not looking here."},{"Title":"The Life of Samuel Johnson, L. L. D. (2 volumes)","review":"Boswell was not the obvious choice to write the best biography about Samuel Johnson, much less one of the greatest biographies in world literature. He had much less contact with Johnson than Mrs. Thrale, for many years a close friend of Johnson who spent much more time with him than did Boswell. In fact, Boswell spent perhaps 400 days with Johnson over a period of many years. He also was not Johnson's literary executor. Finally, Boswell was regarded by many of his day, and afterwards, as something of an 18th Century celebrity hound. He made a point of meeting every famous person he could (Voltaire, Rousseau), and went to great efforts to make himself famous. Nevertheless, in his Life of Johnson, Boswell succeeded in portraying Johnson and his circle so vividly that more than 200 years later they come across as real human beings. He did this by breaking the convention of concentrating only on the most favorable aspects of his subject's life, and instead describing Johnson's eccentricities of dress, behavior, etc. Moreover, Boswell did not neglect to include incidents that make himself appear ridiculous. The book is both extremely funny and moving. If you read this, you will want to immediatley get a copy of Boswell's book on the trip that Johnson and he took to the Hebrides."},{"Title":"The Life of Samuel Johnson, L. L. D. (2 volumes)","review":"Ah, Ol' Sam, the Great Cham as somebody called him (it's an 18th century misreading of &quot;Khan&quot;, fact fans). My opinion of Johnson the writer fluctuates over the years; sometimes he seems a long-winded authoritarian, at other times his juggernaut sentences seem possessed of a superhuman vitality. Whatever. This isn't Johnson the writer we're concerned with, so much as Johnson the talker - the gruff, ridiculously prejudiced, gloomy, scrofulous clubman, holding forth from the biggest chair in the room, wisecracking, bullying, brooding and sulking.Johnson was as lucky to have Boswell, as Boswell was to have Johnson. The conversations of great men tend not to be much fun; Eckermann's &quot;Conversations with Goethe&quot; is fascinating, all right, but Goethe's mixture of gossipy cattiness and Olympian pomposity gets to you after a while (Donald Barthelme wrote an evil parody of it). With Boswell's Johnson it's different. He seems at once painfully real and a caricature of himself. Boswell captures both the readiness to pontificate about anything under the sun and the panicky vulnerability. Eckermann's Goethe leaves the room when he's upset (nothing must ruffle the patrician facade) but Boswell's Johnson stays in his chair - we can see his reaction.Of course there are drawbacks, in that half of the book covers the last ten or so years of Johnson's life, but there really isn't that much hard evidence about Johnson's early life beyond what Boswell himself collected. I reserve my doubts about Johnson's cultural politics, but the rolling, rumbling figure that Boswell sets down is one of my favourite characters in literature. Swift has a darker and more perplexing fascination for me, but you wouldn't have got the 44-year-old Swift out of bed at 3AM for a ramble. He'd have hurled his bedpan at you.Why is it a great airport book? Because there's a lot of it, it's unfailingly entertaining and informative, and it's guaranteed not to include a description of an air crash."},{"Title":"The Life of Samuel Johnson, L. L. D.

But although I love the Everyman's Library, I do not recommend this edition of Boswell.

The book had a nice heft to it, and the print was large enough for a comfortable read. My only major beef with this edition is that Boswell's text is replete with quotations from a variety of languages including Latin, Greek, French, Italian and others, and very few of them are translated into English. Whether the editor assumed that the average modern reader is a polyglot, or was unable to provide the translations for some other reason, I feel deprived at not having had access to this portion of the book's material, particularly as the quotes are most often used to gild the lily of one of Johnson's witticisms. Nevertheless, the book rewards the diligent reader with a wealth of intellectual stimulation, and offers a fascinating look into the England of the period including: polite London society, Oxford University, and jaunts around the British and Scottish countryside. Johnson's somewhat eccentric life and personal habits are lovingly and affectionately relayed by his close friend Boswell, who somehow managed to preserve a vast amount of Johnson's conversation without the aid of a tape recorder. With everyday life as a backdrop, we see how Johnson, a self-described lazy man, managed to produce such an abundant literary legacy, not the least of which was his groundbreaking dictionary.

I did, however, read every line of it, and I can say, I liked it.I started reading this work---oft cited as the greatest biography in the English language, and surely the one where the subject was most un-objectively represented by his fawning chronicler---when I was a sixteen-year-old sophomore in an honors seminar. I finished it literally today, some eleven years and perhaps twenty-two starts and stops later.What remains most strongly in memory, above the man about whom this was penned, is the era itself, which was captured in full dimension here by a scribe whose entire being seemed concentrated upon gulping down those scraps of notice sent his way by the movers and shakers, the \\"A-listers,\\" of his century.As a straightforward biography, this work is oddly paced, anything but impartial, and since it concentrates most of its scope on a relatively brief period in Johnson's life and career, curiously uneven. This is not unusual in biographies, of course, which tend to select moments that most closely define the subject's celebrity, but the pacing in the coverage does stick out at me. It also surprised me to find out that Boswell was around the great Johnson about a year's time, and the rest of his work, in all its ever-excusing hero-worshipping, anecdote-dribbling glory, is the result of his being privy to gossip, to making use of the facts known about Johnson, and by his, frankly, inventing whole sections in a kind of \\"non-fiction-fiction.\\"What forgives all that (if forgiveness is needed) is the thing I mentioned above; namely, no other writer from any era does quite so complete a job of making a person centuries in the future feel THERE for the scenes he's describing. To have wrung as much as he did from Johnson, the greatest \\"talker\\" of his time, shows that Boswell had the reporter's gift for conversation as a means of LISTENING. And all that is why this is the 18th century's finest life story, and also why I came to like this book so much in the years between when it was assigned to me, and when I finally finished it as a pleasure read in the year 2006."},{"Title":"The Life of Samuel Johnson, L. L. D. (2 volumes)","review":"Boswell took as his subject, the person called ' the greatest talker the English language has ever known'. He went around with him, goaded him here and there, and allowed him to talk.In return Johnson said countless wise, provocative, interesting, and offensive but above all humorous things. Boswell wrote down these , and also wrote down , or reconstructed conversations of Johnson with his friends. All of this helped make his subject ' alive' to his readers in a way no detailed recording of his every action from minute one of his life to minute zero at the end of his life could. He had the sense and intuition to help bring out what is most interesting in his subject. And so he presents the subject not only in a realistic way but in a sense in a most appealing way. This made Boswell the pioneer in a form of biography , or in one of the techniques of biography which is central to it. Boswell himself with all his much self- regretted dissolution was also an interesting apprentice, a writer too after all who learned from the Master. Johnson is a great and central figure , for many the greatest critic the English language has ever known but he is too an acquaintance and friend of Garrick, Hume others of distinction .Boswell listens to them also .Johnson was something of a curmudgeon a lovable kind of character who in his anger and outbursts amuses us. He was also a moral teacher although apparently he did not give much attention to the stricture regarding the wrongness of needlessly defaming others.Together these two are one of literature's great teams, not equal to the Knight of LeMancha and Sancho but up there on the top.Like all works of genius this work has its fanatical followers and its petty demeanors. It is better in these cases to trust the first .For a work like this enriches our common humanity as all the truly great books do."},{"Title":"The Life of Samuel Johnson, L. L. D. (2 volumes)","review":"'No man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money,' Samuel Johnson.Sorry, it is a hobby.Samuel Johnson the writer of the first comprehensive dictionary of the English language, which was a very big deal in his day as the elite felt the English language was in decline due to it being influenced by so many foreign influences and the marvel of Samuel Johnson's efforts and method of writing made him, according to Lord ChesterfieldLord Chesterfield's Letters (Oxford World's Classics), as someone to be deferred to as the \\"Caesar\\" of the English language. Samuel Johnson, along with his friend and former pupil David Garrick, helped place Shakespeare as the permanent king of the English language; further, Johnson was a great and singular essayist and has an eternal place as a minor poet of the English language. His dictionary shot Johnson into the inner circle of elite in English society.Boswell's \\"Life of Samuel Johnson\\" is a fascinating read as Boswell traces Johnson's life story. Samuel Johnson and Edmund Burke, a friend of his, and together the center of English political and cultural life with the 'Literary Club' that they had both started were big players in forming the English reaction to the major liberal events going on in their day and could be said to be the fathers of modern conservatism. They were alive to face the genesis of modern liberalism, in the form of Jean Jacque Rousseau along with the American Revolution, theirs was the conservative response. 'What hypocrites are the drivers of negroes to be demanding liberty,' Johnson in reference to the Americans. (It is funny that Samuel Johnson was against slavery while the more liberal Boswell was for it). Although, I know Edmund Burke felt England to be in the reconcilable wrong with the American RevolutionEdmund Burke's Speech on conciliation with the American colonies,: Delivered in the House of commons, March 22, 1775; ed., with notes and a study plan ... I. Crane (Twentieth century text-books)the Doctor, Samuel Johnson, did not and felt the Revolutionaries hypocritical ingrates. What is good about conservatism lays with these two fellows, Burke and Johnson. It is also amusing that Johnson's conservativism included the observation that countries should be judged by the condition in which their poor lived, disapprobation given to the worse.Samuel Johnson came from very humble roots and his early life was spent in modest means, fortunately he was surrounded by books. His first years in London were quite a struggle, near pennyless, sometimes sleeping on the streets. The money he ended up getting for writing the dictionary wasn't much in the end, it was the fame that got him some wealth.A marvelous read. Giving advice about the legal profession, education: his advice - just do it; habits form early and habits are hard to break... lots of interesting views from how to conduct oneself socially (Boswell seemed in constant search of this) to political commentary (one of my favorite was his advice on being weary of those that wrap themselves in the flag)... too much to write about. Boswell, when he first meets Johnson is so filled with awe and reverance but it mellows out some, he even starts playing games with the Doctor; however, he always greatly respects him but the idolitry disipates.Although Samuel Johnson's conservativeness and strong opinions might turn people off I find it refreshing compared to the stealth tactics of politics today. Politicians don't say what they mean and that is also probably why the Doctor was discouraged from entering politics in his day by some close friends with ties in that area, somethings change only by degree. James Boswell, the author, didn't agree with the Doctor all the time but appreciated the hard, realistic way of looking at things and amusingly delivered (mostly by quirky analogies) that Samuel Johnson did.Then Boswell is a story in himself. Boswell's Rousseau-ist fever for the notions of the 'Noble Savage, Natural Man'The Noble Savage: Jean-Jacques Rousseau, 1754-1762was interesting also; his generation caught it and he had strong sentiments towards it despite Johnson's arguments against its reasoning. This fever also, at the least, lent cover to the American Revolution.Johnson could only afford one year of college. Received an honarary Doctorate for his dictionary.One of the books one should read before they turn 20.The best synopsis of Rousseau and in his own words is probably 'Creed of a Priest of Savoy'The Essential Rousseau (Essentials)"},{"Title":"The Life of Samuel Johnson, L. L. D. (2 volumes)","review":"I own the Penguins Classics edition but no matter. The story is wonderfully rich. Boswell really is a master story teller because at no point did the story become dry. I literally read and savored every single word.All I knew of Johnson is that he wrote the first English Dictionary. But I had no idea this man was full of wit. He had a temper no doubt and definitely went through periods of what sound like moderate to severe depression followed by periods of bursting with energy, joy and wit and incredibly prolific and productive in those bursts, enough so that he surprised most people with his abilities in those bursts of creative genius. I am biased as I am a psychiatric physician but it sound like bipolar disorder to me.Whatever the case may be, I drank this book up. I'm still reading it, have about 40 pages left and haven't put it down since I picked it up.A must read just because of the sheer wonderful story contained within!"},{"Title":"Cellular Energy Metabolism and its Regulation","review":"Although Dan Atkinson wrote his classic book nearly 30 years ago, it is still available, and thus still worth reviewing.Much of what he wrote in 1977 is still quite valid today, and anyone wanting a readable introduction to the classic ideas of metabolic regulation could scarcely find a better place to start. Although the title refers specifically to cellular energy metabolism, that just provides the focus for what are really more general ideas, and in any case it is the central point in the whole subject. Many of Atkinson's ideas have become part of the general background knowledge in biochemistry, but he also includes less well known themes that could benefit from being better known: for example, he devotes several pages to assessing what he calls the metabolic costs of growth, in other words estimates of the numbers of molecules of ATP that need to be transformed into molecules of ADP in order to \\"pay\\" for producing particular metabolic products. Thus the simple aminoacid glycine costs 12 ATP equivalents, whereas tryptophan costs 78. Although qualitatively this is obvious -- no one would expect tryptophan to be as cheap as glycine -- the quantitative aspects are also important.Another theme that Atkinson handles more competently than most textbooks is that of equilibria, and thermodynamics generally, in biochemistry. This is not, of course, the favourite topic for most students, but it is one that has to be taught, and in an ideal world would have to be understood as well. Among some important insights he disposes nicely of the popular nonsense surrounding free energy \\"efficiencies\\" -- to put it at its most simple, Gibbs energies can be added and subtracted from one another, but multiplying or dividing them by one another makes no sense.Atkinson wrote his book before metabolic control analysis started to influence the thinking of biochemists. One might fear that this would make it out of date, but in fact it is an excellent thing, as it spared him the need to write many pages attacking an area of the subject that he came to dislike very much."},{"Title":"Cellular Energy Metabolism and its Regulation","review":"This book is an excellent overview of Biochemistry from a global perspective, as well as from a local one.It provided me with the logic behind the processes of metabolism, and in a very readable way describedthe kinetic and thermodynamic foundations for it. While reading it I referred to a more up-to-date textbookon Biochemistry for the finer-grained contemporary details, but this book provided me with the basic reasoningthat is still very valid behind much of the confusing detail provided in the Biochemistry text. The author andpublisher should consider coming out with a new edition, or at least another printing of this edition. Reading itwas a very enriching experience for me."},{"Title":"Mr. Chickee's Funny Money","review":"Mr. Chickee's Funny money was a super book.It begins when Steven get a quadrillion dollor bill. Then he and his dad show Agent Fondoo, and Agent Fondoo will do anything to get the bill back. Even send Steven and his best friends on a wild goose chase. If you like adventure books that are fast moving and don't let you know what will happen next this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Mr. Chickee's Funny Money","review":"Mr. Chickee knows what he is doing when he gives Steven a bill that has fifteen zeroes, and the picture of the Hardest Working Man in Show Business, James Brown, on it. Steven's the perfect choice due to his being the President of the Future Detectives of Flint club and the second smartest kid at his school. When Steven starts to investigate whether this bill is real or not he quickly runs up against Agent Fondoo of the US Department of the Treasury, who is determined to get the bill back, one way or another.This implausible book, while keeping the setting of Flint with a black main character, is a departure from Curtis's other novels. Serious messages are out and humor is the focus of this mystery. Clearly intended to be the first of a series, those looking for a funny mystery, or just a plain funny book, will be pleased with this book."},{"Title":"Mr. Chickee's Funny Money","review":"it all starts out when mr. chickee gave steven a quadrillion dollar bill. then he and his dad show it to agent fondoo and fondoo is instructed to get that governmet dollar. if steven deposits it in the bank he will be a quadrillionaire.

The agent then start traking Steven. Read the book to find out what happens. It is a very funny and exciting book.I like this book because of how the author writes. He writes simple buy yet, uses words that can get you tense. He makes you feel that you are a spectator who is in the book and you can see in your head of what is happening. If there is a sequel I will be wanting to read it and I wonder what will happen to Steven in his next adventure.My favorite part in the book is when Agent Fondoo had to apologize to Steven and his parents and Russell's parents too. I didn't like how the way Fondoo treated the kids so I thought it was really funny how Agent Fondoo had to give Steven and his family a lot of things so he could apologize.

It did not make me want to find out why someone jumped off a bridge because we were immediately told that it was because they were being chased by agents of the department of treasury. However I did like the strengths of the book. When reading Mr. Chickee's Funny Money, Curtis was able to vividly paint a picture of what it was like to be a member in the Carter family home. He gave great insight into the family and gave each character a distinct personality. Being from Michigan, I also really liked his display of local color to Flint Michigan. After reading the book, I wanted to look up the places that the characters went especially Kearsley Dam. This is a great beginning book to an adventure.

I was initially reluctant to pick it up because it seemed like a departure from Mr. Curtis' other books,which I have adored. This year, my husband and I adopted a nine-year-old boy, and began reading it as a read aloud before bedtime. The book made us all laugh. I tell my friends that the book is like an old Looney Tunes cartoon--there's the kids story and then there is the adult story. I have since passed the book on to several other (adult) friends, who have all enjoyed the book and a few are reading it next year for read aloud in their classrooms. If you've read his other books, you'll appreciate the references to Flint, Clark Elementary, and other locations familiar to readers of the Watson's Go To Birmingham (there is even a shout out to Kenny in Mr. Chickee's Messy Mission).

Steven, his friend Russell, and Russell's giant dog (commonly mistaken for a bear) try to figure out whether the bill is real and end up eluding secret agents (you can tell because of the \\"Secret Agent\\" sign on the car), sparring with an ancient dictionary with customized rude messages written on the copyright page every time Steven opens it, and Much, Much More.This is wacky fun; my wife and I had great time listening to it on a road trip. (We listened to the audiobook read by Joe Holt: just 3 discs long.)There is a sequel which I will definitely listen to (although not immediately: I don't want the fun to wear off).Note on content: There is at least one interjection which will strike most people as unexceptional but may offend those sensitive to use of God's name.

Clara Topper (Burke) spots Marion Kirby (Bennett) in her husband Cosmo's room.

Unable to explain to Clara that Marion is only a ghost, Cosmo tries to fast-talk Burke into a reconciliaton. Several floating martinis later, Bennett manages to reconcile the couple, and is now able to join her husband in their celestial home. The trick photography by Roy Seawright is astonishing for its day. Cushions which deflate when invisible figures sit on them, cigarettes being smoked in mid-air and pencils writing notes by themselves are all executed with great skill. The sight of the Kirby's dog Skippy - also a ghost - is hilarious when only his tail fails to become invisible or when he bites the ankles of totally flabbergasted men!

I've read it many times and will do so again. Smith was truly an underrated genius and a master of language. Here's a sample from Chapter 1: &quot;Yes, Topper was fond of his wife, but being fond of one's wife and getting along with her were two entirely different matters, as many a husband had found out before him. Perhaps it was not to be expected. Topper did not know. The problem had been too long with him. It was barnacle encrusted.&quot; If Smith is an acquired taste, now is the time to acquire him. I have some 11 of his books and in three short years he's come from being someone I'd never heard to being my favourite author. He has many imitators, but forget them, they are not worthy.

He's utterly normal in his generally loose moral fibre and unexceptional in most ways that are worth noting except that he happens to be plagued by the most curious company in the form of four ghosts which haunt his every step and send him on no end of random misadventures. One of the phantom quartet is bent on using Topper solely to supply a good time. Another of the foursome is Cosmo's mistress and she's bent on killing him so that they need not be bound by their differing status in the afterlife. The other two simply seem to go in whichever way the wind blows them (as the wispy and non-corporeal are wont to do anyway.)The most noteable thing about Smith's novel, aside from its utterly bizarre and original concept (it spawned several movies) is the twisted and writhing manner in which he writes. I realize, of course, that such a phrase coming from me is, at the least, a bit shocking. I look at my own prolix prose and see tendrils that are convoluted far beyond easy human comprehension but Smith makes me look like a grunting Neanderthal by comparison. Smith's long and sometimes fruitless journeys into metaphor, combined with his copious use of French terms that are unknown to me makes him a real chore to sift through. This combined with the unfamiliar vernacular of the 1930s makes this one a tough nut. That said, if you can grind his prose down to its meaning, you have a good nut, but my attitude going into this was of a book to be easily tossed off in a couple of nights. It came to span four and not without some fair amount of dread when it came time to sit down and read. As example I give you the early description of Cosmo Topper:Topper, it is to be learned with some relief, was virginal more through circumstance than choice. This does not imply that his was a low and lecherous nature. Nor does it necessarily follow that he was epicurean in such matters. But he did like things nice that way. Most men do, when and if possible.Topper had been a banker by profession. He still was a husband-an original error of judgement unrectified by time. Habit is a dreadful thing. Once he had commuted without realizing the error of his ways. Most men commute through necessity. Topper had done so ritualistically. In Glendale, USA, the Toppers had been socially solid. All that was changed, but not through Mrs. Topper.I'll admit that even after having read the entire book and that exact passage several times, I'm still not EXACTLY sure I understand what he's saying. At any rate, to the studious and focused reader, this book would no doubt be at least a small riot. Smith's verbal wit is good though would have benefited from anything even remotely approaching a plot. Like an episode of The Stooges, one is left with the idea that something odd might have happened (one falls short of using the word \`funny') but without a common thread to bind events together the result is a handful of milkweed fluff. If nothing else, I suppose, I was amused to hear again the phrase \\"mon petit chou.\\" One can never have enough cabbage in one's life."},{"Title":"Topper Takes a Trip","review":"I rented this video many years ago (b/w), and I have been waiting a long time to get my hands on it again. This version is colorized, which I enjoy even more. The quality of the tape is perfect. The movie and script were not the greatest, but, compared to the junk that is out there now, it is something that the whole family can watch. Billie Burke (the good witch in the Wizard of Oz) is a delight and I wish that she had more screen time. I saw this video on the Internet in DVD, but the price was criminal, to say the least. If you like good clean comedies, here is one for you. The first Topper with a limited appearance of Cary Grant was good and the third in the series: Topper Comes Home had a lot of more action.

I thought it would contain helpful tips on getting far better prices. Wrong! This book should have been called \\"Cleaning for Dummies, Lazy Teens & Completely Clueless Adults\\". It contains nothing but common-sense and the obvious.The first 3 sections are insultingly simplistic, i.e., \\"the buyer will see your clutter\\", \\"clean the stove\\", a list for cleaning (\\"sponges, bucket, glass cleaner\\"). If you have to read that broken tiles, whether on the floor or bath, should be replaced prior to showing your home, and that you need to clean the windows, wash down cabinets and tighten loose doorknobs, I'm afraid that you have far worse problems than selling your home!Section 4 basically tells you not to paint your kitchen orange and yellow, or your bedroom pink, but rather paint everything white, as a base for a buyer to use for \\"their\\" color, and so as not to distract from key features.The 5th and last section is still more from the \\"Dummies\\" series... \\"don't display empty flowerboxes, put fresh flowers on the table, serve coffee, don't have blank walls yet don't display provocative, political or religious items, clear debris.\\" I now know that I can make a living as a writer, with little effort, as this one does.Basically, if you've ever rented a white-wall/beige-rug apartment in a complex, that's the look to which she's aspiring, perhaps adding a few no-controversy items from a mid-range hotel lobby, like a simple wreath or inobtrusive floral display..."},{"Title":"Dress Your House for Success: 5 Fast, Easy Steps to Selling Your House, Apartment, or Condo for the Highest Po ssible Price!","review":"This book is the voice of objective common sense needed to help you get your house fit for the market.What I really love about Martha Webb is her warm and friendly guidance, and she illustrates from her own experiences both as a buyer and a seller.

House dressing is key to getting the right price you want for your house. you'd think people would be interested in the quality aspects of a house, wood make, name of the manor, bedroom names, the name of the basement, people who lived there, etc etc, but they're not. This is a business first and foremost. People get houses to sell more houses, and guess what, look at how many houses we have? Too many. Yet people still want more houses. Its crazy. But that is economics for you. This book will fix that though. From the first moment a buyer walks into the room of your abode you need to convince them that this is the house of their pocketbook dreams. Selling. Thats the key. Brandish a broom to make it clear to them you intend to \\"sweep up\\", an industry buzz word. Whatever you do, don't let them see the toilet bowl, this is a sign of weakness and humanity that nobody really likes to talk about. Let's face it, wouldn't we all like to live in a world where people don't have to go to the bathroom and just eat and everything disappears from your bottom half hours later? Duh. Think of the environment. Anyway keep the bathroom locked. Also if you're having trouble with selling, as in this market where people have forgotten the value of a good house, there are other options, first. If your house square footage is over 5,000 square feet, you can rent out bedrooms to immigrants. The great thing about immigrants is that while naturalized citizens prefer whole rooms to themselves, wasting valuable space, immigrants require a single bed, which is often forty times smaller than a room. While you have to charge less for a single bed, you don't have to charge forty times less, you can fit an average 200 square foot room with ten immigrants. For the whole house that is 250 immigrants, each paying about 50 dollars a month, thats over four thousand dollars a month! And the bonus is when a prospective buyer comes in and sees your business plan in action, and action it will be, the hustle and bustle of everyday life in every section of the house, they will know that you mean business. And that means if you mean business, and you bought this house, and they want to mean business, then, in beautiful logical simplicity: they will buy the house. Classic. Well done."},{"Title":"Mastering Spanish, Level 2: Book Only (Foreign Service Languages Institute Series)","review":"The books and cd's for Mastering Spanish are from the Foreign Service Institute.

These three books follow Morgon, the heir-apparent of the small, merchant-minded island of Hed as he comes to realize his own power as a bard--not merely a singer at the courts of his peers, but a magician of great power who comes to wield the power of the beating heart of the world.One of the more well-crafted elements of the book is that Morgon travels on his quests with Raederle, a mysterious landless princess who is herself searching for a way to deal with her innate magical ability. In her case, she is afraid of what she is able to do. What is unusual in this series is that the relationship is at the center--most of this genre follow the quest of the individual. Yet it is clear from the beginning that neither of these young magicians is the side-kick--neither plays Hermione to the other's Harry, or Sam to the other's Frodo. Here, the pair is the hero, and McKillip weaves the story of that pair's travails in a wonderfully compelling fashion."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"There are some fantasy epics that all literature professors, and most normal people, would consider essential reading for any well-educated person -- J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S.Lewis, Lewis Carroll, etc. So, yeah, I read those a long time ago. But beyond that, there's not much fantasy literature that's essential reading. So, for a long time, I didn't read any. In my drive to be educated, I stuck to the classics (which are classic because they're great literature, usually). But one day, maybe 15 years ago, Patricia McKillip's Riddlemaster fell into my hands. I can't remember exactly when, and I can't remember how. I can't even remember enough to tell you exactly what the trilogy was about. It's been that long ago.All I can remember is sitting for hours, slack-jawed and amazed. The imagery was so beautiful, the writing so elegant, the ideas so powerful. Some of the imagery has remained with me; I can still remember the awe I felt when Morgon learned how to change into a tree, how to harp the wind, and who Deth was. I don't really remember the details of the story very well, but I still feel it.I was sad when I finished the Riddlemaster trilogy, but excited to have found something I loved so much, so I went looking for more beautiful fantasy literature. It's been my favorite source of entertainment since.~FanLit.net"},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I first found the Riddle-Master series when searching for books that paralleled LeGuin's Earthsea series. Skeptical at the time (as my fever for those books was still fresh, I wasn't sure anything could ever rival them), I put it on my list of wanted books nonetheless, and received it as a present. I avoided it for a few days, still nervous as to whether it would be as good as I was expecting. And as such, when I first began reading it, it wasn't.This soon changed. From being unable to get through only a few pages (and still, the first chapter is undoubtedly the most challenging to get through), I became reluctant, and then unable, to put the thing down. Morgon became such an enthralling and real character to me, the plot became so strange and unpredictable (moderately), that I had to finish.One of my favorite aspects of the characters was the way Morgon and Raederle interacted with one another. They were not a typical pair, nor particularly atypical, and this can be said of their separate characters: they were normal. They were remarkably easy to relate to, and there wasn't a single moment when I sighed and rolled my eyes at a typical action from either of them.Morgon and Raederle have become two of the most treasured characters I've read about in a while. The world is strange and new, and I found myself excited to explore it as Morgon traveled its reaches. The legends and \\"pre-story\\" that shapes the plot is a bit fuzzy, but becomes clearer as the story goes on. This is one of those books that I was compelled to read in the shortest amount of time possible, and then was compelled to re-read almost immediately after.As for technical aspects, I recall counting a few typos (no big deal, of course, but amusing to find), little things like that. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the language used to be very beautiful; unlike the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I feel connected to the narration; it has its own distinct personality. But maybe that's the writing style talking. ;) Admittedly, the first part of the second book could be taken out easily, as well as a few smaller parts in other sections of the book, but it doesn't detract from the story as a whole.Since reading it a short time ago, it's topped my list of favorite books, albeit a short one. It was definitely worth my time, and has inspired my writing a great deal. I hope to read more by McKillip in the future."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"McKillip's Riddle-Master trilogy is simply great; it's one of the absolute best examples of fantasy I have read. Her prose is poetic and beautiful, and she creates a world that is vividly real. Her characters are believable, interesting, and sympathetic.Above all, McKillip is a suberb storyteller. Although the plot is familiar--a magical land threatened by dark forces of evil--McKillip does not resort to using cliches to tell the tale. The plot twists and turns, and she maintains a high degree of suspense throughout the story. Although it's clear who the hero is, it is much less clear who is friend and who is foe, and the ending is a suprise, at least in that it is not obvious or trite, nor is it a stereotypcial happy ending. I couldn't put the book the down, and when I lent it to my sister, she read it in a single day.I am a big, big fan of fantasy, and have been since I was in elementary school and read Lloyd Alexander's Chronicles of Prydain. Personally, I like McKillip's Riddle Master more than Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, Le Guin's Earthsea, or Donaldson's Convenant series. The only books I have read that I like as much are Martin's Song of Fire and Ice (and it remains to be seen if the end of that series is as good as the beginning). I suppose in the end that's a matter of taste, but I'm certain that Riddle Master belongs in the same class as the best of the genre. It is a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"This is a wonderful series. The world that Patricia McKillop creates is refreshingly original: the creatures and races are her own, not just the usual dwarfs, elves etc. Likewise the magic encountered in the story is subtle and interesting, a pleasant change from the standard hand-waving, chanting and pyrotechnics.The characters are superb as well. Morgon and Raederle are wonderfully 3-dimensional and human as they cope with their unwanted powers and destinies. Apart from the two principals, my favourite character was probably the fierce and uncomplicated warrior girl Lyra, whose answer to every problem is to throw a spear at it.As for the story, it works pretty much perfectly. The various mysteries in the plot are revealed gradually, rather than in one big chunk at the very start. The final revelations do not seem forced - most of them can be guessed by an alert reader, yet the ending is still surprising.All in all, a must for any fantasy fan, and probably not a bad entry into the genre either."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"Off the bat i will say that my only problem (and maybe it's me) was that there were certain times when i was lost reading the prose. Ms. Mckillip has a very interesting way of writing - it's beautiful but sometimes i didn't get what she was saying. Otherwise, this is an ABSOLUTE MUST READ for any fantasy/Tolkien/epic quest fan of fiction. I loved all of the characters, especially Har and Morgon. Morgon takes an amazing journey where he is transformed from a simple prince into something much much more. I loved all the magic, all the powers each major character has, the plot twists and turns, as well as the setting of the book. A great read, and i can see myself picking it up again in a couple years!"},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"The Riddle-master trilogy is amazing. What one immediately notices is McKillip's masterful use of language. She flavors this world using beautiful descriptions, intricate detail, and attention to setting. More importantly, and unlike some other epic fantasy series, McKillip's characters are unique and distinguishable from each other. Each is very much an individual. Morgon of Hed, the protagonist, is a believable character. McKillip never looses sight of the characters and their development. While I've seen others complain that much of this world's history is never presented, the narrative, read almost like a stream of consciousness, would be hampered by historical pedantry. In fact, I came away with a very definite sense that the world McKillip describes is real.What really sells this story is the ending. I won't ruin it for anyone, but it is moving. The final scene with Raerdale and Morgon is poetic perfection. In short, the Riddle-master reads very much like an epic poem; it feels as if for a time you have been pulled into another world."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I purchased the trilogy as 3 separate volumes almost 20 years ago and I have since read and re-read them so many times that they have fallen apart.If the number times I re-read a work is a barometer of how good it is, this is one of those rare books that belongs on the shelf with the great fantasy classics. I have also found that it is book with enough complexity that my understanding and appreciation for it has changed over the years.McKillip creates a world where rulers are responsible for their countries in a real and meaningful way (e.g., the \\"land-rule\\") .....it leaves the reader pondering how our world would be different if this was reality and not fantasy."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"The other Amazon reviews give enough background of the story, so I won't repeat it all here. Like some of the other reviewers, I read this trilogy when it first came out and have re-read it often, and I am currently reading it aloud to my thirteen-year-old son, yet even after so many years, it can still bring involuntary tears to my eyes that make it hard to see the words. McKillip has a distinctive and almost unbelievably rich style, with a gift for bringing even the most unimaginative person directly into her worlds. One can savor the dark fire of Herun wine running over the palate or feel one's heart-strings resonating to the reverberations of Deth's harp even as his enigmatic silence beneath the music seeps into the blood. Unlike some authors who daub out great canvases with a palette knife, McKillip seems to create miniatures with a \\"brush of two camel-hairs\\" (Jorge Luis Borges), yet they vibrate with the jewel-like colors of a medieval illumination and draw you into their whirling pagentry until those worlds are more real than your own. In an age of movie-graphic writing, McKillip somehow manages with a fingertip against a wrist or a whisper of wind where there should be none to evoke an eroticism or a terror that can disturb my sleep for nights.These books should not be dismissed as the early attempts of a very young author to write yet another \\"coming of age\\" or \\"lossof innocence\\" saga that is discrete enough to satisfy the Young Adult librarian. I disagree with those reviewers (and with the author herself!) who think her subsequent books--all of which I have read and loved--supercede this trilogy. The writing may be honed even finer and the colors tinged by a more mature palette, but this trilogy assaults more challenging questions and continues to resonate in the heart long after the book is setback on the shelf, whereas the others, evocative and memorablethough they are, must confine themselves to more traditional ground since the heights have already been scaled. It is not for those who only want a \\"thumping good read\\" or characters to fall in love with, though they will find both. It will torment you with the unanswered riddles in your own life until you also have to decide whether you are who you think yourself to be or something more. Its warning \\"Beware the unanswered riddle\\" and its stricture \\"Give others what they require of you for their lives\\" require a response. Unless you are willing to give it, close your ears with wax against its harp-song like Odysseus's sailors did against the Sirens, or it you will be haunted forever by a silent harpist with silver hair and eyes as dark as your own forgotten dreams."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"One of the greatest works of science fantasy. Tolkein is irrelevant (comparing apples and oranges). I first read the trilogy when I was 15. I'll be 35 soon and I re-read the books yearly."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"This trilogy is on my top five list of favorite fantasynovels,along with Tolkien's The Ring Trilogy, Hughart's Bridge ofBirds, Zelazny's The Amber Chronicles and Hambly's Antryg Windrose books. The difference is...THIS is the trilogy I wish _I_ had written. Human love and grief, humor, understanding and maturity, magic that comes with knowing yourself and the world around you....none of these are things we outgrow or become surfeited on. It may not please all readers, but is that the fault of the writer or the reader? ;)"},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I bought and read this book on the recommendation of several family members who had read the original books when they were first published (and when they were much younger readers).Compared with the other fantasy novels that I've read, this is among my least favorite for the following reasons:Lack of background on the worldLack of depth to the charactersLack of conflict and plotPoor dialog & formattingThe story was mildly interesting, but has been done several times before and at this point isn't anything new.First, the formatting of this book was poor and may be the result of the three original novels being combined into a single edition. There were several times when the character came out of a dream sequence, but you didn't realize it until a paragraph or two later. Likewise, there were other times when the setting changed or time passed and there wasn't any indication of this. Most authors put a blank line between paragraphs to indicate either of these occasions, but that's only used a couple times throughout the book. Additionally, the dialog formatting is poor and can be confusing when there are several characters in a room having a conversation. Most of the time, there are several lines of dialog without attributing them to their speaker. Since the characters are all flat and don't have any variation in dialect and don't have any catchphrases, I found myself just reading through it and not caring who said what as long as I got to the next paragraph.Besides the formatting, the lack of introduction to the world and characters was also a point of frustration for me. There is no background to what a \\"riddle\\" is or how they are important in the world. For the series to be called \\"Riddle-Master\\" there should have been more setup and explanation as to how the riddles of the world worked, and why they were important. It didn't even seem like there was a high regard for those that studied riddle-mastery. They didn't walk around the land with an elevated status, or any extra honor compared to other characters. It seems more like the riddles were simply \\"questions\\" that needed to be answered, and often you can substitute the word \\"question\\" for \\"riddle\\" and the text will make more sense and reads more smoothly. One of the examples of the text where this stuck out most was pg. 387, \\"From the greyness an owl woke and sang a riddle.\\" Owls are frequently known for making the sound \\"who, who,\\" which as far as I know is at best a question and certainly not a riddle. There's also nothing really mentioned about the importance of a character's \\"name\\" either. There's a little background as to the wizards and some of the other characters in the books, but it doesn't really explain why the continental land-rulers (aka Mathom, the Morgol, Har and Danan Isig) are almost immortal (having lived centuries), while Morgan's parents didn't seem to be centuries old and certainly weren't immortal.I was able to fight through the poor formatting and lack of background detail in hopes that the story and characters would be good. I was let down. The overwhelming majority of the books are taken up with characters traveling. There's not much conflict and almost zero fighting. I think that for these two reasons, the target audience for the series is much younger (perhaps the under 12 crowd). Unlike other books, there isn't a rush you get from characters narrowly avoiding the enemy or barely defeating their foe. The characters just plod along on their path as it appears before them. It's more like one of those \\"lazy river\\" rides at a theme park than an actual roller coaster. After the second book, I only read the third one because I had it, and I had hope that it might be better than the first two. Since it's the final book, there's actually a bit of conflict towards the end, but nothing worth the build up of 500+ pages. The aftermath at the end is also rushed, as though McKillip had a deadline to make and just wrapped everything up as best she could. I would bother discussing this poor finish more, but the lack of interesting characters didn't really make me want to know what Tristan, Eliard, Danan Isig, Har, Mathom and the Morgol ended up doing.I'd recommend this book to a parent who's going to read to their child, or has a young reader and is looking for an okay story that doesn't feature any violence or things that might be unsuitable for younger ones. Children will be able to muscle through the poor formatting and lack of background information and will probably find the story entertaining. I feel like this book was like when you watch a children's show as an adult and say, \\"how on earth can kids find this interesting?\\""},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"Here's what I wrote in Goodreads in May 2011:Finally finished the book which is a reprint of McKillip's first fantasy books. It was hard to read more than 2 pages at a time; I didn't care about the characters; I had problems whenever there was dialogue because she made it hard to know who was speaking and the book needed to be edited down to 2/3 of its original length removing some of the sturm und drang.I've been told that McKillip got better as a writer after she finished these 3, but it'll be a long time before I pick up one of her later books. She should never have re-issued this volume without extensive editing."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"A great book for kids. Although I think this could be a book enjoyed by all ages."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I read this book while on drugs after having pretty major surgery. Perhaps this is why I did not understand this book at all. Or perhaps it's because nothing in the alternate universe of this book is ever explained. A lot of fantasy novels start assuming you'll latch on to the way the world works, as this one does. Only in this book, nothing is clear enough to figure out. At the end of the book, I didn't even know what a riddle was (and believe me, they're not like the riddles we know, they're more like questions, only you have to be educated in them and they're important to the world. I think, I may easily be wrong, because I couldn't figure anything out.)I mean no offense to anyone who loves this book. I didn't find it bad in any way; I just didn't understand anything that was happening.But I still read the whole thing. Maybe I would enjoy it more now that my mind is not in a chemical fog. But over all, this book (for me) didn't live up to the glowing reviews many people on this site gave it."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"The hero whines a lot, suffers inexplicably over things that don't seem too troublesome, and is loved unreservedly by every good guy in the book. The heroine is annoying, wanting to be present at all times and tagging along even when not supposed to -- this is supposed to make her a \\"strong\\" female character rather than the pest and burden she really would be?The young McKillip hasn't yet learned how to shape a story, develop characters, or create suspense; the story is choppy, episodic, and at times inexplicable. There is much -- way too much -- description of emotion, but no creation of emotion in the reader.I'm being a little brutal, but this is an immature work that will appeal mostly to teens and to those who haven't read much adult fiction."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I love fantasy novels, especially when I can look forward to a series of stories in which I can follow strong characters who I care about. The Riddle Master trilogy had some wonderfully drawn characters, but that's about it. The plot was confusing and vague, with the majority of the \\"action\\" happening within the protagonist's mind. Dialogue was hard to come by, and I often found myself re-reading passages to be clear about who was speaking, and to whom they spoke. Additionally, the long and loving descriptions of the air, the earth, and the feelings of the characters could have been reduced enough to make one long novel - with 3 acts. The essence of a good story is there, but it is so hard to find!I'd give this 2 stars if I didn't know this was McKillip's first series, and hope that her future books grow from this point."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I love this series; land-law and riddle mastery are two truly original concepts. However, I've been bothered each time I've picked up my old paperbacks. I always feel like I'm coming in on the middle of something. Is there another book, that covers Morgan's riddle game with Peven, and his early relationship with Raederle, and his years at the college? (If not . . . why not?)"},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"It just didn't make much sense. None of the characters captured my interest. I found them to be shallow, confused and confusing. I didn't get a real feel for them or their world. I finally gave up a third of the way through the final book in the trilogy. It's not the worst book I've read, but I would not recommend it as good reading."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I first read this series in grade school. I remember it as being some of the first fantasy I ever read and a favorite. I picked it up again this summer after reading some other Patricia McKillip stories. I wish I hadn't.It just doesn't hold up over time. After reading J.R.R. Tolkien, Terry Goodkind, George R.R. Martin, and many other great fantasy writers, the flaws are far too obvious to ignore. It feels like a bad attempt at a first novel by a naive teenager. There are words in here that do not exist in any dictionary and phrases that made me cringe. She mentions secondary characters several times with seeming importance to the story without further developing them or explaining their importance. These books could have been so much better if only the writing skills matched the premise. The descriptions of events and travel are good, but take so long to read with so many errors and unimaginative phrases that it becomes a struggle to finish (much like Tolkien's descriptions).Take a pass on this book. Children might like it, but there's much better fantasy out there. (And I don't mean Harry Potter!)"},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I was looking forward to reading this trilogy from the recommendations I had seen but was most disappointed. I enjoyed the author's evocative descriptions and the basic storyline is a good one, occasionally even compelling. Unfortunately, it is spoiled by a serious lack of background detail about the world she has created. There are fragmentary references to other characters and events whose relevance to the main plot is often left unresolved, so that instead of helping the story they become a frustrating distraction. Another annoying habit the author has is not making it clear when necessary which character is speaking: too often she changes the order of who is speaking without indicating it, making it necessary to go back and re-read the dialogue. Aside from the positive points mentioned above, the story is fundamentally flawed, ill thought out and poorly executed.Incredibly, a quote on the back cover says \\"...good enough to be compared to Tolkien...\\". They have got to be kidding! Though I think it rather unfair to compare this author with such a master of the craft as Tolkien - no need to extol the virtues of his writing here. Patricia McKillip may be a World Fantasy Award winner but on the basis of this trilogy, I can't understand why and frankly wonder about the quality of the judges' credentials. Nevertheless, I intended to persevere but by the time I had read about a third of the last book, the story had become so monotonous and tedious, I was bored with the main characters and no longer interested in discovering how the story turned out. I consigned the book to the trash without finishing it. Suffice to say, I am not tempted to read her other stories."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I have to admit that the \\"Riddle Master of Hed\\" is the very first fantasy book I ever read, and even though there are a ton of new stories out there I still love to read this one. I was excited to see they had all been put into one complete trilogy. This is definitely a story that could easily be made into a great movie."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"Patricia McKillip will always be remembered for this series. It shows her true mastery of the fantasy genre and showcases her gift for lyrical prose. I recommend this one all of the time, in any format, and own two copies myself."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I've got an 11 year old working her way through Harry Potter - I'm just waiting for the day when I can share this trilogy with her! The first time I read it, in the late 70's, it wasn't in print and I had to scour libraries and wait excruciating months between books. Since then, I've bought several copies, given some away, and still I read it about every 2 years. I only wish she could pull another trilogy together - her other works like Atrix Wolf and Basilisk are JUST TOO SHORT in comparison!"},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"In the original series all the main characters are important senior crew members. If ever a non-essential crew member shows up, there is a 99% chance that he is going to be killed before we discover his character.As with Riddlemaster, all the characters are important people in the world. The main character happens to be a prince, who wonders the world meeting other princes, princesses, kings and queens. Where are the working class people in this world?The writing talent is awesome, and I assume that this was written when PM was a young writer, hence a bit of naivety comes through in the storyline.For example:- I often found myself looking to the appendix for explanations of character names that would be dropped into conversations with no previous introduction.- As the book progresses, Morgan's powers become exponentially enhanced until he becomes some sort of super-superman, but with little explanantion of how these powers are acquired and why.- One of Morgan's first powers is the ability to change shape to an animal. Hence he wonders the land taking various animal forms and changes back to human when he arrives at his destination. Yet there is no mention of Morgan ever having to find clothing each time. Does everybody wonder around the world naked? Also when he changes to crow shape and flies, where does he put his sword and his harp? Because they are always with him when he changes back. Must big a bloody big crow to carry all that stuff.This series shows what appears to be a young writer with lots of potential perhaps taking on a story that is a little too big for her at the time. Good read if you can overlook the holes."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"Patricia A. McKillip, The Riddle-Master of Hed (Ace, 1976)McKillip's Riddle Master trilogy has attained something of legendary status over the years, and it seemed to me that, as a fantasy fan, it was something of a must-read. I did find it somewhat difficult to get into at first, but once I got into the rhythm of McKillip's writing and got the quirks of the world she was building down, it picked up just fine, and I got a glimmer of what it is about the series that garners such devotion in its fans.Morgon, as we open, is the Prince of Hed, a bucolic island whose main concern, usually, is the brewing of beer. Morgon, however, had been sent to the Riddle-Masters' college as a youngster so that he could get a bit more experience of the world; he returned to Hed with the long-dead Lord of Aum's Crown; the ruler of An, one of the three lands making up what used to be Aum, has promised the hand of his daughter to the riddler capable of gaining the crown. When he challenged the Lord of Aum, Morgon knew nothing of this; upon finding out, he sets out to travel to An to meet, and marry, his promised bride. Getting to An, however, seems as if it may prove more difficult than it had seemed for Morgon and his sidekick Deth, the harpist of the High One (this world's version of a deity).One of the problems I have with a number of fantasy novels I've run across over the years is irritating naming conventions, and The Riddle-Master of Hed has this problem in spades. Unlike most fantasy novels, though, whose authors revel in long, unpronounceable names containing a multitude of stupid apostrophes (yes, Michael Moorcock, I'm looking at you), McKillip's irritating names go the other way--they're short, almost brutish, and are way too brash in their foreshadowing (really, when you name a character Deth, you get what you deserve if everyone figures out the big plot twist in the climax, and naming a country Hel is just a little obvious, don't you think?). But beyond the awful names is an interesting, and decently-told, story; at the heart of it all is a guy who just wants to go get himself married, settle down, and raise oracular pigs. (Oh, sorry, that's another classic fantasy series.) Not bad. **** * *Patricia A. McKillip, Heir of Sea and Fire (Ace, 1977)McKillip's follow-up to The Riddle-Master of Hed somewhat surprisingly avoid the middle-novel-of-the-trilogy doldrums, which is a welcome change from most fantasy trilogies, and it does so in a somewhat novel way; rather than continuing on with the story of Morgon, the hero of the first novel, McKillip focuses on Raederle, Princess of An and Morgon's betrothed, who sets out to find out what happened to Morgon at the end of the first book. (As she does, so do we; The Riddle-Master of Hed is left in an entirely unsatisfying cliffhanger state that, had I not had access to the second book immediately, would have had me tearing out my hair.) As a result, we get an entirely new quest, if one tangentially related to the first, and we still get to stick with some of the characters from the first book. Many of the shortcomings of that first novel are still present (after all, one can't change the names one has built one's world on in the middle of the story), but that book's strengths are here as well despite the story's sudden change in focus; if you liked the first one, this one will keep you just as interested. ***"},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I fell so lucky to have the priviledge to read this beautiful story. I have read other McKillip's books and so far, this is the BEST!! The story just tangled my emotion and my mind.

Simply a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"This is the best fantasy series ever written.What I would give to write like Ms. McKillip!This must be read by anyone who claims to like this genre, and even those who don't.

And I'm always suspicious of those people..."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I suppose I can understand why so many other reviewers have given these books such high praise but I find myself unable to follow suit. If you haven't read much other fantasy, or if you have but don't mind reading the same plots with the same characters then you will probably enjoy these books.It's not so much that they are bad, rather that there simply isn't very much to recommend them. They are simple books with simple characters that lack much depth beyond the stereotype they are given. Many plot elements exist solely to drive the books towards their telegraphed conclusion. (It is always frustrating when the reader has figured out something by the middle of the second book that takes the characters another books and a half to sort out themselves.)In a lot of ways this is like the Reader's Digest version of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time. Whining main character. Improbable and inexplicable romances. Annoying bickering between characters who should be deep in the honeymoon phase of their relationship. It is certainly more focused and more concise than Jordan's work. However, that conciseness comes at a price. The only characters in the books are Kings and Queens and Wizards. Despite taking place over the course of several years I can't recall the name of a single character that wasn't either a Wizard or born of royal blood.There were other flaws that marred my enjoyment: the basic premise s of the Earth-Masters, their war, the High One, and the hereditary Land Rule aren't adequately explained giving their fundamental importance to the entire story line. Not to mention there isn't even an attempt to explain why Morgon has the powers he does. There are also lapses in consistency that leave the reader confused. At times the Bad Guys are relentlessly chasing after protagonist. Then they seemingly leave him alone for weeks on end with very little explanation about why the change in strategy.Despite my above misgivings the book wasn't unenjoyable. It simply felt like a book I had read a dozen other times under different titles. I think this book finds it greatest popularity among a young adult audience that has little other exposure to the genre."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"The three books which comprise this trilogy--how I wish *I* could've gotten all of them at one stroke, instead of tortuously searching out each sequel!--are among my very favorites. The author *is* my very favorite. The reasons are simple and numerous.McKillip deftly shapes a world that draws us in effortlessly on all levels: from the muddy pigherders of Hed to the great sorcerer-kings. Inhabiting it are people you can fall in love with recklessly, not the least of them being the protagonist Morgan. He falls into love and into tragedy, and you cannot help but follow his steps and emotions. The plot draws you through all three books, compelling and offering twists and turns that surprise and delight. And at the end, it is all tied together into a resoundingly satisfying conclusion.My foremost admiration is for McKillip's writing, which is full of luxuriant description and the occasional wry humor. I only wish I could master the same flow of words she obtains. In many ways I consider her writing to be more of poetry than prose.I cannot recommend this trilogy highly enough. I would suggest it be read when you have plenty of time, because her thoughtful story deserves no less."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"Why it was ever published separately in the first place is quite a riddle itself! When I first read &quot;the Riddle-Master of Hed&quot; as a requirement for school, I about died falling of the cliff-hanger. That aside, the emotions and characters are as real and complex as they come, the most important being the inexplicable love/hate relationship between the protagonist, Morgon, and the enigmatic Deth. It was the nuance and development of that part of the story that had me sobbing out loud. &quot;All I wanted, even when I hated you the most, was some parched, dry, barren excuse to love you.&quot; (something to that effect--Morgon says that) The book (books) is breathtaking, like the view from the top of a mountain."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"There simply isn't anything I can say that hasn't already been said.This series has been my favorite for more years than I want to discuss.

So I'll be getting a new copy.There's magic, mystery, battles, humor, plot twists, more magic ... what more could you ask for?Just think, in the time it's taken for you to read this, you could be finding out who has milk dumped over his head and why.Just go buy the book and find out for yourself."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I first read these books in the Del Rey printings in the 1980s, and they are proof that the golden age of fantasy is 14.When I saw the omnibus volume, I picked it up, and reread it. Like many things I enjoyed as a teenager, I expected the suck-fairies to have alighted upon it and turned it to dross.If you're looking for a good cognate for this series, it's not Lord of the Rings, or the countless shelves of Extruded Fantasy Product that followed it, from the Mary Sue of Shannara through to The Sword of Truthiness or the Wheel of Why Won't This Series End.This is much closer to Ursula LeGuin's Earthsea Trilogy, which is a writing and publishing contemporary. Magic is allegorical, in a lot of ways, and power has its price, and sometimes people with power are reluctant to pay that price.It is, at its heart, still the hero fable of the young man who leaves his comfortable rut behind, travels with a mentor, discovers the mentor had an agenda, and takes agency and adulthood onto himself upon discovering this agenda. It also has the \\"fabled figure of destiny\\" trope. It also has a far too idyllic view of life in a Middle Ages economy, but gritty fantasy wasn't really en vogue when this was written.There's a lot of subtle worldbuilding going on, worldbuilding that's very easy to miss, because McKillip doesn't explain it, and her characters largely work within the structure of the world she created without needing it explained. Riddles are more akin to Socratic dialogs, each designed to take an historical event in the universe, provide the recounting of the event, the resolution of the event, and the strictures - the lessons one should learn from knowing it. It is also a world where there is prophecy, but no visible or active prophets - the only character hinted at having that knack is Mathom of An, who's a secondary character noted for his inscrutability, and it's fairly clear that he'd rather not have the knack; I'm minded of the second Dune novel where Emperor Paul Atriedes is almost locked to inactivity because any actions he takes will result in worse outcomes that he can see. The same binding of action is implied here, too.There is magical power aplenty, and each of the kingdoms seems to have its own varieties of magic, including the land of Hed, which has the magic of being peaceful. Magical power is, as was common in fantasy of the 70s, shown, but not explained. There is no \\"magic as science\\" explained by one practitioner to the protagonist; to me this is more appropriate. It keeps magic risky and dangerous.What's left for the reader to figure out is this: Recorded history on this world appears to go back only 800 to 1,000 years ago. There are rulers of kingdoms (most notably rulers of \\"naturalistic\\" kingdoms) who date back to that dawn of history. Prior to that history, a race of intensely magical beings - the Shape-changers - had a civilization that turned into a race for mastery over the world; as they strove, they destroyed their cities, or burned out pieces of magic; the war shoved the losers into the sea, and left the one winner alone on the world. In this war, their children were consumed as sources of power.That paragraph above explains, more neatly, one of the underlying cornerstones of the book than anything in it does...and that's something I count as a virtue, not a flaw. I like that there are books where the author trusts you to figure things out rather than spoon feeding you plot twist after plot twist.The book also shows that McKillip, who in her mid-20s the time she wrote it, was seriously into rewriting for concision. The first two books and the first third of the third volume are written with no spare words at all. This can make them seem dry and inaccessible to people who are used to more florid prose stylings of Extruded Fantasy Product. They are, however, beautiful examples of economical writing that is still evocative.The books have a serious lack of inter-character conflict; the plotting doesn't have the usual page turning cliffhanger endings, and there are times (as other reviewers have noted) where her desire to tighten the writing makes dialog difficult to follow.All in all, though, this is a good piece of fantasy, and is one of the few that I'd put up with Ursula LeGuin's Earthsea trilogy for the role of keeping magic mysterious, and for keeping fairly subtle worldbuilding that is worldbuilding by implication rather than worldbuilding by lumpy exposition. I recommend this to anyone who has kids who've finished Harry Potter, and to adults who're looking for something that's less of an Extruded Fantasy Product."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"McKillip is deeply gifted with a talent that is rare in authors, especially in fantasy authors...brevity. She can say so much with so few words. These books require a careful reading or much will be missed. This is not fried froth like Goodkind, Brooks, Eddings, etc.Her prose approaches poetry, which may be offputting to many readers. I actually rather dislike poetry, but find her prose to be beautiful.There are some weaknesses to this series, the biggest of which is the second book and its centering on Raederle. That installment dragged and seemed to be an unnecessary digression. She was also a quite annoying character throughout the series. Despite this, I give the series a 5 star rating because the rest is so good.I read this series first in the 80s when I was a kid. Every few years I get it out and read it again. For me this series has worn more well with rereading than any other fantasy series I've read."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"This is a book that I read some time ago, but have put for which I have spent some time avoiding writing a review. The reason is the idea that I may not be able to correctly capture the beauty and complexity of the storylines. I do not have a background in literature and poetry to undergird my attempts to write a review here as I do a background in studying philosophy to help me write a review for some other books. This book is *that* beautiful, yes.The storyline is hard to describe without giving away too many spoilers. The main details are that the world is divided into a number of countries, with the hereditary ruler having the control, via a psychic link of sorts, over his or her land. They are called Land-rulers, and they gain their \\"Land Law\\" from a mythical being known as \\"The High One\\". Morgon, the land-ruler of the smallest, and least important region, was born with stars adorning his head. The High One's harpist, Deth, sets Morgon on a path with his destiny that will change the world forever.The narrative is filled with the most stunning, beautiful imagery in almost any piece of literature, short of works by L. M. Montgomery, C. S. Lewis, or J. R. R. Tolkien. It is not merely a descriptive feast for the senses, however, it includes detailed characters, cliff-hangers, and a rather complicated plot that the author *still* manages to pull off successfully in the end.The story is a trilogy, and I am read and reviewed a combined omnibus edition. I recommend that any potential readers either get an omnibus edition, or read the books back to back. While not quite as seamlessly connected a narrative as, say, *The Lord of the Rings*, it is clearly all one tale. It is only a trilogy in name only.I heartily and enthusiastically recommend this moving, complex, thoughtful, and poetic, work of fiction, to readers of most any age."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I picked up the trilogy on a whim one day at the bookstore. At first, the writing style was a little awkward for me to get used to, but as soon as I did it was impossible for me to put down. The story is spectacular, and I love the secrets and surprises woven consistently throughout all the books. Patricia McKillip created a fantasy story with all the elements, and did it without being cliche. The end of the book is so beautiful, I would recommend it to anyone that loves a good story. Five Stars!Update Nov. 2011:I just finished re-reading this trilogy after buying a second copy to replace the one I loaned and never got back. Despite knowing what was coming up, and despite knowing how the story ended, I STILL found myself sobbing at the end of the book. I have tried time and again to describe the story to my friends and family and the only word I can come up with (even after years of having this book on my shelf and reading it multiple times) is Beautiful. Please, give this book a try, Patricia A. McKillip's prose is perfect, poignant, and it is worth reading again and again."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"The Riddle-master trilogy has been compared to Tolkien's LOTR. The Riddle-master story is well written, and the characters thought provoking. Like LOTR, this book tells about an average, simple man caught up in a story of destiny bigger than he ever imagined. However, it is obvious when you read Riddle-master that the author is not an English scholar, like Tolkien. Few of us are, but her editors should have done a better job. Most annoying is the repeated use of pronouns. Whole pages of dialogue between two male characters only refer to \\"he\\" without any clue as to which character is speaking. This is a problem through out the book. This is also a problem with three female characters who are all referred to in a conversation as \\"she\\" instead of giving us some kind of way to distinguish the speaker. History is not explained, which is also a difference from Tolkien. On the plus side, Riddle-master is faster paced than Tolkien, and slightly more believable since the character's feet actually hurt. Perhaps the author, like Tolkien, will go back and reedit before the next printing. Tolkien revised his work with nearly every printing. I think this is the best piece of fiction written in the last 40 years. A tremendous accomplishment."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I first read the Riddle-Master trilogy in my twenties, and have read it many times since, including to my children. Its poetic beauty and imagery, read silently or aloud, are a feast for the ears as well as the mind and heart.Brilliant and suspenseful, McKillip tells us enough but not too much. It is full of the unexpected yet it's all there: the foreshadowing; the hints; the well-developed plot; action; and life-like characters, young and old, with personally relevant inner struggles. They \\"reveal\\" themselves through their \\"lives\\" and choices. Their complex motives are drawn from very human tendencies and the paradoxes of power and of love.Riddle-Master trilogy is an epic fantasy Tolkien and Lewis would approve of - it has all the elements of Faerie; the universal truths they valued most in literature and in life; and a triumph of the things of greatest worth. The trilogy sounds chords in each reader, and leaves none unchanged. It is an intensely human story that can be understood on a deeper level with each reading.This 3-in-1 edition is a must-have, the journey through it's pages worth taking again and again. I'm now a grandparent and the Riddle-Master trilogy \\"still works\\" for me."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"This trilogy is ____. Fill the blank with the most positive adjective you can find (wonderful, amazing, perfect . . .) to make the sentence true. McKillip's Riddle-Master is, next to Tolkien, the most unique series I have ever read. And while being completely unique is indeed a rare find in the fantasy genre, Riddle-Master has the added bonus of being incredibly well written. I love this trilogy--and even now, after finishing it, I'm not certain I caught everything. If ever you feel a need to read an intelligent novel you should find your way to the Riddle-Master series. It's absolutely stunning. Go. Buy. Read. Now. . . . . . . . . . . Please."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"From its book-club selection omnibus volume title, these three books are commonly called \\"The Riddle of the Stars\\".Written sometime in the late 70s or early 80s, these books easily ranked with the leaders of the time, easily beating out the Shanara books and many others.I've read the series many times since I found them over a decade ago, including just last year. I've never regreted spending my money on them, and since they're pretty much no longer available, buying this book is the new reader's best choice.The story is about the down to earth and simple ruler of a backwater land of pigfarmers, Hed. The Prince of Hed, Morgan, has quite an unusual talent for Riddles, and three stars emblazoned on his forehead from birth (those stars cause him all sorts of problems).Riddles in these books are not of the common puzzle variety. They are complex tales about events in the past that have no clear answer, like murders and other mysteries. Because riddle crafting is an ongoing tradition, many riddles do have answers, invented or discovered by the Riddle Masters of the past; however the answers to those riddle may not have been widely desiminated, or may only be known to a single person. In a competition between two people over riddles, it is perfectly legal to ask your opponent to answer a riddle you know only you have the answer to. This isn't a problem most of the time, unless the competition you're in happens to hold your life in the balance. This view of riddles is unique in my reading experience, and quite enjoyable.The magic system of these books is also excellent.Other people here have already commented on the intense characterizations of the novels, so I'll avoid a repeat.I will note the one drawback of the series. The map is not particularly detailed (thankfully, it has a map, many modern Fantasies do not). The map is also clearly attached to a greater continent, and of course the seaways are open. However, nothing is ever mentioned of lands beyond those on the map. It seems almost like the map and the lands it depicts really exist in a small pocket dimension. However, this is a common flaw in many Fantasy novels, and should not disuade anyone from reading them.Get these books. Read them. If you haven't, you can't call yourself well-read in Fantasy."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I was determined to read this trilogy through regardless of how I felt about it, and frankly that's the only reason I finished it. On the other hand, I'm glad I did!The first book was interesting, if long-winded. It took its time getting where it was going, and had some detours that when all was said and done, seemed unnecessary to the whole of the plot. Still, the writing was much better than average and the story was engaging. The lead character had a very common syndrome caught by leads in fantasy epics: the \\"wanna go home\\" whine. Luckily, he got over it; once he did, he became a fascinating individual.The second book was, IMO, *filler*. It left the lead character in favor of spending time with the character's s.o., who had very little relevance to the story overall. She did a couple of interesting things (raising the dead, for one), but her actions felt like they had very little to do with the actual plot. Most of the time, she looked for her fiance and failed to find him. The point of that was...? Some very gripping things happen to the male lead character during book two; unfortunately, all of them happen \\"off-stage\\" and we only heard about them second-hand. That was a great loss.The third book put the other two to shame. The writing suddenly leapt to life. It got better and better the closer it came to the climax. Once there, everything came together, and a thousand questions that had been ignored for too long were finally answered. I felt like I was reading another story entirely, one that was vibrant and exciting and worth every penny. I regret that the first two parts of the story were not as good, but it was worth reading through them to get to the last part.There were times when I had to force myself to keep reading, especially during the second book which was the worst of the batch. Unfortunately, you can't skip books -- there's too much information you need to know in both the first and second book in order to appreciate the third. I recommend reading this triology collection anyway, because the final act is so splendid, and even the tedious parts are better written than the standard crap that is published in the Fantasy genre these days.FWIW, I heard this was one of the author's earlier works, so she was probably still learning her craft at the time. Kudos to her for mucking through it, and turning out something that must have taken a great deal of effort and talent. I look forward to reading other works by her."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"The other Amazon reviews give enough background of the story, so I won't repeat it all here. Like some of the other reviewers, I read this trilogy when it first came out and have re-read it often, and I am currently reading it aloud to my thirteen-year-old son, yet even after so many years, it can still bring involuntary tears to my eyes that make it hard to see the words. McKillip has a distinctive and almost unbelievably rich style, with a gift for bringing even the most unimaginative person directly into her worlds. One can savor the dark fire of Herun wine running over the palate or feel one's heart-strings resonating to the reverberations of Deth's harp even as his enigmatic silence beneath the music seeps into the blood. Unlike some authors who daub out great canvases with a palette knife, McKillip seems to create miniatures with a &quot;brush of two camel-hairs&quot; (Jorge Luis Borges), yet they vibrate with the jewel-like colors of a medieval illumination and draw you into their whirling pagentry until those worlds are more real than your own. In an age of movie-graphic writing, McKillip somehow manages with a fingertip against a wrist or a whisper of wind where there should be none to evoke an eroticism or a terror that can disturb my sleep for nights.These books should not be dismissed as the early attempts of a very young author to write yet another &quot;coming of age&quot; or &quot;lossof innocence&quot; saga that is discrete enough to satisfy the Young Adult librarian. I disagree with those reviewers (and with the author herself!) who think her subsequent books--all of which I have read and loved--supercede this trilogy. The writing may be honed even finer and the colors tinged by a more mature palette, but this trilogy assaults more challenging questions and continues to resonate in the heart long after the book is setback on the shelf, whereas the others, evocative and memorablethough they are, must confine themselves to more traditional ground since the heights have already been scaled. It is not for those who only want a &quot;thumping good read&quot; or characters to fall in love with, though they will find both. It will torment you with the unanswered riddles in your own life until you also have to decide whether you are who you think yourself to be or something more. Its warning &quot;Beware the unanswered riddle&quot; and its stricture &quot;Give others what they require of you for their lives&quot; require a response. Unless you are willing to give it, close your ears with wax against its harp-song like Odysseus's sailors did against the Sirens, or it you will be haunted forever by a silent harpist with silver hair and eyes as dark as your own forgotten dreams."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"Years ago, my first attempt at reading this trilogy did not end well: I managed the first book and half of the second, but I had to stop when I realized I didn't have a clue what was going on. I just couldn't follow it. Since then I've read almost all of McKillip's later books and grown used to her lyrical style, which tends to conceal the plot behind dense imagery and poetic-prose. On reviewing her books, I always tend to warn other readers that her prose something that takes getting used to, but is well worth the effort once you get the knack of deciphering its style. Once you're familiar with it, it gets easier to read, and soon you can fully appreciate its dreamy quality. After finishing her latest novel (The Bell at Sealey Head) I knew it was the perfect time to go right back to the beginning and try again with her first trilogy: \\"The Riddle-Master of Hed\\", \\"Heir of Sea and Fire\\" and \\"Harpist in the Wind.\\"The trilogy is set in a world that - despite resembling medieval feudalism - is a quite different from the usual fantasy setting, simply because of the way its features are presented. There are no chucks of exposition explaining how certain things work: concepts like the land-heirs or shape-shifting are never described in detail. Instead you have to pay close attention and figure out how it all works by yourself - but by the time it's important to the plot, McKillip will have given you enough information to understand it.Likewise, knowledge of the all-important heritage and history of this world is taken for granted by the characters - they know it back to front, and they're not going to stop what they're doing just to explain it all to you. As the story flows on you begin to grasp the pieces of this world, but it's up to you to link them into a cohesive whole: we learn that some time in the past the wizards of Lungold mysteriously disappeared; there is mention of ancient beings known as the \\"Earth-Masters\\"; and people keep referring to someone called the \\"High One\\", but who he is and what he means to them is kept relatively opaque.This can be very disconcerting at times (no one in the text bats an eyelid when a character casually mentions that he's several hundred years old - because it's simply no big deal to them) and altogether the book reads like a manuscript that is not only *about* another world, but *from* another world, written by an inhabitant who simply assumes that the reader will know what they're talking about. There is no exposition, no omniscient narrator...not even clear points-of-view from the characters themselves - you are chucked headfirst into this world, and if you don't start concentrating, you're going to be left behind.In the first volume, \\"The Riddle-Master of Hed,\\" we are introduced to Prince Morgon of Hed, who contentedly rules a simple island kingdom with the help of his squabbling siblings. Unbeknownst to them, Morgon has recently emerged victorious from a riddle-game with a spirit, winning himself a crown as well as the hand in marriage of his old flame Raederle. Morgon's desires are simple: in his own words, he wants to: \\"marry Raederle, and then go home and plant grain and make beer and read books.\\" Later he repeats this sentiment: \\"I want to go home, fix Snog Nutt's roof, and go to bed.\\" Snog Nutt is his pig-herder, which should tell you what sort of man Morgon is.But naturally, destiny has other ideas for Morgon, as he gradually comes to realize that there are riddles pertaining to the three stars upon his own forehead, and their relationship with a harp that only plays for him and a sword that awaits him in the deepest mine of Isig Mountain. It is a particularly obscure destiny, since nobody has any idea what it might mean, least of all Morgon himself. But Morgon reluctantly sets his face toward Erlenstar Mountain where the High One sits so that he might answer the riddle of his own existence. He travels with the High One's enigmatic harpist Deth and gathers clues (as well as new magical skills) along the way from the wise land-rulers of various other countries, learning that much of what he's been taught to believe about his world may in fact be an elaborately constructed illusion.\\"The Heir of Sea and Fire\\" is set a year after the events of the first installment, and deals with Raederle, \\"the second most beautiful woman in the world.\\" Along with Morgon's family and friends, she is grieving over his apparent death at Erlenstar Mountain, and decides to go in search of answers. Joined by Lyra (who accompanied Morgon for a time in the previous book) and Tristan (Morgon's little sister), the three women forcibly commandeer a ship and go in search of their beloved/friend/brother. I'm wracking my brains here, but I can't think of another fantasy story in which three women team up for a common goal. Along the way Raederle discovers some shocking truths about her own heritage and identity, as well as the harpist Deth, and Morgon, who she fears may have changed beyond all recognition in his new persona as the Star-Bearer.Finally \\"Harpist in the Wind\\" reunites Morgon and Raederle, draws together all the riddles and mysteries, and catapults all our characters toward the prophesied \\"end of an age.\\" I can't bring myself to make a larger summary than this - it would spoil the surprises that are awaiting you in this final volume. Suffice to say that lingering questions concerning Deth, the shape-shifters and Morgon's destiny are brought to their satisfying conclusion.Our two protagonists, Morgon and Raederle are strong, intelligent and brave...but more to the point, they are also *good* people. They go through so much suffering that they don't deserve, they long only for one another's company as well as the safety of their families and homelands, and it is thoughts of each other that first instigates their individual quests. The extraordinary thing about them is throughout most of the first two books we only ever see one brief scene of them together (in a flashback) and yet we are never in doubt of their very deep love for one another. I have no idea how McKillip pulled it off, but for a extended period of time the two lovers only interact briefly, and yet when the reunion comes, it's heart stopping. If you can read their final exchange in \\"Heir of Sea and Fire\\" without getting a little choked up...well, you're a stronger person than I am.The supporting cast is just as strong: the myriad of brothers, sisters, mentors, lovers, ghosts, fathers, friends, rulers, allies and enemies...any one of these characters, no matter how small, could carry their own novel. Likewise, any singular idea contained within the three (surprisingly slender) volumes is enough for any other author to thrive on for several books. McKillip's restraint in not turning this into a full-blown multi-book series is remarkable when considering the ideas she's managed to pack in.In all three volumes, the conflict and tension arises from the presence of several insidious shape-shifters, who can hide their true forms behind the mask of a simple trader, a friendly sea-captain or a beloved wife. Their intentions are a mystery, no one really knows what they want, they pop up in the most unexpected places, there is no obvious way to destroy - or even identify them - and for all these reasons they are utterly terrifying, creeping out of the darkness like nightmares.As I've already mentioned, McKillip's style is utterly unique. Though she's gone on to write many books in her distinctive poetic-prose, the \\"Riddle-Master\\" trilogy is still a bit different, perhaps because it is based on quest narrative rather than her later use of fairytales. The only other stylist I can compare her to is Francesca Lia Block, who also writes as though she's describing a series of lucid dreams, but there is an earthiness and emphasis on autumnal shades to \\"Riddlemaster\\" that reminded me of Lloyd Alexander'sThe Chronicles of Prydain (The Five Books of Prydain, Complete Set), as well world-building that reminiscent of Ursula le Guin'sA Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)in that magic is mysterious, horrors are left up to the imagination, and characters are intimately depicted, yet kept just a tad distant due to the fact we are never privy to their innermost thoughts.This review is massive, and I seem to have written an essay or a \\"how-to-read\\" manual rather than an actual review -but this is the type of book that requires something a little different. These aren't books you read, they are books you experience, and as such, they are also books you have to be prepared for. They are definitely not for everyone - they are well nigh incomprehensible sometimes, and often I found myself re-reading sentences in the attempt to figure out what the heck was going on underneath the complex prose. And if I've made reading the \\"Riddle-Master\\" like a chore...well good. This trilogy needs your utmost attention, and if that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, then consider yourself warned and don't read it. But for those of you who are intrigued, then I'm pretty confident in telling you that you haven't read anything like \\"The Riddle Master\\" trilogy before, and you'll never forget it once you've completed it."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"Never, in all my vast readings of fantasy, have a read a tale that left me so spell bound, so haunted, so enchanted. When I closed the book, finished, it was painful to leave the rich, beautiful world of riddles and mysterious harpists McKillip creates in the Riddle-Master trilogy. Her lyrical writing and deep, often heartbreaking, characters along with the depth and mystery of the plot create a lush world I once thought could only exist in my dreams. It was hard to leave it at the end because I wanted to live there, in that beauty. I love this book more than anything I have ever read and I recommend it to anybody who loves to read, especially to those who often feel misplaced in this world of reality."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I recently re-read this trilogy (somewhere between the 5th to 10th time over a 20 year period) and was startled by how many of the characters, interactions and events in the book are embedded in my mind and heart--and how much emotional resonance the book still has for me.Like others, I praise McKillip's prose, dialog, characters, and originality. Sturgeon's Law [look it up] is, if anything, an understatement when it comes to fantasy, the vast majority of which is a rehashed mish-mash of JRR Tolkein, Robert Howard, Andre Norton, and Katherine Kurtz. (Let me upset a few more people: I find largely mediocre and derivative, though not without some high points and merit, most of what Stephen Donaldson, Terry Brooks, and Robert Jordan have churned out, not to mention the vast hordes of lesser lights.)McKillip's world in this trilogy is sui generis and a place that calls to you. As a writer (largely non-fiction, but I am working on both a play and a novel), I have the greatest of admiration for McKillip. As a reader, I find this series always moves and renews me. I hope they do the same for you. ..bruce.."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"Reading McKillip's great Riddle-Master trilogy is like trying to solve the riddle of someone else's partially-glimpsed dream. You enter a rich world of metaphor, sometimes baffling but always beautiful. A standard hero's quest is overgrown with fabulous beasts, children of stone, and death-dealing harps.In the first book, \\"The Riddle-Master of Hed\\" Land-Ruler Morgon of Hed wins a bride and a crown in a riddling contest with a ghost. He wipes the cow manure off of his boots and sets sail from his tiny island kingdom, unsure as to whether his beautiful, red-haired prize has any interest in marrying a farmer-king. In pursuit of an answer, Morgon detours to the College of Riddle-Masters at Caithnard, where he was once a student and where his bride's brother still resides. His companion for the journey is Deth, the thousand-year-old High One's harpist.Morgon and Deth are shipwrecked, and once Morgon regains his memory he discovers that he has unknown, shape-changing enemies who will stop at nothing to destroy him. As he flees through the kingdoms of his world, he is befriended by the various land-rulers and is gifted with a harp and a sword that are decorated with three stars--identical to the birthmark of stars on his forehead. He also learns how to change his own shape into beasts and trees.Finally Morgon makes his way to Erlenstar Mountain with Deth, the harpist, hoping that the High One will solve the riddle of his stars and defend him against his implacable enemies.The heir of sea and fire referred to in the title of the second book in the trilogy is Raederle, Morgon of Hed's betrothed. She struggles against her shape-changer heritage, but gradually begins to tap into its power in order to protect Morgon. \\"Heir of Sea and Fire\\" begins in the spring of the year \\"following the strange disappearance of the Prince of Hed, who had, with the High One's harpist, vanished like a mist in Isig Pass...\\"Raederle has reason to believe Morgon dead, since the land-rule of Hed has passed to Morgon's brother, Eliard. Or was land-rule ripped from Morgon while he was still alive? In a key passage, Raederle asks the High One's harpist, \\"What piece of knowledge did the Founder expect to find beneath the knowledge of when the barley would begin to sprout or what trees in his orchard had a disease eating secretly at their hearts?\\"The importance of the question lies in the inability of the harpist to answer it.There are some great visuals in \\"Heir of Sea and Fire,\\" especially in the sequence where Raederle calls up the dead of An and bargains with them to protect the man who is journeying across their land. I really feared for her life because of the bargain she made with the dead Kings, even though I've read a million fantasies and the heroine never dies--at least not until the end of the trilogy.In the final book of the trilogy, \\"Harpist in the Wind,\\" the Star-bearer (Morgon of Hed) and Raederle of An, united at last, continue their search for their true identities. This book won the Locus Award in 1980 and I feel 'award-winning' is the least amount of praise one can apply to this trilogy. McKillip 'dreams awake' when she spins her fantasies, and that's how it feels to read them.Love, family ties, and even magical bonds to the land play an important part in these novels, as they do in many other great fantasy epics such as 'Lord of the Rings' and Norton's Witchworld trilogy concerning the triplets Kemoc, Kyllan, and Kaththea. Vengeance, which was a prominent theme in \\"Heir of Sea and Fire\\" slows to a cold drizzle in \\"Harpist in the Wind\\" and in one case dries up completely.Revenge might indeed be a 'dish best tasted cold' but if it gets too cold, the hero could end up feeling sorry for his erstwhile enemy or even forgiving him, as does Morgon. His gradual change from innocent farmer-prince, to vengeful shape-changer, to the Star-bearer spins out the most challenging riddle of this trilogy. Who is the Star-bearer? What is his true purpose?\\"Stars, children with faces of stone, the fiery, broken shards of a bowl he had smashed in Astrin's hut, dead cities, a dark-haired shape-changer, a harpist, all resolved under his probing into answerless riddles\\"--at least in the beginning of \\"Harpist in the Wind.\\"There are scenes of high astonishment and magic in 'Harpist,' most especially in Morgon's discovery of wizards other than the evil Ghisteslwchlohm who are still alive, most prominently Yrth, the creator of Morgon's three-starred harp. Or is this another of the riddles the Star-bearer must solve? What is the relationship between Deth, the High One's harpist who betrayed Morgon to Ghisteslwchlohm, and Yrth, a great wizard who had once been called the Harpist of the magical city of Lungold?At trilogy's end, all riddles are answered and the Star-bearer comes into his heritage, although his friends and loved ones (and the reader) seem to realize who he is long before he does. Such is usually the case with heroes."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"When McKillip gets it right, really right, she can't be beaten. The Riddle of the Stars is one she got right.The Riddlemaster trilogy (Riddlemaster of Hed, Heir of Sea and Fire, Harpist in the Wind), apparently reissued in this volume, is perfect. It's a high fantasy story suitable for young adult and adult readers. High fantasy means many things, including that, yes, if a man can turn into an animal at will, he can have his clothes on and possessions with him when he turns back. The magic in this world is mystical, not technical.There are too many things I love about this trilogy to be able to enumerate them here, but I'll give three. McKillip's writing here is clear, lyrical, and well-tuned to the story; the opening sentence is one of my favorites. The story is well-knit, to the point that when you read the end, you can go back to the beginning and read it all over again with a brand new understanding of much of what is happening. The characters are complex, fascinating people you want to get to know better."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I am so pleased that these books have been reissued in one volume--at last! For quite a while, only the first and last were in print, leaving a considerable number of people hanging, I'm sure. There is simply no other series within my (pretty extensive) readings within the fantasy genre which is so elegantly put together. Ms. McKillip's writing is wonderfully succint; if a single word were removed, the structure would fail. This holds true for the plot as well. No element is not necessary; there is no embellishment or unnecessary description, yet the characters, relationships, and world created are unfailingly complete. The plot and its twists are original and completely unsuspected, and will most likely leave you floored. Ms. McKillip's insights into human relationships and their wonderful and painful complexities, as embodied particularly in the relationships within and between Morgon, Raederle, and Deth, give this story a power I'm not sure many other fantasy novels or series accomplish. I'm tempted to say that this is a novel about people, and the creation of the world in which they live is a secondary, albeit brilliantly shining, accomplishment. The archetypal struggle between good and evil which most often characterizes fantasy novels has been simplified; what that struggle represents-- the struggle between good and evil within us all-- is described in this book, and the honesty of this gives the story a power to move you quite profoundly. Read this book simply because the story is engrossing, beautiful, and runs deep. Then go back and notice how it has changed you."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"when i was a teen, I read my way through our tiny local library. They would often give away the older books in a box in the front of the place. I pulled the first two volumes of this trilogy out, but could never find the third in the box. I took them home and read the first two. I was totally entranced. The plot was unpredictable and intense, like life. The characters were real, and the world came complete with it's own set of uncompromising rules. Anyhow, I read the first two books over and over for about ten years before I finally found a copy of the third book of the trilogy in a used book store. When I read it, I was stunned. The rug was really pulled out from under me, and I had been not just reading the other two volumes, but EXAMINING them for years. You should buy it. You'll Love it. (But do make sure you get this 3-in-1 set.)"},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I first picked up this series over a decade ago. I stumbled across the first book in this series while looking for something to read in a class (I didn't always pay attention to the teacher - sci-fi/fantasy was much more interesting). Upon completion, I was desperate to find the rest of the books in the series. I finally managed to find them and have since re-read them several times - enjoying them more and more.I read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy and many of the books are good, but not memoriable. This is a story that's stuck with me and that I'll keep remembering.I'm very happy to see that they are being re-released. Letting this series dissapear would be a terrible shame. If you're into fantasym this should definately be in your collection."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"Patricia A. McKillip has been one of the secrets of the fantasy genre. She is a prolific and amazing writer who can spin tales of epic depth and breathtaking scope and make it look effortless and completely natural. Her characters are memorable and real. Her settings, whether delightfully ordinary or utterly fantastic, always seem like some place that you could easily get to, if only you knew the way. I have never read a bad book by her and this trilogy, an early work, was what started me off on a lifelong fascination with her creations. She has an understated style that seduces you gently and leaves you feeling dreamy and misty-eyed by the end. A deft writer who has mastered her craft and made a genre all her own.Riddle-Master is a collection of that early trilogy into one volume. The main character is an unlikely and unassuming hero whose charm and appeal are magnetic. No matter how many times I read these books, I am drawn in all over again and cannot stop turning the pages until I am done.Read all her books, if you like a gentle fantasy with little hacking and no slashing, you will not be dissapointed. Intelligent characters with great dialogue, interesting situations, and not an orc in sight."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I recently picked up Riddle-Master in a rather doubtful frame of mind. I had read some of McKillip's previous work with mixed feelings: some works were excellent, and others boring and unoriginal. In addition, I'd read that Riddle-Master was meant for younger readers, and so was half-expecting underdevelopment and tedium. Instead, I found one of the most fantastic works of fantasy I have ever read, and a new book to cherish for years.I can see why certain people would dislike this book. McKillip's writing can be heavy-handed, with excessively lengthy descriptions and superfluous metaphors. On the other hand, most of the time her imagery is beautifully poetic, one of the characteristics that set her apart from other writers. McKillip's writing--in ALL her books--is filled with metaphoric detail, and if you dislike literary embellishment, you will likely hate her prose. Other criticisms I saw mentioned here, like the unrelatability of the characters and the world, seem absurd to me; they were so lovable, real, and familiar to me--even the secondary characters--that I genuinely cared for them while reading. More than that, what misted my eyes at the end of the trilogy was not even the fate of the characters so much as the longing to join them; it was actually painful to leave her world.The Tolkien/realism criticism is a bit different. The two stories are very similar in some ways; the plain, innocent young man from a small, generally unnoticed, peaceful, rural land being dragged away from his home to face his destiny as a hero comes to mind. However, the way the characters develop is entirely different, as are the lands and people they encounter, and the stories themselves have very little in common (besides the general theme of the quest). As for the accusation that there is no sense of history, as there is in Tolkien's meticulously crafted books, that is one fundamental difference between the two writers. Tolkien's world, while magical and epic, is made to seem real, whereas McKillip's writing is like reading a dream. Her descriptions hint at things, but are never concrete; her magic is uniquely described in such a way that the reader slides into the minds of her characters in order to understand it. With McKillip's work, you must be willing to immerse yourself in the story and writing to be captivated by it.I found the writing, the characters, the lands, and especially her unique conception of riddlery absolutely captivating, and I would wholeheartedly recommend this book to any lover of fantasy who delights in rich images and fantastic storytelling."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"A wonderful journey with amazing characters. I highly recommend this book to any fan of high fantasy."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"Once in a great, great while a book pulls you out of yourself and into another world. Since Ursula LeGuin's Earthsea Trilogy I have sought another author with that power. McKillip has it. The older I become the more surprised I am at how rare this gift is and the more I treasure it. If you enjoy the world of fantasy, one which will touch all your emotions, you should enjoy this book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I've read this series several times, and I am still amazed at how the story is so beautifully developed without one word too many or one word too few. The plot will keep you intrigued and guessing until the end. The world is one of the best fantasy worlds I've ever encountered. Above all, this is an original, not a copy from another author's work.If you haven't read this series, read it. Let your children read it - it's an excellent intoduction to epic fantasy."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"but this trilogy definitely is. It is wonderful, sometimes sad and sometimes hilarious, but always wonderful. I finished it a month ago, and I already find myself looking longingly at it when I pass the bookshelf.

Even if you hate fantasy, READ IT."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I have read these books over and over and I never get tired of them. Anyone who has ever loved fantasy will be captivated by this enthralling and altogether wonderful trilogy!!!!!"},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"The Riddle of Stars trilogy are some of the greatest fantasy I have ever read! I was deeply moved by Patricia McKillip's beautiful prose and imaginative plot! I have never been a huge fan of fantasy, but this story simply took my breath away. I couldn't put it down for days. Great job Ms McKillip! I look forward to reading your other works!"},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"Patricia A. McKillip captures her readers in the superb writing of her Riddle-Master Trilogy. At the end of the first book, she leaves you hanging, so that you can hardly wait to start the next one and find out what will happen to the characters. A beautifully written piece of fantasy; it gives you the right amount of suspense, magic, deceit, and throws in a bit of romance. I love ever single one, and I wish we could continue into the hearts of Morgan, Raederle, and everyone else."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I bought this book on the basis of 36 great reviews given here. What a mistake. This book is shallow and confusing. The characters have no depth. The ideas and concepts, while intriguing, are never developed. There is no explanation of what is going on and why? Things simply happen, for no apparent reason. And who are all these characters that bounce in and out of the story? They are never developed or have any purpose, except perhaps to offer a bed and a meal to an incredibly unlikeable 'hero'. Why does his girlfriend not want to marry him? Why doesn't she use HER powers? Who are the bad guys that are sucking the life out of the land? Why are they mad and what exactly are they doing? YOU NEVER FIND OUT! By the end of the book I was rooting for the enemy, if for no other reason than to put this indecisive, slow-witted guy out of his misery. But even the final battle was a bore. He shows up, they run away. That's it. And finally, the authors play on the words death/Deth and hell/Hel got old real soon. I vowed years ago never to buy any book that in any way shape or form compared itself to Tolkein. This one did and I wish I hadn't paid the money for it. I sincerely hope I got a copy with every other page missing, or perhaps an early draft. Something, anything that might give me a reason to beleive those other reviews. Unfortunately, I doubt it. If this is the state of current fantasy, we're in trouble."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I've been a fantasy fan ever since the Hobbit came out in the US. I've tried the first 60 pages of this trilogy and found it confusing and baseless. She may be a great fan of Tolkien but just compare the first 60 pages of the Hobbit to this confusing work and you'll see the incredible difference. I just couldn't get interested in the characters and thought at age 71, why waste my time."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"After reading any Harry Potter, there's a let down, because you know whatever you read next won't ensnare you as much. But, these books actually are interesting enough to keep you interesting for all 592 pages. Although they are slightly confusing in the begining, they eventually make a great deal of sense and are a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"What a strange, glorious story! Memorable characters, beautiful writing, and artful plot twists--nothing is quite what it appears to be! McKillip is a real wizard, and this is her masterpiece, as engrossing as it is odd. Celtic folklore enthusiasts should particularly relish touches like the Great Shout."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"First of all, I find the constant comparing to Tolkien of any Fantasy artist to be trite and overdone. In most cases it is as insulting to Tolkien's work as it is to that of the artist being compared.That being said, on with the \\"Riddle-Master\\". The storyline is wonderful; the \\"idea\\" behind these books is a work of art. However I must say the colors she uses to paint this tapestry are often garish and clashing. I've never read a book with more forced dialogue in my life. The characters more often than not change the direction of thought while speaking (\\"I...I...he's not here\\" type conversation, repeatedly) making them out to look like terrible stammerers. The metaphors and similes threaten to take over the story. Sometimes a denim jacket looks so much better without all the spangles and the rhinestones. This book would be far better without the rhinestones too. The idea behind the story, the visuals she paints, the growth of the characters from innocence to the dawning of their power is all done smoothly. The story line flows evenly, with a just a few snags. Unfortunately, the characters themselves have about as much depth and history as those in a video game.All in all, yes this is a good series if you can clench your teeth and make it through all the \\"foam colored eyes\\" and the \\"fire etched lines of her face\\" pancake batter and get right down to the actual meat & potatoes."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"A riddle:What comes in a trilogyfull of riddlery,where characters fight their destinythrough Air, Yrth, Fire and Sea?The answer to that riddle should be obvious, but there are a few other points that I think are worth mentioning about this series.1) Beware of the glossary! There is one character description in there that will ruin a revelation in the first book.Fortunately this series has more than one revelation / plot twist, so even if you do prematurely discover that character's identity, it won't ruin your experience of the whole series. It certainly didn't in my case.2) Although this series is compared to Tolkien, don't expect to find Orcs and Hobbits and rings. In general, the works of McKillip are like novel-length GRIMM FAIRY TALES (the originals, not the watered-down Disney versions).3) I love how McKillip has the first book focus on Morgan, the second on Raederle and the third on the two of them together. Speaking of Morgan and Raederle, I think these two are perhaps the most believable and interesting odd couple in fantasy.4) The first two books I'd rate 5 stars. Easily. The last book started out excellent (the bickering between the two was great!) then got a bit more confusing as Morgan is shifting shape in one paragraph, digging into someone's mind the next, fighting a battle after that and warping from country A to country B in the span of a sentence. Fortunately, the threads connected in the end and the many riddles raised received answers.If you haven't read this series yet, please don't be put off by the \\"hero trying to understand his destiny\\" storyline. I myself have read that formula countless times but this book has not only breathed new life into that tired cliche, it has mastered it."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"It's odd that this book isn't better known-- it's one of the best fantasy books I've come across in quite a while. The characters are interesting and likeable, and the writing is elegant. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I usually read a couple hours before I go to bed, but this trilogy kept the usual reading time down to an hour maximum every evening.Why, you ask, since others espouse McKillip as a master author alongside Tolkien? An earlier reviewer pointed out how the book dragged at points and I agree wholeheartedly. I usually read fairly quickly, but the prose was tedious at times and kept weighing me down. I would, on occasion, have to close the book, reopen after a minute or two, and begin a paragraph or so down from my departure point simply because the meandering descriptions and character musings were making me sleepy.On the other hand, I enjoyed the characters and the plot, and aside from the muddling of both with unnecessary writing, I had to keep coming back to the book every evening. The transformations were very believable and well-written (I bought the tree transformation easily) and I thoroughly enjoyed the angst that some of the characters were going through. The main characters are easily identified with and accepted from beginning to end, even with the murky focus that they receive at times. You'll need time to digest some of McKillip's writing, but it is admittedly worth it in the end.While this isn't something you'll want to curl up with for a long weekend, it's definitely something to enjoy in small portions--bit by bit."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"Having read Patricia McKillip's Winter Rose, The Book of Atrix Wolfe, and Song for the Basilisk in the last year I found that I liked the characters in the latter two so much that short length of the books left me wanting more of them. I think that this book compensates for that (but I still love all of her writing, because she's got style) Being a trilogy, her characters are finally given and bit more space and time to play out. I simply love Morgan and Deth. One of my current criteria for whether a book is good is wether it makes me want to draw the characters (fanart). One hundred pages into the book I'd filled a sketchbook page with character sketches."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"The Riddle Master trilogy isnt just an engrossing story that transports you to another world and time. It is fantasy adventure at its best, fun, gripping, challenging without being overwhelming to the mind.I've read the trilogy many times when the books were first out and sold separately. Never once did the story lose its appeal.Patricia McKillip brings the characters, the events, the world she writes about alive to all the senses."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I've read this series several times, and I am still amazed at how the story is so beautifully developed without one word too many or one word too few.

McKillip draws the world with such life-like imagery that she leaves the reader breathless. The characters, with all their love, hate, and flaws, reach out and pull us after them. Wildly imaginative, this series veers off the dull path of so many other fantasies. I can't wait to read more of her work!"},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I've read this book about 7 times over the years. The first time in high school, and the last as a 40+ year old engineer. This trilogy weaves threads of light and hope and strength into the fabric of the READERS' own character. (The Lord of the Rings is dark and morbid in comparison.)Here are some specifics of what I mean:It demonstrates what logical thought process is like, and how it works in life... how to search through resources and possibilities to find the truth, how to abandon your opinions/theories when new facts come up, instead of lazily and arrogantly holding to what you think or what you've always been taught. (How else to learn the truth when the official Masters of education are themselves deceived?)It teaches a balance of compassion and justice, and drives home over and over that failing to pursue the truth and to require it of others is a deadly mistake to everyone: yourself, those who love you, the nation you live in, and the entire world around you.It drives home the point that truth DOES exist, as we all know in our hearts -- rather than the myth taught so widely today that there is no truth. It does the same for evil, and nobility and honor.It teachs that you cannot judge good or evil merely by surface appearance or by concensus of opinion, but also that both good and evil must be named and acted on.It teaches how real love acts: driven by compassion, not passion; self-sacrifice, not self-focus; long-term results, not short-term gratification.It teaches how to identify real betrayal rather than assuming it by appearance or accusation, and how to properly respond.It challenges you to struggle to be better, and to shape a better world and life around you.It teaches all this with balanced examples that are somehow instinctively related to real life - even to America on 9/11/01.Above all, it is never boring, and makes you regret every time you have to put it down."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"Patricia McKillip, I offer my humble gratitude. You have succeeded remarkably at three things. First, you tell a compelling story, replete with adventure, peril and romance, that is difficult to put down for its own sake. Secondly, you write with such elegance, style and grace that when I read your words I am transported into your characters' world as if I could reach out and touch the trees, smell the ocean, and hear the winds myself. When I finally put the book down I am bemused, and I need to confirm for myself that I have not in fact left my chair the whole time. Finally, and for which I am most dearly thankful, you bring to life a story of bindings, of those connections between people, woven of love and devotion, powerful bindings that perhaps are what this life is really about. Thank you, from the depths of my own heart, for this touch of wonder."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I just finished reading this book, and after hugging it lovingly, I placed it on the special place on my bookshelf - the place I call my \\"shelf of favorite books.\\" That is where I place all of my most favorite books in the world. The Riddle-Master Trilogy is now there, because it deserves to be there.This book will be loved by people who love fantasy, like me, but I think people who aren't into Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter or whatever will be able to enjoy this trilogy, too.It has the fascinating magic of most fantasy books, and the amazing creatures and characters with remarkable abilities, but there is a humanity to it all that makes it even more stunning, because McKillip shows us so many wonderful things, but lets us see them through the eyes of a simple man who was content to farm and stay with his family - before destiny called and named him.The adventure Morgon of Hed goes through is beautiful, touching, and very exciting. It leaves me feeling like there is no aspect of being, of magic, or of true fantasy missing. McKillip's characters are real, so human, that I was able to cry for them, and feel for them, and care for them, so strongly, more so than I have for many others. Unlike some fantasy stories, where the hero is special from the beginning, and knows he is, and wants to be, Morgon is easier to relate to, because, like us readers, he lived a normal life and was content, a regular man, before his journey began.McKillip's technique is also something special. Her writing style is elegant, and poetic - how beautiful her use of language is! - and yet not so complex as to make it confusing. I appreciate her beautiful descriptions, and the way certain scenes twanged at the heart-strings.Every breath I drew while reading this book was one of wonder - either at her characters, the adventure, the loveliness of her words, or just the overall effect of how everything and everyone in this trilogy is so ALIVE! They are alive with the ups and downs of life, with the riddles that are strange and confusing, or small but still important. Everything in this trilogy is alive and has its own personality, and power - which all weave together to form this extremely enchanting book.Please read it. I swear it will be worth your time and money! It not only has all the aspects of good story-telling (a good plot, engaging characters, excellent writing, humor as well as touching scenes, etc), but it is a book that came from the heart, and reaches into your heart, and leaves a mark there that is cherishable.Read this book, and by the last page, you will want to put it on (or make) your \\"shelf of favorite books,\\" too. I guarantee it."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"This incredible story centers on an unusual prince of an ordinary country. Morgon of Hed was born with three stars on his forehead, marks that pull him into an age-old war that threatens to tear apart his world. The turmoil throws him in with men and women so real you expect to bump into them around the next corner. Sweeping through it all are magic and mystery that entwine themselves in your thoughts and tug at your emotions.Patricia McKillip writes with all the elusive beauty of a dream - simple and hypnotic. She is a truly great writer, and this trilogy is her masterpiece. Warning: once you read the first page you are lost. Expect to be caught in the spell."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"The majority of fantasy fans refer to Tolkien, so I am definitely NOT like other fantasy fans. This trilogy is to me what the Lord of the Rings is to everyone else (although I loved the movie very much and I've read the first two books and understand why people love it so much). I'm not the biggest fantasy fan--I've only read fantasy books when I was in middle school, and this trilogy is perfect for middle schoolers. It is definitely my favorite story of all time (not to mention the first fantasy story I ever picked up) and it has helped developed me as a person. Because of Mckillip, I came to love fantasy (for young adults, that is) and discovered other writers like Louise Lawrence and Meridith Ann Pierce. I love that Mckillip's works are not as popular as other fantasy writers'--it just makes it all the more special to me.I definitely recommend this trilogy to anyone who values innocent stories that feed the imaginations of young adults. As a college student now, I have my own criticisms about the trilogy, but I can never forget the effects it has had, and still has, on me. It is the epitome of my childhood and my innocence--I love it with all its flaws. Mckillip has created a magical world full of mysterious shape-changers, harpists, and wizards that is extremely unique from any other fantasy worlds(despite what other reviewers might say). Trust me--it is worthwhile to read."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I love this series. I read it once a year. The easily readable prose and simplicity of the story is what makes it great! For those of you that have had difficulty trudging through the prose in the Lord of the Rings, you will love this book.The first chapter of the series (you can read the first six pages on Amazon) is among the best writing I've read. McKillip introduces the main characters, the description of the world they live in, and sets up the story. Most interesting is that she accomplishes these tasks almost completely with light dialogue and action -- there is very little description that distracts you from the story. The whole story is very much like this chapter.There are three things that are unique about this world: First, the deity of the world is called the 'high one', and he lives in the far northern wastelands. No one ever sees him, but he communicates through his emissary 'the high one's harpist'. Second, the rulers have a special, metaphysical connection to the land and beings of their nation -- they receive this 'land rule' from the high one. They also have a connection to their heirs. Finally, the history and culture are passed down through riddles with lessons attached. The most learned are 'riddle-masters' (hence the title).The story is very simple ... . Some people may find this annoying. Also, there are some stereotypes such as the main character being from the smallest, most remote country, and he always wants to go home. Keep in mind that this story predates most of the stereotypes that are now commonplace.The bickering between the two main characters is a little annoying in the third book, but otherwise the interrelationships between characters are very interesting. I also enjoy some of the little details of this world, like the talking pig from 300 years ago.I read a lot of fantasy, and I'm very critical of much of it. Very little comes close to this series in terms of readability and story. It is a definite buy."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"This trilogy is the story of a prince who is trying to solve a riddle about the three stars on his forehead. I enjoyed it because it had a strong feeling to it. It was one of those wonderful books that I simply couldn't put down. The Riddle Master Trilogy is as compelling and suspenseful as any fine mystery story. You will want to read this book again and again. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"The writing is top-notch, as I had come to expect from this author; filled with astounding poetic prose and unconventional ways to describe sights and sounds. The story also has intense philosophical underpinnings, borrowing plenty from the usual fantasy fanfare but also expanding them in depths in ways unrecognizable from the bland tomes that populate shelves. There are so many good things to be said about the quality of the book, but I still prefer the author's single volumes stories, as I feel this particular trilogy took things to a level that is just too complex for mere entertainment. I do appreciate the fact that the author doesn't dumb things down or explain the world and its magic systems to us, but rather let me build up the knowledge organically, but at some point the weight of the whole structure collapses onto itself in confusion."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"This trilogy has long been one of my favorites, so I was upset when my copy of it became moldy. (My husband stored it in the basement without my realizing it, and it was too late when I found it.) I purchased a replacement from ebay, but it had an even worse mold problem. Sigh. Anyway, I ended up buying this version, because it's the newest reprinting I could find, and I could get a nice, new copy. That's important for this trilogy, because I reread it often, which is the main point I want to convey in this review. I have read this trilogy multiple times over three decades, and I still notice different nuances each time. The characters have an amazing depth, and the plot is extremely rich, with so many connecting details that you can always find something new each time you read it. I particularly like that the female characters are strong, interesting people who take charge of their own lives -- no screaming princess waiting to be rescued! There's also a tremendous amount of humor in the books. Between all this and the beautiful writing style, they're definitely among the best books in the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"My mother read this book for the first time as a young woman. Always, when we discussed books, she would tell me about this book - how wonderful it was, how much she enjoyed it and how she wished she could read it again. I spent months tracking down out of print copies of the series but seeing my mom's eyes light up when I gave them to her made it all worth while. :-) I own a copy myself now, and like her I adore the books. In fact, I'm going to buy her another copy that she can read (and leave the rare copies alone!)"},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"This book creates a feeling that one can hardly comprehend on the first reading. I first read it a few years ago, having heard mention of it in a guide to fantasy writing. I read the novels and was amused, but didn't think much of it.A year after that, I picked it up again. Morgon of Hed had become a being transformed in my eyes. I read it knowing how it ended, but I was still overly amazed. If you are a romantic at heart, someone who believes in things having a \\"rightness\\" to them, then you will enjoy this book. It will make you melancholy, but better in the end."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I am so happy to see this wonderful volume back.This used to be called Riddle of Stars, when it was a book of the month club volume in 1979.I read this before I read Lord of the Rings, and was quite breath taken with it.It takes place in an alternate reality of Earth. Man grew into demi-godlike powers and a war made them vanish.Morgan, a Prince of Hed was born with 3 stars and a destiny on his brow. The first book in the volume is Morgan's first steps into learning his powers and destiny and his introductions to all the land heirs.The second book in the Volume, 'Heir of Sea & Fire', follows the path of Morgan's betrothe (the Second most Beautiful Woman of An), Morgan's sister, and daughter of the Mogul (an Amazonian like city of Women).The third Volume, Morgan and Raederle complete the quest, going to each land heir for more power, so he can be ready when the Earth Master's war returns to the land.In all, there is a lot of traipsing up and down the landscape. The author doesn't shy away from using a little bit of horror to keep you entranced with the action. Wizardry, spellbinding, and characters with flare make this book memorable and definitely a keeper for your Barister Bookcase.A couple of the male characters I wouldn't mind marrying myself. Astrin, for instance. Rood is way too moody."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"Riddle Master trilogy was one of those rare books that I just picked off the shelves in a book store on an impulse. No one had recommended her works in particular. And to say I enjoyed reading that book is an understatement. The trilogy's latest edition has a note from McKillip about this particular work - her earliest, which in itself was touching. Her language is sheer prose-poetry (as I like to call it). Its a song that speaks to your heart, evoking memories and feelings you thought you never had. Even though its downplayed because its an earlier work, her trade mark - her style - is intact in Alphabet of Thorn which also I love and own. A must for any one who loves G G Kay who wrote Tigana, Fionavar Tapestry, etc.,"},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"This is the book that convinced me that waiting for a series to be finished was agony, but well worth the wait. It is simply the best of the best. I love Robert Jordan, Robin Hobbs and George R.R. Martin, but McKillip did it first! She brought me back to fantasy at a time when I had given up finding quality material.She can evoke laughter, tears, anger and fear, love and hate with a single sentence. Patricia McKillip is a true master of lyric language, and her characters will live in your heart and in your mind forever."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"When I first attempted to read this trilogy I got about 30 pages into it and put it down. The brother and sister argueing down on the farm just didn't draw me in. But luckily for me, I decided to give it another chance a few days later.I have never read anything like it. After the first 30-40 pages the first book is like being on a ride of \\"wonder.\\" Everything you see is fascinating and although you want to know the \\"secrets\\" you really don't want to get to the end.The change of perspective in the second book is the most creative technique I've seen in fantasy writing. Once again at first I was almost put off, but loved the first book so much that I pressed right on and quickly became enamored of the second story teller.The third book and payoff sometimes can be a let down after a great buildup. Not in this story. It builds to a great cresendo and delivers a mighty payoff that in no way disappoints.Great writing Ms. McKillip! Thanks for a wonderful journey that I've enjoyed several times over the years and probably will reread again soon."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"This is the finest of all of Patricia McKillip's works. Unlike the others, the characters have great depth and the story is original.This book is a collection of three shorter novels, which are now almost completley unavailable. The follow the story of Morgan of Hed, the ruler of a simple land of farmers, who finds that his fate leads him to leave his land. He endures perils for reasons he does not understand, and finds friendship amoung the rulers of other lands. Most of the books follow his journeys and the journeys of his lover, Raerderle.One of the most memorable elements of the books is the concept of riddles. These are stories of things that happened long ago which have acute meaning for the present time. Morgan's plight is echoed in the riddles which appear throughout the book, and some of the riddles are truly beautiful in their own right.Some have commented that this work is not entirely mature. Although this is true to a limited extent (occasionally a line of dialogue sounds unnatural), it is not a large enough problem to distract readers from the beauty of the whole work. It is appropriate for ages 12 and up, and wonderful for adults as well as children."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I just wanted to give it 5 stars to support its rating and offset some of the bad reviews (hee hee). Well, ok, I'll try to help out those wondering if they should buy this book.The plot: the farmer Prince of Hed with a birth mark of three stars on his forehead leaves his country to marry his betrothed, Raederle (which I think is the name of an Irish princess, so my Irish friend Caerhball told me). Anyway, our hero's journey is cut short by an ambush, and he is forced to \\"answer the unanswered riddles\\": who or what are the cold and cruel shape changers chasing him? Who really is the harpist that travels with him? What are the stars on his head? To answer these questions, the Prince of Hed goes on a journey to ask the High One, the ruler of all of the lands.And it goes on from there.It's a trilogy full of raw emotions, darkness, silence, and dreamlike poetry.This story is not new to me. I'm 23 years old now, and it was 11 years ago when I first picked up the Heir of Sea and Fire (the second part of this trilogy), which pulled me into the fantasy genre. It's a part of who I am--it's like wherever I go, I take all of the seriousness, maturity, and innocence embodied in this trilogy with me, because it has helped shaped who I am today. Thus, it's neither a typical story nor story-telling.It attracts only certain types of people--people lusting after color and richness and people appreciating not just the end of a story, but the process of getting there as well. If you're up for the challenge, read it."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"This is one I love to come back to every few years, and it never fails to remind me how good this type of fantasy can be. Although lacking the polish and literary control of McKillip's newer work (which is topnotch stuff indeed), it still has the freshness and power of that first post-Tolkien fantasy rush. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I first read this book years ago, perhaps when I was about 13, and I can honestly say that this is the most picked up and re-read book I own. Though the story has stayed with me, the power of McKillip's prose is simply stunning and I find myself craving this read again and again.Having since read several more of her books, I realize that this book represents an earlier, less-developed style of McKillip's prose. And for that, I am grateful. Her later works are so succinct as to be poetry, but this book represents an effortless read which is equal parts narrative and poem. It makes the truly original story so much more accessible.The characters and their relationships represent the gamut of human emotion and interaction. There is a wonderful simplicity of style in the storytelling. One can truly witness the metamorphosis of Morgon, of Raederle, and of the land itself as it prepares itself for the cataclysm of its ending. I never fail to be delighted by the tree-shaping of Danan or the Old Wolf of Osterland.This is a book (series) to be read and re-read. It is a book to be shared with others, and to read aloud to children and loved ones. It sends, as does all of McKillip's work, a taproot into our collective mythical imagination, which creates a much more resonant fantasy than many stories of this genre. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I love this series. I read it once a year. The easily readable prose and simplicity of the story is what makes it great! For those of you that have had difficulty trudging through the prose in the Lord of the Rings, you will love this book.The first chapter of the series (you can read the first six pages on Amazon) is among the best writing I've read. McKillip introduces the main characters, the description of the world they live in, and sets up the story. Most interesting is that she accomplishes these tasks almost completely with light dialogue and action -- there is very little description that distracts you from the story. The whole story is very much like this chapter.There are three things that are unique about this world: First, the deity of the world is called the 'high one', and he lives in the far northern wastelands. No one ever sees him, but he communicates through his emissary 'the high one's harpist'. Second, the rulers have a special, metaphysical connection to the land and beings of their nation -- they receive this 'land rule' from the high one. They also have a connection to their heirs. Finally, the history and culture are passed down through riddles with lessons attached. The most learned are 'riddle-masters' (hence the title).The story is very simple (I think Robert Jordon could learn something here). Some people may find this annoying. Also, there are some stereotypes such as the main character being from the smallest, most remote country, and he always wants to go home. Keep in mind that this story predates most of the stereotypes that are now commonplace.The bickering between the two main characters is a little annoying in the third book, but otherwise the interrelationships between characters are very interesting. I also enjoy some of the little details of this world, like the talking pig from 300 years ago.I read a lot of fantasy, and I'm very critical of much of it. Very little comes close to this series in terms of readability and story. It is a definite buy."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"It had been a while since I had read The Riddle Master of Hed when I came across this edition. I bought it since I didn't own any of the books, and I thought it would make a nice addition to my library. The book arrived, and it sat for a bit on the shelf. Then one day I picked it up and began to read...From the first chapter of the first book it sucked me into the world of Morgon, land-ruler of Hed. I couldn't stop reading. I couldn't stop turning pages. When I finished Riddle-Master of Hed I HAD to start immediately on Heir of Sea and Fire. I was then drawn into the world of Raederle and her search for Morgon. When I finished that book I HAD to start on Harpist in the Wind. Like the previous two, I couldn't stop reading.... Four days after starting The Riddle Master of Hed, I finished the last paragraph of Harpist in the Wind. Finally I could rest. I had been reading the collection every spare minute, sneaking breaks to read more while at work, avoiding people so I could read without interruption, and reading long into the night. I was exhausted, and throughly satisfied.Morgon, land-ruler of Hed has a destiny to fulfil. A destiny and an inheritance that he knows nothing about. All he has to work from are clues. Three stars on his forehead, a harp, a sword, and several riddles with no solutions. Raederle is in a similar situation. She is the daughter of a land-ruler, heir of a mysterious people with no name, and in possession of powers she is afraid to use. Both Morgon and Raederle are involved, in ways they don't understand, and often do not want to be, in the ending of an age.This book presents one of the great trilogies of modern fantasy in its complete form. The complete story arc is here, in one volume, for your time-draining, work-interrupting pleasure. You might want to take a vacation prior to opening it, the book is that hard to put down."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"On a recent trip to Boston, I live in the wild west, I was trudging through a bookstore looking for something to read and a copy of this book (the only one on the shelf---slightly dog-eared and full-priced!) called out to me. I picked it up and saw that on the back cover a reviewer compared this trilogy and the author to Tolkein. I had to buy it and make the decision myself. From page one, I was unable to put the RIDDLE-MASTER down for three complete back to back readings! Patricia McKillip deftly weaves a believable tale of Morgan and his friends and their journey from innocence to nearly immortal power. McKillip has a command of language that rivals any fine author and she has the ability to spin a story that is intriguing as well as compelling. Her heroes, Morgan and Raerjle, are characters that follow the hero formula that is as old as the epic and are as human as we all are. This complete trilogy is satisfying because it is all collected in one volume and there is no wait for each of the sequels (seemingly, the original books are out of print and I had never heard of this author). Considering that these tales were written some 25 years ago, there are delightfully fresh and as I stated above, compelling. Oh, by the way, Tolkein has nothing to fear---he is still the master but I would have no problem placing this volume on a shelf along side the copies of his work!"},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"It had been years--or should I say decades--since I read this trilogy, so when I found it reissued in a single volume, I had to buy up. My fond memories of the book were not disappointed, and it still reads as freshly now as it did during the late seventies. Then, when fantasy still remained dominated by Tolkien, or in the hands of overly prolific imitators, two authors stood out, both for the freshness of their approach and their skill of writing: Stephen Donaldson and Patricia McKillip. It's fitting, in the author's acknowledgements, to see their names still linked.As the author hints in her introduction, this trilogy lacks the maturity of her later works, such as &quot;The Book of Atrix Wolfe,&quot; &quot;Winter Rose,&quot; or the recent &quot;Song for the Basilisk.&quot; Yet all the elements are evident that have contributed to making Patricia McKillip one of the finest authors writing fantasy fiction today: beautiful, at times lyrical, prose, imaginative and original themes and characters, and a wondrous sense of the magical that infuses both her world and story throughout. Each world she creates is unique and thoughtfully rendered, with elements designed to provoke both thought and wonder, and her characters are some of the most striking found in fantasy fiction--no small accomplishment indeed!While I understand the exuberance behind some earlier reviewers' comments--this work is special and deserving of wide readership--some of the praise here goes overboard. Compared to the second two books, &quot;The Riddle-Master of Hed&quot; is a rough cut, both in conception and in terms of its writing. It lacks the assurance of the later two books, and, despite some marvelous passages, such as the book's opening and the story of Peven, at times rambles and exhibits writing in need of further polish and greater concision. Essential for establishing much of the basis for the rest of the trilogy, and containing many marvelous episodes and characters, it nonetheless displays the lack of focus and more assured writing skills evident in the following two books, and for this reason prevents me from according it full marks. And, this early trilogy is certainly not up to the standard of the author's later and more mature work.That said, I nonetheless consider this a classic of the genre, far more imaginatively written than scores of other work currently lining retailer's shelves. Further, it is written with a style that sets the author apart from almost all other wordsmiths presently practicing the genre, a beauty of voice that makes her tales compelling and unique. And while I am dubious of the many comparisons to Tolkien, there is a sense and tone of wonder echoing throughout this story that I have never found elsewhere except in Tolkien's work. I cannot recommend this book more highly."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I just want to add the perspective of a not-hard-core fantasy reader-- I just like good stories, be it an oldie like The Brothers Karamazov or a new great like The Life of Pi. And this is one of my all-time favorite stories. It really is worthy of the \\"classic\\" label-- it is masterful storytelling, utterly creative, and seems more real than 'real-life' fiction. What matters most to me are characters who are real and story that speaks into my own life-- Riddle Master has both. It has none of the cheesiness or worn-out qualities of some of those fat, best-selling fantasies with 39 sequels that you can buy at airports. This story is deep, and stays with you for life. If you can make it through the second chapter, I don't think you'll find this story hard to get into at all.Regardless of what many others have said, without a doubt I can say this is McKillip's strongest work. While her writing is always compelling, many of her 'more mature works' lack the depth and complexity of this one. I definitely enjoyed The Book of Atrix Wolfe, Song for the Basilisk, and Winter Rose, but they all left me feeling somewhat dissatisfied, due to the somewhat tidy endings and incomplete characters. They are enjoyable, well-written stories that you forget in a year. Not so with Riddle Master.It definitely IS high time that those cheesy 70s mass-market paperback covers (that probably kept would-be appreciative readers away) were replaced with this one-volume reprint. I'm not the only one to initially judge a book by its cover. Take the opportunity to experience this beautiful story without having to brave the 3 annoying comic-book paintings, produced by those cover-artists who never read the books. I'm buying a new volume and giving the old ones to someone who doesn't care about aesthetics!"},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I grabbed a copy of this book to read on a plane to Ireland. The plane landed when I had finished all but one chapter, and I ran to the baggage claim to sit down and finish it.The story was compelling, the writing was exquisite, and McKillip manages the nearly impossible -- in writing about emotions and experiences that are impossible to put into words, she suggests them so well that the reader is able to feel them. It made me choke up in a number of places, even cry in a few, and there are images burned into my mind that I will never forget. A comparison to Tolkien is probably useless -- McKillip and Tolkien share little except an obvious love of myth and language, and stunning vision and originality.However, in reading the other reviews here, where reviewers indicate that they found the book confusing, or \\"weren't able to get into it,\\" it did occur to me that this is not a book for everyone. The language and images are rarely concrete -- they are fleeting impressions, suggested rather than described. The story and writing overall are dreamlike -- you can understand them instinctually, but if you try to analyze or think about them too much, they fade like a dream does upon waking. For people who like their descriptions concrete, or who prefer events to be clearly explained, or who want explanations that are stated directly rather than implied, it would probably make for very frustrating reading.The best advice I can give to a would-be reader who is not familiar with McKillip's writing style is to not think about it too much while you're reading it -- just experience it. If, after finishing the first book of the trilogy, you're not enthralled, put it down. If you aren't put off by the dreamlike nature of the book, however, you will find it one of the most amazing reading experiences you will ever have."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"For centuries the ghost of King Peven has haunted his decaying castle, playing a deadly riddle-game with visitors: his crown against their lives. He has always won. Now someone has taken his crown, ignorant of the fact that with it goes the hand of Raederle, the second most beautiful women in the known world. The crown has been won by Morgon, Prince of tiny, agricultural Hed, and it's under his bed while he, his brother and sister, and Snogg Nutt the pigherder try to decide what to do with it. Suddenly riddles are gathering like storm clouds over a world scoured centuries ago by the War of the Earthmasters, powerful magical beings who once ruled, then suddenly fled the world. Where did they go? Who were they? Who are the powerful and hostile men from under the sea, and why have they suddenly come after Morgon? Most important of all, why does Morgon have three stars birthmarked on his forehead? Luckily, he's one of the Riddle-Masters and has a chance of finding the answer. Meanwhile Raederle, no shrinking violet, calls upon the powers that she is heir to through her father the King of An, as the ancient dead of An begin to rise and pursue their ancient wars, and strikes a desperate bargain with the dead to safeguard Morgon. Who is the harper named Deth? Where did the wizards go? Why doesn't the High One, source of authority and land-rule, act in some way? And who will fix the leak in poor Snogg Nutt's roof? Even if you turned into a tree and thought about it all winter you'd never figure it out. Secrets as deep as the root of a mountain, as wild as a pack of wolves, as chaotic as the pounding sea: solve them or the world plunges into horror."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"Usually when an author is compared to Tolkien, it means that there are lots of swords, sorcery, countries clashing and a dark lord, but that the spirit of the master of fantasy is missing. This is one trilogy that almost lives up to the words -- a majestic, magical adventure that spans all of McKillip's richly invented world.\\"Riddle-Master of Hed\\" opens with the discovery of a jeweled crown under Prince Morgan's bed -- a sign that he outriddled a king who had never been defeated before. Along with the crown, he wins the right to marry his pal's sister, Raederle, the second-most beautiful woman in the continent of An. But Morgan is stopped on his way by a shipwreck and news of something dark and sinister creeping into the lands. Strange shapeshifting creatures are entering the lands, the wizards have vanished from the land, and somehow the three stars on Morgan's brow are connected to their presence and how to stop them. He heads off to Erlenstar Mountain, to find the High One -- and finds more than he bargained for...\\"Heir of Sea And Fire\\" very slowly resolves the cliffhanger ending of \\"Riddle-Master,\\" focusing instead on Princess Raederle. The land-rule -- a sort of sixth sense given to kings -- of Hed has passed to Morgan's brother, meaning that apparently Morgan is dead -- but Raederle and her father don't believe it's true. She sets off with a few faithful friends, and encounters the semi-sinister harpist Deth, the shapechangers, armies of the dead rampaging through her father's lands -- and disturbing news about her and her heritage.\\"Harpist in the Wind\\" continues from the end of \\"Heir,\\" with Morgan and Raederle planning what to do next. Strange rebel armies -- of both the living and the dead -- are massing in Ymris, and Morgan is taking the dead armies to Hed in an attempt to protect it. Then he and Raederle set off to find the High One and wring some answers out of him -- only he may not be what they expect. As Morgan grows in power and gains knowledge about all of An, he strips bare the secrets of the High One, the shocking identity of the shapechangers, and begins a new age for the lands...There was never a less cliched author than Patricia McKillip -- the scope, majesty and richness of her invented world rival the best of the genre. Her plot twists and turns inside the lush, dreamlike prose that she's so good at, making a snowstorm as eerie as a magical showdown that can redefine an entire world's magic.Her plot can be seen in two ways, as the growth of a naive young prince into a wise paragon of power, and also about the shifting of a land from one era into another. The Four Portions of An are a detailed, real-seeming fantasy world, and her princes, wizards, ghosts, and harpists are wise, sometimes sinister, mysterious and full of power.Morgan is an excellent hero, who is not arrogant or desirous of the power that he is gaining. As confused by his own destiny as by the events around him, he spends much of the first book resisting his fate. Raederle is an excellent counterpart to Morgan, afraid of her heritage and fiercely determined to follow him wherever he goes. They are not a perfect couple: they bicker and argue occasionally, but they do not allow divisions to sit and fester. Deth is the ultimate ambiguous character, keeping you guessing until the end about what the heck is going on with him.There are no elves, dwarves, fairies, gnomes, or similar fantastical creatures in this book. It came to me with a bit of a shock at the end that aside from the shapechangers, there were only humans in this -- humans who can learn magic, who make mistakes and who have to search for the truth instead of having it handed to them on a plate. The magic is startlingly eerie, subtle and pervasive rather than being flashy. Similarly, the shapechangers' menace isn't overdone -- much of their creepiness results from the question of what they are, and why they are doing what they do.The complexity and depth of McKillip's early trilogy is still striking today. Her rich invented world and haunting, complex tale of magic, wizards and riddles make \\"The Riddlemaster Trilogy\\" a modern fantasy classic."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"Don't talk to me about Tolkien, Terry Brooks or Stephen Donaldson. Since I first read &quot;The Riddlemaster&quot; (then called &quot;A Riddle of Stars&quot;) in my early teens, all other fantasy paled; I've simply never been able to enjoy any of the other authors books because this is simply the best! Morgon of Hed is a wonderful hero, human while retaining that legendary quality. He is written with humor, pathos, &amp; empathy as are all the characters in this cycle. Unusually for fantasy, the female characters are not only strong but individual while retaining their feminine qualities. The world McKillip creates is one that her readers can say &quot;this feels right! These are the rules that should govern the world!&quot; And all the characters, major to minor, have depth &amp; uniqueness. McKillips language creates vivid pictures from epic magic battles to humorous vignettes. If you read fantasy, or know someone who does, this book is indispensable. Buy it today!"},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"Patricia McKillip writes the best prose in fantasy, better even than Tolkien. Her sentences are like glittering jewels that sparkle and enchant with their beauty. Happily, the story itself is not dimmed by the splendor of the author's words.The story is of Morgan, Prince of Hed, whose life has been marked by Mystery in the form of three stars upon his brow. What these stars mean, both to him and his world, is the main plot of the story and the answer to this mystery is satisfyingly astonishing and impressive.Riddles and magic, ancient kings and timeless wisdom, powers of wind and earth, fire and sea, each portrayed with wonder and elegance are encountered by Morgan on his journey. Most importantly, the reader is never entirely sure how things will turn out until the very end -- in fact, we are rarely sure how things *are* until the very end. It is when you re-read the story that you really appreciate how deft she was weaving the threads of her story into the wonderful tapestry that is the Riddle of the Stars -- The Riddle-master Trilogy."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I recently came across the Riddle-Master books and was very pleased with my discovery. McKillip has crafted a fantasy series that while being very much in the traditional realm of that genre is still an original and refreshing series. Morgon, the Riddle-Master, must set out on a journey to fulfill his destiny, but his journey is not just a bad imitation of Tolkein, but one that is captivating and a mystery to him and to readers. The journey that he undertakes is one that he would rather not go on, but he knows that he must. The result is a story about a man's wanderings as he tries to solve the riddle of his life.What I really enjoyed about these books is how real McKillip makes everything seem. Of course, these books are fantasy and the armies of ghosts and the ability to change shapes are constant reminders of that fact. But nevertheless, the characters and their lives seem believable. The main character, Morgon, is not a hero who has the universe figured out and knows exactly what must be done to save it. He is a common man who discovers that there are further plans for his life than pig-herding. He is forced to discover that destiny and eventually save the world as he knows it. But those are not things that he immediately knows or is willing to accept. Like as for normal humans, his life unfolds day by day. As readers, we see the pieces of his life fitting together at the same pace as he does and so his life seems more real.I also appreciated how McKillip portrayed the women in these books. She again created characters which seem real. Her women are not the warrier princess gods or the traditional beautiful weakling extremes that one finds in many fantasy novels. Instead, they are real women. Yes, some of them are the best warriers around or can use magic like no one else, but they also have fears, emotions, longings, and get sick on boats. They are not unnatural superwomen, but they do have strength and character and are not afraid to show it. It is so seldom that one finds a good portrayal of women in any fiction that I must praise McKillip for the ones she gave us.While the Riddle-Master books may not be as fast paced as other fantasy stories, they are very captivating. One becomes so wrapped up in the story story that one feels the extreme emotions that Morgon feels at the book's climax. (I don't want to give it away, but the twist at the end is really good.) It's a great series and a fun read."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I rarely ever read fantasy, but with some coaxing from a friend, I decided to read this one. It was absolutely breathtaking. The characters were so well drawn that I could see and feel them in my mind clearly. The plot was vivid and intricate. I can't say enough good things about this wonderful trilogy! Great story Ms. McKillip! I can't wait to read some of her other works!"},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I know others have commented on the wonderful characterization of Morgon, Raederle and Deth, but I can't help repeating it. Patricia A. McKillip creates the most amazing struggle inside and out of Morgon - the conflict between life as a farmer and a mysterious destiny, and his confusion over who to trust. As soon as I finished the trilogy the first time, I went back to reread it all the way through. Currently, I'm working through it yet again. There's too much in it to be captured in one reading. McKillip snags you with the first sentence and keeps you guessing until the very last word, but it is well worth the wait. Watching Morgon and Raederle grow to accept their powers and destiny, aching to return to the lives they lose is heart-wrenching and beautiful. This is a must read."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"The Riddle Master was a great trilogy fantasy book.I thought it started out as a great story seen. It keeps you reading at times not wanting to put the book down.This is one book I did not plan on reading, I picked it up and started reading the first paragraph to see what it was like, then I could not stop reading, had to finish it to see what happens."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I was surprised that Amazon's product page currently states that this wonderful young adult (YA) fantasy is for \\"Age Level: 18 and up\\" and \\"Grade Level: 12 and up\\". This is a fantastic story which could be read by most ages. Without hesitation, I would say that this would be enjoyable for grades 7 and up.This trilogy has been a favorite of mine for many years which I regularly dust off to enjoy again. It is an old friend who might not always be at hand but is never forgotten. This is the story of Morgon, Prince of Hed and Riddle-master, who is born with three stars on his face. Morgon has searched fruitlessly for many years to understand the riddle of the three stars. Suddenly Morgon finds himself in peril from those who have been waiting to disrupt the destiny of the Star-Bearer. He is confronted by deadly mysteries which challenge his commitment to the tenets of riddle-mastery which warn about the dangers of unanswered riddles. This is not a coming of age story, as is frequently seen in YA fantasy, but more of an epic YA fantasy. While the story starts on a small scale it evolves to epic proportion as the safety of the entire High One's realm is affected by the destiny of the Star-Bearer.This is a must read story for those who are fans of the YA Fantasy Genre."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"To start off with, I bought the first book in audio book format, thinking I would try it out and decide from there if I wanted to listen to the rest. About a quarter of the way in I bought the second and the third, knowing that I wouldn't be able to stand any waiting between them.What is really delightful with this series (and a little confusing) is just how much back story and history there is to this world. The characters run around in a landscape that constantly refers to past events, but is addressed in such a nonchalant manner that a reader (or listener) learns to just breath and accept what is happening. You just have to put your trust in McKillip that in the end all will be answered. And lo-and-behold that faith was answered! The series practically screams at you to reread it with the knowledge of what is to come. And it is just as wondrous and delightful the second time, or third time, around.Magic -- Lets talk about that. As with any fantasy series, it can be a very tricky topic. Magic is a powerful literary element, but what can be so frustrating is a series where \\"Our Hero has an endless amount of very very strong magic, therefore he/she wins!!\\" (A little like dragonball Z if you catch my drift) But McKillip saves us once again by very skillfully maneuvering this problem. It is common, but not possessed by all. It has many variations that tend to follow bloodlines, or is restricted by rules. The major element of magic here is a thing called land rule, which is sort of akin to kings passing on their crown to the next heir, only that depending on the region, that 'crown' embodies a multitude of magics and powers specific to that kingdom. It turns out to be a rather clever device, and without giving anything away, I found my self more pleased then I could have imagined with the ending.To stray down a side path, the series has interesting combination of ephemeral (where magic and events happen in vague terms that purposely give the reader strange dual imagery that does and doesn't contradict itself, but instead tells the reader to accept it peacefully) and very specific concrete information. While this duality was unexpected, I must admit that once again McKillip pulled through in every way.In short, this was well weaved, and the journey to the conclusion was just as wonderful as the final delight of everything coming together. Read this series!!!"},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I am a Patricia McKillip fan because of this series. She weaves the most intesting stories and I am always left asking questions after her books. She is a great fantasy writer but this trilogy is defenatly her best."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"Still my favorite fantasy trilogy/series. I've read many many trilogies in 40+ years. Still have to rebuy this once a decade :)"},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I read this series every year or two, and have since I was about 13. The language and concepts are pure poetry. It should be made into a movie trilogy! It would be beautiful."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"Patricia A. McKillip weaves an enchanting tale of magic and destiny with her story about Morgon, the land-ruler of Hed, who holds a fate beyond his wildest dreams. He is promised to Raederle, the second most beautiful woman in An, yet their romance is anything but conventional. Morgon's trials take him from his roots as a humble farmer to the heir of an enormous empire.The imagery in this trilogy hooks you from the very first line and draws you into a world of beauty and adventure that haunt you days after you've finished reading the book. I found myself drawn into the kingdoms described by McKillip's lush writing, wanting to sit and drink wine with the characters in their elaborate dining rooms.When Morgon finally discovers his true destiny, it takes your breath away. It's completely unexpected and unique, and it's one of the reasons this trilogy is so special. This is one of my favorite fantasy books of all time."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"Though McKillip's story is one that has been told a thousand times, she goes about it in a somewhat original way. The basic story is of an innocent farmer boy who is pulled into a quest he does not want to complete. Destiny forces his hand, the world is saved, and the boy attains unimaginable powers.As other reviewers have said her prose is dreamy. Many of the similes and metaphors could have been edited out, but some of them are brilliantly executed.The story itself feels a bit jerky, but it gets her point across. Her exposition is brief, but by trusting her readers to keep up with her, McKillip pays her readers the compliment of assuming they are intelligent.I would suggest borrowing the series from your local library before you purchase it. The story is worthy of reading, and some reader's will want a hard copy of the novels to keep on their bookshelves, but others will not find it worth the space or price."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I read this series when it was first published, longer ago than I care to admit. It was a favorite then, and still is. How many books can you read over and over and still enjoy every time? Morgan is a great character -- wise and humble -- who discovers unsuspected depth and power within himself. And Raederle (whose name I will never be able to pronounce) is a woman as fierce and independent as any character I've come across. It sounds corny, but these characters changed my view of life (hey--I was twelve!). I will remember them forever."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I have been a Fantacy reader, since I was a child, I thought my Fantacy reading was over when I grew up, but luckily I found, that this was not true. I have read Mythology, Philosoph and Psycology. Fantacy is the very Potluck of it all. The Riddle Master of Head starts in a hazy tumble, and it takes a little while till you know that this is a fantacy, but then you are already lost. This is the most outstanding Fantacy I have ever read, and I think I have read them all. It will linger in your memory for ever, because you feel as if you were there. The discriptions of feelings, emotions and scenery are rare masterpieces. Putting it into one Complete Trilogy is a mercy to the reader, who does not have to wait for the next book to hit the shelf. This is to my knowledge the best book Patricia McKillip has written. Read it."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"Here is the master work of one of the most sensitive and brilliant writers. Here is a world and people you will love and never forget, an intelligent plot which is paced beautifully, and phrases so fine they bring tears. This is one of those works I come back to every few years. Unique and perfect. Read this!!!"},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"To those familiar with Patricia McKillip's recent work, gorgeously evocative miniatures like The Book of Atrix Wolfe and Winter Rose, The Riddle-Master trilogy is an intriguing puzzle: one of the few modern fantasy writers capable of concision got her start with a three book epic.But while Riddle-Master is instructional to fans of the author's later books, it feels like one of those stories that must be read young to really work -- it's a sprawling hero's quest, overflowing with McKillip's trademark dreamlike prose, but this not yet entirely controlled style isn't necessarily suited to a complex, lengthy narrative.As the characters become so powerful they can change into any form, cross countries in the blink of any eye, the many kings, kingdoms, and creatures blend into a lovely monotony, and eventually only the resolution of the books' central mysteries keeps one reading.That said, if you've kept faith with Morgon, Raederle, and Deth, the finish is spectacular, the place of women within the narrative is a sparkling rebuke to Tolkien and Jordan, and I suspect that if I had read these books twenty years ago I would love them dearly."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"The Riddlemaster of Hed was the first of Patricia McKillip's books that I read. I was drawn in by the disarming simplicity of words combined with such lyricism, such beauty, such honesty, that at the end of the three books in the series I could not pick up another book for days.I reread the series once, sometimes twice a year, and am still left with a sense of awe when I finish. There is no other trilogy that I would recommend so highly as this one."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"let me start by saying that i love this book, it's one of those \\"drag you into a completly diffrent world and way of thinking\\" books which just suck you right in. it is an epic story of a young man in his quest to find himself and his place in the world, and though i wasn't born with 3 stars on my forhead (i wonder j.k. rollings read that book...) it still made me feel alot of empathy towared morgon of hed, as he grows up and learn more and more about the world, about himself and about how those two things interact a harmonius way. the story's full of love with every step that he takes, towared the woman he love, towared his mentor, his family and the beautiful land in which he lives and as he goes on and learn to love more and more of it, so do i, as a reader, see the diffrent places and beauty of it all.there's a lot to learn from this book, both about magic, about oneself and the connection we make with people. i come back to this book every year or so, and it has became sort of a masuring point for me, seeing with who and what i identify and how life effected me in between reads."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"It's been years since I've read this series, so I don't remember the particulars, but I wanted to recommend it highly, because it's one of my favorite trilogies, probably right up there with Tolkien's and Michael Scott Rohan's. I've read numerous others, some of which I thought were just so-so. Give this a try if you like good fantasy."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"Patricia McKillip is not only a great writer of fantasy; she's one of the great living masters of English prose, and this is her masterpiece. This trilogy is comparable to the Lord of the Rings in its scope, in the truth and consistency with which it's imagined, and in its profundity."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"An incredible epic tale with beautiful imagery that encompasses all the trials of total self acceptance. Patricia McKillip weaves a splendid tale that reaches deep into your soul and pulls out the essence of deep personal inquiry. I cannot think of a better book to give to anyone in search of their own personal power. I have read this trilogy several times and know it will be read many more times."},{"Title":"Riddle-Master","review":"I really am intrigued by the tale. I am new to reading fantasy, but have been impressed by Patricia McKillip's Alphabet of Thorn so I thought I would give this a try. And I am not too terribly disappointed, the tale itself is great,the descriptions are decent, the settings imaginative and pique my curiosity. But the writing is not what I expected. I have been finding myself confused by what the characters say then follow it with melodramatic behavior. I first thought \\" oh OK I am just tired and not paying attention.\\" but several times when I was awake and paying keen attention found that again I became confused and had to re-read a scene because it just didn't seem to fit with what the characters were discussing. I can't write it off as a different culture because there are no explanations for this odd behavior. I am happy with the story so I continue to read, but I'm not sure what to think of the over done behavior of the characters. Perhaps in the 70s melodramatic behavior of characters was acceptable."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON VISITING MAUAI. I WOULDN'T DREAM OF HAVING ANY BOOK BUT THIS ONE. THIS IS THE ULTIMATE GUIDEBOOK TO HAVE. THIS IS LIKE A BIBLE FOR MAUAI THE MAPS AND INFORMATION IS VERY VERY INFORMATIVE AND OUT OF THIS WORLD, ESPECIALLY THE ROAD TO HANA AND THE BEACHES"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"OK. I am on Maui at this moment. This is my last morning here, and I want to write something about this book.First of all, it is the Book for Maui. We saw almost 1 out of 5 people holding this book in their cars on the road of Hana. If they were holding any book at all, it was a blue one.But this is my caution. Use this excellent book wisely if you are common travelers like us spending only a few days here. The authors of the books are very adventurous and sometimes-sometimes,it is even too much for adventurous people like my family.First day--To HanaOn the first day of our trip, we drove to Hana. With this book, we did not miss a great water fall near the Garden of Eden(do not go into the garden, it is not worthwhile). But the book is of too much detail and we stopped at too many unimportant spots. When we reached seven ponds, it was already 5pm. Too late for the trail to another great fall!On our way back, we wanted to visit a \\"real Jewel\\"--Venus pond. Yes, we finally reached it. But to get there, we walked through a stinky brook, jumped over barbed iron fences, and hurt our legs-just for the glimpse of a pond! It was not worthwhile, to be frank.The drive back to the hotel was horrible. We are Californians! But driving on Hana \\"highway\\" back to the West is a hellish journey after dark. We saw two car accidents on the way back. People were desperate.My recommendation for a one-day trip to Hana?Stop near Garden of Eden and watch the great fall-Stop on the road to watch some road-side falls-(If you are a bit adventurous, go to the sea side pond with a fall, it is before the black sand beach, takes time and the road is bumpy, but the view is wonderful)-black sand beach- (Quickly drive through Hana Bay)- Seven Ponds and the trail to the great fall. If you do not want to stay in Hana, get back early!Second day-West MauiOn the Second day of our trip, we visited West Maui, this book was our Bible. Without it, we cannot find the dragon's teeth, and perhaps cannot find the Blow Hole. The trail down to Blow Hole was excellent, and we enjoyed it very much. But all this is based on one condition. We learned! We skipped over the book details, and looked at the pictures only. So we made much less stops, and by 4pm, we were at Blow Hole. At 5pm, we were back. A wonderful trip.Third day--Rain Forest Experience.Very much regretting not being able to visit the last fall on the first day, we followed the book to visit some kind of a rain forest trail on 340 Highway. EcoDrive guys took people to there as well, and the book told us exactly where to park. The journey was fun at the very beginning, and then, to be a bit dramatic, we almost lost our lives!After passing two hanging bridges, we jumped over a small brook. \\"Boulder jumping\\", right? There is another brook to cross and we will be able to see the fall. We forgot one thing, it was raining heavily. Ho ho ho.....The second brook cannot be crossed. It had became a river. Looking at the torrents galloping downstream, it suddenly occurred to me--what if!!!It was true!We went back to the first brook we just crossed. It had became a river already. The raging water's white foam had masked all the boulders we jumped over. No one in sight, for this is a place few people visit. It was still raining, and I tested a few spots, the water was as high as my waist. The torrent once almost carried me away. Fortunately I was holding one side of a bamboo, and I managed to get back. Waiting for rescue. My sprint cellphone did not work here. My wife suggested we go downstream to find some possible rocks to pass the river, I refused -Just a few months ago, some Koreans(right?) got lost on a highway and wanted to find a path themselves, the father died for searching for a path, the mother stayed and got rescue. This is a lesson. Just wait on the road.We waited and waited and waited. Minutes passed like hours, hours like years, that is the kind of feeling we had. Finally, after about 1 hour staying by the river bank in the rain. Some local Polynesian guys miraculously appeared. Maybe they were sent to us by the rain god Maui. Anyhow, they pulled us over the river and we survived! Our Canon camera got damaged in crossing the river and we were wet all over, but our lives are well worth that 500-dollar camera.Now I understand why the lady at the trail entrance asked us to sign the contract \\"If you die it is your problem not ours\\". If we were a few minutes late in crossing the first creek, the sudden torrent from the upstream might have carried us away. Has the book cautioned us this? NO? But did not it mention the legend that some kind of god will come from the water, pull you in and kill you?we can then go on with our adventure to the South Coast of Maui--following this book again.A few very good beaches....But we need to go to the REAL JEWEL--the Fish Bowl. According to local legend, it is near some telephone pole. The book gives us a detailed description. Our problem? Not taking the dictionary with you.We glanced over the book, parked in a pitch-black hell-looking lava land and started to count the telephone poles. It was 4pm. At 5pm, we had crossed the lava land, and reached the end of road on South Maui. We did not find the \\"Fish Bowl\\". One old lady who drove past us half a hour ago asked us, \\"You guys certainly had a long walk. What were you guys doing? \\" \\"We are looking for Fish Bowl\\". \\"Fish Bowl, some kind of restaurant?\\" \\"No, Fish Bowl is a snorkeling paradise.\\" When we were pondering how to walk back across the lava land in dusk light, people helped. Someone drove us back to our parking lot and we checked the book, here is the reason: we did not remember the number of the telephone pole correctly. We did see an old couple counting telephone poles in front of us, but they gave up after 25 minutes walk. But we marched on.It was total darkness now. So, no Fish Bowl....The fourth day, we took \\"Four Wind II\\" as recommended by the book to do some snorkeling. The food was good, the trip was fun, and we saw whales at a long long distance away and some turtles. Then we went up to the mountain, and had some very good views. The book gave us a lot of details which we appreciate.This is my fifth morning. I am wondering what to do before the departure. Writing a review of the book which guided our journey? Yes. After this, I am going to the Fish Bowl again, that is, if my wife does not object to that idea.____________________________________Jan. 3No, we did not go to the Fish Bowl. But the snorkeling areas in the book are decent enough.Here is the conclusion of my review on this book:1. It contains too many spots (even too many \\"Real Jewels\\") which certainly cannot be covered by an ordinary tourist in a few days. So do not think about visiting all the \\"Real Jewels\\" if you are staying on the island for a short visit.2. Picking the \\"best\\" Real Jewels from the author's perspective may or may not be advisable. The authors are very adventurous, and constantly pick the most exotic places way out of the common spots as their \\"best\\". Searching for their best sometimes is simply not advisable. If you are too old, or if you are not that adventurous. If fact, my wife suggested that perhaps you should find out your own target for the day first (perhaps from another book), go there directly, and then on your way back, visit some of their Real Jewels.3. Bring your cell phone with you all the time. If following their suggestions, you are way out of the regular tourist spots, you might get some help from your phone if you get into trouble. If the cell phone does not work, wait on the road for help, do not walk into wilderness for help. Had we departed from the trail and go downstream for help, it may have taken much much longer time for us to get out of the danger.4. If you are going to Hana, do come back one hour before the Sunset. For most of you, driving back from Hana at night can be a most terrible experience. Skip some of their Real Jewels would not hurt at all. If the spot is not even ranked as a Real Jewel, simply skip it, and most probably you will not regret that.5. If you are thinking about Snorkeling on the sea, as long as you know how to swim, the boats do not seem to differ from each other that much. Four Winds II is very good, but its price is also the highest. Picking a cheaper boat and I do not think you will have much to regret.6. Overall, this book is very good, and I still recommend you to buy it -- as a dictionary for Maui, so to speak."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"yes i can totally understand why locals don't like this book. it really tells you where the secret places are! and annoying midwestern tourists will now find all of them because of this book. but, if you're like me and my friends, you are cultured and knowledgeable, and aren't a stupid typical tourist. and you will find this book so helpful and you'll be so grateful you have it! i couldn't imagine my trip to maui without it."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I think this book misleads people about the safety of the trips, The directions to get to these trips, and plus there is better places to go. Every place you go with this book there are 100 other tourists heavily impacting the natural resources. If the activities made sure people did not tresspass, had safe hiking trails. and respected the cultural resources. then maybe but it has no regard for local culture, to reveal Maui just ask a local. They have the most revealing insight to the islands, Locals will not send you hiking thru burial grounds, tresspassing on private property, or not get you hurt.If you really reveal Maui you find inside it's rich respectful culture, not it's tour books."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Well, I wasn't impressed with Maui overall...we stayed at a nice big Marriott in Wailea but to get to anything outside of the hotel's ridiculous prices for food, we had to drive a few block away. Thanks to this book we tried a bunch of great restaurants. We tried to drive to the 7 pools place and down that way after the HORRIBLE drive to Hana, and the road was closed...such a waste of a day. Do not get carsick driving to Hana! The road alone is so curvy and scary because of the locals who fly along it and around these hair pin turns, that you can't even relax when you find a spot to pull over at. The one place we stopped, Chings Pond which is beautiful not only has a huge NO TRESPASSING sign, which the book doesn't mention, but also it's right below the road so the big busses driving by can watch you trespass.The best part of the book was the road south of our hotel, the hidden beaches and places to snorkel. We did have a great time seeing all kinds of sharks, eels, and fish at the many places to snorkel.Anyhow, the book is definatley helpful. If you don't buy it before your trip, I promise you won't have a problem finding one on the island.My advice is don't use the the bulky books, there are these maps you can find in any ABC store, called Franks Diving/Snorkeling map for whichever island you're on which points out all the places to go, this is just as helpful if not better than the Revealed books."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Lots of excellent information that you don't get anywhere else.

Remember the guy who wrote this book flies a trike. Book states no real problem driving around the Northern volcano. 4 wheel drive is not needed.

He kinda forgets to describe the lack of guardrails and the sheer 500 to 2000 foot drop off. miss by 3 feet and it's goodbye tourista. one lane, rough asphalt cracked towards the dropoff side, lots of sharp curves, and the chance to back up to a putative cut off. Enough to give us acrophobics a heart attack. Asked at the Hotel and they said the Southern volcano will be the same if I try to go all the way around it. I'm going to do the Hana trail and turn around at Hana. You are forewarned, but, hey it's your life. Otherwise, the book has been ok.

The first bad reviews give off a sour-grapes \\"this is our island, how dare you tell lowly tourists about our secret places\\" vibe that really seems a bit ungrateful for an economy based on tourism, but as I read some of the others, I began to agree that maybe the author does give a bit too much information about hidden, unpredictably maintained trails, and potentially dangerous access points. But I will defend him in that all the references I saw to \\"private property\\" were actually state owned property leased to corporations, not individuals, for which just as many locals use these secret trails as do tourists. Readers need to apply common sense as to whether or not a particular hike is within their means. I think he also adequately defends his less-than-steller reviews of some of the \\"tourist trappy\\" activities, or \\"snotty attitudes\\" of some operators quite well, and happily acknowledges when one has made an effort to improve. I would not at all be surprised to find that those complaining about his negative reviews have a vested interest in these operations. I respect the opinions of most of the people who posted negative reviews, but I hope they would understand that 99.9% of us are not vandals, litterbugs, or eco-terrorists, we're nice people spending our hard-earned money to visit a beautiful state, please give us some credit. There's always going to be a knucklehead in every group - houley or local.Ok, controversial politics aside, as long as you heed the cautions noted in the text, I still have to declare this the best travel guide I have ever read. I read the 2012 Frommer's guide at the same time, and almost NONE of the interesting side trips that Maui Revealed talks about are even mentioned in the other guides. The \\"brand name\\" guides seem to just blindly recommend the most popular tour operators without giving you any alternatives. The reviews of the restaurants and activities in this guide are also done anonymously, and with, I feel, honesty and integrity. It is obvious that the author, as he claims, actually walked/drove/ate/rode/viewed everything he wrote about and didn't just pass down obsolete information from other sources.The useful advice is also peppered with wonderful historical anecdotes, and the entire thing is written with a wonderful blend of professionalism and casual humor.I could not advise buying any other Maui book, unless it was in ADDITION to this one. This one is a must, unless you are only interested in the basic tourist information and have no desire to explore.I feel I am so much better prepared to have a great time because of the information I learned from this book.

Their dining, \\"not to miss\\", \\"a real gem\\" and \\"diversion\\" information are helpful in taking you off the \\"touristy\\" and beaten path and seeing things sometimes that even the locals don't know! There have been times where I was the only one at the beach they suggested, how's that for privacy? I would highly recommend that you purchase this book before going to Maui and reading up on things and mapping your trip out. You will see so much and do so much and really I think that it gives you better time management for your trip. As I write this review I am currently sitting on the Big Island of Hawaii in Puna in a house called Honu Cove overlooking the ocean. And you can bet that my copy of Big Island Revealed isn't too far away. Before visiting any island, visit Amazon and purchase the guidebook for your island and read up....it is well worth it and you won't be disappointed. The way that the book is written is a comfortable feeling, like they are hoping you have the best vacation possible instead of just writing a book to make money. And you can even get on the internet and get up to the minute updates for your books!!!! What an added bonus that is!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This Travel guide is wonderful! It took us a few places we would have NEVER thought of. I swam in a heart shaped salt-water pool with waves crashing all around me...had to do a SMALL hike to get to it but it was worth it. This is a worthy buy if Traveling in Maui!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"My husband and I went to Maui last year and we brought this book with us along with a few others. This is the only book we ever used and needed. It was so helpful and very detailed. The way they describe every turn on the road to Hana was so helpful, you didn't need to spend the extra money on another guide book for just that, this book had it all. I really can't say enough good things about this book."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Having never been to Maui, I trusted Amazon's reviewers and bought this book as our sole guide to the island. For our 7-day trip, this book was all we needed to plan activities and find our way around. I'm an avid online researcher, preferring to gather information through the web, but even I was able to reserve all of my activities simply from the information in this book. Restaurant reviews cover not just the food and price range, but also the service, the ambiance, the location, and even specific meal reviews (the banana pineapple lumpia at Pacific 'O is truly the best dessert!). The section on snorkeling excursions covers way more than the basics, including the size of the boat, type/quality of barbeque, and how long the open bar stays open. The section on Haleakala bike tours details everything down to the time that each company tends to arrive at the summit of the volcano. It's these little details that provided the \\"insider information\\" I crave when booking these trips, and in my experience everything contained in this book was true.I do have to point out the section on the Road to Hana, because if you're planning to drive this road then this book is an absolute must-read. The Road to Hana is not about the destination at all, but rather about stopping to see the sights along the way. These writers reviewed every waterfall, every scenic viewpoint, and every hiking trail along the way to help the reader decide where and when to pull off the road. We were directed to numerous hidden waterfalls and trails that the average tourist zipped right by - the only other people we saw at these little-known locations were fellow \\"Maui Revealed\\" readers. The \\"Best Of\\" section contains the best place to swim in a waterfall, get your picture taken under a waterfall, dive off a cliff, and many other interesting anecdotes you won't find in any other guidebook. If you're content to follow the road and pull over where you see a lot of cars, then you probably don't need a guide at all. But if you want to tailor your adventure to your own interests, find out which waterfalls are the most impressive season to season, or discover which snack shop has the best banana bread, this book comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I purchased Maui Revealed along with a couple of other guide books in preparation for our once in a lifetime trip to Hawaii. My husband read the book before we left and planned many aspects of our time there; we used the book daily while we were there and found it to be accurate and a great read for things to do each day. The restaurant recommendations were right on and the description of various day trips like the \\"road to Hana\\" section were very helpful in ensuring that we didn't miss anything. I truly recommend this guide for people who like to plan ahead as well as for people who want to take the book and get suggestions on what to do while they are on the island"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I purchased this about a week before my 6-day trip to Maui. The book is very vast, it covers almost everything in Maui. Besides discussing the attractions and activities, the author also discusses the island's history, the language of the natives, the customs in great detail (which I though isn't necessary).Most of this book's reader's will be visiting Maui for a stay less than a week. And it's impossible to do even 10% of the activities and attractions described in this book in that time frame. So I think the author should come up with a list of the top things to do in Maui in 5-7 days (depending on the season of the year you're visiting) and put these lists in a separate chapter to avoid randomizing the visitors by some not-so-spectacular attractions.I'm giving this book a 4-star only because of the time it requires to read and the added burden on the reader of prioritizing the activities. Otherwise I would have rated it a 5."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I hadn't done any research on what to see in Maui, so I bought this book the day I left. It proved invaluable in finding wonderful sights, activities and restaurants, it's a humorous, enjoyable read, and it's well organized. I used it every day and was very satisfied with it!Drawbacks:*The author puts so much of his personality into the writing, you may feel like he's on vacation with you.*Some reviews seem subjective--things that didn't impress the author did please me, and vice versa.*Park rangers at Haleakala saw the book in my hands and said \\"Please don't use that while in the park.\\" They said the author \\"refused to correct misinformation about the park.\\" But none of this hampered my enjoyment of Haleakala--or Maui!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"My husband and I ventured to Maui in May 06'. We stayed at a time share condo. The owners had quite a lot of books to look at, all about Maui. This one in particular was very very helpful. We used it most when we went up the road to Hana. We stopped and saw some incredible sights and went swimming in heavenly pools, got some amazing shots of waterfalls. It guided us step by step where to go and what to look for. It was great. When we got back home I ordered this copy as a treasure and keepsake of our Magical time in Maui."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We have traveled in Hawaii quite a bit, and the Blue Book is the only one I trust! Every time I know of someone going over to the Islands, I purchase them this book! It doesn't matter which Island you are visiting, as there is one for each island.... Don't leave home without this Guidebook. And if you forget, buy one as soon as you get there!Happy Travel!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This, and the Kauai guide, were the best tour guides I've ever owned. Our trip to Hawaii was enhanced by this book. These authors definitely know their way around, and if you are willing to take their advice, you will see some amazing things. I can't recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We found this guidebook an excellent companion on our recent Maui vacation. Their advice on must sees and what to skip was invaluable to us. We knew there were many more sights and activities than we could fit in on this trip, so I found it very helpful to know the opinions of locals who had taken the time to thoroughly research their recommendations. The descriptions of the Road to Hana were very detailed, which is important if you're going to find all the neat little stops along the way. Their beach reviews are also excellent. In my opinion, this is the only guidebook you really need."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We used this book everyday when we were in Maui this summer. It does not hold back and gives very truthful reviews of restaurants and hotels. It saved us from going into a few places that looked OK from the outside and redirected us to great meals. We also found our condo after reading their reviews and would highly recommend the book to anyone heading over to Maui. We also loved the maps, they were the only ones that had street names and allowed us to find a cove that had the public parking sign taken off. So we had the cove all to ourselves if you did not count the turtles!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is THE book to have when going to Maui. It helped a lot with where to stay and where to go planning. The restaurant guides are good for the traveler of any price range as well as all the activities listed. Very honest very user friendly."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book, and it's companion Kauai Revealed are excellent. We just returned today and used them heavily during our two week stay in Kauai and Maui. The authors write in an informative and entertaining way. Special symbols are used to identify the best of the best from many options that will compete for your limited vacation time. They did not steer us wrong, even once. Recommendations for best beachs for swimming and/or snorkeling were particularly helpful. These books are a must, particularly for first time visitors, but even for those returning who are looking to get even more enjoyment for their vacation dollar."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Just got back from Maui and this book was extremely useful. Honest and helpful in terms of good places to go and places to avoid. We were able to go to places not well known that had spectacular views on the island. An absolute must for anyone going to maui for the first time"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We've been though 3 editions - and all have been lovingly worn out and dog-earred. This is a fantastic book for finding great local recommendations, \\"off-the beaten path\\" recommendations, and natural beauty recommendations. there is also a mobile app for ipads and iphones - which is fantastic if you have a 3/4G signal. It has all of the same info and more - PLUS you can send an email to the authors on the spot if you have feedback about one of the sites they recommend or tell you to avoid. The mobile app also has a GPS function - which is very helpful in locating some of the nature recommendations, as the book's directions to a hidden waterfall often go something like this....go .4787 miles past mile marker 6 and you'll see a small rotted sign on the side of the highway. Enter the path at this sign, stay right at the fork, go past the brown rock, but if you hit the red rock you've gone to far. Look for a small turn out on the left - make sure its not the medium cturn out though. Walk though the clearing and look for the tree towards the right with no more than 64523 leaves....follow the path to the left of this tree for .364 miles and you should be at your destination.Love the book - but some of the directions seem to send you on a boondoggle!!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book was recommended to me by someone who has a condo in Hawaii. I love it. The authors live on the island. The details are good and it covers everything from where to eat.....to which beaches are topless. Much more useful than the AAA books I usually use."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Indispensable. This was the guide book that everyone in my group relied on. Basically, during my entire trip to Maui - this book was always within arm's reach. Want to find a parking lot with convenient beach access? Want to find a place to grab some cheap lunch after that? Want to skip the real touristy areas altogether? This book will do the job."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book was great to have. It seemed like everyone was carrying this book around on the island. Try to read through and highlight the Hana Highway chapter before you go on the \\"Road to Hana\\" so you won't find yourself missing the scenery because your heads buried in the book."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I have used the \\"Revealed\\" books in Hawaii previously. The last time was for Kauai. Even though we have been to Hawaii several times, I always find information in these books very helpful. I have started reading the Maui Revealed book and marking things I find that I haven't done or want to remember to do again. Love these tour books."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We used this book on our road to Hana tour. I would highly recommend this book. We found some waterfalls that nobody was at and we were able to enjoy by ourselves. This book also gives good history of the Island. Would recommend getting this book before you book your travel plans. I would of did it differently after reading the book."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is a great guidebook for Maui. However, if you have one of the previous editions of Maui Revealed I see little justification to buying this one. Having said that, any version of Maui Revealed is probably the best overall visitors guide you can buy. During our visits to Maui we have found this book to be spot on. Well worth the investment, especially for first time visitors."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book was very helpful and we look forward to putting it to good use in the near future. It was informative as well as humorous. Helps find some of the out of the way places, that you may miss otherwise."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Received this book in a timely manner. It's a great guidbook and well written. We are getting ready for a two week vacation in Maui and this book gives so much information and will be a huge asset in planning our days. I highly recommend it if you are going to Maui."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"The content is good, and it is nice to have the book on my phone. Much easier to carry with me than the book. However, you cannot zoom in on the maps, so they are useless on a smart phone."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Try any of these books for all the Hawaiian Islands. Great detail on what to do and where to go."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"My wife and I are very active travelers (we love hiking, kayaking, and snorkeling), and generally don't like guided tours. When I first read through this book, I got a lot of great ideas for my vacation. Initially, I was a little disappointed that it didn't cover much in the way of where to Kayak, but after reading a couple of other guidebooks on Maui I'm realizing that was just a minor deficiency.This book covers a great deal of information, and does an excellent job of describing if places are worth your time (they give good descriptions of each spot, and leave it up to you decide if it's something you should do), while the \\"Gems\\" make it easy to flip through and find some excellent ideas for activities. The author does a great job of describing each location in detail, and gets you excited for your visit. They also do a good job of describing activities that are popular, but may not be worth your time.Overall, it's a great read."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I purchased this book prior to my recent (March 2012) return to Maui. I found it well worth the price because it helped me prioritize what I wanted to see. My daughter was married on a recommended beach, where I also snorkeled twice (and saw 6 green sea turtles). I am a PADI open water scuba instructor so was prepared to be critical of their diving / snorkeling recommendations. They were right-on. I also found their restaurant information helpful (I\\"m a vegan), and their maps. This book provides the background against which you should apply your good judgement. For example, because you could drive around the \\"bottom\\" of the island after going through Hana, doesn't mean you should. And, you will find other \\"gems\\" of your own with this book as a guide - such as the Hana Coast Gallery."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I already have \\"Big Island Revealed\\" so I knew I needed this one. Very accurate info delivered in a casual and sometimes comical way. Best guide books I have ever read. With this book one can just about plan all their daily vacation outings from the mainland, but bring the book anyway."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I purchased this book on recommendations from other travellers to Maui and even though I haven't read it all yet, the information, tips, tricks, hints and suggestions are fantastic. I am a first time traveller to Maui and unlike many other publications this one gives you expert analysis on the rights and wrongs, places to see and which ones you will be wasting your time with.A must get for any Maui traveller"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is the single book I needed. Took a look at many others, but this was the most friendly."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This Maui Revealed book is a wonderful resource for us as we plan for our trip in May, 2011. I have been to Maui twice before, but this book is leading us to places I've missed previously.We purchased the Big Island Revealed book for our trip in December, 2009, and everything it recommended as the best, WAS!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Just returned from a week in Maui staying at the Sheraton in Kaanapali. This guidebook was great (and easy) reading, humorous and spot-on with descriptions of out-of-the way places and how to get to them. Written by people who live and know Hawaii and more importantly, how to present a useful guidebook. [...]. This book made a great vacation all that much better."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Good writing, (or good \\"talk story,\\" as Hawai'i folks say) but some difficulties, like following the directions to an eating place using the inadequate area maps."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Maui Revealed is the bible of Maui guidebooks. Its maps are detailed, very well organized and easy to use. The author tells you what to hit and what to miss and is usually right on. As with the other guidebooks in the series (Big Island, Oahu and Kauai), the book is thorough and fun to read."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This series of guide books are great for all of the Hawaiian islands. Really honest reviews. Hints about things you don't find in other guide books."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Excellent book. Extremely helpful on our exploration of Maui. Have given it away as gifts to visitors of Maui."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book was a must have for our trip to Maui. Great tips and ideas for things to do! We referred to the book for guidance/maps, etc. the entire week! Definitely would recommend it to anyone going to Maui! This was our first time there and we felt like we were able to see so much more than we would've had we not had the book to tell us about some things."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I've never given a review for anything I've bought, but I had to thank the authors of this book somehow. My husband, four of our friends and I went to Maui for two weeks at the end of May. This book took our trip from amazing to UTTERLY PRICELESS. It answered all of our questions, told us where to go for anything and everything, and gives really great maps. I wish they made this book for every place we visit, I would buy them all! It was that good. The only thing I would note is that my friends and I are in our mid-20's. Some of the hiking trips were challenging, even for us. If hiking is something you do normally, then it probably won't be a problem. Also, every time we followed a more difficult hike in the book, the end was always completely worth it. So, if you are much older or don't get alot of excercise, then I would suggest taking into consideration any of the warnings in the book that talk about the hike being difficult. If you do decide to go for it like we did, it WILL be worth it, but bring ALOT of water. We would have been so lost without this book, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in getting the most out of their Maui vacation."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I lived in Hawaii for 6 months back in '02. At that time I had the older version of the same book, and I am soo glad I did!! I was able to go to places, see things and experience true Maui.I have bought the newer version several times, mostly for honeymooners going to Hawaii.Buy this book, and forget about what the rest of the tourists are doing, because you will definitely have better stories and the pictures to prove it!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We haven't gone to Maui yet. That will happen later this year. But this is a good book to get a feel for what Maui has to offer. We should have bought this before scheduling some activities. This book did help in justifying where we are staying, which luau we've chosen, etc. Which means you can do all of this kind of research on the Internet, or buy this book and simplify the process, and save some time in the long run."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is a great book for those who either are first-timers to Maui, or those who have been many times. I used this book prior to visiting Maui, and found it all-in-all very informative. The book describes in great detail how to find all the secluded beaches and waterfalls throughout the island."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I have owned two of the previous editions and this is also outstanding. It is complete and well organized. The author pulls no punchs on his evaluations of the businesses he reviews. I have never found anything that I can disagree with of a substantial nature. The humor he uses to illustrate his opinions are a welcome departure from the dull guides that many publishers put out. All in all, great fun and full of useful facts!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"After buying four previous guidebooks I finally picked up Maui Revealed and it was everything a guidebook should be. It was honest which is what I am looking for, if you shouldn't waste your time they tell you. It also tells you about all of the tour companies other books only pick out 2 or 3 that they feel is noteworthy and then you have to wonder if the company you want is good or bad. Other guidebooks that have Hawaii all in one are pretty bad. There is just way too much information to cram into one book. It's best to buy books dedicated to each island. I feel this book helped with me with everything I needed to know. Everything is laid out perfectly for you, this book will be your best friend in you planning of your trip to Maui."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is not your average guide book. Quick to the punch, raw advice, and written in a jovial style missing from the other, more dry guides. There is little pretense and it would be hard to believe that there is any payola that could go one (example: in a restaurant recommended there is advisement to avoid certain dishes).This book, and others from this publisher, in this series, are easy to use and read. Previously I used the Big Island version, and discovered things to see, places to hike, and bargain dining. This book sets up the same way.I do tend to use many resources when planning and I can say that there are things that are in this book that do not appear in any other sources. Also, the frequent publishing of this guide brings information that is current, where as others seem content with putting out guides and collecting money (example: all downhill rides from Haleakala now start outside of the park, so you miss the most interesting views).This book is a real informative, pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Last year I bought Kauai Revealed for my honeymoon and that book was AWESOME!! So this year we are heading to Maui for our 1st anniversary and I purchased Maui Revealed and I have read through it two times already highlighting with sticky tags everywhere we want to go. Everything about these books is great, the directions to hideaway beaches, food places we never would have found, awesome hikes, the information they provide is dead on. I have purchased other books like these but these Revealed Books are the best."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is a great book to let you really know what is going on! It gives you the inside scoop like where to park, little adventures, and things you should know about the locals. Highly recommend that you read it before you go so you don't get car sick reading it on the Road to Hana!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book is SO helpful in helping you find where to go, what to do, where to eat, stay, etc. Start reading it NOW, before your trip... then bring it along to guide you along the way. Great maps. Great tips. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"that is part of the problem. As other reviewers have noted, the author does too good a job and obviously has ticked off the locals. For example, on the road to Hana, the author notes all these places to go see waterfalls, etc. and uses mile markers to tell you where they are. Unfortunately, most mile markers are now missing, and it's hard to keep your eyes on your odometer and count while driving that road! We still enjoyed the drive immensely, but everywhere you think about stopping, you see tons of \\"private property\\", \\"no trespassing\\", and \\"KEEP OUT\\" signs.His review of a Mexican restaurant in Kahului was suspect, as the burritos were cheap, yes, but not very good at all.Overall we found the book helpful in planning our trip."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We always referred to this book during our 9 days vacation in Maui. It's comprehensive and detailed, with a lot of colorful photos. A must-have. It seemed to me that every other vacationer had read it."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Given our limited time of only one week on Maui this book proved very helpful in choosing where to spend our time and money. We found the sites detailed to be accurate and loved the detail provided such as \\"just past the 25 mile marker on the left, down a short trail...\\" Well worth the price!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book has been extremely helpful in planning our first trip to Hawaii. The authors provide you honest and helpful information, unlike many books who sound like a paid advertisement for everything, and give you practical advice on everything from the usual tourist attractions to local information like hidden jewels, flora, fauna and where to eat.I would use them again and would recommend them to anyone."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"The best guide book available! Every time we pulled up sonewhere most everyone had one! The book paid for itself with the money saving helps it gave!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Very well done, detailed and comprehensive. Just make sure you read all they write about these pleaces because just finding the general location of a beatiful waterfall will not get you to the fall itself without the book's guidance."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book is amazing. Leave all of the other books at home. I don't know how the author does it, but he knows where to go, what to do, where to eat and shop, which activity vendors are the best, who and what to avoid, everything - all over the island. When we spoke with the locals, and they shared advice and information, it almost always echoed what we read in the book. Having this book was like traveling with a well-informed, very active, long-time, well connected, Maui local. Mahalo."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book is very thorough, yet not too much to be a good quick resource. I highly recommend spending at least a couple of hours with it before a trip to Maui, and then take it along with you for reference and ideas once you get there. It seems to cover everything! It made our Maui trip better."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I took both Maui Revealed (MR) and Frommer's Maui 2010 to Maui this month, and liked Frommers more. Both were good books in general.MR is a beautiful book! The pages are glossy and thick with beautiful pictures. The narrative is funny and amusing to read. But it's hard to reference in a hurry because the details are lost in large paragraphs of jokes and historical background. MR failed to point out that one of the waterfall hikes on the drive to Hana would require trespassing, a fact that was pointed out in Frommer's. Though MR was good to discuss how some trespassing signs by EMI can be ignored.Restaurant recommendations in MR are awful. It lists commonplace burger and pizza joints, even a Pizza Hut. From Frommer's on the other hand, I got great restaurant recommendations on varying price ranges & local BBQ joints (e.g. Aloha Mixed Plate in Lahaina).In short, MR is good as a supplement, but not as your only guide book in Maui. I'd recommend Frommer's Maui."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book could not be better for giving people a feel for what it is really like to be in Maui with expert advice and the feeling that they have no qualms about telling us the good, bad and ugly about everything (such as for the best beaches and day-trips). Having said that, it is WOEFULLY lacking in Maui restaurant and hotel reviews compared to other sources. I feel like a consummate insider after reading the book except (and unlike their book about the Big Island for some odd reason) the hotel and restaurant reviews were missing. The book is so good I almost thought that chapter fell out, but no. So I will have to check their website for that I suppose. There must be some reason for this and since the authors are all about revealing the truth -I am waiting for that."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"A must have if you plan on visiting Maui!! His reviews were spot on. We knew exactly what to expect. We have been to Maui three times now and I always have this book!!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Most comprehensive guide I have ever used while on Maui.

Too bad we got the flu and had to cancel!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Love this book. We buy a new edition every time we return Maui and Kauai. It's written as if a friend with a ton of experience were giving you the straight scoop on all you need to know about a trip to the islands."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Writers have prejudice against Maalaea Bay area. Reading the description of that area you think that every day is cane field ashes and high winds. The Trade Winds vary in strength and we are blessed with natural air conditioning.The cane fields in Kihei and other locales are burned as needed very early in the morning. Varying amounts of ash floats on the winds. No burning in the care fields next to Maalaea Village."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book has a lot of great information to help us in our plans for a trip to Maui this coming May, looking forward to it."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"See the island of Maui through the eyes of a native, using this book as your guide. Very interesting and informative."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Great guide book. Best one out there.

Very detailed about where to stop etc.."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This guide proved very useful. It provided very detailed and informative suggestions, with a welcome sense of humor. In particular, we found the guides for the Road to Hana and for driving around West Maui terrific, and the advice was dead on. Some idea of how much it has become &#34;the&#34; guide for Maui is revealed by a sign we saw at a store they recommended. The sign referred to the page number in the book - didn't mention the book by name, just gave a page number - and, sure enough, it was for this book."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We used this guide to plan a couple of trips on Maui and it served us well. Mainly, we used it to get the feel of the island and to make sure we didn't miss anything that is a must for a first time visitor--such as the road to Hana, getting down to Lahaina to see to the big Banyan tree, and doing the drive up to the top of Haleakala. All of those were fun and easy to do. We didn't do a lot of hiking since we were here to relax and de-stress, but we did do the snorkel tour from the Makena Beach Resort to Molokini. We accidentally took the scary road around the northeast end of the island near Lahaina and don't ever want to do that again, as it's too narrow to turn around once you get past a certain point. Fortunately we had rented a jeep with four wheel drive and more clearance than a normal car. We've discovered that if you encounter a sign that says \\"End county road\\" in Hawaii it's time for non-locals and tourists to turn back. Other than that, a fun trip and this guide was essential in planning and executing our trip."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is the best review of Maui I have seen.

The reviews in this book are honest and direct with no apparent bias."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Our family recently returned from a destination wedding on Maui. Five of us had purchased this guidebook and we relied on it heavily for information when we had discretionary time apart from the wedding activities. If you are only purchasing one guide, this should be the one."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Used these guidebooks for Maui and Big Island. To the dismay of locals, these guidebooks are very thorough. I understand they feel some of the suggestions are an intrusion of thier privacy.

Lots of great tips and interesting off the beaten path places! No need for tour guides with this book!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"These books (Maui, Kauai, Oahu, The Big Island Reveled) are by far the best guide books to the Islands. We are military and moved here a couple years ago and these have been amazing. not only did they help us around town but made visiting the neighbor islands a real treat. The books give you information not found in the other guide books out there. Because they are for each island they give better detail. If you ask any local what guide book to the real Hawaii is the best they will most likely tell you the blue one (FYI, all of the Reveled guide books are blue)."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"WHen traveling to Maui we always bring an updated copy of Maui Revealed.

Even though we have been to Maui 10 times there are always new places to try that arelisted in the book."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book is a \\"Must Have\\" on your visit to Maui. A very well and to the point book describing the beautiful island and all of the activities associated with it. This is the third different edition that I have purchased. I also have printings number one and three. A lady siting accross the isle from me and a gentleman in front of her on the plane ride across the ocean each were reading a copy. What more can you say."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Wow. This book is an incredible tool for planning your vacation in Maui. I spent the 12+ hours of air travel time getting to Maui reading this book. We had 7 days in Maui and every single minute was everything a vacation should be. This book will tell you the best places for EVERYTHING no matter what type of vacationer you are. There wasn't a single detail left out. Thank you to the writers for Maui Revealed. We would've missed out on a lot of cool stuff. Extra tip....make a reservation before you leave home if you are planning on seeing \\"Warren & Annabelle and evening of magic\\". I think the book recommended that but we were already in flight when I read it. Luckily I called the minute we landed and was put in touch with WONDERFUL people who got us in on our very last night in Maui...WELL worth the time - my husband LOVED that show and he's not a \\"show-type\\" person at all. It was the best show we have ever seen. Not just magic, comedy too! You'll love it. Just get this book, seriously - I can't say enough great things about it!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I purchased Maui Revealed in preparation for my upcoming honeymoon. So far, I've been very pleased with the level of candor and detail provided, from landmarks on scenic drives to tips where to park. I'm learning things about Maui that I could never find on a website and that will surely help my fiance and me as we plan our week in Maui. We're especially interested in the book's reviews of the many excursions available on the island; it will help us find the best value and best experience.Edit: Maui Revealed was an invaluable resource on our honeymoon. First of all, it helped us determine which area of the island was the right fit for our stay. We ended up in Ka'anapali for our honeymoon. It reviewed not only the hotels/resorts, but also the surrounding area, telling us about the shops and restaurants in Whaler's Village to what to expect from the beaches. It also helped us choose the best activities for our preferences and budget, from the Old Lahaina Luau to the dinner cruise we took upon the Teralani II. We were also able to pick out restaurants based on reviews of food and prices.The guidebook was also a necessity in our drive on the Road to Hana. It features all of the secrets and know-how from a true islander's perspective, allowing us to avoid tourist traps and informing us of views and experiences we'd otherwise pass right by. Without the book, we would not have been able to appreciate and experience the drive to the degree we did.Finally, the book is an amazing resource in terms of lifestyle/cultural information, which helped us feel \\"in the know\\" about what to do and not do around the island, where to park when we got to Lahaina, where the best stores are to stock up on snacks/supplies for the trip, etc.Overall, the book helped us save a lot of money and have an even more enjoyable honeymoon. I'd recommend to anyone new to island."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"Once we knew we were heading to Maui a friend of mine recommend Maui Revealed and and I glad I took her up on it.

We used the Kauai and Maui books while we were in Hawaii. I did a little searching through them before we went but they're really great for when you're there and just driving around. We had a rental car and just drove around the islands with our books. The books were our tour guides. They give great info, dos and don'ts, and hidden places that we would never have known about. Definitely get these books before your Hawaiian vacation!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"As far as data goes, this book has a lot of it, but my wife and I found that the gripes, raves, and insights lacking.For example, the Author recommends a roadside grill in McKenna for the fish tacos. This is probably the most expensive taco I've ever had. It was prepared in an outdoor kitchen that lacks soap and water for cleaning, and attracts a plethora of flies. Yummo! (I was gung ho on trying the recommendations from this book.)If you agree that when choosing a snorkel cruise your biggest gripe is wearing a flotation device that needn't be inflated, on a boat that doesn't serve beer (The author's gripes with Trilogy) then follow the Author's recommendation and book your cruise on a competing \\"Cattle boat\\" (what the locals call them), some of which give you a large life buoy to hold onto instead of a vest, ample alcohol, and the accompanying sounds of the loudus humanus intoxicus.And that's not all....The Cream puffs at Komodo's that are to die for? I felt like dying after trying them.The rich history on the Iao state park outlined in the book? Freely available trail side.The recommendation to visit Longhi's in Lahaina for breakfast? Missing.. (I still crave the Eggs Benedict.)The tips on enjoying the Valcano at sunrise? Not applicable, since everyone is following the same suggestion's from this book. Unless you arrive way before sunrise (45 minutes wasn't enough), forget about any of his tips. (I personally recommend going the day after you arrive (since it's easy to get up early in Hawaii if you're flying over from the mainland), check your rental car for a valid receipt (since they are good for three days from the date of purchase), leave some space in front of you when you park (so you don't have to rush down to let anyone out), and hiking up the trail that wraps around the lower lot peak - where you can enjoy the view away from the crowds.)I sincerely feel this author had a great little niche for a long time, but I couldn't connect with the criticisms or accolades in the book. We found better information on the internet from a more culturally diverse audience.Do you really want a non foodie telling you where to eat? Me neither.Summary: Great book for information, but if you'd like help sifting through it, try the internet or another publication."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book is so good that we followed it with blind faith to plan our trip.

The Maui Revealed book is also essential to pack. I went to Maui prior w/o the book and didn't start having fun until I met up with people who did have this book. The book helped us discover the most adventurous hiking/climbing/swimming trail we've ever been on. The maps throughout the book are superb - readable type size thank goodness. One suggestion is to add a blue diamond legend on the beaches, sights, etc that are located on the map. Some sights were only a miss but it was because of mother nature, i.e. tides, rain, etc."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is a spectacular book!

While my trip to Maui is still a few weeks away, I have thoroughly enjoyed paging through the book. The fact that it's written by an island resident and he isn't afraid to take you off the beaten path are what I like best.

There are hikes, tourist type activities that you would not see in a typical guide book or even most websites about Maui.I agree with other reviewers who say that this book is not valuable for it's resteraunt or hotel information, there are much better, much more current up to date reviews online for those types of places. What makes this book invaluable is the detailed maps, the insider secrets, the off the normal vacation activities that you won't find in other books.It is an interesting book.

I'm actually reluctant to review this book because I don't want anyone else to buy it and crowd up all of the amazing secret places this books guides you to. This book will be your best friend and constant companion from the time you land in Maui until you leave. This is our second trip to Maui, the first time we did it without this book and the second time with it. Let me just say that our second trip was less expensive and so much more enjoyable thanks to this book. I'm amazed that thousands of people spend a fortune to go to Maui and don't see and experience near what we did.By dividing up the island into geographic zones, Maui Revealed becomes very easy to use. Wherever you are on the island you can find the best beaches, snorkeling, restaurants, hikes, sites, pools, parking, resorts, waterfalls, adventures, (and on and on) that the island has to offer. Just watch out for the mile markers and this book will guide you right to where you want to go. We had the kindle edition which made searches and bookmarks even easier.Thanks to Maui Revealed we didn't have a bad meal, never went to a bad beach, and had an overall amazing experience that I know we never would have had. And it provides all of this in a humorous, historic, and easy to read way. You're crazy if you go to Maui without bringing this book."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"If you are going to Maui, GET THIS BOOK!

I have used the Kauai and Big Island guidebooks, too. The maps are detailed and accurate, they give 'insider' information that you would not find in other books. They tell it like it is, from their personal experience at the restaurants, beaches, accommodations, activities, and sites. The book is well organized, wtih an index that allows you to answer questions and easily find iformation. The reviews of places to stay have been helpful, and accurate, allowing us to save in accommodations cost so we could enjoy other luxuries of the island life. With these books we were able to make our vacations absolutely perfect! I have loaned my books to others who have been thrilled with the quality of the books.

This book will save you a lot of valuable vacation time wandering around looking for things."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is the best guidebook I've ever had for a location. The author really put in the time to write a detailed, accurate, and wildly informative guide. It seems that everyone on the island already knows this, and refers to this book (and no other). There was even a dog-eared copy that came with our condo.We spent our week in Maui hiking, scuba diving, snorkeling, swimming, driving, and of course, eating. The book took us right to great little hikes to waterfalls, natural pools, grand vistas, and great beaches. The dive recommendation agreed with other reviews (such as [...]). I usedSnorkel Maui Lanai and Molokai Guide to the Beaches and Snorkeling of Hawaii (Guide to the Beaches and Snorkeling of Hawai'i)for snorkeling sites, since it was much more detailed than the Maui Revealed book. But the Maui Revealed recommendations agreed with the top sites in the snorkel book, which were in fact very good. (The best snorkeling in Hawaii however is in the bays of the Big Island.)The food recommendations were accurate, but don't except to be incredibly impressed with food on Maui. The author describes very well when the food is a good deal, tasty, bad, whatever. I like that both good and not-so-good restaurants are included in the review, making it easier to avoid the latter.This is THE guide for Maui. Don't go there without it. (You might not get one for free in your room. Also it's good to read before you go.)"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"We had both the Frommers Maui Day by Day and Maui Revealed with us.

Be sure to visit the website before you go - I didn't, and a bridge was out on the Hana Highway that made for a long drive in the dark, but that's okay - we were in Maui! Buy it! It is a fun read."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I've been visiting various Hawaiian Islands for nearly 30 years and no other guide book even comes close to this series. It perfectly describes what to expect, where to go, and more importantly when on a limited vacation, where NOT to go.The reviews of restaurants, hotels and tourist events like luaus are spot-on and one of the two major strengths of this book. In Maui in particular, it can be difficult to find a decent restaurant for a decent price. Without this book you would be lost.The second strength of this book is that it is compiled by people who actually like to spend time outdoors rather than watching faux-natives while drunk or arguing with the hotel desk about getting a local pharmacy to deliver your xanax and ritalin.Now just a comment on Maui. You will note that the Maui book is always in the top-sellers list. That's because THERE ARE TOO MANY ******* PEOPLE ON MAUI! The traffic is horrible, the prices are high, the service-workers are the surliest of the islands. (The stories I could tell you.) Get the Kawai, Big Island or even Oahu guidebooks and go to those islands instead."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"I can only add my rave reviews for this book as being very accurate and helpful for finding the best ways to make good use of your time and money on the island. I also used \\"Hawaii Revealed\\" on a visit to the big island with similar results. In many other places you are taking a chance on the reliability and accuracy of reviews of activities, reviews, directions, etc. but I find this book is right on. Since it's written from experience, I've found you can rely on the descriptions without question. The vendors for activities were exactly as described. The ways to beaches were exactly as described. The restaurants were exactly as described. While it's not all-inclusive (it's pretty hard to stay at every possible condo), the authors provide enough choices that they have personally explored that you will have plenty of choices too.A reminder to the reviewer who calls us tourists \\"maggots\\" - we are providing your economy and supporting the peoples of the state in so many ways. The book makes many, many references to the need to respect private property, and for respecting the ecosystem as well. It's up to the visitor to do this, really - I've always felt a strong sense of \\"visiting\\" in Hawaii, the spirit of the Hawaiian place and peoples is very strong to me and I feel like I am privileged to share some time with the sights and features. I urge other visitors to similarly respect the traditions and ecosystem when you visit. Hopefully during your visit you won't run into many kama\`ainas so possessive of their \\"private\\" paradise - we found everyone to be friendly and welcoming, born there or not."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This is the best book for travelling in Maui.

Many locals hate it because they feel it spoiled their secrets. Don't leave it or carry it in plain site. Respect \\"No trespassing\\" signs, which prevent you from visiting some of the areas mentioned. There's plenty to amaze you without justifying the belief some locals have that this book encourages trespassing and disrespect for the land they of course love.The book shows the best snorkling spots. Molokini had super clear water and the boat (Four Winds) was fun, but we saw more fish off the South Kihei shoreline at the spots recommended."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This was the only book we considered (at first) for our first trip to Maui, based on the author's excellent Kauai Revealed book, which was fantastic on an island where much is hidden unless you're in the know.I read Maui Revealed cover to cover before leaving, but wound up checking out Frommer's from the library as well. Maui Revealed is a great overview of the island, with some terrific details, plus it will get you very excited about traveling there, but using it on Maui proved to be utterly pretentious and annoying for us, for two reasons:1. When taking a road trip, or sight seeing, we found it to be thoroughly annoying that the maps, though detailed, are not on consecutive pages, and one has to keep finding the map of the area and then finding what page the map continues on, it seems like constantly (not a problem with the Kauai book.) Of course, we bookmarked the pages, but this book just seemed all over the place in this regard, it seemed we could never locate what we had read the night before when we needed it while driving (\\"Was that in the 'Beaches' chapter, or under 'Snorkeling'?); and2. This is really over-zealous at many times. We know the author is proud of his adoptive(?) state, but he seems to think that almost every single thing on Maui is EQUALLY wonderful (save for pretty good info on snorkeling spots.)The Road to Hana chapter is ridiculous, with so many \\"Waterfall Alert!\\"s and \\"Diversion Alert!\\"'s it made me seasick. And there was one waterfall the author raved about that said it was accessible by such and such a trail, but this access was fenced up with barbed-wire and menacing keep-out signs - no mention of this, though, in this over-detailed book. Okay, so maybe there are a lot of waterfalls - a VAST MAJORITY of them are hidden and must be hiked to, and quite frankly, really aren't that great! I mean if you're from Kansas and you're never seen a mountain or a lake or a curvy road, I suppose you'd might be flabbergasted with each and every over-described detail, but over all, it's water flowing over rocks and they are nice, but please tone down your over-enthusiasm for every single one of them. Don't get me wrong, I am a true nature lover. I am an avid hiker, I ooh and aah at waterfalls. The Road to Hana IS magical, it IS the destination! It's just that the author is clearly over-enraptured by small waterfalls and banana bread stops, yet there was little mention of the breath-taking majesty of the jaw-dropping bamboo forests! As a matter of fact, if one were to follow the Road to Hana chapter, while driving it, you would SEE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, because you would be so busy reading each and every possible detail of it from author's experience of it - Don't be one of those people that videotape their entire vacations and don't end up being present themselves for any of it, because they're too busy VIEWING IT from their lenses! Put the book down for the Road to Hana, and BE THERE NOW, and experience it for yourself, it is truly memorable.What this whole book and especially this section really needs, is a starred system (or something of the sort -how about hula girls?), to indicate, for example, that this is a 5 star waterfall, this one, a 2.We did enjoy the restaurant recommendations, and found them to be sound.At the beginning I though this would be the definitive guide book on Maui, but find it too disorienting and weakly organized, and although there are some great photos, the book is laid-out poorly, graphically speaking. This last detail may sound unimportant, but it contributes to a sense of confusion, and disorientation while reading and searching; I found surprising welcomed relief by the practical organization and graphic layout of info in Frommer's.Maui Revealed is a great read-thru with info you probably won't find in other guidebooks. Definitely read thru it at home and make a few notes and get excited about your trip. Leave it in your room when you're there and Be Present in Your Vacation- don't spend it reading the book!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook","review":"This book is one of the best guide books I have ever bought.
