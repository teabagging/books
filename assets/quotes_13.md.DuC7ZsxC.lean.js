It posed some intriguing questions about the power of the human brain, something which the human race has been fascinated with from time immemorial but which we still know very little about.

All in all, a great novel, its only weakness being a mundane, anti-climactic ending which stands in blatant contradiction with the rest of the plot. --DB"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"i felt that the book started out great! I was so excited to turn to the next page. I kept thinking about all the possibilities of how the story could play out. Then i started to get disappointed. First off, I would have enjoyed the book better if they would have explored the ship more and didn't just focus on the sphere. Second i found the characters didn't seem that realistic. I still was confused about who Jerry was. Harry's shadow? Then they find a body in the ship that looks like Beth... what is that about? The manifestations were not that original. Squid? And what exactly was that foam? Frankly it sounded like the book was written just to become an action packed movie. To be fair I thought that the added scientific information about black holes and zoology was great to learn and the book is worth reading if you want a lot of suspense. Finally i want to add that Micheal Crichton has written books that i would give 5 stars (for example: Airframe)."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I'm a Crichton fan, but I'm very disappointed with Sphere. It's been awhile since I've read it, but I remember thinking how unbelievable most of the book was. I don't know how I finished it."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Typical Crichton, this novel spins a suspenseful web around technology with a typically reluctant, but plucky, lead character in Norman. The suspense was real and gripping throughout the book. I read each page with anticipation, expecting (and getting) a new plot twist at every turn.Why three stars? The ending drifted predictably to a Dallas-esque, never-mind-it-was-only-a-dream conclusion. The ending was so lame that I really felt let down. In the end, it was a five star book with a one star ending. I still recommend the book for the roller coaster ride it is. Just quit while you're ahead with about ten pages to go."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"*Sphere* is an incredible book, despite some of its limitations. The characters are not especially deep (par for the course Chricton) and this book is less a vehicle for education that most of his other works. Nor is it intended as an action-oriented thriller (though it has elements of that, if you want to emphasize them). What makes it incredible, in my view, is that it is very much in the category of &quot;real Science Fiction.&quot; There is perhaps not enough technical material to interest most *Analog*-style sci-fi fans, but it does have one of the strong qualities of good sci-fi: it leaves you with questions. You start off exploring the space craft, but get side-tracked when things begin to get too dangerous. There are alot of things you learn about the ship, but more you don't.Perhaps the biggest complaint that could be levied against this book is how little the Sphere itself is explained, and how little sense it might make, perhaps. But this argument rather misses one of the main points: the incomrehensibility of &quot;the alien.&quot; Building on Crichton's fascination with the concept of Chaos/Complexity, *Sphere* is, in fact, a portrait of people who are suddenly confronted with the realization that they are dealing with something totally beyond their experience.If you take the time to consider that aspect and all its ramifications, this is actually quite a provocative and intriguing work. If you're looking for a heart-pounding supsense novel, or a compact story, or set of deep characters, you will probably be disappointed. But, like the characters in the book, you won't always have your expectations met..."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I enjoy reading Mr. Crichton's work. He is an excellent story teller, but this book seemed rushed. He started off with a really good idea: Space ship from the future (American) found enbedding in a reef at the bottom of the ocean. No one was inside except for this sphere. Where did it come from? What does it do? Did it kill the crew? Where did the ship come from? Etc Very intriguing! Then it stopped. The concept concerning what the Sphere could do and how they fought against it was lame.

Oh, it has quite a bit of excitement though. I could not give away anything else without giving away the plot, and I wouldn't dare.I started this book on a Sunday afternoon, and finished it on a Sunday night. I skipped laundry, I skipped dinner - heck, I even skipped the Simpsons. The only flaw I could find in this book was that it was too good, and I couldn't put it away.I've never seen the movie, nor would I want to, because no movie could do this book justice. I highly recommend skipping the movie and go straight to the book. In fact, I'm going to stop the review so you can order the book now."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I can never forgive Michael Crichton. It happens again and again. His pace is unrelenting, his logic nearly flawless. His stories are invariably intense and suspenseful. I can never regain the sleep I've lost when reading \\"just one more chapter\\" each night. Michael Crichton, I rue the day you got me hooked.\\"Sphere\\" is a terrific sci-fi thriller. Instead of space though, the story takes place deep within the Pacific Ocean, where a team of scientists, in support of a US Navy exercise, explore and try to understand what appears to be a spaceship.Like most of Crichton's novels, \\"Sphere's\\" characters are created to give voice to varying personality types and perspectives. Crichton populates his undersea thriller with representatives from multiple scientific disciplines. Norman Goodman is a psychologist and explores the deepest parts of the human (and alien) mind. Beth Halperin is a biologist and brings her perspectives of earth and space-bound biological beings. Ted Fielding is the obnoxious astrophysicist, and Harold Barnes is the Navy commander who provides a militaristic, and conspiratorial, perspective.Harry Adams is a savant mathematician with prodigious reasoning skills. The character seems to be an early sketch of the well-known Dr. Ian Malcolm from Crichton's \\"Jurassic Park\\". Adams serves as the big brain and foil to the narrow-sighted exuberance of the martial Barnes in \\"Sphere\\", whereas Malcolm served the same role as counterpoint to John Hammond's financially-fueled dinosaur fervor on \\"Jurassic Park\\".Goodman works through the causalities of events and actions and gives Crichton a mechanism and mouthpiece for the exploration of human nature and motivation. Crichton utilizes Norman's field of expertise to provide the psychological context to the story. And instead of delivering the themes through a disembodied narrator, Norman's internal monologue and dialogue with the other characters provides the mental framework driving the psychological horror and intensity.Crichton uses his plot, as usual, to delve into numerous scientific theories and perspectives. The alien presence provides the platform for the discussion of extraterrestrial contact, space travel and time travel. The underwater setting provides Crichton with the physical background to delve into ocean biology, and the capabilities and possibilities of living for extended periods under water. Within all of the scientific disciplines, Crichton enables his characters to explore the most modern and extreme theories of science.Norman uses the isolation and extreme existence of underwater habitats to provide readers with a view of a full-scale, real-time Rorschach test. Everyone and everything is viewed, absorbed and translated uniquely. Everything impacts the personalities in a different way, which drives the story's human elements in unison with the well-paced action surrounding and impacting the characters.The book has moments of horror, but is fueled by suspense. The conclusion - literally the last 2 pages - is a little weak, but the ride to get there is fantastic and fast."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I liked this book for the most part although considering how much imaginiation this book requires the ending sure doesn't. Did he hit a deadline and was forced to submit to publish or did he just run out of ideas? I thought that maybe they would use the spaceship to fly to another universe or something but to decide they want nothing to do with it they just decide to forget it and ok guys were fine now the books over. Uhh, ok? Well I mean that doesn't really solve anything. Eventually another group would go back down there to check the ship again and the same thing would happen. This book could have been another 400 pages. I don't know am I missing something? I read State of Fear and even that could have been another 900 pages. Is there some quality to a story that doesn't explain everything? This kind of feels like Crichton just gave up. This always happened to me in high school when I would procrastinate homework."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Of the many great works of science fiction Crichton wrote during his life, Sphere may be his finest. During the first chaper of only 14 pages, Crichton includes enough plot twists and bombshells to put to shame a much longer novel. A group of scientists exploring a mysterious wreck at the bottom of the Pacific ocean continually have to reassess what they think they know. As is often the case in Crichton's novels, the principal narrator has a slightly different scientific background, and so the other members of the group have to continually explain things to him, which in turn provides ready explanations for the reader. Another characteristic is the extremely clever mathematician, Harry, who anticipates many developments and hints at them, building tension.Sphere as a novel divides largely into two parts. The first part is a voyage of discovery, as the team find out more and more startling things about the wreck, where it came from, how it got there, and its mysterious cargo. During the second part, when most of the discoveries are complete, it turns into a taut psychological thriller, building the tension steadily before revealing the last of the plot. Crichton's careful scientific explanations also leave the reader with a feeling of intellectual fulfilment.The only weak link is the end. Crichton presumably struggled to find his grand finale for such a fantastic story, and in the end opts for a slightly weak finish, only bolstered by a minor plot twist that he manages to squeeze in at the end. But the fantastic journey is worth the slightly jarring halt at the end."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is definitely a page-turner. I blazed through this book in just a couple sittings, but that doesn't mean it's an amazing book, it just has some really good hooks.Sphere is about a group of scientists from all walks of life (zoologist, psychologist, an astrophysicist and others) and their secret mission into the depths of the Pacific Ocean. An alien ship has been discovered and it's up to these guys to find the answers.Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike this book, I just found many of the elements a too far-fetched and some of the logic in the book is a bit flawed. It's hard to explain why without giving away big spoilers. I just found some of the plot elements a little too convenient, or forced I suppose. Also, I wasn't attached to any of the characters.However, Sphere definitely is a page-turner. Even though I found gaping logic flaws I was always curious as to what was going to happen next. This book has some shattering plot twists. However, once the main twist is revealed parts of the book become predictable.It's like this -Have you ever been home sick from work and you catch yourself watching some stupid daytime-drama? Even though the acting is lacking, the plot is contrived and much of it is completely predicable - for some reason you just keep watching it? Yeah, it's a bit like that.That being said, Sphere was my first Crichton book and for some reason I can't wait to read another!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This was another highly enjoyable Crichton book. It's been a while since I've read his books, but he was always my favorite thriller/adventure writer. He always has had a captivating flair for developing a fast-paced, intense story of survival that utilizes the latest in cutting edge technology and often involves a controversial subject. Reading his books takes one on an adventurous roller coaster ride that not only leaves your body tingling but often challenges your thinking in ways that can make a permanent difference.Upon first completing this book about a team of scientists, a 300-year-old spaceship, and an alien locked into the depths of a submarine vessel at the bottom of the ocean, I thought, \\"Hmmm, great book, classic Crichton, but no challenging thought or political controversy. Then after a day or two to think things over, I thought, \\"Wait a minute.\\"Of course, Crichton doesn't write without purpose! The largest of the \\"big\\" ideas that were subtly written into this book's underlining was the concept of man's \\"inner shadow,\\" something Crichton attributed to Jung. The Shadow is everything in us that is unconscious, repressed, undeveloped and denied. \\"Everyone carries a shadow,\\" Jung wrote, \\"and the less it is embodied in the individual's conscious life, the blacker and denser it is.\\"Four people were chosen to explore the spaceship: an astrophysicist, a mathematician, a botanist, and a psychologist. As the story unfolds, strange things start to manifest inside and outside the ship. The psychologist realizes that somehow one or all of them are now manifesting the contents of their subconscious mind. Of course, though they were all highly accomplished intellectuals, not all of them were very emotionally aware. Repressed fears and anxieties, however, do make a substantial impact, in this book and in reality. In this case, that awareness was a matter of life and death.As a student of psychology, I think this book is a tribute to the impact of disregarding the emotional world. As a student of God, it hits me that a similar mistake is often made when denying the impact of the spiritual realm. When our life balances the various aspects of our selves, we have the best chance at maintaining a life that is not only in balance, but impacting."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Michael Crichton is a master at infusing technological subjects into an adventure novel. Sphere is no different. The premise of the story is a scientific find on the ocean's bottom. Top reasearchers in several fields are brought in to study the find. As it's on the bottom of the ocean, they'll be living in a pressurized habitat on the bottom of the ocean.I loved this book. I was really drawn into the fear that Crichton was trying to evoke, being trapped under the ocean with horrific things happening all around. It was also a different take on the alien or foreign matter concept. One of my favorite Crichton's!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is a prime example of book being better than movie.Now, I must admit that when I was younger, I was they type to go see movies that interested me, and afterward, investigate their original source material, so I saw Sphere first. And I loved it.I loved it so much that I went out and bought the book, which was the \\"movie edition cover,\\" which these days I find annoying, but am willing to live with as long as the text is untouched.I read the book. And I loved it. But in my love for the book, I started to dislike the film. I though, \\"Gee, Mr. Levinson, couldn't you have been a little more faithful to the book? It would have made an even better film!\\" I'm not saying that the film itself was bad, as after all, I said earlier that I loved it. I'm just saying that if your movie is nowhere near as good (even if it is good) as the book, then you're doing it wrong.The book is about an alien craft found deep in the ocean (it's discovered because its tail fin severed a trans-oceanic data cable). A team of scientists is assembled to study the alien vessel. Upon investigation, however, they discover the alien vessel in not alien at all, but some sort of time traveling space ship from the future, crashing into the ocean in the past. There are no survivors, as the ship has been under water for at least 350 years. There is, however, a strange spherical artifact, called \\"the sphere.\\"One of the scientists ventures into the sphere, but has no recollection of what went on. Afterward, however, the crew is contacted by a curious entity via the computers who is capable of manifesting any manner of horrors just for his amusement.The crew must then survive the childlike wrath of the entity, and try to figure out just what's happening.The thing I enjoyed most about this novel was not that it was a techno thriller, as are most if not all of Crichton's books. I enjoyed, rather, the psychological nature of this book, which does come apparent as you read it.If you are a fan of either techno or psychological thrillers, or quite possibly any thriller, maybe even Michael Jackson's Thriller, then you may find yourself enjoying Sphere. If you want to maximize your enjoyment, you might want to do as I have done, and watch the movie first. Be ready to hate it, though, once you've read the book. And be ready to be disappointed if you read the book and THEN watch the movie."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"\\"Sphere\\" is a great sci-fi story, and one of Crighton's best. I find Crighton to be pretty hit-and-miss, but I consider this my favorite of his books, and one I've read more than once. There are some great time paradoxes and other sci-fi mind games to have fun with, and some extreme hair-stand-up-on-the-back-of-your-neck moments as well! FUN!Crighton's writing is very cinematic; you can see the movie in your head as you're reading the book. This is why the movie version was so disappointing. Dustin Hoffman was a pretty good casting, but Sharon Stone and Samuel Jackson were just WRONG. I would have picked Laura Dern and Spike Lee. But enough about the movie. The good thing here is that if you've seen the movie, then the book will be very fresh... as the movie was almost NOTHING like the book.Certainly Crighton's best and an excellent stay up all night reading kind of book."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere, with its ocean depth setting, is the perfect summertime beach read. Although Crichton's feather light prose does have difficulty with the character development and set-up, once the action takes over it moves at a gallop, contains a number of sweep the rug out from under you twists, and more than a few Jaws type thrills. This all question and no answer concept potpourri contains everything but the kitchen sink and, in the reading, would seem to be the basis for a great movie. But, as with Congo, such was not the case. Recommended to aquatic thriller fans."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"then you better read this book. a modern novel that has a chance of standing the test of time to rest on a shelf right along with classics by tolstoy, melville and doestosky -- no kidding. chricton does a brilliant job of getting us to understand that there are numerous ways to view any situation and that no perspective is necessarily the correct way -- they're all just different and dependent on the viewer. through the clever use of a crashed alien ship at the bottom of the ocean a group of scientists, psychologists and others encounter an alien presence that forces them to confront their own biases in a most direct way. a book that tunnels into our psyches and leaves us forever changed.the movie wasnt nearly as good as the book and that was to be expected since so much of this sci-fi thriller is dependend on dialogue and imagination."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Norman was invited to be a phycologist on a Navy mission, he agrees and flies down there.

But there's a catch- it's evil. He then manifests the action to get rid of the power, and to forget it. I think this is a good book. the charecters are well described altough I don't like the &quot;tesion&quot; between Norman and Beth. (even though norman's married.

After reading the book, my wife pointed out to me that one may not have forgotten (notice who smiles) (sorry so cryptic, but you must read this book).I wish Mr. Crichton would write a follow-up with that thought in mind: one person with the powers that the Sphere gave them could wreak havoc in our modern world and what would happen if, somehow, the other two were able to break through their memory block and try to stop him/her? What a great struggle would ensue! Come on, Mr. Crichton, give it a try! Sphere is one of your very best."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Unfortunately, one of the weakest M.C. books I have ever read. Starts slowly where we do not really get to know any of the characters. The idea was really good and it seems a shame that the two-dimensional characters and silly end ruined it. If you are going to read this be prepared for uninteresting characters, and a disappointing end.If you want to enjoy it don't read the end, I made a mate of mine do this and he was begging me to re-lend him the book, when I eventually did he told me he wished I hadn't. All owners of this book should tear out the last twenty pages, lend it to a friend and watch your mates reactions and imagination come up with far better stranger ideas.There couldn't be a decent end to this book in my view as the concept of unimaginable power coming from the subconcious mind is brilliant. Also I am sick of the Americans going everywhere and achieving everything in novels, I know this is due to most authors being American. But the rest of the world see Americans as two-dimensional, as Americans consider the average of every other country to be. After a brilliant East/West differences in Rising Sun, I found the fact that most of Crichtons other books to be mainly about Americans to be a real disappointment.A novel does not have to be about race/country differences to include people from different nations, life isn't."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"It started out slow, but I kept reading.

I won't devulge many details for those that haven't read the book - but I'd highly recommend it.Like many of his other titles (Disclosure, TLW, etc.) the book didn't translate well onto the big picture. I'm not sure if the screenplay was just bad, or the actors tried to hard to push their personalities over the roles. Not that my point is to bash the movie - just don't judge the book by it."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is the best science fiction book I have read. It is the type that makes one feel lost between reality and dreams. The people are down under the sea for a lot of the story and they start becoming victims of either the sphere, or each other's shared anxiety. And then you get anxious - being surrounded by a dark, ominious sea is all that is needed to make you terrified. But till the end you can never tell if the sphere is a creation of their minds or a being, or what. It's a mystery - the key to any good science fiction.By the way, although Dustin Hoffman is a reat actor, I say you should read the book first. This is definitely *not* the book you would want to spoil by knowing all the secrets. :)"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Many &quot;professional&quot; reviewers dislike Sphere, believing that the plot is weak and goes in cirles. I am here to disagree. Sphere is a complex novel, though never confusing. Crichton skillfully builds mystery and suspense as the death toll rises. This book combines the past, present, and future in a fast-paced, gripping adventure on the ocean floor. The main characters of this novel are members of an alien-advisory panel. Their collective strength is tested when they are called upon to investigate a plane crash. Not just any plane, mind you, but a spaceship. The catch? The ship appears to be have crashed hundreds of years ago. Upon entering the ship, however, the ship is actually from fifty years into the future. The adventure begins when the team finds a large sphere covered with mysterious designs. As a storm brews overhead, the characters find themselves trapped on the ocean floor, with a new presence in their midst. There's something about that sphere... As a writer, Michael Crichton has made the science of the book easy to comprehend and fun to read. Sphere is a book just about anyone would enjoy, especially as a fan of Michael Crichton. This is yet another instance where the book is far better than the movie."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"There is no doubt about it, this book rocks. Usually I read books and give up after a chapter or two, but this book kept me interested the whole time. Every page was exciting and fun. One of Crichton's best works and it was very exciting too."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Some people would just as soon not read the book and rent the movie, but the novel Sphere is an exceptional book and a bona fide classic. Although the plot is roughly similar to that of the movie, the squid combat scenes are much scarier and all of the characters are more human. Everything about this novel is just perfect. But this book, it is the best one I have ever read."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book is noticeably more psychological than the author's other novels, but just as suspenseful and engaging. The story deals primarily with the misuse of technology for fulfillment of desire. The characters must deal with a proverbial alien vehicle that changes the human that touches it. Tension throughout the book leads up to a heart pounding ending.It is not the most uplifting, ideal novel, but it's fun recreational reading."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"If you love science fiction or are just looking for a good book, this is a great book to read. The first pages I read got me hooked. I could not put it down after that. Michael Crighton knows how to add the science and tell a story at the same time. Although there is a great story plot, the science is not overwhelming. It adds to the story. The Sphere starts out with an alien \\"crash\\" in the Pacific Ocean. The most odd scientists are called in and are told to keep quiet about what they are about to see. They are astonished at what they find. Nobody can figure out what this huge sphere is. None of the scientists know how to explain it until one scientist goes in. Unexplainable phenomena start happening and an unknown being starts communicating with them. All of their lives are in danger but will they come out alive? Read it to find out. If you want the best science fiction book out there, The Sphere is for you."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"After reading the other 2 reviews, I felt compelled to say that I too thought this book of Michael Crichton's was a thriller. I don't have the best concentration when it comes to book reading, but so engrossed was I in a particular hair-raising passage in this book, when I was tapped on the shoulder I threw the book across the room. For a few minutes, I felt as if I was actually there in that predicament. This book, as well as Airframe, were the most exciting for me. Couldn't put them down. Skip the movie, I was horrible."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"If you like to read scifi-mystery novels, and have a great imagination then you will enjoy this book; basically is a psychological novel in where you're in Norman mind an he shares will you all his thoughts, feelings, and mood. This book is very similar to the movie, sometime even has the same dialogue. If you are a high school student wishing to study psychology don't even doubt it and read this book to start learning something."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The book Sphere is about a psychologist named Norman Johnson who is flown to the middle of the ocean to help rescue the passengers of a plane crash. On the way to the crash Norman notices something very interesting: that there are a lot of ships around the crash site including many Navel War ships. When he finally lands on one of the ships; he finds out that there is no plane crash but an alien ship crash site. The reason Norman is called to this location is because he wrote a book about how the government should react to the finding of alien life. Norman is then sent down to an under water science laboratory to be able to get into the spacecraft. Once inside Norman's team finds out that the alien ship is in fact a human space craft and find a large round transparent sphere. One of Norman's men Harold goes back and goes into the sphere which gives him the power to bring his dreams and fears to life. The crew then finds out that there is a hurricane coming and they must wait it out. This was a very good book which kept my interest all the way through. This book is a very spectacular science fiction novel. I recommend this book to anyone that likes Michael Crichton."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The book, Sphere, is a great book about people who find an abandoned alien ship under-water. The ship is actally a future USA ship. The people who volenteer to submerge to the ship find something that will change the lives of people forever . . ."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Michael Crichton is my favourite author. I know this book is greatly hyped--i have a friend obsessed with it--but I think ol' Mike could've done better with the ending. The plot, however is thick and very good."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Michael Chrichton proves that he is the best author on the planet with Sphere. It is fun to read and very educational. It causes a feeling of paranoia and claustrophobia as Norman, Beth, and Harry are trapped underwater and not knowing who to trust. Great plot, great charecters, and I think I am the only person alive who actually was satisfied with the ending."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"long but interesting. good enough to keep readind till your done"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"In Sphere, Crichton sets up an absolutely fascinating account of a group of scientists studying a craft at the bottom of the ocean. But there is no ending. The story just seems to come to an abrupt halt at the end, with no resolution to any of the major plot twists in the book. The book leaves you completely unsatisfied."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"as always the book was better than the movie for this book. i read the book before the movie and was surprised that i liked it. i'm not much of a reader and rarely read books when i don't have too. though i enjoyed this story, it was suspenesful and exciting"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"It' simple folks, this book is da bomb. It lives up the the Crichton name"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Crichton yet again writes a fabulous story. How many authors can twist so much science with exitment in a story? He askes many questions of how the human mind works and how it will work in the future. If you havn't bought it buy NOW!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"'Excellent! Crichton's best book ever' is a strong statement, but honestly, I feel that way. An excellent ending with great suspense, SPHERE is the Crichton novel to buy. A great group of characters, with a plot that always keep you second-guessing, this is typical, science oriented Crichton, but it is good! And is sort of fritening at parts. IF YOU READ ANYTHING BY CRICHTON, READ THIS!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I have read most all Crichton's works, and let me tell you, this one tops them all. It is everything Andromeda Strain and Jurrasic Park were, and more! I have never seen the movie Sphere and only have half a desire to, but there is no way it can ever best this book. In my opinion, this is one of the best books of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Crichton's style of writing makes this book what it is. A Sci-fi masterpiece. Definitly his best."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Let's put it this way: If you liked &quot;Andromeda Strain,&quot; or &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; or other books by Crichton, you'll probably enjoy this. It's good -- if a bit confusing at points, and a bit eccentric at others -- and worth the read."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The thought-provoking novels of Michael Crichton have continued to be exciting reads for me -- and a nice break from stress. This novel is no disappointment -- it provides the action and mystery that have made his other books worth the paper they're printed on. Perhaps a bit worn in spots, and at time a bit confusing, &quot;Sphere&quot; was nonetheless a worthwhile read, and provided the excitement I look for from Crichton."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"this is the best book i have ever read!!!! it was so realistic and suspensfull, i thought i was there! even if u don't enjoy sci-fi, read it anyway, cause this book is more realistic fiction that sci fi. if ur thinking about reading this book, and haven't yet seen the movie, DO NOT SEE THE MOVIE BEFORE U READ THE BOOK!!!the book is so much better than the movie, and if u see the movie first, it will absolutely ruin the book. i have read a number of mr chrichton's books, and out of all that i read, sphere is the best, and is even my favorite book out of all the books i have read, which is a lot cause i love to read. i am even a fantasy reader and still loved this book, it's a real winnner."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This was only the second book of his that I read and it was absolutely the best! I agree with some of the other people that reviewed this book when they said it had a slow start. But it didn't take long until it was a book I couldn't put down. I'm somewhat of a slow reader and I finished the book in a few days. I recommend this book to anybody who wants an adventure into the unknown."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book is good for those who enjoy Science Fiction and suspense. The book may not start off at a quick pace but after the first few chapters the book gets a lot more exciting. This book is a must have for Sci-Fi fans!!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"A novel like a movie. Once you open it, you won't loose(?) the book"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Probrably because I saw the movie before I read the book, I thought suspense and the giant squid have stolen the core.There are a lot of good ideas presented in the book. Those psychological descriptions of the crews and the studies Norman did were very interesting. The power of altering reality with our mind was also a stunning idea, since if, we are the combination of matter and energy, we can probrably reverse the effect to create matter or energy.Writing a sci-fi book requires a lot of researches in the fields related, and it is understandable that some details are &quot;unintentionally&quot; avoided or less explanatory. But, those are the areas that I felt unfulfilled."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I really was hit in the face with this one! Finished in 2 days, kept me hanging on with addictive force. The way the three scientists manage to solve the mystery of the sphere is amazing, and Chrichton makes it sound so plausible. And the structure and theme of it is a definite cry for us to wake up and see what could happen in our society. Give it a try. It rocks!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere stands tall as one of the pinnacles of modern writing. Packed with more twists and turns than 1000 summer blockbusters, more well-developed characters than you can shake a stick at, and so many action-packed moments I found myself jumping up, gripping the book tightly, muscles tense, and speed reading to find out how this NEXT twist will be resolved. Some may find the ending disappointing but I think it is the work of a true genius. Sure, the book's weird. But it's good-weird. A truly thrilling thriller that is jostling for the top position right alongside Michael Crichton's other masterpiece, Jurassic Park. So far, this book is winning. I loved it."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I LOVE SCIENCE FICTON AND THIS WAS NOT THE BEST SCIENCE FICTION BOOK I'VE EVER READ BUT IT WAS DEFINATELY ON MY TOP TEN LIST, AND I'VE READ A LOT OF SCIENCE FICTION BOOKS."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I actually hated reading, I read the speed I spoke, but I went through this whole book in one go, bathroom trip and all. The tale is amazing! This book breezes by as nicely as a good movie does. You just don't notice anything else. I can't imagine anyone not liking this book, mass appeal on steriods. MikeC has more spins on this story than a Dutch windmill, you'll just never guess which way its gonna turn next. I think this book defines what a great commercial book that everyone loves should be. Shakespeare for the artsy, history for the geeks, Kerouac for the potsmokers, but Sphere for everyone!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book is fast-paced and well written, especially the first half, but the plot is not as well constructed as some of his others. The problem is that subsequent events render earlier events illogical and senseless. The book starts out well but reaches a very disappointing resolution, as if Crichton bit off more than he could chew. The fact that this book was made into a movie demonstrates, yet again, that Hollywood will go with a project of dubious merit if it is attached to the name of a proven winner."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"To put it as simply as possible, Sphere is one of those books that once you pick up, you won't put it down. Chricton's style of writing leaves the reader constantly wanting to &quot;see what happens next.&quot; He entices us with incredibly vivid imagery. Chricton is like the rider of a mule, who is hanging a carrot out in front of the mule. The reader is the mule, always pushing forward. Excellent book."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Critchton not only included a scientific explanation for all of the theories stated in this novel, but he also kept it interesting. It was edge-of-the-seat entertainment. It was so powerful and gripping, that I could not put it down. If you liked Crichton's other novel then you will love this one."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The story was really quick over too fast very entertaining but worthless ending."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"One of my favorite books. I liked the spaceship"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere kept me hinged on the edge of my seat the entire time, I absolutely loved it. Fast paced, exciting, and with enough explanation of the scientific aspects to keep the reader from being completely lost. Crichton excels at this type of writing."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"There is no compare, Crighton is a brilient writer, he can reach into the mind and bring out the trama within."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is a book that will open your eyes to the power of the human imagination. A suspense-filled story that will keep you turning page after page. It sheds light on the distinction between animals and humans."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Largely overshadowed in recent years by Jurassic Park, Sphere is just as enjoyable to read, even without a single dinosaur in sight. Here Michael Crichton has got the mix just about right; we have the cutting-edge technology, brisk action and also believably vulnerable characters. The mystery is handled skilfully indeed, constantly keeping the reader guessing, and the pace never drags. These, then, are the reasons Sphere gets five stars from me - there are few, if any, dull moments and the tale never becomes routine in the manner of many action-oriented SF stories."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is my favorite book, and is Michael Crichton's best. I couldn't put the book down because it was so suspenseful and thrilling. I think that everybody should be able to read such a fantastic book like this. Many people say the ending is disappointing, but I thought it wasn't at all! I read it all in one night because it was just so good, and never wanted it to finish because the story was stupendous. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is an extremly good book .."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is probably the best book I have read. Michael Crichton is a brilliant man. I have never read a book so interesting, scary, funny, and easy-to-read than Sphere. As sci-fi goes, Sphere is a classic work of art."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This was the first Micheal chricton book I have ever read. I read it in 6 hours in one sitting. the best book i ever read because the plot grows and grows. Until the end where the book just dies. I would still recommend this book to any reader who likes any type of action books."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I read quite a bit and like everything from classic literature to sci-fi. Sphere is absolutely the best book I've ever read. Incredibly well written, it reads just like a movie. This is the only full-length novel I've ever read in one sitting. I bought it, got home at about 6 pm, started reading, and read until 10 am the next morning, only stopping to sleep for about four hours. The movie was okay, but if you didn't like the movie, read the book, I garauntee you'll like it."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The basis of the story is an excellent piece of imagination but the delivery and ending hint of a rush job."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is the first Michael Crichton's book i read,and since i'm from Israel i wouldn't know to really describe how i LOVED this book,it was so intersting i couldn't put it away! i finished this book then less then a week,because i always couldn't stop reading!!! i'm real amazed about how Michael can combaine the latest word in modern technology and fly on wings of imagiontion the way he only can do.now i'm in the start of Congo,and i'm also amazed about all the great plots and technology gizmos written in a very easy-to-read language,i read alot of books of alot of readers and i think Michael Crichton tops them all,No.1!!!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Micheal Crichton is possibly the best writer in the world. This book is amazing. I picked up a copy and wasn't able to put it down; managing to lose several hours of sleep and fail a geometry test. The setting, plot, and characters are some of the best in any novel. Sphere has a lot of great suspense, and it kept me guessing about things that would happen to the crew; only to be surprised with a shocking event. This is a MUST for any reader. Your not going to be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Down in the depths of the southern Pacific Ocean, a gigantic spaceship is found, undamaged after a fall from the sky, which seems to be around three hundred years old. Immediatley, a crew is sent for, and dozens of peoples' lives will never be the same as they fight for survival in an underwater biodome against the power of the sphere. I loved &quot;Sphere&quot; by Michael Crichton. It has every element a classic suspense novel should have. I was fascinated by the excellent craftmanship of &quot;Sphere&quot;. Along with every other thrilling thing in it, it has a twisted ending that will sent chills down your spine. This New York Times bestseller will keep you hooked into the wee hours of the morning, until the last page is turned!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book a &quot;classic&quot; Crichton book: a simple combination of action, scince stuff, and mystery. Also, in this book he adds psychology to the list making it even better."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I'm so glad I read this book before I saw the movie because I probably wouldn't have picked the book up after seeing Sharon Stone, Dustin Hoffman and the other stars playing the parts so unlike was portrayed in the book. That's just my opinion though. The book was definitely 10 times better than the movie with the portrayal of strange huge squids above the undersea station and other fantastic, mind boggling happenings that can only happen in a book. Things that special effects can't even make up for a movie. The book was spine chilling to the point that I felt as if I were in the seastation with the crew. The story is about a strange sphere that appears in the deep ocean. I don't know how everyone else read it but I felt the writer was trying to convey to us that the sphere was not from outspace at all but was from the future and had actually been made in the USA. I'd still give the movie version of this book 3 stars but I implore you, if you decide to see the movie, read the book first! Great story, great plot, great writer as always."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I had the opportunity to listen to this auio book whil traveling. It kept me extremely captivated. I found it hard to get out of my car when I would stop.The characters in this book were terrific. Michael Crichton always has colorful characters and the narrator, Mr. Ed Asner really brought them to life. In addition, this audo book utilizes some minor sound effects that gave me the sensation of listening to an old time radio program. These sound effects added greatly to the book. Some of them were things like the sound of sonar pinging, making the voices sound like they were coming over an intercom system and the computer voice of Jerry just to name a few.Mr. Asner did a wonderful job with the voices. When I first saw that he was doing the reading, I didn't think I would like it, but was pleasantly surprised.This book was the perfect length for my trip, approximately 3 hours. I started it just as I left my home and it concluded just prior to arrival at my destination.My dislikes about this book are minor and not worth mentioning here.If you like to listen to audio books when you travel then I highly recommend Sphere. I have also listened to Arifram by Mr. Crichton and it is another great audio book.Normally, I like to compare the author to others of the same genre; however, Mr. Crichton is the leader in this genre and all others would pale in comparison."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is only the second book I've read by Michael Crichton and so far its the best one I've read. The whole book is so interesting and sucks you in so you never want to stop reading it. I didn't want to read the book at first after seeing the movie which is pretty dumb but the book is nothing like the movie, its far better so don't let the movie stop you from reading the book. If you haven't read any of Crichtons books, read this one and if you are a Crichton fan and haven't read this book then seek help."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I loved this book. To put it simply. I read Battlefield Earth, and Conact, and all of Crichton's novels, and this is his best.The combination of paranoia, and the power of the imagination goenw ildly out of control in an underwater setting make this a classic. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good read. The movie was a disappointment though. It left out all the best stuff, like the ship's details and the giant squid attacks, it was a shame. But last, this was an incredible book."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is a masterpiece of techo-fiction, an awe-inspiring story of a mysterious 300 year old ship found at the bottom of the sea and of the scientists who investigate it. Complex and well-written, the ending is exactly what you need, but not neccesarily what you expect. Top-notch fiction from a master in the field."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is a wonderful, deep, thought-provoking novel. I am impressed by Crichton's research into producing it, and am also intrigued by Norman's different take on an encounter with an ULF. The ending might be ridiculous to others, but I believe it contributes to the whole dilemma and unpredictability of human reaction to an unknown. However, the last few lines seem to imply something. At the end, to Norman, Beth seemed serene and almost beautiful, so did she really relinquish her power? &quot;And she smiled.&quot;As I said, absolutely intriguing."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I thought this book was GREAT! It is TOTALLY different from the movie and MUCH better! Great suspense and sci-fi at it's best!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere failed to convince me; I haven't read a book in a long time which had such a bad combination of poorly drawn characters and unengaging plot. In essence, unconvinving."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Finally somebody agrees with me in regards to chrightons characters. He may or may not have good storylines or original ideas, i dont really care. If there arent at least semi-interesting characters to bring the tale to life then the story is hardly worth reading..."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere was one of the few books I ever speed-read. I finished it in one three-day weekend in 7th grade and loved every minute of it. Although, as is usual for Crichton, the last 20 pages were disappointing, the last 2 pages made up for it completely. The ending leaves you guessing about who did what: Do they still have &quot;The Power&quot;? I've debated this with a friend of mine who has read the book, she thinks they all forgot it, I think only the one lady kept it, and it appears some people on here think they all remembered. I guess only the soon-to-be-released movie will tell us truly (hopefully). This is one of, if not the, greatest Crichton books ever written. Like all his other books, it has a different subject than most are used to and it is no way similar in subject to his other books. The style is mostly the same, and you can see big flashing signs of &quot;CRICHTON&quot; throughout the book. A true great."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Do not waste your time reading this trash.

Found it less than his previous works. Jaygee"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"If you like space fiction (even though its not set in space) you must read it. Sphere is the ultimate proof of Crichton\`s capacity to take a simple plot and turn it into a really great story!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I've read several Crichton titles, and consider him pretty much a master or adept at the genre. The most recent of his works that I've read wasPrey, which was extremely well done and pretty creepy too -- but in decades past I've read and enjoyed Eaters of the Dead, Andromeda Strain, Jurassic Park, etc.Somehow I wasn't sure whether Sphere would interest me (even if a book is well done, if it's not one's sort of book, it's not for one), but there it was in the pile, so I started reading it about a week ago.It seemed a slow starter, but that could have been me; it was a busy week and I couldn't really sit for more than a few minutes at a time. The premise is that a team of people are sent to a deep water environment to investigate what turns out to be some kind of space ship (?) or time travel space ship (?) with an alien artifact (?) that has some strange effects on people. One of the fun things about certain types of speculative fiction is the way that the \\"reality\\" evolves according to the characters' perceptions.Crichton seems to have done his homework, as usual, in terms of the technical stuff -- a deep-water habitat has its quirks.This is more of a psychological thriller, although there is definitely a sci-fi tech element.For whatever reason, I wasn't crazy about it. As I got to the end, instead of suffering anxiety over finishing a gripping book (it really is one that you just keep reading), I was rather looking forward to wrapping it up. The ending was a bit disappointing to me as well, but it did make sense really."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Like all Michael Crichton this book kept me reading to find out what would happen next. I thought it was interesting how he combined sci fi, suspense and psychology all into one book. The technology in this one is a bit dated, but other than that a good, scary read."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This was one of the first books I read on my new Kindle Fire. Ive got to say I could not put it down, I really enjoy Crichtons writing and this one does not disappoint either. Only thing that makes me sad is there will be no more books from him. If your looking for a great read on vacation Sphere will keep you on the edge of your seat."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Good story, quick read, yet an anticlimactic ending. Provoked me to ponder life questions, both existential and scientific. Could have taken a better twist to summarize the events that unfold though"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Michael Crichton weaves an awesome tale in Sphere. It's a unique and mind-bending tale that spins from one catastrophe to another with nice fluidity. Your'e constantly reading to find out not only what the Sphere is but the history of the characters. Crichton explains some difficult concepts using simple grammar which will help any reader who didn't pass chemistry. The Sphere is a character in it's self and that help propels the story forward. It's very creepy and makes you realize how powerful free will is. I highly recommend it because of the action, characters and story."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The one thing that remains the same about any and every book I've ever had the pleasure of reading from this man is the pure elegance and fluidity with which he paints a picture. With every thoughtfully placed word he takes us to worlds we've never had the privilege to visit and does so with such accurate beauty that we are left wanting more. Even when the novel as a whole or the execution as a whole is waning, visually there is no comparison. Michael Crichton is a masterful storyteller and an even more qualified artist, painting brilliant imagery and classic experiences all his own.That said, \`Sphere' is no different. In fact, \`Sphere' may be one of his finest works, for not only does it deliver with grandeur and visual satisfaction but it delivers it plot and purpose as well. Forget all you know and or remember from that mess we call a film adaptation and pick up Crichton's novel with bite and brains. Its miles ahead of what Hollywood served up to the unsuspecting population, and thank the Almighty God in heaven for that.Delving once again into alien territory, here Michael Crichton serves up a story with plenty of scientific babble and technological discoveries, but it's at the heart of this novel that we find a truly eerie reality. I find myself writing this and yet not wanting to say much more because there is so much for the reader to experience and perceive all on his own. Unlike some of Crichton's more popular novels like \`Jurassic Park' and or even \`Congo' \`Sphere' itself has a lot of meat. It's not just a glossed over adventure novel but it has depth in reasoning that Crichton delivers brilliantly. Let's just say that this novel will make you think. I won't say much with regard to the plot since all you need to know has already been said or appears on the back cover. Just know that all will be uncovered in due time.While it may have some similarities to Crichton's clear masterpiece and ultimately finest work of art \`The Andromeda Strain', Sphere' still deserves to stand apart as a sure-fire page turner, a brilliant piece of literature that should excite and entertain the very best of us. So, take a load off and treat yourself to a lavish read by one of the greatest science fiction writers of our time."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere by Michael Crichton is an excellant novel. This was certainly the hardest to put down of all of the Crichton novels that I have read.The story revolves around a man named Norman Johnson. Johnson is a phycologist. He travels with 4 other civilans to a remote location in the Pacific Ocean to help the Navy in a top secret misssion. They quickly learn that under the ocean is a half mile long spaceship. The civilans travel to a center 1000 feet under the ocean to live while researching the spacecraft. They are joined by 5 Navy personel to help them run operations. However on the surface a typhoon comes and the support ships on the surface must leave. The team of ten is stuck 1000 feet under the surface of the ocean. After a day under the sea they find out that the spacecraft is actually an American ship that has explored black holes and has brought back some strange things back to earth.This novel does not have the research that some of the other Crichton novels have, but it still has a lot of information on random things from the lawes of partial pressure to behavior analysis.I would strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Not having the chance to watch the movie version of \\"Sphere\\" prior to reading this Crichton's novel, I found it is intriguing to get it off the bookshelf from a store. As expected in Crichton's fiction novels, he introduced many medical terms based on his previous training as a doctor. Also evident are his meticulous research on the materials presented in this novel.The plot started with a university psychology professor transported all the way to the Pacific, in the middle of nowhere, but evident some sort of vehicle crash had happened in such remote location. As the main protagonist, Norman Johnson, the psychologist along with a team of other prominent members of the academia and a team of Navy specialist went down to the bottom of the ocean to find this supposedly crashed vehicle.They got more than they bargained for, and nightmares-turned-reality started one string after the other. The exploitation of each character personalities are extremely well done.Sphere is a well written novel, though it is not the best of Crichton's. A recommended four-star reading for medical thriller and suspense genre fans."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I've always been a fan of Michael Crichton, but this is the book that captivated me. I startd reading this book, and then I couldn't put it down. The rich plot and wonderful details make this a great book for fans of science fiction. It never get's complicated, but never get's boring either. If you were a fan of Prey, Rising Sun, or Jurassic Park, you will love this book. The charachters are all interesting in their flaws and their good charchteristics. There are a few things that might be confusing though. I can't think of an example but I remember getting mixed up somewhere near the end."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Many books deal with 'alien' ships popping up somewhere. Very few of them handle the issue as well as this one.Michael Crichton obviously did thorough research on all subjects involved in this book - ranging from physics to marine biology to psychology - and of the every day life undersea.The 'thriller' part of this book is also well executed."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Michael Cricton is to Sci-Fi/Techno Thrillers as Stephen King is to Horror. I could just leave this review at that and people would buy this book. This was actually the last Crichton book i have read of his, and I now wonder why I read all of his others and left this one for last?He brought dinosaurs to life for us, introduced us to hand-talking apes, and we have battled in the fourteenth century with him, but never did I imagine that he could take me two thousand feet underwater and have me gasping for air. The story is by far one of his best. I agree with one reviewer by saying no movie could do this epic any justice.The story alone is awesome. A crew of scientists sent to the deep by the Navy to investigate a plane crash that turns out to be an evolved spacecraft from the future, but is really over three hundred years old. Crichton makes you interested and glues you to the pages as the characters explore this ship, then plunge into absolute terror.Don't do as I did and leave this book of his for last, pick it up ASAP and jump into it. The four-hundred pages with breeze by in a matter of hours."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Wow. That about sums up this book. It is one amazing peice of hardware. This book starts out in the the middle of the Pacific Ocean near Tonga and takes you down about one thousand feet. Three hundred years ago (give or take five hundred) a spacecraft of unkown origan crashed here. The Psychologist in the book, Norman, is the main character. The way that this book is written will keep you guessing. Is Jerry creating the evil manifestations of the deep, or is something else doing it? And what is the significance of the Sphere? Does it have a purpose, or is it just a trophy picked up it the year 2048? Does Captain Barnes have his own hidden agenda,or is there more going on here thatn even he knows? I dare you to read this book. It will keep you exhilerated and you won't put it down until the final page. This is one of my favorite authors at his best. I hope that you all will read this book and try not to go nuts trying to figure it out. And remember, at a thousand foot deepsat expidition, no one can hear you scream."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The book Sphere was a superb read. Not being able to put it down I finished it quickly.This story just hooks you. With a great plot, this book is supernatural. I usually don't read these kinds of books, but when I read about the spaceship it hooked me. If you like good twists at the end, that changes everything that you thought would happen, you should read this awesome, exciting, yet thrilling book."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"If you're into Michael Crichton books, then I guarantee you that you won't be disappointed here. One of Crichtons best books."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I'm not sure which was worse, the movie or the book, but either way, the book was a huge dissapointment. He builds us up to some climax, but in the end, it was a very dissapointing resolution. Almost as if the publishers said &quot;Hey, Mikey, we need that book NOW, so FINISH IT. None of the themes were new, but I will say he DID manage to engage me for a while, which perhaps is why I felt so let down at the end."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Unfortunately, this is one of the few times where the movie outshined the book. I love Crichton's novels, but we all know the books are better than the movies. This movie outdid the book though. If I were you, I would spend the couple dollars and buy this one on video. I hope I saved you money!Enjoy the video!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This one didn't do it for me. I found the plot fairly boring (though it picked up at the end), the characters transparent, the situations forced, the philosophizing second rate.Didn't live up to my expectations based on the other Crichton books that I've read.Still, though, perfectly good for the plane."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"What is the sphere? The key to all your dreams, and all your nightmares. It's the one thing that manifests your dreams, your desires, your fears. Michael Crichton builds this tale of deciet, lies, and control with incredible skill and fluidity. A great book, but I didn't like the movie. If you like Crichton's work, READ THIS!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"OK, I am an admitted hater of Crichton's work. However, Sphere was entertaining and had me guessing until a forth of the way through (I've never seen the movie, or heard anything about the book). However, any fond feelings that I may have felt for this book was completely decimated by the cop-out ending!The slow drag partway through the story not withstanding, the pacing is good, and mood that Crichton cast is both eerie and suspenseful. I would have given this book a high rating, just because I was so surprised how much I enjoyed the ending...until the last five pages. Actually, if you skip the last five pages of the book - you will love the book and will walk way enjoying this much more then you would otherwise.I'm dying to say more, but I can't without giving away the ending, and while the ending isn't worth the paper it was printed on (was Crichton just bored of the book, by this point?!?), I don't want to ruin it for people who dislike spoilers."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I'm sorry but that was one of Michael Crichton's worst books. The beginning had me hooked but the end was just stupid. I am also in the making of a book report on this book for English and i'm supposed to pretend i'm selling it but i wouldn't even try to if it wasn't for getting a good grade. The characters weren't very complex and kinda dumb. Norman sounded tired and an idiot the whole time. Beth was insane. Harry was just not there, he was supposed to be rude, smart, and sarcastic all the time but he was not. The ship was pretty cool but they thought the sphere was more important, which it was the point of the story but it was pretty boring. The Sphere really doesn't do anything, its all in Norman, Harry, and Beth's imagination that ends up coming true b/c the sphere shows them that part or power of their imagination to make things real.Oh well maybe its just me who didn't like it."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Totally predictible. For more intellegent mystery, try watching &quot;Scooby and the Headless Ghost&quot;"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Michael Crichton is not a great writer. His prose style is rather stiff, as are most of his characters. His real strength is in hitting on great story ideas. His main failing is in not following through successfully. This book is a good example. The initial premise - a group of scientests being assembled to investigate a spherical space ship on the bottom of the ocean - offers great promise, and the initial incidents in the story are interesting, but from the first third of the book it is all downhill. Much of the plot is silly and the ending is totally unsatisfying.So if you are a die hard Crichton fan, no problem. Anyone else should expect to be disappointed."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Superpowered subconscious seal.An undersea expedition and experiment in living in a high pressure environment very deep in the ocean is enough stress and psychological worry for anyone.Throw in a strange alien presence with reality altering abilities and things will get very strange and scary indeed.The tense novel is definitely one of Crichton's better efforts, portraying the strain on and between the various inhabitants."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book is truly great. Michael Crichton has the ability to create great thrillers like this. The plot is great and I couldn't put it down. I think one of my favorite moments was when they are talking to the computer and it decides it's going to try to kill them. This book is a must read for any Crichton/science-fiction fan."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"i usually just eat up his novels but this was one of my least favourite novels by crichton. i suppose it was trying to make a statement about humanity and all our little quarks . usually his books do make some sort of statement. but unlike his other books it never grabbed me. however this seemed exactly like phillip dicks, 'in eye in the sky' that was written around 50/60's. in both books everyone was exposed to each others fantastic-manifested fears. crichton did put in his usual medical terminology which helped to save it. it could just be a coincidence since crichton's stories are usually very distinctive."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is another book from Crichton that I love...It's about a huge spaceship found at the floor of the ocean, and the team of scientists that go down to find out what it is, and what it's for.The strange part? It's been at the floor of the ocean for hundreds- maybe even THOUSANDS of years.The cool part? It was and American ship sent there from the future and has a large sphere on the inside.Soon after they discover the ship, one of the team members opens the sphere and walks inside. He's found later, unconscious outside it. And after that, strange, coded, messages appear on the underwater station's computers from an unseen character named 'Jerry'.Bad things happen, presumably coming from Jerry; a huge squid attacks the ship over and over again, and soon only three members of the team are left.From its interesting beginning to its chilling ending, this book carries you on a thrill ride that seems entirely possible... just like all the Crichton books."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I liked this book. It is about A space shuttle found no the bottom of the ocean that is three hundred years old. A team is sent to explore it and while in side they find that it is an american shuttle. But the catch is, the first space shuttle was built seventy years ago. How did it get there? Read the book and find out. My personal favorite part was when the jellyfish come to town. I didn't like the fact thatit was so confusing."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is by far one of the most interesting and creative books I have ever read. The plot is simple. A 300 year old human space craft is found far below the earths surface. The character development and sophistication of this book is lacking being that its intent is to entertain the reader. If your looking for a challenging read do not buy this book."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"A traditional Chrichton. The begining lags, as usual in Michael Chrichton. Then it gets good, and the mystery falls in. Then it gets to the ending. The ending was slightly dissapointing. There were unanswered fates, such as Hal C. Barnes' fate. But, maybe some things are better left unsaid. There should be a warning on the cover. WARNING: not for people with high blood pressure or respiratory or cardiac conditions."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Many reviewers here have complained about the ending. The first time I read the book, I agreed with them. But having read it again, I've changed my mind. More on that in a moment.When I read a Crichton story, I tend to enjoy the science, and theoretical ideas, more than the action parts. Jurassic Park, Timeline, Prey, and Sphere -- in all these stories, Crichton delves into some idea such as multi-dimensional space, cloning, nanotechnology, alien intelligence -- and his explorations of those ideas are, to me, very interesting. Not so interesting is when each of those books ends up as an action story, with people in great peril, with some of them dying. Timeline, for example: I find myself re-reading the parts where the theory of the multiverse, the descriptions of the machines, and the ideas of Stern to rescue his friends, are the focus. I skip over the sword fights and daring escapes.Same thing for Sphere. When Ted and Harry are debating about the Drake equation, time travel, nature of aliens (if any), etc., I am thoroughly involved with the story. When people start screaming and dying, I get pretty bored with it. Fortunately there is enough of the former that I enjoyed the story overall.Back to the controversial ending. Three of the main characters make a pact. Clearly, one of them keeps the agreement, and one does not. What I noticed on the second reading is that the third character, who I had assumed also kept the terms of the agreement, might not have. It's left unclear. This adds something to the story I missed the first time. And here's the main reason I don't mind the ending: If the events in this book were to happen, it seems to me the ending would be quite plausible. So I do not see it as a cop-out by Crichton."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is my fav book EVER! It is about 4 scientists who go investigate an alien space ship. Some VERY important things go wrong but Im not the kind to give away endings or, if you put it that was beginnings or mids either. OK so my point is this:READ THIS BOOKpsI am not a walking advertizement for the book i just like it ok"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Wow, this was a very good book. I had seen the movie a couple times and loved it, and then my friend told me to try the book, so i did. It was awesome..the book is a whole lot different from the movie, and, as most books-turned-movies are, the book was much better. For those who dont know the story, there is an airplane crash of some sort in the pacific and all these super smart people get called in to help out. Turns out that the plane was a space ship and there is this really weird looking sphere thing in it. All of the sudden tons of bad stuff starts happening, and the people on the ship are talking to a sentient life form over a computer somehow. Its really intricate and very exciting. There are a whole bunch of twists and turns, and all of it keeps you on your feet. This is a very good book and i would recommend it to most anyone."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is a really cool book. I am a big fan of Chrichton, I love how he weaves fiction and non-fiction together in his books (he knows a lot about science if his books are any indication). If you saw and hated the movie (as I did), you should still pick up the book because it is far better. The book is very suspensful (if a bit predictable, but if the writing is good then its easy to overlook that). I loved the ending, its different and intriguing, it shows that the real enemy wasn't any of them, but rather the power the sphere had to offer. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I never liked science fiction until I read Michael Crichton's, Sphere. He did a great job. It was so life like you could almost believe the story really happened. I couldn't put it down. It's an excellent book.

The last few pages are just amazing!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is definitely Crichton's best novel, even better than Jurassic Park, my second favorite. I couldn't put this book down!

Crichton's ability to stun the imagination is put to work like never before! His caracters have a reality that makes them walk with the storyline.

The auther did a beautiful job on pulling the reader into the story line, helping them to get attached to the charecters. To bad about the ending though, it is almost as if Michael had a deadline and sort of tacced on the last 15 pages. The book is still worth paying for if not for the whole thing then for the story at least"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book has everything needed to make agreat sci-fi thriller, suspece will drive crazy to find out what is going on. However, this book has so many twists and turns in the plot you will go crazy until you get to the end, but this still doesn't change the fact that this book is written in great way and is very interesting, you wont be able to put the book down. Another plus to this book are the scientific fact that are in the book that can help you learn a lot of information you never knew, like in all the other Michael Crichton books.Since this book is soon to be major motion picture I advise you to read the book before the you see the movie.

You can picture so clearly what everything looks like. The Sphere movie is coming out this christmas too, hopefully nothing will be changed differently from the book.

I sure hope he rights a sequel"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I bought this book and put it up on the shelf for awhile. One afternoon, I casually picked it up, and opened to a page as I sometimes do. Hooked, I read from that point until the end without having read the beginning. It was engrossing. It was thrilling. It was scary. Until I got to the end. Then, Michael Crichton did something he has never done before: he RUINED the end!!! I won't say what the ending is because it is still a shock, but you will see if you read it. Okay, I exaggerated a bit I guess. It was not ruined, but it was spoiled. It could have been a much better book IF he had used a different ending - keeping the extraterrestrial premise and going with it. The mental power plot could still have worked if the entire thing with the lovable and deadly alien Jerry had not been IMAGINED. It made me mad! But this is STILL a good thriller and a worthy read, and the upcoming movie should be fun"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"A team of scientists are shipped down to what the navy thinks,is an alien spacecraft, what they find is beyond their wildestimaginations, they find the Sphere...A very powerful but also mortally dangerous item!

I'm sorry that Author Crichton has died some years ago.While used, the books that I received were in good condition and I'm satisfied with the timely service recived and the book stores where the orders were placed.

As the novel opens he is being taken to an undisclosed site by the US Navy. Johnson learns that the crash site is located 1000 feet under the South Pacific and the craft is some sort of a space craft. He was been included because of work he did sometime before organizing a first contact team for a previous administration, an assignment that Johnson would just as soon forget.Once the team is taken to the Navy deep sea facility and begins to study the craft Johnson begins to find disturbing circumstances - that the Navy commander has been less than honest with both the team and his superiors and that the craft itself bears a remarkable similiarity to current human technology, labels and directions are even written in English, leading the team to question just how alien this technology really is. The suspense continues to build as the undersea facility loses their support ships above due to inclement weather and then conditions in the facility itself begins to turn hostile.This novel is quite predictable, just a few pages into the story it is obvious to anyone who has ever seen a disaster movie that there will be no comforting support ships nearby, that the undersea environment will become threatening, there will be many deaths, there will be sexual tension between the hero and someone else and so on. While there is some slight redemption in the last few pages this book is a big disappointment, Crichton is capable of so much more. If you are a fan read it but be forewarned, if you are unfamiliar with his work begin with anything but this."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I'm amazed at how diverse a writer Michael Crichton is.I really liked the concept of this book.Man builds a spaceship in the future, to leap across space and gather data.

It has the classic Dean Koontz suspense, the freakiness of John Saul, and the originality of Isaac Asimov. All of these attributes, Michael Crichton has taken as his own, time after time after time. I first read this book in 1989 and I've jumped out of my skin every time I read it... time after time after time. If the movie is made with the same quality and special effect that made &quot;Jurasic Park&quot; a hit, this movie will be like none you've ever seen.

His initial premise about a possible alien ship sitting at the bottom of the ocean is exciting and the twist about it turning out to be a human ship from the future is great. Furthermore, his genius for plot is demonstrated by having the actual alien artifact the Sphere inside the ship.However, his characters were boring. I was hoping they would die.

I liked the way thatCrichton kept the suspense to the point at which you think thatnothing else can possibly go wrong, and something elsehappens. What made this book so different from Chrichton'sother works is the way he made us feel that we were right inthe sub, working with the team. Another tool Crichton usedwas the power to twist the plot into so many unthinkably tightknots, that everything you had formerly experienced that dayoutside of reading the book seemed trivial compared to thepossibilities that the book opened in your mind.

He's an undisputed master in the techno-thriller genre and although the dialog and characters in his novels aren't exactly world-class, he can usually be relied upon to give us interesting and highly original plots. With other authors as prolific as Crichton (such as Robin Cook), they can sometimes fall into the trap of plots that are merely tiresome variations on the same theme. Crichton, however, always seem to serve up something new and highly creative.In \\"Sphere,\\" a huge spaceship is discovered under 1000 feet of ocean water with a cargo bay containing a strange payload - a perfectly shaped sphere that exhibits unusual properties. The government enlists the expertise of a psychiatrist, a biochemist, an astrophysicist, and a mathematician to journey to the ocean floor and determine whether this sphere is some type of alien life form. When the sphere begins communicating with them, the mood is initially exuberant, but quickly goes south when people begin dying and the underwater habitat comes under attack. Who or what is intent on destroying them? Where is the spaceship from? What is its mysterious payload? It all makes for a fun ride that is exhilarating until the very end.Unfortunately, it's not the ride that was problematic - it's the end of the ride. After 350 pages that built masterfully to a climax, we're left in the final pages to scratch our heads and say, \\"Huh?\\" With the rest of the book so imaginative, it's hard to explain why Crichton couldn't come up with a resolution as satisfying as the build-up.Even with the so-so ending, it's a fun read and remains among my favorite novels by Crichton. He keeps the suspense meter ratcheted up so high that most people will have trouble putting the book down long after it's time to go to bed. Thus, in spite of the shortcomings, it's still a page turner and was considered a good enough story to be made into the 1998 screen adaptation starring Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone, and Samuel L. Jackson."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Michael Crichton rarely disappoints, and this is not the exception. In fact, this one takes its place right near the top of the class.\\"Sphere\\" is great science fiction. It is a page turner, it keeps you guessing, it offers a wealth of thought provoking information and it has a moral as well. What more can a reader ask for?"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"While on the surface this book offers suspense, underneath its skin it is a carefully-constructed Jungian analysis of the idealistic philosophies common to highly intelligent people. Crichton both criticizes our emotional nature and our attempts to hold it in check. While there are some parts of this book that seemed to make no sense, such as how people many feet below the ocean's surface survive the pressure of the water above without special gear, there are many delightful scientific explanations and natural laws carefully used as metaphor here. It's as if Thomas Pynchon decided to write a thriller with his knowledge of physics, and although the text is somewhat pulpy, it is rich and descriptive enough to both tantalize the senses and provoke the mind."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Horrible movie. I was practically crying after I saw it. I knew it wouldn't live up to the book, but still . . . Sphere is a very taut and thrilling novel that blends suspense with scientific fact - like all of Michael Crichton's books. I think this is by far his best book, better than Jurassic Park, Andromeda Strain, etc. It is at the same time filled with scientific fact and psychological elements and suspension.The basic story (if you've seen the movie, you should still read the book, it's far superior as I said before, although it's too bad because you already know what happens) is that an alien spacecraft crashes into the Pacific (I think, haven't read it in a while) Ocean and a group of scientists at the head of their respective fields are sent in to investigate. They discover, well, a sphere, and that's when things start going bad. I won't say anymore so I won't spoil it for anyone.The book is definitely a page-turner. You won't be able to put it down, and the writing conveys the scientific elements very clearly without becoming confusing. To close, Sphere is a great book you really should read."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I read this book right after reading Jurassic Park, and I could hardly believe that they were written by the same person. It's obvious that Crichton had no idea where he wanted to take the reader, because the story is meandering and pointless. Just throw enough twists and turns into a story and nobody will care that they end up where they started, I guess. The mysterious Jerry turns out to be -----. If that's true, then why did ----- use such a ridiculous code to communicate? and why did ----- allow the code to be broken? This is the kind of inconsistency that made me wonder if Crichton had the slighest what he would do with Jerry, or anyone else, when he started writing. Crichton fans will also (I hope) be disappointed by a lack of the contemporary scientific relevance that is so typical of Crichton's work. Those who make it to the end of Sphere are insulted with the ultimate cliche, a dream sequence ending. You're probably going to want to read the book anyway based on all the other reviews, but don't say you weren't warned."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The depth and detail of this book is amazing. When you pick up this book you might say &quot;This will take a while&quot;. But if you're like me, when you pick up a book you like, the pages fly by. The movie is good too, but I reccommend this book because there are a ton of things cut out of the movie from the book.If you like Science Fiction, this is definitly the book for you. 90% of the time you will be sitting on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. Also, the last ten or fifteen pages of the book are the perfect ending.The characters in this book are realistic, with definite personalities. All of them are perfectly suited to be in this Sci-fi novel.Teenagers that like Science Fiction will enjoy the book too. I, myself, am 13 and got a real kick out of this book. I rented it from our public library and couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I love this book! One of MC's best novels! I'd even go as far to say that it's better than Jurassic Park!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Here is yet another novel made into a movie and my first from Michael Crichton. I become more and more surprised at how Hollywood takes extreme artistic licensing in transforming the book to the movie. Situations are similar, most of the cast are the same, but there are distinct differences between the movie and the book that greatly make a difference in interpreting.Plot:Norman Johnson, a psychologist, is hauled to the middle of the Pacific Ocean to preside over a supposed plane crash. What he learns is that he is actually a part of a mission to explore a crashed spaceship hiding underwater for around 300 years and this mission is based on a report he gave to the secretary of the United States on contacting Unknown Life Forms.Norman, along with Ted Fielding, astrophysicist, Beth Halpern, zoologist, Harry Adams, mathematician, Harold Barnes, USN Captain, and four other Navy personal travel down to a deepsea underwater habitat to investigate this spaceship. Inside the ship resides a sphere. Quickly things turn downhill as the sphere unleashes its alien power.Good:I think the book is much clearer about what is happening than the movie was. There are not as many confusing, unexplained occurences. Of course, this is in part due to the inability to show as much in a movie as in a book, but part of it is the fault of the movie.Further, Michael Crichton is great at his characters. It is nice that Norman is a normal human being, scared out of his wits, making stupid mistakes, and not some young, hunky, smart aleky guy. The people in this book are just that: people. Not supermodels or fakes. Real live people.Also, the whole idea is absolutely original. Instead of meeting aliens who may or may not be friendly, the team meets an empty spaceship with an alien object in it.Crichton steadily builds the tempo of this novel. He starts out somewhat slow almost lazy, but it gets more and more intriguing the further you get into the book. By the last 100 pages, I had a hard time putting it down.Bad:While not as confusing as the movie, it is difficult to tell which manifestations originated from which person. Did Norman manifest the jellyfish or Harry? Was Beth's seduction Norman's or Beth's? Other than this, there is not much to lament about (other than one of my favorite characters dies...)Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:There is quite a bit of foul language, mostly da**, he**, bi***, and God's name. Beth acts seductive to Norman at one point. Over the course of the novel, six people die. Their deaths are somewhat graphic but not overly. Several people try or talk about killing each other.Overall:An immensely intriguing book and an enjoyable ride to the bottom of the sea. Well worth the money I spent for it. After reading this book, I definitely want to check out more of Michael Crichton's."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I personally could not set this book down. I'd seen bits and pieces of the movie at a friend's house and decided to read the book to find out how the story ended. The book was much much better than the parts of the movie I saw... and they left out a lot of major story elements in the film. Whether you've seen the movie or not, Sphere is a must read for anybody who enjoys the science fiction genre.Crichton is an amazing writer, but unfortunately his books are usually turned into second-rate science fiction flicks (with the possible exception of Jurassic Park, which was awesome back in 1993). I think this is at least partly because so much of the appeal in his writing comes from the mental dialouge and thought processes, which cannot be conveyed to viewers of a film.Definitely hit this one up if you've got some spare time; it's worth every second!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This was the second Crichton book I've ever read. I shouldn't even say read, I should say experienced. What an unbelievable action book! I cannot praise this book highly enough. The only complaint that I have against this book is that I ruined my Monday, as I stayed up late on Sunday to finish it.What starts off as an underwater search turns into a harrowing tale of mystery, then action, then suspense, and then psychology. Without giving much away, the story revolves around a team researching a strange artifact, and things start going wrong. But why are things going wrong? Who's responsible? What's the motivation? Throughout the book, as the action unfolds, the mysteries and the actions get weirder and more intriguing. It's a true page-turner.In fact, it's so good, I refuse to see the movie. No director on Earth could present this book on film as well as it presents itself on paper. Another adaptation of this book, no matter how good, would only damper my experience.It's so good, I became an instant Crichton fan, and bought as many books of his as I could. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is the first MC book I'd read, and I've read every one ofhis books since! I was bored at a library, so I picked outa paperback w/ a nice cover, and there we have my favoritenon-classic novel ever! Who says you can't judge a book byits cover? Scientists uncover an alien spaceship from thefuture, but what they discover in the ship is nothing comparedto what they find out about themselves. Mix in high-tech,mystery, suspense (200%!), fear, and there you have THE bookwhich I HAD to finish in one sitting."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Beneath the depths of the ocean lies an American spacecraft that crashed three hundred years in the past!?!?!?!?

Michael Crichton planted a seed in my imagination, and with the setting, characters, and plot, it soon grew to gigantic proportions.I was so caught in the story that I could not put it down. I was hooked after reading just a few pages, and I finished it in a little over twenty-four hours.Although this book may not be for everyone (I have found that while a friend and I (both 13) were in love with this book, my mother and a friend of hers didn't enjoy it so much), I would reccomend reading it. You may find Michael Crichton weaves a pretty good tale."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere was, and still is, an excellent book. While exploring an &quot;alien&quot; ship, a highly specialized crew discover an &quot;alien&quot; object in the cargo hold of the ship. This sphere brings hidden desires and fears to life and those fears wreck havoc on the crew. This is a wonderful book, not only because Crichton tells the story so well that you can feel the tension, he also challenges our notions of what is alien and what isn't, of what we feel and what our conscious and subconscious minds, the latter especially are capable of. Through this book Crichton challenges everything we take as a given and almost forces the reader to think, instead of just being entertained. Sphere is a thought provoking, gripping, edge-of-your-seat story that will take a hold of you and won't let go until you've read the last word and maybe not even then.."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Once you start this book, there's no going back! You won't want to do anything until you've read through to the last word! It's action packed, suspenseful, scary, and great fun! It'll really make you think! The ending was great (despite what some of the other reviews say), and when you think about it, there's a good chance of a sequel! I don't know which one of his books was better - this or Jurassic Park. I talked to Michael Chrichton and he said Sphere the movie will be out some time in '97! I can't wait (I just hope they don'y botch up the story line like they did in Congo)! I hope you get a chance to read this classic Chrichton novel - you won't be dissapointed"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I found this to be one of his most thought provoking books.

A group of people go into a novel environment (lost jungle city/dinosaur inhabited island/spaceship under water) get chased by monsters, everything blows up, solving the problem.The science in Sphere is highly suspect, the characters are flat, the plot is unbelievable. After years of students telling me how great the book was and not being able to read it, I finally forced myself to get beyond the first couple of chapters. The story didn't get any better. I still didn't care about the characters. The plot was almost page-by-page predictable.Forget this book."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"basically.....this book is GOOD. if u love sci fi and michael crichton....you'll love this too.....very suspenseful and it isnt boring for the first 100 pages like mosst books....it keeps you thinking and thinking untill the end."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere by Michael Crichton is one of the best books I've ever read, it's full of suspense action, and some of the best character interactions I've read. I would strongly recommend this to anyone who likes any other book my Crichton (Jurassic park, Andromeda Strain, Airframe, Congo etc.).\\"For a decade, Norman Johnson had been on the list of FAA crash-site teams, experts called on short notice to investigate civilian air disasters... This time his wife, Ellen, had been annoyed because he was called away on July 1, which meant he would miss the July 4 beach Barbeque\\" (Crichton 4)In the first chapter you meet Norman Johnson a 53 year old psychologist whose being called out to the middle of the Pacific Ocean, for what he thinks is just a routine crash inspection. He soon finds out it's much, much more than that. You quickly find out that there is a \\"Space Ship\\" 1,000 feet below the surface of the Ocean, and there's \\"something Alien\\" inside.\\"They walked into the room, moving among the giant hands and claws. And they saw, nestled in the padded hand, a large, perfectly polished silver sphere about thirty feet in diameter. The sphere had no markings or features of any kind\\" (Crichton 104)This is \\"The Sphere\\" and it is what the book is about. Without giving too much away, when you go in, everything changes and not necessarily for the better. As soon as this is introduced the book really starts to pick up.\\"Now the feet of the body were swinging just above his head. Norman climbed another step, and one of the boots caught in the loop of the air hose that ran from his air pack to his helmet. He reached behind his helmet, trying to free himself from the body. The body shivered and for an awful moment he thought it was still alive. Then the boot came free in his hand, and a naked foot-gray flesh, purple toenails-kicked his faceplate... He turned the body so he could see the face. \`It's Levy.'\\"(Crichton 200)If this type of writing doesn't intrigue you then this book really isn't for you, but as soon as I started to read this book I couldn't put it down. It's got everything a great book needs, action, suspense, philosophy, science, and everything else you need."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Annotation: A sci-fi thriller that has a twist at the end you couldn't see coming. Michael Crichton sets the stage deep in the ocean as a group of scientist explores an unknown spaceship and finds a mysterious sphere that causes strange things to happen.Author bio: Michael Crichton was born in Chicago in 1942 and attended Harvard medical school in 1964. He has produced books such as Jurassic Park, Timeline, and Congo. He also created the hit show ER and is the only person to have the number one movie, number one book, and number one show all at the same time.Evaluation: This book was awesome! I couldn't put it down for a minute. One complaint I have is that when they made the movie, they tried to make it &quot;hollywood adaptable&quot; and messed up some key plot points. The part I liked best was when Harry uses his simple logic to determine that they were going to die in the spaceship because the ship was in the future and there was no sign that the future knew of them visiting the ship. It was so simple I was mad I didn't pick it out before I read it! This book is a definite read for anyone who is a science fiction fan."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I was looking for a quick read at my local library and picked Sphere up by accident. As a big Robin Cook fan, I immediately dove into this book. I never saw the movie, so I have a pretty un-biased opinion of the book.The ideas behind Sphere were creative, but I found myself rolling my eyes at several totally unbelievable parts of the novel (and I'm a big sci-fi lover!). The dialogue between characters was also a bit forced, but I'd recommend this book if you're looking for something to read by the pool :)"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"While not among the very best books I have ever read, Sphere is thoroughly engaging and kept me turning page after page from beginning to end. I've read many reviews that refer to Michael Crichton's cinematic writing style, and it's certainly on display here. (Although, as I've been told, the movie based on this novel was not particularly good.) As the plot unfolded, I was drawn in by the mystery of what is actually happening to the characters, and found myself caught off guard (pleasantly so) a few times as the truth was revealed. A good read, and one that I would recommend to almost anyone."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is an interesting book, it will take you a while to read it because is not an easy book, but it will keep you reading, the way it explains the basic things of what is a Black Hole in space and other scientific things is as easy as it can be.Of course this is a Sci Fi book, but the way it ends maybe will make you think that could be real, why not? At first they think that the sphere is from outer space, but when they explain that if Leonardo Da Vinci would see a TV he would think of magic, he would never know how it works, that makes you think.This is one book that will make think things that you thought you were sure of them."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is not only Crichton's best book, it is the world's best book.

DEFINATELY READ IT!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"All that this incredible novel needs is a squillionth rave review about how involving it is. So I will be brief. If my personal experience will shed any light on what you're getting yourself into -- I opened the book sometime during the day, read about half, and then picked up the last half at perhaps 1 am. Next time I look at the clock after reading the last pages and digesting that monumental decision that the characters must face, it's 4am but it feels as though only a few moments have passed. Crichton just has the knack for putting you in a trance, what else can be said? It's debatable whether this is his best work (I would actually argue for &quot;Airframe&quot;), but that's beside the point. These novels are treasures, they educate and thrill and keep us guessing invariably."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book is amazing.

A trained group of military specialists along with a pyschologist, are assigned to live in a habitat set up at the bottom of the ocean next the ship and explore it. The presence of an alien sphere and strange occurances cause the crew to suffer heavy losses and have their lives changed forever.This book used the idea of the existence of black holes, and that in the future, humans will visit alien lifeforms of other planets. Along with the solid story line, Crichton created one of the most intriguing books i have ever read. I am usaully very good at predicting what is going to happen in a novel, but this book constantly had me thinking one thing, and finding out that later that what I thought was totally wrong. Sphere was very hard to put down and suspenseful throughout."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Have you ever come accross one of those books that you pick up and never want to put down ? &quot;SPHERE&quot; by Michael Crichton is definitely one of those books. It is about action packed drama under the sea. Only your imagination can tell you what will happen. Just when things seem calm again, disaster strikes. The suspense is enough to keep you going for hours on end. I don't know anyone that could not relate to a charachter in this book. A lot of people love suspense, a good mystery, science fiction, horror, and drama. This is the only book I have ever found with a twist of everything. I am not a fan of science fiction, and yet this was incredible. I recomend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Well, I made the mistake of reading the reviews here before reading the book; people seem to forget that many readers read reviews to see what others *thought* of the book, not to have the book spoiled for them. So I already knew something about the plot of the book before starting it, other than what was in the synopsis and available from the cover. I thought this book was fabulous; interesting subject matter, great characters, an even pace, a thickening plot...and a great climax. I didn't even mind the way it ended, which I'd like to discuss, so if you haven't read the book yet, read no further!!!!! (That's why my knowing what I know wasn't entirely readers' fault; I did read further, even when told not to. Some, however, don't tell you not to and just talk aboutthe book assuming everyone has read it. Okay, I think I rambled on enough so that those who haven't read it could get bored and skim on down to te next review.) I didn't mind the way &quot;it never hapened,&quot; but what I did find a little too easy was the way they got around the tapes. Surely, there must have been *some* evidence of the sphere...weren't the conversations with Jerry on some of the tapes taken to the sub? It just seemed like Crichton was a little too eager to have it work out the way it idd, and didn't think it through completely when it came to the tapes. Or he hoped the reader wouldn't notice the minor discrepency. If it hadn't been for the tapes thing, I'd have given this book a 10. I would've preferred to give it a 9.8, but since that's not an option, I decided to go with 9."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"One of Crichton's best sci-fi novels.

I don't know what people see wrong with the ending. It is exactly what it shoud be. The unanswered questions are what makes it great. They let every reader determine for themselves where the sphere actually came from or if the people still have &quot;the power.&quot; I personnaly think that Norman and Harry lost it while Beth kept it. Crichton could not have ended it better. As a big fan of his I would strongly recommend Sphere eventhough the movie was not that great (or so I've heard)."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is the summit of Crichton's literary career. Characters are fairly flat, but better than in most of his other novels. The awesome plot carries them along well, though. The very idea which speeds this story along is chilling, as is the end. In some of Crichton's works the ending is sped up and is often anticlimactic but the finish of this one is bone-chilling. Ever throughout the novel the screw of suspense is twisted more tightly. This one is epic, topping all of Crichton's other works."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is a great book, you just can't stop reading it.

Jung's &quot;shadow&quot; insights were used quite frequently to illustrate the true power of the sphere, and I believe it's a testament to Crichton's writing skills that he makes it plausible and understandable for any reader.

Crichton uses a fast-paced writing style to keep you from putting the book down. Does not pay great attention to general detail (a la Tom Clancy) but is adequate enough to tell a great story and keep you guessing from beginning to end. Crichton's use of psychology and science, however, are excellent and the backbone of the story. The feelings of the characters, such as curiousity, fear, and anger, that radiate off the pages is splendid work. I read this in 5 hours straight."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Without a doubt, Sphere was the greatest book Crichton ever wrote. The book is extremely compelling... it was hard to ever put down. I don't know science but I could understand Sphere; the sub-plots, the technology and the physics. Michael Chrichton really wrote a book for the average schmo that we can all understand and be captivated by. The CHARACTERS were great too. Instead of some typical bimbo heroine, there's Beth, a mentally troubled young woman with good intentions but bad results; and Norman, a middle-aged, overweight, balding, and impertinant psychologist. They're people that are familiar to everyday life. I don't thick Michael Crichton was trying to write a boring, predictable epic, I think he was trying to write a book. He succeeded Sphere is a true classic of science fiction genre."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"As a joke, I like to keep this on my boat. Very well thought out, his best book by far. I read it in one day two summers ago, can't put it down. It can be looked at from different angles, dealing with aliens and the concept of black holes, and the unknown. A must read for those who don't think Sci-FI is for them. Basic yet complex, he lays out his theories in layman's terms. Don't base it on the movie, it's much better than that."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"There are many science fiction books written and published to the public, but none with such detail and research as Sphere. This book is an excellent mixture of scentific fact and scientific fiction which makes it more real to read.Synop: It starts out with a collection of people (4) who have mastered their fields of Physics, Math, Biology, and Psychology. They were recruited by the Navy to investigate an underwater vessel which is one mile in length and over 300 years old. What they find on the ship boggles their mind in engages them in an intellectual journey in understanding the human mind. In there struggle to understand the incomprehensible, they slip closer and closer into insanity as the pyschologist keeps everyone together.Once you start reading this book you won't be able to put it down. You will be engulfed in a new world while your world fades away as you continue reading. Its thrilling, mind-boggling, and titilating to any avid reader with an active imagination. The ending is the best part of the whole book. The last 10 pages are exactly what they should be.Unfortunately, the movie couldn't capture thr real suspense of the novel. The point of this book is to take your mind on an adventure, which will be different for everyone. A movie simply cannot capture the film being rolled in your head.One of the best things about this book is the readability of the book. I could read this book about 10 more times and I still would enjoy it on many levels as I did the first time reading the book. You will also catch small details which are critical in understanding whats going on, so re-reading the book several times is a must. (Trust me, you'll enjoy it!).Final thought: There is a reason why its New York Times bestseller with over four million copies sold."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book was very interesting. It combines science-fiction and mystery in one. In fact, I found this book to be so interesting that it is one of my favorites. All of this author's books are my favorites, If you haven't read this book, it is about a gold sphere in a spaceship that messes with peoples' minds. I highly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I read this book twice, I believe. Both times it kept me going. I enjoyed the suspenseful parts as well as the mysterious descriptions and dialogues presented therein. It's definately worth reading at least once for y'all."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book was astoundingly great, and the movie was astoundingly terrible, I felt ashamed that I had seen the video. Oh well, the book is great, and totally unique. It also has a very well done twist at the end of the novel, and keeps you addicted to the book. One of the reviewers said, &quot;This book should come with popcorn.&quot; Well, I certainly agree and would drink to that any day!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Try to take Richard Bach and his 'Illusions' and make his characters so well defined that you'd think they're real, existing people, and you'll have 'Sphere'. It's one of the best books I ever read. It makes you think you mean something in this world and life is worth living. It makes you proud to be a human being. And that's, I'd say, enough to take it in your hands."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I read this book before I saw the movie and I think that the book is 1000 times better than the movie.

Its non stop reading."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is an incredible book, and shows Michael Crichton at his best. The plotline, characterization, and imagery are all top notch. The plot keeps you on the edge of your seat, and keeps you hooked, forcing you to turn the page to read of the next mishap or discovery. Filled with fear, action, and intense situations, this book is a must read for the Crichton enthusiast or anyone else interested in killer sci-fi books."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is one of the few books I have actually read in only one day.

I may need to reorder as well."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. I think its interesting, scary, thought provoking, and over all good reading. I think the way the story is told from a analyitical point of veiw is brilliant. I thought the ending was terrible. Crichton cannot end a book to save his life, and this is no exception. (and the movie was SO AWFUL!!! for lack of a better word to truely express my discontent) However, this is still a great book so check it out if you haven't read it yet."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"i really liked this book. it shows the downside of human nature and how we act when given a &quot;power.&quot; the ending leaves you questioning, and makes you like &quot;what would i have done in that situation?&quot; although not his best, it is good. whatever you do, dont watch the movie. the movie is crap."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"i mostly love writing my reviews criticising others those who begin and end with one crichton book are simply closed minded no i don't think it was his best but not bad enough to be a first and last of crichton and not reading the book because of the movie? that shows someone clearly choosing to remain an ignoramus yes the movie was bad, read the book i am almost certain anyone would enjoy it much more a good read"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book gave me PURE AWE...it's unlike anything you've ever read...people over use the term a &quot;page-turner&quot;, but believe me, this book is just that. This book is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I've read nearly every book written by the author and rank this one as his second best work. &quot;Sphere&quot; combines an amazing number of solid, differing characters. In most novels of this genre, all of the characters come from similar backgrounds and fields of study. Crichton was ambitious enough, however, to combine professionals of many educations in the same context. The outcome is an impressive story of physics, mathmatics, psychology, biology, and science fiction. Oh, yeah . . . and an ending that will blow your mind (pay close attention to Beth in the final scene!)."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Hi! Me again! I love this book, but the ending could be a bit better, like.. wishing for world peace or sumpthin. Anyway, I read this one after Jurrasic Park and I was like: Wow! Why arent kids reading stuff like this instead of Animorphs and Goosebumps?"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book ROX! Read it now. Book needs to come with HOTbuttered popcorn. If you got work tommorow dont start reading it,because you wont stop!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book is an easy read, exciting book!!! It's about a newlydiscoverd phenomenon that was found on the ocean floor. They seem tobelieve that it's some kind of space craft that's been there for hundreds of years before time.

Best book I've everread! Crichton could have made up better characters."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book gets you really into it, you think you've got it; andthen BAM it turns you on your head! I've read them all and this isCrichton's best."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Crichton is the best writer ever! Spere keeps you on the edgeof your seat wondering what will happen next. It's mystery, horror,and science fiction combined. You can't put it down. It takes you to realms of your imagination that had been unexplored. It makes you wonder if it could actually happen. Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Most definitly, Crichton's best book to date and it was never even a feature film. It kept me turning pages with the mystery of the scenerio. The ship was the strangest added touch. A spaceship that crashed 300 years before it was discovered and is dated from the future is one of those topics (if written correctly) interests the hell out of me. The ending isn't what I expected initially but, the weird thing is they just wanted to forget, it wouldn't go away. He should make a sequel called &quot;Whatever&quot;"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is definately one of....if not the best Crichton novel to date. Keeps you hangin' on from the 1st to last page....the imagery in this book is unparalled, Crichton has one of the best imaginations ever!!...anywayz I would have given this book a perfect ten...only the ending was too tame for the rest of the book. Look for the movie....Christmas '97. Barry Levinson who directed Crichton's 'Disclosure' is doing this one too, and if he does as good as a job with 'Sphere' as he did w/ 'Disclosure' then Levinson has a life long fan here...but instead of Demi Moore we have Sharon Stone this time.....can't wait!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"SPHERE is Micheal Crichton's best work, ever!I have read most of Crichton's books and SPHEREis, by far, the most suspenseful and well thoughtout book he has written. If you want an endless,science fiction, page turner you must read SPHERE.Caution, this book causes insomnia. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I read about 4 of Michael Crichton books, and I think that all of his books are fantastik!But I especially liked sphere, becuase it combines Tech, with humor and future. Sometimes I would read 100 pages at once, I couldn't Stop!!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is the absolutely most greatest book in Crichton's history. I know where I'm going to spend MY Christmas. In the movies!Sphere PG-13 Christmas 1997"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is indescribable. I just finished the book and I appreciate Crichton's advanced, creative and imaginative thinking. However, unlike Timeline, the ending left me wanting an answer. Being a writer myself, I always know the part that a writer just assumes the reader will discover after some thought. Yet, the novel seems to want to stay ambiguious; you're mind is always searching for a concrete answer. Crichton refuses to give you one.Sphere transcends a &quot;sci-fi thriller&quot; that &quot;keeps you in suspense&quot;. It, unlike most else, makes you think. It also confuses the hell out of you, but (to quote my favorite Gladiator) &quot;Are you not entertained?&quot; People forget that Crichton isn't writing to answer long asked theological questions; he's writing to make you think and to entertain. After all those vanishing pages, I would answer a definitive yes."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I read this book this summer and I think it is his best to this day. A team of scientists set out to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean to examine a spaceship that crashed to the bottom three hundred years ago. There is the calm and wise Norman Johnson, the attractive and determined Beth Halperin, the brilliant and befuddling Harry Adams, and the smart yet annoying Ted Fielding, all under the command of Harold Barnes, a Captain in the U.S. Navy. They quickly gain access and discover the ship operational, and they discover a metallic sphere. But when they are cut off in a storm, they must discover the power of the sphere and confront its great powers. lest everyone get killed. I was genuinely sad when it ended. This book is Crichton's best and it is the best I have ever read, and I have read a lot of books. If you are looking for a white-knuckle ride to terror on the bottom of the ocean, this book is your ticket, and this review is your boarding call. Buy it today, because I guarantee you, you will want to re-read this one. Even if you aren't a fan of Crichton, pick this book up today and start reading. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"What an amazing experience to read! Easily Michel Crichton's best. He has outdone himself once again. When I first read Sphere, it took me only a day to read. Every character is so well defined and described. Being in Norman's mind an incredible experience in itself alone."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Michael Crichton has written some very good novels and happily this is one of them. When a crashed starship is found at the bottom of the ocean, over two hundred years old, a diverse and argumentative team is dispatched to survey it. On board they find a mysterious alien sphere, and soon afterwards things begin to go frighteningly wrong . . .Not only a chilling underwater fable, Sphere contains plenty of food for thought on the nature of alien life, human nature and the power of our own thoughts. Guaranteed to make you shudder - a great science fiction novel which is actually written in understandable English."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This Crichton novel is a science fiction tale in which an advanced vessel has been found on the ocean floor and apparently has been there for at least 300 years. Initially thought to be alien, it is soon discovered to be from Earth and from the future. A group of scientists are sent down to unravel the mystery which includes a discussion of black holes and time. However, a series of unusual events begin to occur. Are their minds being influenced by the unusual sphere they have uncovered? In fact, I would regard this novel as more of a mystery than science fiction (even though it is filled with science and technology); in fact, a mystery techno-thriller! As you can tell by most of the other reviews, many readers really enjoyed the story."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Whew...what a rush. That book was good. Very good. A little too good. I wasn't sure what the book was about when I picked it up, but I was already a fan of Crichton, so I thought I'd give it a whirl. Man. Crichton has one hell of an imagination. A party of scientists, 1,000 some-odd feet underwater looking at an abandoned spaceship almost 300 years old. Cool. But, although Crichton isn't the best at writing villians, the Sphere was the perfect villian, incredibly apathic, and you don't even know if the Sphere is alive or is even alien!!! The characters are a bit thin, but who cares?!?!?!?! There is enough tension between the characters to keep them interesting. Wonderful examples of &quot;you make one wrong move, and you're dead&quot; fill this book to the brim. Psychology, Biology, even Mathematics look appealing. The movie can't compare to the book, except for in acting power. Norman isn't the kind of guy you look at and say, &quot;he's a leader,&quot; but Crichton does a superb job of making a follower a leader. Minor characters die off too fast and you don't even know where they went, but that's a very minor hiccup. Crichton does a superb job of story-telling. And ,JERRY, man, is he creepy. You don't even know what he's about until Crichton tells you, which is a relief (you might get too tense). The death of Ted was very unexpected, which tells you this is a very unpredictable book. Little bits of humor soften the chilling blow of suspense. Go out and get it, all of you. It's a must-have."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Being a Crichton fan, I was very disappointed by this book. Crichton usually writes in a combination of theory and fact, which is what makes his books so interesting. However, this book is just way-out &quot;weird dream&quot; fiction. If you are a Stephen King fanatic, you may like this...it's just like Tommyknockers, only add an ocean. It was too unbeleivable to be enjoyable. It could have been made interesting if the alien object (the sphere) was the focus of the book, rather than the exploration team. Where did that thing come from then? What was it designed for? And, why? Who knows...in this book all that matters is the 3 member team left at the end of all the weird stuff!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I read this book years ago, and with the release of the movie, felt compelled to get a few extra copies to lend to friends prior to their running to see it. (Anyone who read Congo and then painfully spent money and time in a theater seeing it knows why I'm doing this). Crichton is not my favorite novelist to be sure, but he does have a way of advancing his plot, telling a story, and getting you involved as a reader with action (I've read 5 of his novels). This book is not an exception to my opinion but more the rule. I read slowly as a habit, but was unable to do this with this novel. I drank it in a weekend. From a science fiction point of view: no it's not on par with Asimov, Niven, Clark, or Gibson. Michael unfortunately does not labor us with the characters enough to give them full three dimensionality, in fact I've known people who couldn't associate with any of them, calling them cardboard representations of unlikeable people. The ending of this novel is controvertial. If you dare to read any or all of the negative reviews your peer readers have left on this page (I say dare because some of them feel compelled to insult those that disagree with them), you'll find most of them had major objections with this ending, and many make comment of Crichton's weak endings from other novels. So why do I join the ranks of the overwhelming majority of people that rate this book a 9 or a 10? As the story unfolded and plot points were reached, I found myself reacting: in fear, in anxiousness, in doubt, in eagerness to read on. This is a reaction to an art this is rarely reached. The story is truly gripping, we really do want to know what is happening next. Of all the reviews by friends and all the reviews listed here at AMAZON, only one person had difficulty picking the book up. Even that one person however got so caught up in the action, in the story, in the suspense that they also read it to completion in record time. Now having read the book in a whirlwind, we (the bug eyed, heart pounding, sweaty handed readers) cross a finish line that truly is a line. It's not drawn out, it comes quick, to many, too quick. What I implore is to not let the brevity become a betrayal. It's now your turn to think. Something happened, but what? Interanlize it, discuss it with friends, just don't let it go. If you do, you will be the disappointed few that do feel betrayed. It's easy for me to say those people &quot;missed something&quot;, especially after some of them insulted me for liking the novel. But I honestly believe that they may have missed something. One - we all have strong emotions in reaction to the ending. Many have positive, some have negative. If you have an emotion, why are you having it? Did Crichton just make you feel? Have you ever looked at a painting and cried, felt angry, lost? (I encourage you to go to more museums if you have not, or at least get some coaching on opening your mind). I don't deem to compare Crichton or his novel on par with Degas or Monet, but as a piece of art, Sphere made us all feel, some stronger than others. To those that so violently hated it: you have not wasted your time. This book stirred something in you, take a look at it. Beware, it may be something you don't like, especially if you reacted enough to write a treatise like me to an audience you'll never meet. Two - I loved the ending. I have an opinion of what happened, what the sphere was, how it got there, what really happened in the decompression chamber, and what that will mean to these characters going on. I did not have it immediately, but on pensing for days, weeks, years after the read. The fact that it made me think like it did while being so exciting while reading is why I rate it so high. It has some weaknesses so is not a 10 in my mind, but the long term effect it has had on me from a story-telling point of view makes Sphere one of my favorite novels. FYI - If you agree with me about Sphere, I encourage you to read these 10's on my list: Thomas Harris - Red Dragon and Black Sunday; Tom Clancy - Without Remorse"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"His worst book?, same plot as many other sci fi classics - humans encounter alien technology that makes their imagination come true, beware the dark side! Far better done by Stanislaus Lem.

You know what the strange thing is? READ IT! YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT!

It's better than any classic."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I really thought this was an excellent book"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is my first Crichton book and he has easilybecome my favorite author.

The plot isinteresting, and you never know what will happen next."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is easily the best book written by Crichton. I liked Jurassic Park, I was disappointed by Congo's plot but I liked it's technology, Terminal Man simply frightened me, and Andromeda Strain just left you feeling cheated but when Crichten wrote this book he had the neccessary plot, the needed charachters, the awesome technology, and a theme that blew me out of the water. I would definitely reccommend this book to any lover of Crichton, any loather of Crichten, and simply anyone who likes a good thought once in a while.

Read the book anyway. The concept is:In the south pacific or somewhere near it, a vessel is resting on the ocean floor. It has crash-landed in the ocean. A group of American scientists are then sent to investigate this vessel. That's all I can tell you. Michael's best.

I still think Crichton is one of the best!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Crichton has out done himself again. Five strangers are sent to an underwater habitat to investigate an unknown &quot;alien&quot; spaceship. The civilians of the group: Norman, Beth, Ted, and Harry, are very complex characters that are portrayed in a very simple way. While down in the habitat DH-8, they visit the spaceship. Inside, they find a perfectly polished sphere. Everybody in the group has an idea of what it is. Ted thinks that it is a trophy of some sort. Harry thinks that it was picked up on the travels of the ship, and Norman thinks that it is a door of somesort. During a routine day, the sphere opens, and that is when things go very wrong. The ending really tops off the book. Leaving the reader in shivers, the book ends the way that it ought to. Supspensful and very dangerous, this book is one of the best fiction novels I have ever read. Like all Crichton books, it leaves you wondering what if, and is very, very suspensful."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I bought this book because of the title and the description it had. First I started reading it with no enthusiasm and read to page 20 aprox., another day I read a bit more because the book was getting more interesting with every page (I read to page 70 aprox.), then a third day I read to page 250 aprox. and ended reading that day because it was two hours past midnight.

My conclusion is that the book will rise your hair and make you continue reading no matter the hour or how tired you are."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This was my third Crichton book that I've read and was honestly sitting on the shelf for a rainy day. Last week, I picked up Sphere and within a fraction of my normal reading time for a 300-400 page book, I was finished with Sphere and hoping for more!Michael Crichton leads you through the story without any break-points or useless information. He manages to make items like the Time/Space Continuim, Black Holes, Paradoxes and other intense scientific items easy to comprehend. Up until the last few pages, one did not know how the book would be resolved. Excellent writing! I highly recommend reading Sphere, especially if you have not seen the so-so movie version."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book was so great it is my favorite book! the story line is great teh characters are great!

I started to read this book because I heard it was going to be a cool movie. Once I started to read it I couldn't put it down.

The part where Norman needs to go to the sub and is walking all by himself on the ocean floor and when the giant squid attacked him made me sweat. I think after Crichton comes out with the prequal to Jurassic Park I think he should write the sequal to sphere. I thought the ending to this book was absolutly awesome and could leave the story open for a sequal.

What should we forget?&quot; ending, but halfway through it seems that Chrichton gets bored, and doesn't know where to go. What a waste of hours I spent reading this drivel."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Crichton writes &quot;blockbuster&quot; novels which handily translate to &quot;blockbuster&quot; movies. Lowest-common-denominator action pulp at its worst. It's not even good science fiction, which genre has a noted tendency to forgive some of the traditional demands of literature (character, style, plot) if the imaginative vistas are nice enough. But this one? Naw, baby, naw. I can't tell you how many times I've groaned in pain when I mention to someone that I read a lot of science fiction; three out of five immediately ask, &quot;Oh, do you like Michael Crichton?&quot; In a word, no.On the other hand, if you need something for a transatlantic flight, you might find this in the airport. As brain candy, it serves its purpose. Leave it in the john for the next guy."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Wow, what to say about this book. Well I forget. If you haven't yet read Sphere ignore that last statement. Sphere has everything you would expect from a book with such a title. It has a great sci-fi story that keeps you guessing and guessing, and I don't mean why am I reading this damn book guessing either. Sphere is such an excellent book that I would say without hesitation that Jay should read this book... right now. Hey I said right now. The Pepsi joke just killed me. Now thats great writing, but its the end of Sphere that is so forgetable. As a matter of fact this book is as forgetable as Jays mom, but hey that's just me. So if you are reading this review and just not sure if you should read this, than just stop reading now and buy this book. BUY THIS BOOK! Well there you go you gotta admit it, on a scale of one to ten, I give this book an A... Of course"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Actually, I have not read this book, but have seen the movie. Aside from that fact that the movie was unbelievably bad, as attested to by many of my fellow reviewers (wooden acting, ridiculous dialog, miscasting, etc), I was struck by one thing I haven't seen anyone else comment on.I'm referring to the similarity in plot to Shakespeares's &quot;The Tempest.&quot; The idea that our deepest fears, desires and insecurities can seep from our unconscious, gain life and manifest in the &quot;real&quot; world, where they create startling consequences, is integral to both plots. In fact, this same plot has been used in other sci-fi films before, most notably in &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; with Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis and Leslie Nielsen. Has anyone else out there noticed this?"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Very good book-- Keeps you on the edge as always with his books. He always keeps you on your toes!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere by Michael CrichtonIt was good, but seemed a little predictable after reading other Crichton books.I will read others however."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. Finished it in 7 days, it was that riveting! Details are precise, Characters are worth it, will literally keep you on the edge of your seat reading it!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"WHEN I READ THIS, I JUST COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN! I LITERALLY STAYED UP 'TIL 3 IN THE MORNING, FALLING ASLEEP ONLY TO GET NIGHTMARES, AND WAKING UP, WANTING TO READ MORE!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere by Michael Crichton was my most favorite books ever. It has a very intresting plot and a ausome climax. Alothought the movie was bad, the book was 10 times better! The story takes place in the atlantic ocean when some people find an over 300 year old space craft. Astronamers go inside to see what they can find and inside their is somthing still alive and evil. I hope you read the book and if you saw the movie and hated it like me, well the book is still the greatest!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Once you start reading this novel, you will not tolerate any interruption. Misterios and quite terrifying, the plot explodes into a gripping cllimax. The chilling atmosphere seemes so far-out yet so near as you read it with excited expectation. Most impressive and ingenious is the character of Harry."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I think that this book was resonably good.I am not much of a sci-fi reader, but I couldn't put this book down and finished it in 2 days.A little on the wild side, but should be a promising book to those who read it."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This was by far the best book I' have ever read. I loved the way everything is brought to life by Crichton's delicate pen. The movie doesn't do the book justice. I refused to let anyone talk to me during the last 30 pages or so. The suspense just builds and builds until you think it is about to end, and then it takes an unespected twist. It definately makes one think. Andromeda Strain was an excellent book that I've read a couple of times, but Sphere puts it to shame. What a Masterpeice!!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I don't know if Michael Crichton himself would stand up to be counted among the great minds of his generation. But he's there among them.This thriller is set at the bottom of the ocean in a &quot;deep-sat&quot; environment, where a typical bunch of misfits have been thrown together by the US Government. As the story progresses, more and more of the picture becomes clear until its climactic and horrifying resoloution.Except it's not that horrifying. And not that climactic, either. The charcters, while being relavtively interesting are not memorable. The plot covers both black holes and their infamous time-travel associations, plus the alread-mentioned undersea environment. And true to Crichton's professed beliefs, it even dabbles with the workings of the mind.Yet there is a feeling of dissatisfaction upon reading the last page. It doesn't have the same zip and enthusiasm that characterises his other works. It frequently drags. Overall, I think that the science has blinded him to the more important aspect: the story. He could have written this one in his sleep.Maybe he needed the money."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"One thousand feet below the surface of the South Pacific Ocean, the Navy discovered a spaceship of huge dimensions. Somehow it had crashed there with no damages and no crew. By the growth of coral, it is estimated to be at least three hundred years old.A crew is strategically selected to go below the surface and make contact with the alien ship. They arrive to find everything within the ship perfect for human life. Surprizingly, all buttons and instructions are written clearly out in English. The alien ship was not alien after all. It was American made. A three hundred year old American spaceship. If that is not incredible enough, the Sphere found inside the ship sure is. No one can seem to figure out how to open it. Once someone does, they find Horror escaping.***I can see how this made the movie screen. It is even better than his Jurassic Park...and much more believable.***"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"One of my absolute favorite books. Don't be fooled by the movie; in his novel Crichton mixes dazzling imagery, exciting science fiction, and fascinating ideas about humanity (just what is it that makes us so special?) into a quick-moving page-turner. The ending is absolute perfection. With plenty of plot twists and intriguing propositions, Sphere is sure to prove an extremely enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Many people seem to be dissapointed by Sphere. Don't listen to them. Sphere is top notch Michael Crichton writing and keeps you in suspense all the way through. If you've seen the film, read the book - your imagination makes the whole thing seem far more real, depite the fact that the film is pretty good (not the best). I would rate Sphere along with Jurassic Park and The Lost World (which is very good in novel, by the way) as this is definately one of the best misteries of all time, and writing."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"What can I say-this book overwhelmed me. I read it in a day and night. Maybe one of the most suspenseful, provocotive sci-fi-psychological books of all time. Impossible to put down. If you are a Crichton fan, YOU MUST read this. Better by far than Jurassic Park of The Lost World. The details and even the very essence of Crichton's writing are overwhelming. I have read 11 of his books, and this one is undoubtedly the best."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Deep in the heart of the ocean, the fears of human kind are manufactured, take home this book tonite and make it an amazon nite."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book is nothing but suprises as a combination between a who-dun-it and sci-fi thriller. When everyone thinks it is somebody, the blame goes to somebody else. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat but still in your submarine at the daring depth of 1000 feet with a time traveling american space ship parked under 8 meters of pacific corel for the last 300 years right outside your door. Everyone should read this book for non stop action and adventure!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"'SPHERE' is a horrorfying nightmare about a huge craft discovered resting on the bottem of the ocean. A group of scientists investigate the area immediately. They enter the craft with caution, and unleash a sleeping bloodbath, ready to come their way. Very engrossing. Boo ha ha ha!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book is packed with excitement! After I started reading this book, I couldn;t put it down!!! I honestly read it in 1 day! It is so exciting! I would definitely place this book among my personal top ten list. Anyone considering reading this book should read it! I promise you that you will love it just as much as I did!!!!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is clearly one of Crichton's best books. I have read it many times. The suspense is nonstop. I wish every book was this good!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"M.C is none other than a great sci-fiction writer and he's one of those writers who are in the 'best' catagory with A.C.Clerk. Jurassic Park, The Terminal Man,Congo,Sphere etc. are some of his marvalous creations.Also his books inspired me and my friend to write a sci-fiction short story and we won first place.Also I would take this chance to thank the great man. Your great admirers, Chamira &amp; Mahasen 11/07/1998"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"It was a fast moving book that managed to keep the mystery that before only movies could have. Despite what other people say I rather liked the end."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The only redeeming quality I was able to find in this book was the attention to detail that Crichton paid in compiling scientific information for this poor excuse for a novel. Aside from that, the characters were two-dimensional cardboard cutouts, which prevented me from having any sort of empathy with them at all. At the end of this novel, the biggest mystery I found was how I was able to finish this mediocre piece of garbage."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I love Michael Crichton. I have read nearly all of his books, and this stands out as one of his very best. For everybody that ever took interest in science, you will adore this book. I was sleepless for several nights after reading this book, exploring the possibilities. Even if you hate Sci-Fi, this book will be enormously entertainning because of the master storyteller in Crichton. This is a great book and I highly recommend it to every type of reader."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"this book will take you into Crichton's world...and it will not let you out till an hour after you read it...(it will take you that long to recover)...very good book."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Just read it. It has a great plot, and well, just read it@"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The book Sphere, by Micheal Crichton, had everything a reader wants. It had action, adventure, and side-of-ones-seat-suspence. It was a an awesome pageturner. A subject will not want to put in down. In the book, Norman comes of age by making large decisions. He must leave his friends if he wants to survive. He also must go into the @#@&amp;*! to survive and delete the past.Gutek and Tostevin gave two thumbs way way way way up!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is one of those books you can not put down, no matter how tired you are at 11:00 PM with work the next day. Crichton has the ability to easily explain time warps, black holes, matter/anti-matter and other conceptual ideas which can be so difficult to grasp. The psychological dynamics of the characters are finely described, so you don't get mere robots talking science to one another. There are personality conflicts, episodes of jealousy, love affairs, etc. The Sphere has the ability to manifest one's thoughts into material reality. The crew begins to abuse this privilege, which says a lot about the Human Condition. As all the other reviewers have said before, the movie stank. Don't see it."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I can't believe that no one else has reviewed this book! Has everyone been living under a rock? Or maybe the movie deterred Crichton fans from undergoing this one? Well, the readers are missing out, because this is his most fantastic story yet! Crichton takes you into the characters heads and makes you feel what they feel. What an adventure! And what a scare! VERY EXCELLENT BOOK!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I bought Sphere since it looked like a promising science fiction. It turned out to be one of the most astounding novels I have ever read. The decoding of an alien message and a conversation with Sphere itself reminded me of the parallels in Carl Sagan's epic: Contact. They are masterfully written, backed by the Crichton's sophisticated knowledge in psychology and computer algorisms. Sphere brings us much more than a thrilling entertainment; it repeatedly feeds us with the newest information in technology, while not omitting the fundamental elements of scientific methods: Yes, telepathy might be possible but we always have to ask for plausible reasoning based on confirming evidence.However punctilious Crichton might be, he is no professional cosmologist like Stephen Hawking. In explaining time travel, he suggests a future spaceship from earth passes through \\"blackholes\\" to get into parallel universes and travel through time when \\"wormholes\\" would have been the more relevant choice (when any object would be torn down into subatomic partials by a blackhole's super strong gravitation). Moreover, the ending of the novel doesn't brought conclusion to the unsolved mystery of neither the future spaceship, nor the sphere. Their significance to the advancement of human society was left ambiguous. Perhaps Crichton should write a sequel.Sphere is only the second Crichton book I read. Just a week ago, I picked up Disclosure mindlessly from my bibliophilic grandpa's 9-foot bookshelf just to kill some time. It was sitting beside a 1906 German Bible and a pile of ancient Japanese literature analogies. I didn't know why in the space-time continuum did such randomness take place, but increasingly, I discovered that Crichton was very enjoyable to read and there was always depth in every plot. I deeply recommended his books for novice airplane riders, skeptical psychologists, skeptical physicists, and professional poets."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Michael Crichton is really good at using time elements like jurrasic park and timeline again a novel about the connection between the past and the future he really knows to use the time and he gets advantage of the myst of these mix people who like dinos would like them present and more dangerous"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book begins when Norman, A psychologist, is called by the Navy for a very special project. So special, that the Navy doesn't tell Norman and a group of scientists what they think is really going on. The special group is sent underwater to spend a few days investigating a space craft. There the group finds a beautiful sphere.They are all dumbfounded about why the mysterious sphere is there. It doesn't seem to do anything.....At first. Crichton, once again writes another thrilling novel. &quot;Sphere&quot; keeps your attention, and makes you believe you are a part of it's world.With never a dull moment, you will absoutely love &quot;Sphere.&quot;"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This story has excellent technical details. The psychology tests information was great while the explanations on quantum theory were just brilliant. The effects of mind-control, how man has little control over his mind is also there. The plot is ok. After an interesting start, it peters out along the line. If you like sci-fi, psychology and techno-thrillers, go ahead and read it."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Excluding books that come in series (Wheel of Time, Lord of the Rings, etc.) this is the best book I've ever read. I've worn out my copy by re-reading it every year. I've just about got it memorized. It has so many surprises!! It has mystery, suspense, high-tech gadgets, psychology, and everything else (except romance, Crichton seems afraid of that subject). You get to the end and think, &quot;He'll never be able to end this book.&quot;, but then, WHAM!! The awesomest ending!! It doesn't seem so at first, but as you re-read it, you realize the ending is kind of ambiguous. The whole book keeps you on your toes. Who else could bring us giant squids, alien spheres, black holes, time travel, deadly jellyfish, and shrimp that have no stomachs? While the characters are sort of shallow, you have to love them. I love the scene where they argue over what order their names get announced on TV. I laugh every time I read it. And where else can you get an alien life form that tells a group of scientists, &quot;We'll be back after a word from our sponsors&quot;? You have to read this book. You'll love it!!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Since I thought I had been giving too many five-star reviews lately, I was somewhat determined to give Sphere four stars. However, I realized it would be an injustice to this great book.Sphere is the closest Michael Crichton has come to old-school science fiction. It is in the grand tradition of Arthur C. Clarke and his contemporaries: suspense, the not-quite-knowable yet seemingly real object, etc. This also has the best characters in all of Crichton's body of work and is complete with a semi-cliffhanger ending -- though you may not realize it."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book is my very favorite. Michael Crichton doesn't go on and on with info. like Congo. It is a page turner. I loved this book. Check it out for our self!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"&quot;Sphere&quot; is one of the best books I have ever read. It's incredibly entertaining, and even kind of educational. I read this long before the movie came out, and I was very disappointed by the movie. It was awful! But don't let that keep you from reading the book."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"if i hadn't read this book in the first place I wouldn't have gotten involved with Crichton's books at all! How could anyone not like this book? Call me mad you criticizers, but i didn't think there was a weak point in the entire story. Go Michael!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I just can't describe how good was that book. Tell are you friends to read it, it's worth the long and small-written 371-page books. Great thrills, great actions, great characters. In short, everything in this book is just great. One of the best..."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"While most of you were at home watching T.V., listening to the radio, or talking on the telephone, you were compleately unaware that someone, somewhere, had the ability to control every aspect of your life. Whether or not you would make the cheerleading, go to collage, or even just have a salad for lunch. This is all science fiction of course, but in Sphere, it is reality. In the middle of nowhere, a Naval operation is underway. A three million year old spacecraft is discovered miles under the ocean's surface. When they enter, they discover a strange spherical metalic object which they refer to as, &quot;the sphere.&quot; Soon, odd occurances take place. Jellyfish attacks, mutant marine life, and giant squid. After consulting a phycologist, the learn that these happenings are directly related to manifestation, or imagining something and having it appear in reality. Only one person can save or destroy the ship and crew. The problem, finding our who it is."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is such a good book, I loved it. I couldn't put it down. It is just sooooo good. I thought it was wonderful."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"its the best book i have ever read."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I'm a seventh grader. I loved this book every aspect. It was almost perfect. This time the flaw in this book is the ending; it was horrible. The book itself was great. It had lots of description and mystery. The characters were excelently played out and every page held suspense and kept you wanting to read on. The thing I like about this book is that it's one of those that is science fiction but has the extremely slight chance of happening in real life. The other thing I loved about this book is that you can go back and read it two or three times and always catch some thing new. One last thing, the movie; it was a disgrace."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I would recommend this book to any person who likes to read things about the supernatural. It had a lot of action and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole book. I also liked it because I really had to think about the ideas presented since Chrichton talked a lot about math and the sciences. In conclusion, I think this book is awesome!!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is truely one of the best books i ever read. I found myself getting up in the middle of the night to read it. It is well written and discriptive. A real page turner-read it if you havent you will love it."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Michael describes these charachters perfect for the theme of this book. Definetly one of his better books. The difference in charachters set an exciting plot with all there different professions and thoughts. A truly beautiful piece of work."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"A unexplained 300 year old ship was found in the bottom of the Pacific when a cable was being layed in the ocean. 5 people are sent down to explore. They go into the ship and find that it is supposedly from the future, with new technology. Signs of life were found in the ship, but no person was found. In a room, there is a huge sphere. Nobody knows whats in it or why it is there. Later on, a person figures out a way to get into the sphere, and whatever they dream comes to real life. Another person goes into the sphere, until all people have gone into it. whatever these people dream, comes true. 2 out of the 5 people die, and there is no way to go out because a Pacific Typhoone is right above them. They go into a emergency ship, and all agree to forget, so they dreamed they forgot about all that happened, and they did. The sphere dissappeared. People found them later on when the ships returned when the typhoone was gone."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is an excellent book, one of his best. I have read his other books and this is my favorite. I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I think that this book is the about the best one that I have ever read. It really keeps you coming back to read more because the plot really never ends. Once the chain of events is set in motion, the plot snowballs to the point that putting it down is no longer an option. And through out the entire book, Crichton keeps a strong sense of reality, so the plot stays solidly grounded in a down to earth manner. This book also depicts true human nature, which really makes you think about who you really are."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Michael Chrichton sure did come of big when he wrote this book. Sphere is an intense book with an extreme setting under the waters of the Pacific Ocean. It'll be hard to set this book down for you'll want to know what happens next!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Reading this, I could tell that Crichton loves big Hollywood movies, filled with young groovy scientists and lotsa shiny special effects. He also loves computers and high technology and space travel and the theory of general relativity. It's a pity then that he can't apply his mind's eye camera and grasp of all things technical to the writing of a decent sf novel - Sphere does has some intriguing ideas about time travel and alien life, but the execution is lousy - uneven pacing, one-dimensional characters and a conclusion that fizzles. If you think this is great literature, go back to reading pop-up books."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Micheal Crichton at his best! This book has excellent dialogue and storytelling. A must read!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The book was very well written, but the plot was a little advanced for the average reader. The way everything was the opposite of what it seemed often got more confusing then anything. but once it was over and everything was revealed it was a very well thought out and planned book."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is a really great novel. But the book is about more than a ship on the bottom of the ocean. It also a book within itself. The main character is a pchycologist, and made money doing tests on people, measuring their reactions. Elevator emergencies, &quot;dead&quot; airplane pilots. Then he finds himself in similar type situations... but this time it's real. This book is about the mind. I don't know how Michael Crichton managed to piece together such a perfect book. Sometimes I wonder if he wrote it backwards."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book is the best written book I have ever read. I can still se all the details of the book and I read it almost a year ago. I don't remember how much I enjoyed the story but the author created a wonderful picture and I could imagine everything. I think I liked it a lot because I read it for 15 hours striaght. I recomend it highly and you should look forward to reading it."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Michael Crichton is a master writer. I've never read a book this well written. The way he breaks it jup is just perfect. My favorite part of the book is &quot;The Monster&quot;. The best book on the market today. By far my most favorite of all his books. The way he arranges the group of people is pure genius. Harry, Beth, Levine, Ted, Norman, and Barnes. Master of novel writing. Best writer ever to walk this planet."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This was one of the best books by Michael Crichton I have read. Tense and exciting, it truly was a page-turner. I liked how Crichton brought out the psychology of every situation through his characters, making them real and dodging cliche. This book is a fast read with a very satisfying climax. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I will be short and to the point.I would have enjoyed this book much more if there hadn't been so much BAD(and I mean gratutious use of s*** word)language.The other problem I have with this book is that the ending is corny. Other than that,this book is well worth the 7+ dollars."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book is the best book I have ever read. It is exciting and mysterious at the same time. You can't put it down. If you're looking for a good time, read this book. Don't get it from the library, Buy It!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Michael Crichton is too good!!

Entertaining and educating at the same time -- like most of his other books."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I absolutely loved this book. The suspense, the mystery, the info. I can't believe people actually rated this book one and two stars. They said it to &quot;technical&quot;. Well, I'm twelve and I wasn't confused at all! I am also a big Chrichton fan, and I love all his books. A MUST READ BOOK!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is on of Crichton's best novels of his career. The movie is no comparison to this book."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book is a mind boggling thriller that catches you off guard. Crichton is one of the few writters that can actully make you think that such a fictional story really happened. It pulls you from reality and keeps you turning the pages. This book is a must read. The story is brillant, the writter is a genius, and the charicters are belivable. Once again Crichton has amazed me and out done himself!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This book was the best. Nothing could match it. Its science, suspense, action, everything is there. It's a little boring at first, but it picks up after the first 40 pages and leaves you stunned for the rest of the novel.

I am a huge Michael Crichton fan, I have read practically all of his books. He is by far my favorite author. I love anything Michael Crichton writes. But, Sphere is a favorite amoung favorites! This is by far the best book i've ever read! It deserves more than just a measly 5 stars! But, five stars is all they'll alow it. You have to read this book! YOU HAVE TO!!! Trust me, you won't regret it. I guarentee it. Just read Sphere, and be amazed."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I'm definitely in the minority here. While I love Michael Crichton's books, this was my least favorite.A team of experts from various fields are pulled together and assembled to investigate what appears to be an alien spacecraft on the bottom of the ocean. The plot thickens as several crew members mysteriously die, one at a time, before those who are left figure out that they are responsible. It is a suspenseful and riveting read.I just felt that sometimes it is a little too cerebral and far fetched, at the same time."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"As an avid SF fan I was disappointed to realize about two thirds of the way into the book that it was basically a mish-mash of the novel Solaris and the movie Forbidden Planet (with the Fruedian &quot;Id&quot; replaced with a Jungian &quot;shadow self&quot;).(spoilers)There were also some basic plot problems as well that bugged me. At several points the characters were worried that their habitat would run out of air or that it would be destroyed in another attack by the creature. Apparently they forgot that they were parked right next to a half mile long spacecraft that had survived over 300 years on the sea floor and was full of god knows how much breathable air!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The SPHERE's best recommendation is that it is still being read and reviewed 14 years after publication....here goes: Is it an accident that the author began his story with 10 characters, then whittled them down to the mandatory three? This ten-little-Indian story was so obviously \\"well made\\" that I saw it coming from the first death. The deaths got so frequent that when the main caretaker, Captain Barnes, disappeared the author never even bothered to explain the cause of death. He was just gone. Did anyone care? I know I didn't. What hurt the tale is that the demise of these poor seven buggers added an extra hundred pages .I gave my stars for Crichton's grapple with the unknown -- the powers conveyed to his three heroes when they dared to enter the sphere. The sphere was a new version of the genie in the bottle. Instead of rubbing three times one just visualized the door opening. The power of the mind to \\"manifest\\" material creatures out of the quantum foam is fascinating. The author's explanation that such power lies hidden within all of us leaves much to be added. The screwy ending of using the genie wish to forget everything that happened, also erasing the tapes, kinda' made the whole story irrelevant both to the story characters and to me, one reader. A cop out--big time. This is a modern fairy tale dressed in scientific garb. Nice try, but no cigar!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The Sphere (1987) is Michael Crichton's metaphor for his own mind. The novel preceded Travels (1989); Crichton's autobiographical work that attempted to explain himself and his beliefs. The plot of Sphere, the characters, the style, the action, the setting, the monsters, the technology, the science are all mostly irrelevant. Nevertheless, that's what people focus on. And that is Crichton's conclusion--that people, humans, do not want, and cannot, function effectively if they (we) truly engage the world as who we are. We are \\"Source Energy\\" to use the \\"Law of Attraction\\" terminology. We have the power to create worlds and are solely responsible for what happens to us by virtue of our thoughts; but \\" ... we simply aren't prepared to control our thoughts,\\" he says in The Lost World (1995). \\"We are directly responsible for any illness that happens to us,\\" Crichton said in Travels. Here is where things get very interesting.Crichton died in 2008 of cancer. He was 66. Cancer is said to be caused by: \\"Deep hurt. Longstanding resentment. Deep secret or grief eating away at the self. Carrying hatreds. \`What's the use.\\"' [Hay, Louise. (1982) Heal Your Body.] Before I go on, I want to be clear--I've read most of his work, like it, and have the greatest respect for him as a man and artist. He is the only person, only one, to have at the same time, the number one book, movie, and TV show. He's had books published posthumously. He was also married five times, and his latest child was born after he died. In other words ... he never stopped trying! I don't know what that speaks to--his character, the hopelessness of existence, or a failure to understand that which is true.Three things appear to me: 1) Michael Crichton was a genius (He was also six-foot nine. He was a freak physically and mentally is one way to look at him.); 2) He had disdain and resentment for people in general; 3) Being that abnormal makes life difficult, even if it produces for you millions of dollars and world-wide fame. In Sphere, he tries to reconcile all things in the final segment titled, \\"THE POWER.\\" He does this, essentially, by having conversations with himself under the guise of dialogue between characters, and finally with the Sphere itself - who (\\"I am not a who.\\") informs the protagonist, Psychologist Norman Johnson, that he, Johnson, already knows everything there is to know and that he already has the power to create anything he wants. What this is: Is a fictionalized version of the channeling of Abraham by Esther Hicks in all her books about the \\"Law of Attraction\\" (2004 - 2010); popularized by the book and DVD, The Secret (2006) by Australian Rhonda Byrne. Abraham is analogous to The Sphere. [The idea of a Law of Attraction, and that thoughts are manifested into reality, can be traced back to the New Thought Movement in late 19th Century America.]Johnson, not surprisingly, decides that people cannot handle The Power, and that the secret should remain a secret. So he, and Crichton's other characters, use their power (imagination) to erase the knowledge that they gained--that they can manifest reality by thought--and so forget everything that happened; and invent a false narrative and present it as truth.This novel delves into many of the issues I myself am struggling with regarding the Law of Attraction. Foremost is: That negativity is such a powerful force in one's mind it seems impossible to do what is directed by Abraham - that one choose the better feeling in any given moment. It seems so much easier to fall down the mineshaft than to imagine yourself ascending. To let go is to fall. To go with the flow is to follow the negativity. Look around. Being able to appreciate what looks like evil and ugliness is unnatural.Crichton might be right. In the novel, he approaches this with a conversation between Norman and Beth, a female Zoologist. Norman is explaining to Beth about The Power, about how one's thoughts are manifested, conscious or unconscious, so if one will focus on the good, positive thoughts - then they are what will happen. (Choose the better feeling.) Beth responds by saying that is impossible: \\"How can you say to someone, \`Don't think of a giant squid'? The minute you say that, they automatically think of the squid in the course of not to think of it.\\" \\"It's possible to control your thoughts.\\" Norman responds.Clearly (Really Mark?) Crichton struggled with this concept his entire adult life. (As am I. Are you cracking up, Mark? Of course not. I'm perfectly sane. Just because ... doesn't mean that ... .)The Law of Attraction states that: Wanted or unwanted - your dominant thoughts will be manifested. Crichton approaches this with a discussion about The Shadow--Jung's idea that the we are both what we desire and that which we don't desire. Our personality is both/and, not either or. We are both male and female, extraverted and introverted, thinking and feeling, courageous and cowardly ... though one facet is more dominant than the other within an individual, but to deny your shadow is to ask for trouble. (Ask and it is given. Hicks' first book.) Crichton articulates: To fear something, no matter that you might repress it, is to call it forth. The Law of Attraction concurs. Thus, Crichton has backed himself into a corner with no way out: (What's the use of living if his dominant thought is that people are stupid and nothing can change that.) His character, Norman Johnson, believes he has figured things out. Norman argues, to himself, that he acknowledges his unconscious, his shadow, and by so doing protects himself from manifesting his fears. Of course, that's a contradiction as Beth pointed out. By thinking about your dark side - the Universe will confirm it. Fear the giant squid and the creature appears. At one juncture, Norman and Beth attack one another.Beth mutters: \\"You're a real son of a bitch, Norman, do you know that? You feel so terrible that you need to make everybody else just as low as you are.\\"She was talking about herself, he thought.\\"You're so big on the unconscious, Norman. The unconscious this, the unconscious that. Jesus Christ, I'm sick of you. Your unconscious probably wants to kill us all, just because you want to kill yourself and you think everybody else should die with you.\\"He felt a shuddering chill. Beth, with her lack of self-esteem, her deep core self-hate ... saw herself as victim ... [and] failed to see how she had done it to herself, he thought. (p.321)Good stuff ... if I'm right.What are your dominant thoughts about yourself? Where do they come from? Crichton looks at this question through the mind of his protagonist Psychologist ... does childhood and biology decide, as Freud thought? Born introverted and neurotic -- then denigrated, humiliated, neglected ... Isolated, feeling alone, and that nobody cares about you - is it possible to have good thoughts about yourself? Or, has the damage been done and it irreversible? (Enter psychotherapy and/or drugs, and/or belief.)Crichton posits in Sphere, the only way out is to deny, or repress, The Power, your power. In effect, disempowering yourself and keeping everyone ignorant.Crichton's life and death are a testament to his genius and to ... I don't know - that he was right? He died for a cause? He says in The Lost World that humans are the only species that will die for a belief - which is a product of mind, which then becomes reality. Abraham says that a belief is just a thought you keep thinking. Keep thinking the thought and soon your belief manifests in the real world.Crichton says via \\"Source\\" in Sphere: ... \\"imagining is what makes it happen. You imagine wonderful things and you imagine terrible things, and you take no responsibility for the choice.\\"Norman responds in his mind: \\"But you are somebody different from me, separate. You are not me.\\"\\"Yes I am. You imagined me.\\"\\"Tell me more.\\"\\"There is no more.\\"Thus, with our love/hate relationship with oil, we called forth the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster. With our love/hate relationship with drugs - we assure increasing violence regarding the use of drugs. With our love/hate relationship with war - we assure its inevitability. With our love/hate relationship with wealth - we assure the continuous boom/bust cycle and widening gap between rich and poor. With our love/hate relationship with foreigners we guarantee xenophobia. Because we have the power to create whatever it is we want; but are more comfortable not accepting responsibility and blaming others, we think we can have our cake and eat it, too. The Law of Attraction says you may have your cake, eat it, and then bake another one.Another issue Crichton examines is what happens when two people have conflicting desires, or imaginings. What happens then? The Law of Attraction says take care of yourself, choose to feel better than you do at any moment; and choose to see only the best in others, and that then will manifest to the benefit of all. Everybody wins. Again, that is simply much easier said than done, or imagined. Fear and negativity creeps in, and tends to dominate. What if, what if, what if ... .One final comment, I watched the movie, Sphere - a waste of two dollars. The beauty of the written word versus a moving picture is: With words, one can slow down time, enough so as to examine all that is happening now, what has happened in the past, and what is imagined in the future.At least--Crichton was willing to look at the possibility that he might be culpable for his own cancer and powerless to prevent it."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"As the chopper nears its destination, Norman rests his head, not knowing what is lying ahead. Norman is a psychologist and is headed for an miraculous discovery or an alienated nightmare. This book \\"Sphere\\" by Michael Chrichton is exhilarating at even the calmest points like this.A business outside the government has unimaginable technology within their grasp. How they came across this is not in the book so u have to make up your own part of the book. I liked this because it added something out of my thoughts to be a part of the story. It makes you think about what you want to happen.After the sphere is found the power of vision is given to three explorers, Norman, Beth, and Harry. Will they find out how to use it or get pushed to the brink of destruction? This starts a conflict but Beth and Harry are workers aboard the ship so they should be able to find a way out of the mess Norman created. The power of vision is the power to create what you imagine.The crew is dead form an excruciating attack from a monster on the ocean floor. Norman thinks Harry is the cause but he really made the monster. He used his power to make it look like Harry did it and he also used his job to help. This is my favorite part of the book because the cause and effect keeps you reading on and on.\\"Sphere\\" shows a good sense of exploration because of traveling down to the ocean floor to study a new discovery. It also shows friendship. This is from how Beth, Harry, and Norman have to overcome problems to survive their conflict with the monster. If you want to see what happens to the three read \\"Sphere\\" by Michael Chrichton"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I had high hopes for this novel, never having read anything by Crichton before, but having heard such great things about his books from friends. In concept, I suppose Sphere appealed to me because it sounded like it had potential for making a statement about humanity as a whole, while at the same time making for a quick and entertaining read. Well, it did not make any kind of statement. For the most part, though, it delivered on the entertainment, but I was truly disappointed with the direction the book took about halfway through. Without spoiling any plot details, after the characters discover the sphere, the book unexpectedly turns into a kind of psychological \\"Twilight Zone\\"-esque thriller (cue theme music) that I wasn't expecting, nor really pleased with after it happened.When it came down to the final pages, I couldn't envision any way that the story could possibly come to a satisfying ending for me, and I was right. It didn't- in spite of the fact that a reviewer on the back cover is quoted as saying \\"the last ten pages are exactly what they should be.\\"Still, I wouldn't go so far as to say Sphere isn't worth reading. It definitely kept me turning the pages, but to be honest, wouldn't have held my interest if it had lasted much longer."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere by Michael Crichton is about the United States military having a secret project to figure out why there is a spacecraft dating from the future at the bottom of the sea. Mathematicians, biologists, psychologists, zoologists, and more go down to the bottom of the sea to figure out what this spacecraft does. Norman Johnson leads the exploration and through twists and turns they start to see the pieces of what the spacecraft is. As they look through the storage areas, they come across a sphere. You will never expect what happens after its discovered. This is a great book that will make you think about what happens next, but you will never guess what actually happens as Sphere takes you through twists and turns. I feel it's a Great Book."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Crichton has always frustraded me, writing 4/5 of a brilliant book, and then ending them with some miraculous event that makes the problem take care of itself. This book has the same problem as all of his other ones having the most unsatisfactory ending to a book that I can remember.What made me dislike this book is that it fails at what really makes his other novels work. Crichton's novels captivate the reader with easily understandable explainations and extrapalations of new high technology. While there are the usuall neat gadgets that he describes, this time he just didn't pick out anything that was really facinating.This novel is an attempts to be a Stephen King type action thriller, but comes up badly lacking when compared to better work of that genre. Stories such as these, are all about the characters and what they find out about themselves. All of the characters in this novel are so one-dimisional that the book becomes a second rate slasher book.THe only real use for this book is as a useless time killer."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is one of the best books I have read. the story takes you one way and then another. This sci-fi novel should be read by everybody.You'll notice somthing odd in the book. The beining wasn't what I expected but then the book gets very interesting. I couldn't put this book down. In the end you'll see its not what you expect.With this books written details you'll feel like your in the book with the characters. Like Isiad befor I think this novel sould be raed by everyone who likes sci-fi. And I bet you wont be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"When I read words from Michael Crichton, I can visualize them all. I imagine visually the entire story. His stories are technical and flowing. This book is highly recommended. I won't bother to tell you about the book because you should read without knowing to make it more exciting. This book is for techincal thinkers who can visualize."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I bought this novel a long while ago, knowing nothing more than that it was by the author of \\"Jurassic Park\\", which I enjoyed quite a lot. This is an equally fun and exciting novel, about a team of scientists living in an underwater base, while invesigating what they believe is an alien spacecraft. The truth may be shocking. The blurb on the back of the book says it should come with hot buttered popcorn and I think it deserves that much, since it is infinitely better than the 1998 film adaption, and one of Michael Crichton's best stories in general!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Michael Crichton's secret masterpiece. I don't think many people know about this one. The plotting/pacing developed in Andromeda Strain and Congo, reaches perfection here.This is a perfect engine. GREAT characters.Crichton gets knocked for his characterizations. I think because he builds them to service the plot, not themselves. The five main characters here are excellent.The action is spectacular.The codes, research, logic of the thing -- perfect. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I had read some more recent books by Michael Crichton. This one is very different. It is way more science fiction. It kept me reading way into the night. Just the setting of the book will draw you in... a habitat so far under water that the light from the sun does not reach. The lights on the habitat can only show a small distance and beyond that light is unknown... If you are a fan of sci-fi at all, read this book."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I read Sphere years ago and reread recently. It's a fun interesting book where you don't really know where it's headed. It does a great job on having the reader discover things along with the characters. It's hard for me to tell you what I liked about the alien-mysterious ship and creature without ruining the plot, but just let me say that I found it captivating even the second time around. Crichton's writing has never been Shakespeare, but it's not supposed to be either. His books really paved the way for the explosion of the science action genre. I'd recommend this to any sci-fi, action, or thriller fan, but this probably isn't the book for you if you're looking for deep characterization and literary skill."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I had never read science fiction before, but I found this book at a yard sale for twenty-five cents, and since I have always enjoyed the movie Jurassic Park, I decided to read one of Crichton's books. Once I started, I could not put it down. It is a story about the future, the present, and the complex nature of humanity.A group of investigators are sent underwater to the bottom of the ocean to determine the reason why a ship detected by the United States military has appeared. They suspect treachery from a rival country or somewhere else, and seek to find its purpose.Adventure and mystery abounds. If you want to find out about what happened, you will have to read it. The plot is not what you would expect, or maybe it is."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Book DescriptionWithin a space ship lying at the bottom of the sea, a mysterious sphere promises each of the main characters some personal reward: military might, professional prestige, power, and understanding. Trapped underwater with the sphere, the humans confront eerie and increasingly dangerous threats after communication with the alien object has been achieved. The story is exciting and loaded with scientific and psychological speculations that add interest at no cost to the action, including an intriguing sequence in which human and computer attempt to decode the alien communication. As the story races to an end, suspicions of evil-doing fall as many ways as in a detective novel.[...]A scientific thriller packed with plot twists galore that would keep you guessing the whole way through. Crichton shows his understanding of human nature with a diverse cast of characters whom all show expertise within technical fields. As always he keeps the techno jargon just out of reach of those without PhD's, however not allowing the reader to feel dumb. We enjoyed this novel immensely as a challenging, philosophical and sexy work of fiction."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is the best book I've ever read. They never say the exact area it takesPlace in do to national security, but you do know it's about 1000ft. under the sea in a small shelter called DH-8. You are introduced to the protagonist right away, Norman Johnson: psychologist, average-joe, a little past his prime, but strong willed all the same. He is called in by the military on a secret mission, and is sent into the abyss with about 7 other crewmates (scientists, officers, chefs, and biologists). Beth, and old friend of Norman, zoologist/marine chemist, is one of the few females in DH-8 and Harry, logician/mathematician, are the biggest assets to the mission including Norman.The biggest problem is the crash site; a large ship seems to have crashed in that area of the ocean. In fact that's why they were all called down there. What is it? How did it get there? At what time did it get there? Why is it there? All of these questions need answering.My personal favorite parts are the conversations with \\"JERRY,\\" he's witty but childish and a strange distant character. He's defiantly my favorite character. I would have liked to hear more about the militaries actions in this book but I don't mind too much. This book has a perfect balance of action, drama, suspense and mystery. I don't know who wouldn't like it, but if you're into sci-fi action or a good mystery with plot twists left and right than this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"In a way, very typical crichton. A good plot but a lot of unanswered questions. If you have a good imagination you may like this book even better, but if you like neat tight fitting stories, sphere left me with a few questions.

This should turn out to be a very good movie, there is no shortage of action, drama and tension."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"The movie was terrible, but this book is hands down my favorite still after 30 years of reading excellent books. Keeps you thinking all the way through."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sunday, July 09, 2006\\"Sphere\\" by Michael Crichton, 1987This is an interesting book. I started reading it because it seemed better than that J. A. Jance story I had brought with me.It has the distinction of having a psychologist as its hero. There are not too many science fiction books that even have psychologists in them, much less, as the hero. The best part of the story is the end: it makes so much sense and it was so obvious to start with. Then there is the inevitable what happens now that we all feel after a good story."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"I totally agree with some other reviewers. Interesting story, easy to read. Good. But characters are TOO apparent (or stereotypical?). I couldn't believe they were professional scientists or expert (even the navy peoples too). Being a scientist myself, they don't look like really trained scientific people. Just streotypical 'images' of scientists having many (stereotypical again) problems. Since I just finished it for the second time, I would say I enjoyed it but at many spots, I feel this was written somewhat amateurish. Maybe it was a mistake to read it with a book by Tom Clancy. Conslusion: Fascinating idea/story but a little disapointing writing.*BTW, can a man move or swim at 1000 feet deep? No the pressure problem?

Be on guard for mysterious events that may alter your perception of reality in this thriller. Crichton injects a fair amount of legitimate science (but unfortunately, along with the unrealistic picture of scuba diving at 1000 ft below sea level) into this intriguing story about the encounter between a team of scientists and an unseen alien named Jerry. Is Jerry a playful child or an entity with no understanding of human morality? How will anybody survive? This book is a must read and much better than the Sharon Stone/Dustin Hoffman movie."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Michael Crichton's Sphere is a very intense book. The book has many technical terms and abbreviations that could make it very difficult at times to read. The conversations between characters is very interesting and really makes you think and try to form your own ideas. There are times in the book when it is very boring do to the technical terms and explanations. Then once you get into the book it starts to get very interesting and the conversations start to make you think. The book is very descriptive, which helps you to picture the characters and the surroundings. At first I didn't like the book because I thought it was very difficult to read. When I got more into the book it really started to get me think and picturing what was going on. I thought the main character Dr. Norman Johnson, a psychologist, was a very interesting character through out the whole book. I think without this character in the book it wouldn't have been as good. The other characters have such different opinions through out the whole book that it really help to have this character in the book to kind of help sort out the differing opinions. Even with the boring parts I found in the end that I really enjoyed this book it really makes you think. You really don't know what is going to happen next with the book there are many different twist to keep you interested even if you think you know what is going on in the book in the end it could turn out totally different then what you expected."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This mixture of science fiction and horror is really a psychodrama, set 1000 feet below the ocean surface. A team of intrepid scientists is assembled by the US Navy to explore an alien spaceship found in the Pacific. Although we don't entirely solve the riddle about where the ship came from, we do find an incredible sphere inside it, which changes the lives of the scientists. Who can you trust? What is real and what is only imagined? What is reality? These are all questions thrust at our protagonist, an overweight psychologist struggling to keep pace with the other intellectual giants. This book should be made into a movie - not the one with Dustin Hoffman and Sharon Stone - but one faithful to the text. It keeps the reader's attention. Michael Crichton deserves kudos for doing his homework on it, as well. His scientific descriptions are believable, for the most part."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere is a non stop action thriller. Chricton's wonderful imagination goes all out. The book has a very suspensful plot. You want to keep reading and reading. The book starts out with the search for a crashed plan, but turns into something much different.

I was kind of dissapointed from watching the movie because I new the book would end the same, but still, the book was awesome, its nothing like the movie.

There are so many details that had to be worked out to make everything fit together.&quot;Sphere&quot; takes place at the bottom of the pacific ocean, where a spacecraft has been discovered.

I personally liked the movie, after watching the movie, I thought nothing of the book. Then not to long ago I came across the biook and decided to read it. Well it's not as fast paced as it say's it is. But that's okay, it's a mind twister, and it get's you to think, like when the *THING* starts to speak on the computer screens in a series of numbers as communication, you get the urge to figure it out yourself, (well I did).

But, unfortunately, it is like walking into a coffee shop with wonderful aromas only to have the promise of the aromas result in ordinary and somewhat dissapointing taste. He could have gone much further with this novel but seems, instead, to only want to play to the superficiality of the masses. His books seem somewhat formulaistic and predictable and he sometimes mistakes a confusing plot for great intellectual insight. But, what the heck, if someone makes it into a movie, it is going to be a best seller regardless of the quality of writing. That is an indictment not of Mr. Crichton but of the general public. Perhaps it is us who is wrong and it is Mr. Crichton who is correct by playing to an audience he knows well. By the way, if you thought the novel was bad, rest assured, the movie was even worse."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"This is probably the best book I have read in my life. Somepeople might have been disappointed by the ending, however, what didyou expect??? Crichton had no choice except to end that way or else the three survivors (Norman, Harry, and Beth) would have taken over the world with there 'humorous' manifestations. This would require a part two of the novel. Certaily this was the most ideal way to end the book. Try and think of an ending yourself and E-mail me if you have a better one. I would love to hear it. Finally, if you haven't read this book, READ it, it's definitely worth the time. I started reading \\"Sphere\\" late at night; around 2 am (big mistake). I was by myself at home in a semi dark room (bigger mistake). Let me tell you, I was going to pee on myself. I read very slowly so I could absorb every detail in the book.

This should turn out to be a very good movie, there is no shortage of action, drama and tension."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"... you have to read this! I never cared much for Crichton's flat characters but his stories and technical accuracy always kept me interested. This story is original and well written.

I think the book actually turned its own pages. The ending is everything it should be. On the surface, the ending may appear to be a let down, as it seemed to belittle the intire story, but by taking the plunge and giving us an ending that is such a shock to the system, Crichton adds something that sets this novel apart from other thriller-suspense novels. What better way to illustrate the enormous power of the Sphere? I wouldn't ask for the ending to be anything else. How many of us finished this book and just sat in our chair, silently saying &quot;wow&quot;?"},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Wow. This book is the best Science Fiction novel ever. H.G.

The beginning startsout smoothly, but at about the 100-page mark, wherethe characters first enter the spaceship, then ourcuriousity-and the book-takes off. The next day Iwas so gripped i woke up, turned on my light andread 200 pages, non-stop. The middle isextremely suspenseful, the tension is brilliant,and the climax is enthralling."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Suspensful science fiction that keeps the reader guessing at every turn. A crew sent to study a mysterious spacecraft found at the bottom of an ocean. The story got on a rather slow start, I felt, but it is actually the author's way of building up suspense, as the crew (as well as the reader ) is baffled at every event; from guessing what their mission is all about, to the entry into the spacecraft, to the discovery of the sphere, to the speculation of whether they are communicating with an alien or somebody from the future. The pace accelerated and the urge to solve the mystery kept me turning the pages. So would you if you are a science fiction buff. i would like to add that initially I was skeptical about the inclusion of a psychlogist as part of the crew, but author left no loose ends unexplained, as he showed that 'soft' science is just as important as 'hard' science when mankind is fighting against the unknown."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"Sphere can not be completely explained verbally.

I must agree with the fact put forward by so many, the ending was a little weak. However I didn't let it bother me hardly as much as anyone else. If the ending is sooo bad that nothing else in the book mattered, well, I must have missed something written between the lines. The plot is well developed and the moral definatly proven. And if the book is THAT bad, well, try writing your own ending. I's not quite as easy as you think.Thank you. B.A.F."},{"Title":"Sphere","review":"As my first Crichton book, it was pleasure to realize what this popular author had already offered to other readers. A good book. There story is semi-original, but facinating and intruiging. There were a couple of things that were not fully developed in the story, though. Namely the actual extent of power the Power really had upon the real world. If Norman really posessed this omnipotent power, why didn't he just imagine that none of the accidents had occured and imagine that all of them(the entire crew) was alive and well on board a cruiser. The Power was not fully developed. And neither was the story of the Future ship. What happened to the crew? Was there a crew? Perhaps Crichton didn't include that for fear it would only lure the concentration on the sphere away. But, it would have been fulfilling to know what the ship's story was. Also regarding the ship, at the end of the book, when they imagined all the knowledge of the sphere away, wouldn't the US government just find it again?

I'm not exactly sure what I expected from a novel written so long ago, but I was pleasantly surprised. Verne has a wry sense of humor that keeps this book rocketing along, while maintaining a (somewhat) serious tone at the same time. I thought I was in for a cheesy, unbeliveable story but found that Verne's work is so much more than that. Credited with beinng the father of science fiction, Verne lives up to the hype, especially when you consider that this was written around the time of the Civil War!

And that's what it really is, a masterpiece. Writing a good story doesn't need to have symbolism, satire, cariacature of modern people or place. It need only have the basic aspects of this book: Good story, feasible plot, interesting characters, and a vivid imagination.I am not a scientist, not in the least, and so I cannot make any disclaimer about scientific information as printed in the book (ie; is heat stored in the core of the planet vs. just in the crust, etc.) but from the time the Professor, his nephew, and Hans enter the volcano on Iceland, you *will* be hooked, because the manner of storytelling is very strong here. Every word printed comes to life in your mind as it would on the big screen. And when you go on that journey with them you will find treasures that you'll remember.

Becuase the story is told in a journal-like fashion, the action sequences are abridged somewhat; but there is still some excitement in this book. Though somewhat dated (many of the theories Verne relied on when writing his descriptions about the center of the Earth have since been disproven) this book is still an excellent read.

In the story, Professor Hardwigg and his nephew Harry discover an ancient parchment by an alchemist named Arne Saknussemm. They travel to Iceland and climb an extinct volcano called Sneffels. With them is the Icelandic hunter Hans. They journey into the center of the earth, in which Harry gets lost. They come upon and ocean and cross it. While they are on the sea they witness a battle of ancient sea monsters. Eventually they are thrown out of a volcano on Stromboli, an island in Italy. This was a wonderful book, but sometimes it went into great detail.This is a must read!(For the movie fans I must add that the movie follows only about 65% of the book narrative. And even though it is good, it will not give you the full story.)"},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Jules Verne is definitely the father and master of science fiction. In this book, he chronicles the adventures of a German professor, his nephew, and an Icelandic guide into the depths of the earth. When I read it, it was very different from what I expected. Having been exposed to various film and television versions of this story, I imagined some sort of drilling machine was involved. Also, I had thought that there was some interaction with primitive tribes in the underground realm.On reading this book, you'll discover a very different story. The professor buys and old book, and finds an ancient manuscript written by a famous alchemist in which the alchemist claims to have journeyed to the center of the Earth. The professor inspired by this claim rushes to Iceland to retrace the alchemist's footsteps. He drags his reluctant nephew along with him, and hires a guide in Iceland. These three men proceed to walk into the crater of a volcano, and they follow the empty lava tubes into the depths of the Earth. This is more of a survival story than anything else. They face shortages of food, water, light, and more. Verne really knows how to keep a story moving. For adventure fans, this is a great book to read!"},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"\\"Et quacumque viam dederit fortuna sequamur\\"\\"And whatever route fortune gives, we shall follow\\"This IS your great-great-great-grandfather's adventure story, so reader beware. There's a lot of walking, a lot of exposition, and quite frankly, not a lot of action. But keep in mind...this is an original. Our modern day sensibilities expect high action out of our adventure stories...monsters, critters, thrill-a-minute. But in a much different time when society was in a much different state, \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" set the table for the adventure/scifi stories of the future.The story revolves around German Professor and \\"Savant\\" Otto Lidenbrock, though is narrated by his nephew, Axel. The two come across a manuscript that references an Icelandic explorer's expedition to the center of the earth. Upon deciphering the document, Lidenbrock exclaims: \\"Let no one take it into his head before us to try and discover the center of the earth.\\" And off they go.While much of the middle third of the book reads like a travelogue of northern Europe and anthropological tour of Iceland, the driving force of the story is the eccentric genius of Professor Lidenbrock. The professor is characterized by a certain \\"madness\\", as described by Axel. This obsessiveness is a driving characteristic that one can see across the literary spectrum of those who break new ground. In fact, one can see it across the spectrum of real life explorers as well. For without a little \\"crazy\\", who might have the strength and fortitude to forge ahead almost heedless of circumstances. Without the single-minded obsession and force of will, how would humans be driven to the hearts of darkness that lie at the root of all discovery?Like modern science fiction, Verne delves into the 19th century equivalent of cutting edge science with much speculation on portable artificial light, and various natural sciences related to deep earth biology and geology. Whereas Michael Crichton turned the real science of the possibilities of cloning extinct dinosaurs, Verne speculates on evolution, and deep earth temperatures.I couldn't help but compare the early chapters of Jules Verne's \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" to H.G. Wells' \\"The Time Machine\\" or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's \\"The Lost World\\". They share a certain vibe in their respective late 19th/early 20th century writing style and tone. They're reminiscent, but different...\\"Journey\\" has much more of a sense of humor, and is particularly light-hearted during the early stage-setting scenes in Germany.I liked it. I didn't love it, but I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"As an avid reader of Jules Verne, I enjoyed reading this book very much. I am not much for reading alot of books, but when I do read he is the authur that I choose. I thought that Journey to the Center of the Earth like all of his books was very well writen and very well developed.I especially like these types of books because, they seem that they could actualy be real and certain places mentioned could actually exist. The book starts off with a young boy telling the story. His name is Harry and he lives in Hanburg with his uncle. His uncle's name is Professor Hardwigg. He is a professor of many different sciences like philosophy, chemistry, geology, mineralogy, and many other sciences. In the beginning of the book the Professor makes a discovery. His discovery is a small piece of paper that is called a Runic manuscript. The hard part was trying to figure out what langauge the paper was writen in, but once it was deciphered it appeared to have directions that lead to the center of the earth. So professor Hardwigg being the adventurer that he was, was ready to set off for Ireland, which is were the paper said to go first. Harry being only 13 had no choice in the matter but to go. They took a ten day trip on a boat to Ireland and when they got there, they were supposed to go to base of a mountain where there was a cave that they would enter that would lead them to the center of the earth. The cave seemed to go down and down forever where it lead them to the very depths of the earth. When they reached the center of the earth they came across a blue sky and an ocean. They built a raft to go across it and in the middle of crossing they ecountered two prehistoric monsters fighting around them. In the story they also encounter living fire. In the center of the earth any wrong step of wrong turn could lead to most certainly death or being trapped down there forever. To find out more details and what happens in the rest of the book, you will just have to read it for yourself.Like I mentioned before the reading experience of this book was very good. The characters were very well developed, because of the information given about them and also how they were used throughout the story. Professor Hardwigg for example was a great character because he was a very smart man, but also a great adventurer. In the book as soon as the professor figured out what the paper ment he was ready to begin the journey. Harry was another great and well developed character, because of the information that was given in the beginning. Also, who would have thought that a 13 year old boy could have cracked the code before his smart uncle, so he plays a great role in this story.The plot was very well developed and very well laid out. The story went step by step not leaving out anything and everything was very well explained. In the story they talked about having to learn to repel and in the story it told exactly how and why they did this.I would recommend this book to anyone with an open mind and to people that think that this could actualy happen.

An amazed and fascinated France eagerly awaited the weekly installments, as the unbounded genius of the young author captured the imagination of Europe and soon the world. Countless boys and even adults were inspired by Verne's ability to grasp the potential of inventions for the future, and to focus serious attention on hitherto unexplored regions of the earth (or beneath it, or the ocean), or over it. Obviously for such literary spotlighting of mankind's present and future endeavors, Verne required a new kind of hero--the Scientist, rather than the swashbuckling romantic of the Romantic era.JOURNEY is admittedly Verne's most improbable adventure, yet readers marvel at his detailed foresight in the provisons required, plus in his ability to insert theories of the earth's formation into the actual plot. Unlike most of Verne's protagonists, this one is neither French, English nor American but German. Young Axel is both orphaned nephew and student assistant to his brilliant geologist uncle, Professor Lidenbrock of Hamburg. When the latter discovers an ancient manuscript in an antiquarian book purchase, he becomes instantly obsessed with its translation and then with the passion to follow in the footsteps of a medieval Icelandic exlporer, Arne Saknussem.Axel is wary of such folly and argues the dangers, but the single-willed professor counters all scientific reasoning with a logic of his own, both before and during their arduous journey. With their stoic but resourceful guide, Hans, the three men undertake to seek the center of the earht, using the Icelandic volcano of Sneffels as their portal to mystery and danger. Is academic fame a sufficient lure for one, or mere weekly salary for another? Axel's own personality (often dreamng of his beloved cousin)undergoes a true metamorphosis as the result of months of hardship in the bowels of the earth. Still fresh almost 150 years later, this adventure tale is certain to entertain and enlighten. (Ignore subsequent movie versions with change the cast.)"},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"The Great Illustrated classics are great (no pun intended) Journey To The Center Of The Earth is so cool.

I have only seen the movie done a number of years ago by British actors so my review may be tainted. I very much enjoyed this Audio tape. Nimoy and deLancie are definately sci-fi favorites. I feel the portrail of Professor Lidenbrock was too harsh while at the same time the portrail of Axel was too weak. Professor Lidenbrock seem angry all the time rather than a curious scientist. Axel was afraid all the time and did nothing but wish to return to the surface. The music and sound effects added very much to the overall story and was done very well.

A short review is not necessarily a bad review if it leads you to a great novel. I've just noted the general theme. ThanksA group of adventures with an old map travel to Iceland and find a cave. They enter the cave and follow a path to the center of the earth, where they find an inner world of strange creatures. Just suspend your belief, and sit back an enjoy this wonderful tale. I experience it first as a movie way back in 1960. Later, I read the novel. Don't miss it.The concept of a hollow earth was not new in Jules Verne's day (mid-1800s). Its most prominent advocate was Capt. John Cleave Symmes, who advanced the theory in about 1818. Symmes was so convincing that in the 1820s he got twenty-five members of the United States Congress to vote to fund an expedition to the North Pole, where they would enter the center of the earth through a 4,000-mile-wide cavity in the earth.It was then believed that the Lost Tribes of Israel lived on the North Pole behind a wall of ice. This theory found its way into the revelations of Joseph Smith, who in the Book of Mormon and later, said that the Lost Tribes would break down the ice and return from the \\"north countries.\\"Also, check out \\"At the Earth's Core,\\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs.Land of Terror (Bison Frontiers of Imagination)"},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Verne's first true piece of Science Fiction (and one of the earliest of all that genre) is nothing less than fantastic. A short and simple story that will be enjoyed by readers of all ages, this is a 'Must Read' for all fans of science fiction. With a heavy dose of legitimate science, Verne gives this story a strong feel of authenticity that has been forgotten in much of today's SF novels. Verne's imaginary subterranean world reveals the powerful vision of the fantastic that he has become known for as a pioneer of SF. Richly detailed and certainly out of this world, Verne's creation has inspired science fiction writers and even scientists themselves for over one and a half centuries.The characters that people this novel are some of Verne's most unforgettable. The eccentric and reckless Professor Liedenbrock presents the stereotypical scientist obsessed with discovery even at the expense of safety and practicality. The stoic Hans represents the fearless devotion and calmness under fire that we still proscribe to the man's man frontiersman. And the frightened and pessimistic Axel provides the perfect reluctant hero. Each of these characters have helped shape the personas of innumerable other characters since their creation.A non-stop adventure to a fantastical world, this book remains one of my favorite in its genre. Its label as a young adult novel in unfortunate, in that people of all ages will find this one highly enjoyable. Exciting, amusing, thought-provoking, this book is not to be missed. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"When I was a kid, I used to read lot of Jules Verne. In those days I couldn't read neither English, nor French so I was destined to use translations which were few and of varying quality. Nevertheless, I think I'll always remember captain Nemo and his mysterious ship, his exile on the island and his death. Stories of Jules Verne always stirred my fantasy, and I guess that he should be blamed, together with Poe and Tolkien, for me entering the world of SF&F; and staying there for a long time.Today, I'm much more cynical, writer of literary criticism in my own language, somewhat versed in few branches of Theory, result of which is, however paradoxical that may sound, growing inability to read and enjoy books from my childhood memory. Only thing that I'm capable of is sort of a nostalgic remembrance, which overlooks the style of ages, straightforward ideology, and overpopmpousnes of Verne's work. And this is a bad thing, 'cause my intellect shows me the drawbacks of this book, but my memory says otherwise. Balancing those two, I'll give in to the memory and say that \\"Journey to the center of the Earth\\" is a fantastic novel of mysterious nature and adventuring in the dark. It is a part of Fantastic voyages series, written by Jules Verne, series that tried to explain geographical and topological characteristics of various places on Earth by using latest scientific discoveries and presenting them in form of a novel. To reader of today, Verne's style may be troublesome, and many a young reader because of it will probably put book aside not feeling drawn enough into it's story, and being attacked by the language of mid 19th century sure won't help in those feelings. Today, when modern fiction has covered almost every aspect of adventure, having in it's pages every imaginable mystery solved, written in contemporary language, it is hard to imagine someone willingly taking Verne's work and reading it (unless he also feels nostalgic or has a school paper to hand in). And you couldn't blame them for that. Strength of Verne's work comes from mystery and unknown, mainly of scientific nature (psychological readings of captain Nemo I should put aside for now), mysteries which are far better explained in contemporary prose, with greater ability in novel writing and various other things.Verne's time has passed and today we may only look upon him as a pioneer of SF adventure, or as a fond memory from our childhood. Sure, we could apply modern Theory on the text and see with what we'll come out, but in a long run it won't help. One can't fool the reader so easily.\\"Journey to the center of the Earth\\" will remain fond memory but nothing more than that."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Saw the movie with my son, then bought the book.

So am I."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"I bought this book for my 9 year old son and he really liked it."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"The book A Journey to the Center of the Earth, by Jules Verne has many different pros and cons. One of the pros of the book is that it sometimes has some explanations of difficult or important things. Another pro is that it is on a very interesting topic, which of course is going to the center of the earth. It has a few attention-grabbing parts as well. It is a very good book if you are interested in rocks and geology and science in general. But this book also has many cons. These cons outweigh the pros most of the time. An important one is that it gets very confusing. The main character is known by two names, either Harry or Henry. It makes it harder to understand what is going on. Another thing that makes it hard to understand is that Jules Verne's choice of words do not help the reader work out the actions taking place well. Another con, and probably the biggest one, is that sometimes it becomes quite boring because it is like reading a textbook with endless explanations of different types of rocks, theories, and scientific happenings. It is also repetitive because the narrator goes over the theory on how the earth formed several times. The ending was pretty disappointing as well. I would only recommend this book if you have a great interest in scientific theories or geology. It goes extensively through the different stages or the formation of the earth, the stages of evolution, about the different layers of the earth and how certain features below the earth's surface were created. If you aren't interested in that type of stuff you may find most parts of this book extremely boring. Overall I think this book was average despite of its many errors."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Over the decades, I have read \\"Journey ...\\" a few times.

I've always been a fan of sci-fi so if your like me dont miss out on this book by Jules Verne."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"A Jules Vernes classic, this is one of those novels that has stood up well against the test of time. True, there are some items that may seem a bit dated, and of course the whole scenario of the fantastic adventure to the depths of the earth is impossible. Yet, this novel is still a joy to read.With a stoic Icelander as their guide, a renowned professor and his reluctant and skeptical nephew descend into the depths of a volcano in the vast frozen tundra of the Arctic, as the adventurers attempt to retrace the steps of a renowned alchemist. Contrary to popular belief (and scientific reality), the party descends deeper into the bowels of the earth, which is remarkably of a mild climate and not a boiling inferno. I won't serve as spoiler, but sufficed to say, that they uncover vast new worlds and creatures living in the subterranean world hundreds of miles beneath the terrestrial crust of the earth.Vernes does attempt to make their descent seem plausible from a scientific standpoint. Their instruments, a crude electric light and others, would be considered state-of-the art for their time. Vernes also goes in great detail to describe the geological formations and fossilized remains contained in the earth. Vernes also attempts to explain how it is possible to travel so far under the surface of the earth without increased pressure harming the body. And if you take Verne's theories to heart (although modern science refutes them), their journey is plausible.However, I do have a couple minor gripes. Vernes goes into great detail describing fossils and rock formations, which no doubt lend scientific credence to his novel. Although this may interst a geologist or paleontologist, the rest of the masses (myself included) probably find this too tedious and distracting from the main story line. Also, there is one glaring scientific discrepancy with Vernes logic. During their rapid ascent (the details I won't reveal), the adventurers would have surely perished from decompression sickness (a.k.a., \\"the bends\\"). Although it was still a new phenomena at the time, I believe Vernes should have taken into account the rapid change in pressure, as he did during their slow descent into the abyss.The nitpicking aside, this is a superb novel that has withstood the test of time. A modern reader will no doubt be entertained and enthralled at Verne's vision of a subterranean world. Nearly a century and a half later, Vernes' works still inspire awe and imagination."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This book is great!

Okay, so you're not going to find many people that believe in the hollow earth theory these days, but who cares? It's easy to suspend your beliefs and just get caught up in the story. Admittedly, the discourses on geology can drag a little for some readers, while others may find it part of the 19th charm, it all comes down to preference. Personally, I love the 19th century \\"info dumps\\" it's an insight into how people saw the world at that time.

Cleverly worded, the novel grabs the readers attention from the beginning and doesn't let up until the end. Also Jules Verne's choice of plot scheme made the book a very enjoyable read. In this epic tale, A Greek professor finds a secret parchment stating that another scientist has been to the center of the earth. Taking on the adventure as a number one priority,He packs his things and literally drags his nephew with him to Iceland, where they are to begin their awesome journey. It seemed to me that everything that took place in the novel took place where it should have, one of the marks of a true author.Also, the novel was not rushed, which is one of the most common problem with adventure stories.

I myself like to have a journey to the crater of a volcano. One of the exciting story about volcanoes is this book. Though it is somewhat surealistic, Jules Verne was able to present a life-like story that is able to draw the readers' minds, as if as they were in the story themselves. Through his words, we can feel the beauty of the scenery in Iceland, the suspense and thrill of the characters' adventure, the imagination of the living creatures inside the earth, and the joy of the characters after their success in 'go down to the centre of the earth and back in three pieces (the Professor, Harry, and Hans)'.

The images that this conjures are just breathtaking and it's full of suspense and edge of your seat excitement. Verne just takes a painting, a masterpiece and depicts a massive underground ocean and a raging storm, all while in the center of the Earth. No, they don't actually make it all the way, but you root and you cheer, crossing your fingers, hoping they don't slip and fall.

Here is a timeline (that may contain spoilers) of my thoughts on the book.The beginning was epic. I was thinking, \\"Heck yea, I'm reading a classic that has dinosaurs, rocks, science, etc. I'm reading heavy stuff.\\"The start of the book was amazing. With Leidenbrock finding the code in the old book by A.S. and they make their way to Iceland. I especially loved the dealing with the code and the confusing and fear of Axel. Grauben sounds like such a doll.When they get to Iceland it was still kind of interesting. Axel has to deal with his fear of heights and I liked the idea of climbing the tower every day.Here is where the book starts to get a bit dull. From around page 60 to page 90 I call it Journey to the Center of Boredom. I don't need 30 pages to tell me they went here, stopped here, there was grey rock here, they stopped for the night there. Realistically, this is what would happen. Then again, I want to read a fictional novel, not a travel guide.Getting inside the mountain was quite clever. I specially liked the idea they had for rope. Their travels inside of the darkened hall was most excellent, but then, again, the book takes a turn for the worst. Magically they find a stream when they are about to die of thirst. And, as one reviewer said, they magically have enough stuff to be able to survive for so long. I mean honest to God, they are literally carrying hundreds of pounds EACH. Ladders, 400 feet of rope, 3 months supply of food, sleeping wear, medicine kits, rifles, 50 pounds of explosive powder, a torch, lanterns, that's just the beginning! Don't forget the compass, the 5+ different types of equipment they have to measure the temperature and their depths, etc. Then you have the books they carry to mark everything. It all starts to add up. And, keep in mind, they are walking around 90 leagues a day (a league, if you look it up, is around 3 miles). So they are wearing hundreds of pounds, going downhill, and walking so fast when the average person in a 12 hour period walks about 36 miles without wearing weight. Doesn't that seem a bit odd? And as for a gripe about the water, they started a stream they nicknamed the Hansbach that was a little trail of water that went downhill. They followed it and when they needed a drink they stopped and got from this stream. If you think about it, though, a little stream going downhill for even ONE mile would be SO polluted with sediment that it would make you sick to drink it.So they get into the interior of the Earth after the ungodly smart 16 year old narrator, Axel, has passed out about 3 times already. It's possible that life could, technically, survive down there. Plants CAN grow without sunlight.Perhaps it was because I saw the movie before I read the book, but I was disappointed that there were no T-rex's! I won't hold it against the book, though. What I WILL hold against it is that for a book so heavy with science, Verne should have known that these creatures would have evolved. In this book the fish didn't have eyes and there were mastadons. Technically that wouldn't happen. They would all become different over time.The last of the book was kind of a pain in the butt. I had this problem with the movie was well. They are on some type of floating device (the movie had a dinosaur skull, these guys had a raft) that, for some reason as they are going around 90 miles an hour with the water pushing them that fast, NEVER clip the side even a smidgen. Their floating device stays in the same position for literally a whole day in the book whether it's when they are being shoved at a high speed horizontally or through the geyser at the end. That doesn't fly with me. Not to mention, if they were shot out the top of the volcano on a raft that had been under intense heat and being weakened with water for hours, they would have been decimated as they hit the ground. How does Verne get past this? They are going up, up, up, all of a sudden Axel wakes up outside with Hans over him. They landed.The writing in this book is absolutely excellent, but I am asked to believe just too much for this story to be real. It's a great book if you want to stretch your imagination so much that it will leave marks, but not for a reader of fiction that wants realistic fiction.John McAdamEnoch and the ExtraterrestrialsAreothWesth: Sun Thieves (Areoth Adventure)"},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This is better than any movie version I've ever seen or will probably seen.

And come to think of it, there is yet another world miles under our feet!The story is narrated in very simple way with very few scientific details and terminologies used unlike '20,000 leagues under the sea' by the same author, where he used so many of complex marine terms that a person not familiar with them get frustrated.A good adventure book just like rest from Jules Verne.

This book is filled with action and adventure. There is not more than two chapters that go by without a major event occuring.

The crossing of a wide sea, with a stone ceiling as sky, and pre-historic monsters fighting to death, is terrific. This is a wonderful book of adventures. The reader will find all sorts of surprises and vivid descriptions."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"I found this book to be dissatisfying. Joseph Campbell speaks of the Hero Cycle involving many things, such as a dismemberment or crucifixion being associated with the threshold crossing. As the trio enters the volcano, there is nothing horrendous about their passage. There is no \\"elixir theft,\\" although Arne Saknusemm's dagger could have fit the bill. Lastly, there is no real character development. You have the clash and tension between Harry and the Professor: young-old, scientist-novice, driven-reluctant. But there is not enough to drive the story, and no enchantment.There are some mythic elements, but they seem a bit haphazard. They exit the earth, the \\"belly of the whale,\\" by way of a torrent and lava, the Masonic fire and water trial. IT pushes them out and up, in a mock rebirth. Then they land in paradisiacal Italy, contrasting with cold and dead Iceland. This is the motif of a \\"sacred grove,\\" but it is never utilized fully.Furthermore, there are some structural problems. Specially, Verne has two backtracks. The first is in Chapter 18, when they take the wrong road, and then Chapter 33, with the storm blowing the raft back to the starting point. Aesthetically, this is wonderful parallelism, but by the time you get to the discovery and the back track, you feel cheated. All the reading you have done up to that point was pointless.The ending is rushed, and the denouement seems like a slipknot at times. I would have preferred a bit drawn out enduing and the possibility of a sequel. After all, who is Arne Saknusemm, and is there more to mysterious and even Christic figure? He is a Buddha, an enlightened one who leads the way for other to follow as they go through the underworld that is middle earth.It is Verne's second book, so he is still in the process of becoming \\"Verne\\" or the icon we have depicted in \\"Back To The Future III.\\" Despite my criticism, you do see the wonderful characters and Technicolor and three-dimensional scientists at work. They are not the flat logic boxes or computing machines, like Sherlock Holmes, or the campy \\"Professor\\" cutout character on bad TV programming.Vern can spin a yarn, and mix enough technical scientific detail to make it believable. I am not familiar with Verne's scientific background, but he understands that science is merely part of the backdrop to any science fiction story.Leonard Nemoy's afterward in the Signature Books Edition (0451528964) is worth reading. He does an analysis between the father-son relationship of Harry and th Professor. He caught things that I had missed, in my frustration of the backtracking problems.

So much of it spent in the bickering between the professor and his nephew, and the \\"science\\" part of the science fiction really seems to be missing in most places. And I just flat out didn't like the reader for the audiobook. I go through a lot of audiobooks, and I consider this to be one of the worst I've listened to."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"A lumbering read, alot of talk about the ground. Three characters, one is monosybolic, one is TOTALLY commited and the first person account whines all the time. He wants to hook-up with his cousin. Hmmm. A read to say you have read it."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"One thing I did not realize about the book Journey to the Center of the Earth was that it was originally written in French by Jules Verne. This book is my first reading of any of his works, and after reading Journey to the Center of the Earth, I am somewhat apprehensive but feel confident in reading more of his other books. The story of Journey to the Center of the Earth is started out beautifully &agrave; la in the prose of John Steinbeck, and I thought I was going to be taken on a great ride. Somehow, I was getting more disappointed as the more I got to know to Professor Lidenbrock, who of course influenced the creation of the Doc character from Back to the Future, because he is such a hard-headed a-hole. I just didn't like the one-dimensional mindedness that he carries along with his absolute pedantic method that makes me want to punch his nose every time he goes on his \\"I am right, and you are wrong\\" argument. Therefore, I felt sorry for the nephew who had to put up with him. In the meanwhile, the journey to the center of the earth begins in Iceland which influenced me greatly to look up the internet the history of the country and the pictures, so anytime I think of the book, Iceland will come to my mind, or vice-versa. Of course, the feeling of the adventurous trip is much akin to Indiana Jones movies except the sacrilegious fourth part. Before that journey was embarked, I just can't help but feel how utterly stupid the idea is and the nonsensical undertaking is. Then again, I have to remind myself that the book is purely science fiction. I want to make two points of mention from early chapters of the book. The nephew is right in calculating the number of combinations twenty letters can make but only twenty distinct (no repeats) letters. How the math is done is that it is 20 times 19 times 18 times 17 times...3 times 2 times 1 letters (multiplication format, as I mean). Actually, this is not a combination but rather a permutation. So, that's a small change in the wording but a big difference because the ordering of the words does not matter at all during combinations yet the nephew is concerned about putting the words in an order which is exactly the definition of permutation. The next point which I think the uncle made a serious error when it came to calculating the temperature of the center of the earth. He said that the radius of the earth is over 4,000 miles and to go to the center, it takes one degree for every seventy feet below. In end, he calculated the temperature of the center to be over two million degrees. Whether that is in Centigrade, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin, he doesn't say. There are 5,280 feet in a mile, so in 4,000 miles, we have 2.1 x 10^7 feet (or 21 billion feet) and then to divide that by 70 feet, we get 301,714 degrees. If that is in Centigrade, then it is 543,117 degrees Fahrenheit. If it's the other way, then it is 167,601 degrees Celsius and also 167,874 Kelvins. So, the uncle is wrong, wrong, wrong! Of course, he goes further with more techno babble elsewhere in the book that I can't really say if he is right or not because I have zero expertise in geology. In short, a guy like Andy Dufresne would immensely enjoy reading Journey to the Center of the Earth, and I wouldn't be surprised at all if that book influenced him to take up geology. On a second thought, as for myself, I think I will do so the same and credit the book for sparking my interest. As for the reading of the adventure to the end, I think Jules Verne has really captured my attention because of the rush and tension that came with the journey, but too bad that every chapter was spoiled by its heading. For example, Chapter 22 is the search of water, and the next Chapter kills the suspense with its heading \\"We Find Water.\\" Another is Chapter 28 where the nephew is in the dark the whole time and is completely lost and I wonder if he gets rescued. The next two chapters come with the heading \\"I Hear Voices\\" and \\"Saved.\\" Hey...thanks a lot...way to go...lovely....really lovely. Of course, during the trip, I can't stand the uncle and was dying to finish the book and be done with it because of him. All in all, Journey to the Center of the Earth is a great read that is suitable for all ages although a great deal of suspension of disbelief is required, and I only ask for the uncle to be replaced with somebody else with a better personality."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This book was the equivalent of a 3D movie in the 1800's, meaning it had virtually no plot, but lots of visual effects.

While some people like this kind of writing, I certainly didn't."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"The book Journey the the Centre of the Earth was not as good as I had expected it to be considering that the other novels that Jules Verne has written have been better. In my view, I would have to say that there was too much science terms and in doing so it made things extremely confusing. I would definetly never reccomend this book to anyone unless they really like science novels. I think that the book described things a little fully and at a point I was bored. I only found about three pages that actually engrossed me into the book. There was a beginning middle and an end but the middle was very long. There was no lesson learned in the story therefore not alot of meaning.

I think we owe it to this brilliant man to at least read his books the way he intended them!"},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"For those interested in the history of science fiction, it can be debated as to who wrote the first science fiction story. My personal choice has always been Mary Shelley who wrote Frankenstein, but others have argued for Poe or others. Then there are Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, who were more-or-less the first true science fiction authors, that is, authors who really wrote in that genre.Verne predates Wells, but I still can see argument for Wells being given priority. Wells seems to have done more to give the genre definition; Wells is more interested in using the fiction to speculate about the future and the nature of man. Verne, on the other hand, uses science more for a plot device to tell adventure stories. Probably it's impossible to ever settle the matter, but the way I see it, Wells was the deeper thinker, but Verne was the more entertaining writer.Journey to the Center of the Earth is a typical Verne story. In it, the narrator Axel relates the story of an adventure with his uncle and guardian, the esteemed Professor Otto Lidenbrock. Lidenbrock has stumbled upon an old parchment, which when translated, tells of a passage to the center of the Earth through a volcano in Iceland. Axel, well-educated himself, is more skeptical than his obsessed uncle, but is compelled to go along (it doesn't help when Axel's fiancee thinks the journey is a good idea.The bulk of the novel deals with the trip to Iceland (where they pick up an assistant, Hans), then to the extinct volcano, and finally into the bowels of the Earth. What they find there defies their expectations, and I won't spoil any of the fun by revealing it.Like other Verne tales I have read, this one is written with a light touch and is an easy read (Wells is a bit more inconsistent in this regard). Compared with today's works, this is pretty tame and simple, but for its time, it must have been a lot of fun. In fact, it's still pretty entertaining, and if you're a science fiction fan, this is a good look at one of the early works in the field."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"First, let me say, try to get your hands on the \\"complete unabridged\\" translation of this novel, since there are several apocryphal (i.e., abridged) translations, which are more like adaptations than faithful renderings of the French.The Deus ex Machina at the end is a bit cheesy--how in the world could three men on a raft survive a volcanic gunshot to the Earth's surface? But the novel, with its abundance of real science (of that era), always made me want to turn the page, even if it took ninety of those pages just to begin their descent, and just over a hundred more for them to enter the subterraneous world of giant mushrooms, prehistoric reptiles, and colossal troglodytes who herd mastodons (I wonder, is it for their meat, their milk, or both?). The novel ends abruptly: instead of making contact with the Ape Gigans, the men skedaddle topside. I wish Verne would would have (also) written the Saknussemm account of the journey, it would have been fascinating. But he didn't. A great read, but 20,000 Leagues is his all-time best, probably because Nemo is really a shadow of Verne."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This was an entertaining read, but kind of ridiculous, and ultimately not very satisfying. The main premise of the book is that there exists an entrance (through a volcano) into the depths of the Earth, that leads to an entire subterranean world. When the book was written, I believe this was considered - if not plausible - at least a possibility. And that's fine. Even today, the deepest hole ever drilled is only 7.6 miles deep, and we know surprisingly little about what lies beneath the Earth's crust. So I'm on board with ignoring the inconvenient matter of geothermal heat. You want me to imagine a subterranean world? No problem; I'm happy to suspend disbelief.But then Verne goes and botches all the details that needn't have been botched! His protagonists go without water for seven days, while wandering through underground passages. They get thirsty - yes - but they still have energy enough to chip through a foot of granite with a pick axe and a crowbar. Reaching a subterranean ocean, they build a raft out of a few logs, and sail it through a veritable gale, without the craft falling apart, and without losing any of their provisions. Later, they ride this raft at 120 miles per hour as it first descends and then ascends through a giant hole in the earth. And eventually, they are blown out of the top of an active volcano, whence upon they casually walk away from the flowing streams of lava.I am an evangelist for what I call \\"realism in fantasy\\". My opinion is that a good story requires consistency. In this case, Verne wants us to imagine that the world we live in contains a hitherto unexplored land beneath its surface. Cool! But in the real world people need water. People can't chip through 1 foot of granite with a pick axe. And people do not ride rafts through storms on oceans. The alternative that we are left with, then, is that the world Verne describes is *not* the real world...which of course ruins the magic of imagining that it is. I think this could have been a great book. Instead, Verne misses the mark by a mile."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"I grew up on the James Mason movie, \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" (1959), so it was quite a shocker to read the book. You could imagine to my dismay the absents of quite a few characters and the center of the story is Germany not Scotland.Now for avid readers you could care less about old movies, I can truthfully say that this is one of Jules Verne's best stories and well told.What you will find more interesting and fun about this tale is the characters and their interaction. One of my favorite parts is when Harry who did not want to go to the center of the earth with his uncle, Professor Hardwigg; he turned to his affianced, Gretchen, and was planning on her to stop him. Her answer is shockingly disappointing to him.\\"While there is life there is hope. I beg to assert, Henry, that as long as man's heart beats, as long as man's flesh quivers, I do not allow that being gifted with thought and will can allow himself to despair\\"Be prepared as the bulk of the book is really a geological journey back through time and forward again painfully spelled out by Harry whom is the first person narrator.The Kindle version does not have actual picture of the runes in chapter 1. Moreover, a tad off on pronunciations. Other than that, it is more than worth obtaining along with a hard copy for your library.Journey to the Center of the Earth"},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This short book is one of the founding classics of science fiction literature. It details the story of a German scientist who comes across a map to a place that leads inside the Earth. He puts together a crew, and of they go to Iceland to find the volcano that serves as the entrance. From there, he and his crew journey into the Earth and encounter environments with their own plants, animals, geography and weather. They collect samples, evade dangers, and have hair-raising adventures. The group travels back to the Earth's surface, but lose much of the samples to prove their trip.The book moves along quite quickly, and has fewer dinosaurs and other animals than seen in the various movie versions. Instead, the book focuses more on the internal dynamics of the group, and how they react to their discoveries, and to each other. All in all, a book that is easily read in a couple of hours, and more worth the time than watching any of the movies."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"When Professor von Hardwigg discovers an ancient parchment suggesting a journey to the center of the Earth is possible, he wastes no time dragooning his dubious nephew and ward, Harry, into an expedition, first to Iceland, and then into the Earth. Harry, a young man, sees no good that can come of this expedition, but dutifully agrees.So begins one of the most beloved classics of science fiction ever published, Jules Verne's \\"A Journey to the Center of the Earth\\". I'm hardly a Verne expert, but I've read many of his other classics. \\"Journey\\" is unique among his work. It's one of the few books to feature a first person narrator in the form of Harry. Moreover, unlike his other books, \\"Journey\\" is less grounded in science and more interested in the fantastic. Verne, through his various characters, slyly implores his readers' indulgence, reminding us that there is plenty about the center of the world we don't know.Verne was an author who dealt in archetypal characters. From \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Seas\\" on, Verne generally concentrated on three types of characters as his protagonists: the brilliant and calm professor; the professor's loyal apprentice, and; the non-scientific, cantankerous, pragmatic, but steadfast man of action. Here, Verne mixes and matches these traits, making for a more interesting cast. Hardwigg is a brilliant scientist, but he's also a ball of barely restrained emotion and energy, demanding his fellow travelers press on, perhaps beyond all reason. The man of action, the Icelandic Hans, is loyal, but by no means cantankerous. He simply does what must be done, and is steadfastly loyalt. Finally, Harry, rather than the unquestioning apprentice, is quite skeptical of this expedition. Hardly steadfast, he proves to be quite cowardly and panics at inopportune times. Thus, with these interesting characters in the mix, the plot of the novel proves frequently unpredictable.While the premise is fantastic, the action of the novel is far less concerned with monsters that might be found at the center of the earth than the more realistic, albeit more mundane, threats of natural disaster. Rather than being chased by dinosaurs or hidden cave-men, our heroes must deal with being lost, the threat of starvation, underground lakes, exhaustion, and exposure. Naturally, just as all hope seems lost for our heroes, fortune takes a hand. Obviously, if Harry is narrating, they probably get out okay. Still, there are some moments of true white knuckle tension, as Harry is lost in the caverns, or the trio finds itself on a raft with only a piece of jerky as their food-supply.Wisely, Verne lets the scientific explanations he used as the basis of his other novels go here. He's less interested in giving his reader an education in the latest discovery, and concentrates instead on a great rip-roaring read. Admittedly, the conventions of Victorian-era fiction don't always allow the book to rip or roar. The first third of the book is actually dedicated to getting Harry and the Professor to Iceland and recruiting an expedition. It's more of a travelogue than an adventure tale, which makes the book more realistic, although not consistently exciting. Once our heroes are underground, however, the book takes off.In the grand scheme of things, \\"A Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" is probably not my favorite Verne book. It lacks a remarkable character, like Captain Nemo. It also lacks some of the sharper satire Verne brought to his other books, like \\"From the Earth to the Moon.\\" It doesn't quite have the pacing of \\"Around the World in 80 Days.\\" Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable and charming read, and certainly has earned its place among the classics."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"I absolutely loved this story.

Very good read!"},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Journey to the Center of the Earth (Optimized for Kindle)First let me say that I read a lot of the reviews on Journey To The Center Of The Earth, by Jules Verne, the free editions and found them somewhat disturbing because a lot of people complained. Some said names were changed from the original and such to make it easier to read. From what I understand Jules Verne did not write in english. Everything he wrote has to be translated to english, therefore my decision to buy the optimized for Kindle edition. I do not regret this decision. Heck for a buck it is well worth it.If you're going to get a free edition you really have no right to complain about the translation or whatever you feel is messed up. Stop being so cheap and spend a buck.I would have gladly spent up to six bucks for this.Verne wrote as all other Victorian era writers did. There is a deep sense of propriety, of the customs and manners of a very polite society- even though that society probably never really exisited. Todays novelists would never get a way with this. But for the era it worked well.This is the first time I read any of Verne's works. Yes, I've seen the movies. But never read any of his books either in school or as an adult. And let me say that I am astonished at how much the movies really vary from the original written work. Even the one from the 1950's (if I have the decade wrong, so what?) starring Pat Boone. I figured that one has to be somewhat close to the book. But no.The first thing that stands out to me is that in the book there is no woman that goes on the trip with them. Yes, I understand script writers have to have liberty to change things to make it work better for the screen.But I'm not going to waste time pointing out the differences. I'll probably forget to mention something and upset somebody...At times I thought the writing was a bit slow or boring and overly proper. This is why I give it 3 stars.There are other times that are exciting like when Hans, Professor Von Hardwigg and Harry are on the raft in the interior of the earth. Or when Harry became separated from Hans and the professor and was lost.The story is written from the first person perspective of Harry, Von Hardwigg's nephew. This, combined with Verne's high sense of propriety (in my opinion) sometimes makes it hard to stay with it. But I'm glad I did. I can finally say I've read Jules Verne.I am going to buy and read other works from Jules Verne hopefully optimized for Kindle.

Now, as someone well into middle age, I thought it timely to catch up with a classic.Jules Verne has written a book which, in my mind, is almost of the \\"boys' own\\" genre. The story is very far fetched. Indeed, too far fetched. An old manuscript is located which, when deciphered tells of a portal to the centre of the world. An extinct volcano in Iceland leads three explorers, Professor Hartwigg, his nephew, Harry, and their local Icelandic guide, the phlegmatic Hans, to a subterranean world. Together they traverse a vast network of ancient tunnels before coming upon an underground sea complete with pre-historic creatures from the time of the dinosaurs. I should also add that for the entire journey, they have access to electric lanterns and then, when on the sea, there is a strange artificial light by which they can see. Eventually, they are thrust to the surface upon a raft they construct. Their point of re-entry is the island of Stromboli in Italy.I suspect that many might think that I am being too critical. Just remember that it is a work of fiction and go with the flow so to speak. This is a valid point. However, at many tmes during the novel, I was brought to compare this book with the works of the great British novelist, H.G. Wells. They were both approximately contemporaneous. Yet, Wells was by far the better story teller. He wrote of invasions from outer space and time travel. In other words, they were both writing of science fiction in many of their works. Wells's work is by far the superior.So, in summary, I recommend that people read \\"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\\". It is an interesting tale that moves at a good clip. However, do not expect a great work of literature."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This work has Jules Verne's normal scientific explanation of things. However, this work was particularly interesting because of its interaction between the journey and the historical worldwide flood."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"***This review may contain spoilers and is based on the English translation that labels the Professor as \\"Hardwigg\\", his nephew as \\"Harry\\", and their Icelandic equipment porter as \\"Hans\\"***Ironically, Harry was right of course about the Earth's composition. Earth's center is fiery molten iron/nickel core, not a prehistoric underworld. But James Verne was probably not aware of this discomfiting fact when he penned his classic science expedition adventure \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" (hereafter, JCE). It's inconsequential, because Verne went ahead and captured the true essence of how an expedition begins, how it is prepared for and equipped, and what data the expedition records. Verne also illuminates the vivid but widely diverse personalities of the three men who embark on this stunning trek, the obsessed leader of the trip Professor Hardwigg, his unwilling but scientifically competent nephew Harry, and the industrious, phlegmatic, dependable Hans (but no duck, Gertrude or otherwise).Professor Hardwigg's discovery of a parchment by the late Arne Saknusseum (hereafter A.S.) launches the tale. \\"A.S.\\" is widely believed to be the first person to reach Earth's center and return alive. Hardwigg eagerly believes the parchment is a road map to the center and attempts to decipher it, without success. On the other hand, Harry's last thing on his mind is a mad, dangerous subterranean trip; he is more interested in marrying his fiancee and enjoying his bourgeois comforts. The manic Hardwigg will have none of it; he insanely vows that he (and Harry) will not eat until the parchment is deciphered. Abstinence and hunger are not among Harry's pastimes, as he describes an ordeal he suffered as a little boy, when he accidentally got stuck in a chimney while trying to remove a bird's nest, and waited for hours for rescue. In a bit of foreshadowing Harry absorbingly describes the hallucinatory toll his hunger took on him, until the chimney masonry his belt is stuck on crumbled and he tumbled to safety. At length, Harry stumbles upon the parchment code; it is not in a non-German, foreign language, but simply in cunning backwards German! Alarmed, Harry attempts to keep Hardwigg from learning the answer, too, but his fast and his compassion for his uncle's mental anguish force him to divulge the secret. To Harry's further alarm, Hardwigg resolves to follow the map and A.S.'s clues (and initials) to Earth's center.However, even the impulsive Hardwigg realizes that he needs careful preparation for the trip. First, in a fairly comic chapter, he compels Harry to overcome his acrophobia (fear of heights) by climbing to the top of their town's church spire repeatedly. After all, a lot of climbing and rapelling will be involved. Next, off they go to Iceland by boat (where Hardwigg, to his irritated embarassment, suffers seasickness). Mount Sneffels, an extinct volcano A.S.'s parchment describes as the doorway to Earth's core, is located there. However, before the ascent and descent, Hardwigg secures the services of the brawny, laconic, and reliable worker and porter Hans. Hans is a workhorse, provided he gets his weekly 3 Icelandic rix-dollars. The trio lay in their supplies: food, climbing gear, bedding, and chronometer (which will measure the depth and distance from Sneffels of their descent. Verne devotes a chapter each to the ascent and descent of Sneffels. Then the expedition begins.As I said, Verne realistically captures the obstacles and obstructions of a scientific expedition, from cave claustrophobia, to rock-slides, to wrong directions, and especially the want of water, which really affects Harry. Although he may seem querulous and whiny to his uncle and to us, Harry is actually quite sensible about the necessities of an expedition. No matter how consumed Hardwigg is with his quest, the trip will fail without water. Only the discovery of internal hot springs and Han's patient release of that torrent saves the trio from thrist and incidentally releases a trickle that will lead to the core.However, as the trio follows the stream, Harry inadvertently gets separated from the group and finds himself lost with almost no food and water. Naturally, he panics and despairs. Fortunately, he is in a cavern that conducts sound well and successfully uses it to call his uncle. By deducing sound's speed through rock, Hardwigg informs the faltering, weak Harry that he is 5 MILES away from them. Nevertheless, Harry stumbles forward until he falls down a shaft and loses consciousness.Harry awakes with a head injury and tender care by his anxious uncle. To his amazement, Harry sees a beach with giant mushrooms and an ocean stretching to the horizon. Meanwhile, Hans is methodically building a raft. After Harry's convalescence, the trio set sail on the Central Sea. They endure storms, lightning, prehistoric ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs and even a magnetic ball that lands on their raft. When they finally reach land, they are stunned and disappointed to learn that the wind pushed them back to where they started! Hardwigg fumes until they find A.S.'s initials in a hole in a seaside cliff. Providence is with them.The trio spend a couple of days exploring the beach and find a treasure trove of ancient fossils. Harry and Hardwigg wax rhapsodic about their finds, especially when they discover an ancient blade that could have only belonged to Saknusseum. Even more shocking, Harry and Hardwigg discover a herd of living mastodons (elephant-like creatures) feeding on trees, and being tended by a giant caveman. At Harry's insistence, they wisely don't get any closer.Finally, the trio enter the cave in the cliff and follow A.S.'s trail until they reach an impassable boulder, which fell after Saknusseum's time. The trio decide to dynamite the boulder. Bad move. The explosion does remove the obstacle, but the seismic shock also causes the sea to pour into the new gap. The trio has barely enough time to ride the swell along the shaft. Along they go (with Harry having an amusing but horrifying dream about an \\"Ape Gigans\\" chasing him) until they improbably enter the shaft of a live volcano with lava about to erupt. At length, the volcano (which turns out to be Stromboli in Italy) spews out the trio. Fabricating a shipwreck tale to describe their haggard appearance, they receive aid from Italian fisherman and a voyage home to a heroes' welcome in Konigstrausse, Germany. Hans receives his proper wages from Hardwigg and returns to Iceland. Impressed by Harry's feat, his fiancee agrees to marry him. However, despite the accolades, Hardwigg is upset because the compass he brought along on the journey no longer pointed north. Harry comes to the \\"rescue\\" by explaining that the magnetic ball on the raft reversed the polarity. Now everyone can be happy.Again, if you can overlook the scientific inaccuracies (including the premise, the impossibility of riding hot lava, and being spewed miles away without death and injury) JCE gives you an exciting, engrossing, easy-to-follow, largely realistic scientific expedition. Through Hardwick, JCE also reminds us expedition leaders NEED to be indomitable, obsessed, and even slightly mad to be effective. Nevertheless, expeditions need to balance the Ahab-like megalomania with cautious, quietly competent, hard-working, and loyal followers (personified by Harry and Hans) to be focused and successful. And yet, I noticed a (I think) slight flaw toward JCE's end. The expedition brought NO tangible evidence that they traveled beneath the earth (of course how could they, being spit out by a volcano?). So why is the Professor and company being feted? The movie version of JCE starring James Mason as the Professor at least acknowledges that oversight by modestly stating that he doesn't deserve the celebrity because he brought no souvenirs of his trip. Oh, well, skip that too and enjoy a fantastic but mostly plausible, well-told, politics-free tale."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This is the story of how a man and his nephew journeyed to the center of the earth.

Professor Lidenbrock decodes the message which tells them to go in to a volcano and descend in to the center of the earth. Axel doesn't want to do it but his uncle is determined to. To help them out, they hire a man named Hans to be their guide. The group of explorers start to descend in to the volcano towards the center of the earth. Soon they are running very low on water.

The book requires some suspension of belief that three men can travel hundreds of miles underground for months without fresh air and limited supplies, not to mention find fantastic prehistoric creatures living underground, but if you can look past the logic you can still enjoy it. The professor's arguments for the center of the earth not being a molten core are almost convincing, even if we know he's wrong. I found the professor to be the most interesting character in the novel. He comes across to me as a kind of savant, a superintelligent and learned man who also happens to be hyperfocused and completely clueless to the basic human needs of others.

It is an extremely lengthy book & at some points does seem to loss it's flow. Overall, it was worth reading just to say I read a Jules Verne story!"},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Be warned, I don't even try and avoid spoilers.Jules Verne managed to find himself a nice little literary niche. His basic MO was to come up with some kind of spectacular but as yet (circa late 1800's) unperformed human achievement, whether it be traveling into outer space, going around the world in 80 days, moving 20 thousand leagues under the sea or in this case journeying to the center of the Earth. He then applies the science of his era to figure out how it can be done. Verne enjoyed relaying his own scientific knowledge for instance treating the reader to a scientific explanation as to how Iceland's land mass formed. I was however a little surprised that Verne seemed completely ignorant to the effects of high altitude climbing since obviously this was known about in his time. The story centers around Professor Von Hardwigg and his nephew Harry who discover a long lost manuscript written by Icelandic explorer Arne Saknussemm. In the manuscript Saknussemm claims to have traveled to the center of the Earth, some three hundred years ago, entering through the dormant volcano Mt. Sneffels in Iceland so Von Hardwigg, Harry and their superhuman Icelandic guide Hans attempt to duplicate the journey.The main issue I had with Journey to the Center of the Earth is that Verne can't seem to decide what literary genre he's writing. He seems to be attempting science fiction but the story is so absurd that it feels more like pure fantasy and concludes like a Loony Tunes cartoon. Verne knew that as you descend into the Earth the heat, pressure and lack of breathable air would build to the point where no human can survive but unless he chose to write a book called Journey a Short Distance towards the Center of the Earth he simply had to wave these problems away as if the characters had found a magical path. If Verne had simply gone all out and wrote a fantasy book it would have been better than try to include scientific explanations for all these absurdities.Let me describe just how ridiculous the book gets. About 120 miles under the Earth the adventurers arrive at a vast saltwater sea. Hans inexplicably manages to build a seaworthy craft in a matter of hours from wood he gathers from an underground forest. Here is where it gets really silly. They travel in the raft an unbelievable 300 miles with no mention of lack of food or water. They come to a tiny and fairly useless island and then set off again for another 600 more miles through a violent storm that lasts three days. So violent in fact that their ears literally bleed and yet still no worries of hunger or a collapse of the raft. A globe of ball lightning menaces the group and even manages to be consumed by Hans causing him to spit fire. The ball lightning magnetizes all the metal on the raft including the rafts nails. Where in the world did Hans get these nails from? Did he carry them all the way on the off chance that he may need to build something and where did the sail come from? After surviving this multi day storm the raft crashes on shore leaving them with almost all their supplies and four months of food. FOUR MONTHS!?!?! Since they've been traveling for at least several months that means they started the trip with over a half a year of food along with huge amounts of rope, pickaxes and ladders. Near the end of the book their passage is blocked by a large boulder and they use 50 pounds of gunpowder to blow it up. Among all the staggering amounts of provisions they had 50 pounds of gunpowder just in case. Had Jules Verne ever gone on a hiking trip in his life? 50 pounds is an enormous amount of weight to lug around particularly 120 miles down into the Earth.Compared to the above events the appearance of dinosaurs seems downright pedestrian. There never seemed to be any restriction on the amount of supplies they carried they could only proceed thanks to a magical path that supplied light, low pressure and coolness and the book ended with the group riding up the eruption of a volcano blowing out the top and surviving with nary a scratch. Perhaps my greatest disappointment was that they didn't even get close to the Earths core. They descended about 120 miles before shooting up through the volcanic shaft. The books concept is fantastic and it's been made into a least a half dozen movies but the execution here leaves something to be desired."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This fantastical story will have your mind swimming. It is a great read for the learned."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This book starts off strong with the Verne's classic style and wit. The initial pages are entertaining, fast-paced and set the stage for a potentially wonderful novel. However, the story quickly slows down as preparations for the trip take entirely too long. In the version I read, the actual journey doesn't begin until page 90. Then, once the journey begins, it is rather uneventful. Verne also puts in too much geological information for the average reader to appreciate. It becomes quite tedious reading the detailed content of various mineral deposits, composition of the substrata of the earth, etc. While some such material is interesting, Verne innundates the reader. While there were some exciting moments, this novel failed to win me over."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"A Journy to the Center of the Earth it is a good book. I think it would be cool to the center of the earth. I also like Professor Hardwigg and Harry. In the book the professor never give up.

As a boy, he longed to travel to unknow worlds and at 12, he tried to stow away on a ship bound for India.But his father pulled him off the ship and gave him asevere beating.Jules, hower, vowed to continue to travel from them on-but only in his imagination."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"I have read it 1 time and I think it is an excellent book worth the time it takes"},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Jules Verne or sci-fi books.

Pages upon pages are devoted to the prosaic trek to the Icelandic volcano which serves as the ingress to the abyss, and, once inside, pages upon pages are devoted to the mundane exploration of rocky tunnels. (\\"Look at that magnificent feldspar, Uncle!\\")The protagonist gets lost (and found), the water supply runs out, and sundry other non-exciting events occur. I wanted more ichthyosaur vs. plesiosaur-type happenings...which alas, were barely represented.The treatment of Saknussemm defies credibility, and the fact that the main characters survived being erupted out of Mt. Etna beggars belief. I'll grant a lot of latitude when the premise is such an interesting and promising one.

I give it a five-star rating."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"A novel that takes its reader on a grand adventure from page one is sure to be a good one. Journey to the Center of the Earth by Jules Verne is just one example of such a novel. The story grabs you right from the beginning. Narrated by the main character's nephew, we are taken on a journey from beginning to end that is as exhilarating as any ride at Disneyland. Having dreamed of being an adventurer since he was a child, Mr. Verne managed to channel some of that energy into his writing, while at the same time pleasing his father and becoming a lawyer.The story opens with Professor Lidenbrock finding a book written in Icelandic. The book is not as important as what is found inside the book, however. A piece of parchment with a series of letters written in a Runic language is found tucked among the pages, setting off a frenzy for the professor (and by association, his nephew, Axel) to find out what the parchment says. Once Professor Lidenbrock and Axel translate what is written we get into the meat of the story - the journey to the center of the Earth.Their journey begins with Axel and Professor Lidenbrock going to Iceland, where they spend time trying to learn more about the person who wrote the note on the parchment. While there, they also acquire a guide who will go with them on their visit to Snafell and into the center of the Earth. He proves an excellent guide and his efforts are appreciated by the professor and his nephew.Throughout the book, the professor never gives up on getting to the center of the earth. He is bound and determined not to let anything stop him, despite the many protestations of Axel, who is ready to turn back at the first sign of trouble. I wouldn't label Axel a skeptic, but he is definitely more cautious than his uncle and tends to think something is going to go wrong. I know that those things would make the reader immediately label Axel a skeptic, but in the end he does come around to the adventure and is willing to see it through to the end. Throughout the story, the trio is faced with a variety of obstacles but they overcome all of them with grace and come out for the better on the other side.It's hard to review this book without giving anything anyway. However, I will say this (without spoilers): I wish there were a sequel and this is one of the most well-written books I've read in a long time. Mr. Verne certainly did his research (and copious amounts of it) for this novel. He crams a lot into a little space (the book, not including notes, checks in at 288 pages), but the detail is impressive. He also provides 30-plus pages of notes at the end, to explain all the people, places, and objects he refers to throughout the novel.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I love a story that grabs me right from the beginning and doesn't let go until the end.

A few days later the book arrived and my son began reading it. About a week or so later he has finished it and loved it.

It is great to see him dive into it like he did."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"It had been many years since I had read a Jules Verne novel, and to be honest, I couldn't recall his skill as a writer at all. When I dug this book off of my bookshelf I admit, I was simply bored and looking for something mindless to read while the children fought over gluing cotton balls to construction paper.I admit that it took my mind a while to re-acclimate to the writing style of the time, not that it was difficult to read, it was just far too easy to skim. So, bringing my mind to a screeching halt, I sat down and began to truly read this wonderful novel. Let me begin with saying that the science in the novel is extremely outdated but at the time of it's writing, was plausible. If you can get your mind past the huge hurtle of your current scientific knowledge, you can appreciate this book for what it is: a brilliant science fiction/adventure novel. The conventions of the time include misunderstandings of the makeup of the earth, and the propensity to marry one's own cousins.The book is written in the form of a diary at times, and a retelling at times, of events that had passed previously. The voice of the book is the character Harry, nephew and assistant to Professor Von Hardwigg. The novel begins with the professor's discovery of a secret parchment which when decoded gives the location that a previous explorer used to enter the bowels of the earth. The immediately set out to follow in the footsteps of this great explorer of centuries before. Joining them is Hans, the apparent superman of Iceland. He never complains, rarely talks, and saves the lives of those around him on a regular basis. I cannot help but to believe that this is Verne's ideal man, his \\"Adonis\\" if you will. The Professor, though he loves Harry, is a closet ADHD case hidden behind a brilliant and stubborn mind. There is great adoration for his nephew, on those occasions when he stops moving or talking long enough to notice him. Harry, who is telling the story, is easily written off as a coward; however he is so much more than that if you take into account the beliefs of the time. He is following his uncle on a dangerous journey into the unknown to a place he does not even believe exists. (Harry's beliefs are far closer to the reality that we understand, however in this novel they are all completely incorrect)Upon entering the depths of the earth many hardships and terrors await the three, ranging from dehydration, starvation, dinosaurs, many falls, getting separated, raging storms on underground seas and volcanic eruptions. I won't go into great detail suffice to say that the movie, though highly entertaining, does no justice to this story. Spray painted iguanas with horns are far from what is described in this book. If you have spare time on you hands, this is an excellent read and I would highly recommend it to anyone. There is a reason that this is considered \\"Literature.\\"4 of 5 stars."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Journey To the Center of the Earth was always one of my favorite movies and after all these years, I finally read the book. The book is not like the movie at all. Honestly, I liked the movie better however that is not to say I was in any way disappointed with the book. It moved along quickly and drew me in such that I couldn't put it down and so read it in one sitting. A geologist, his eager young nephew and an Icelandic guide make their way to the earth's core following the footsteps of a previous mysterious explorer into the dark subterranean world of weird plants, animals, rocks and unforeseen dangers. There was no woman with them as in the movie but a female companion might have spiced it up a bit. The Icelander didn't have a pet duck along as in the movie but he was an indispensible partner in the venture. All in all, it was adventurous and fun and worth my time. I enjoyed it very much. Sure glad I finally read the book!Betsy"},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Lost races, dinosaurs, volcanoes, what more could a kid want? A scientist discovers some writing by an old explorer that greatly excites him. He puts together a cosmopolitan expedition of adventurers to go and check it out for himself. The expedition includes his young nephew, presumably so younger readers have someone to relate to."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Jules Verne's _Journey to Center of the Earth_ (1864) is an incredibly imaginative work, enlivening a reader's capacity to draw mental pictures and dream impossible concepts in concrete, believable terms. The German Professor Van Hardwigg, his teenage nephew Harry, and their stolid Icelandic guide, Hans, descend into the dormant volcano, Mount Sneffels, in Iceland at the end of June in the 1860s. According to a centuries old Icelandic manuscript by the sixteenth-century Icelandic alchemist, Arne Saknussemm--Professor Hardwigg accidentally discovers the manuscript--at exactly twelve noon the early summer light of June would reveal the correct path to take in the volcano. And so, after a few overcast days, when it appears that the mission will have to wait another year, the explorers see their last glimpse of the noonday sun for two months.Verne is brilliant at blending science, history, and art to make his fiction seem realistic. The effect is that a has both a renewed interest in science and history while experiencing a memorable imaginative journey. As the explorers follow false leads, despair of ever finding water and food, become lost and then found, and face unexpected, unreal dangers, Verne captures the sense of confinement of being underground. For much of the early part of the book, the descriptions lack color and the reader almost must adjust his eyes to the light of the men's torches. The center of the book, in contrast, like the near center of the earth, is beautiful, literally creating a new world within a world.In terms of characterization, Harry expresses the explorer's angst while his uncle gives voice to the explorer's elation. Upon seeing the extinct Mount Sneffels for the first time, Harry thinks, \\"To descend into the interior of a cannon when perhaps it is loaded, and will go off at the least shock, is the act of a madman.\\" (Harry's words will later ring true). According to Harry, his uncle seeing the same sight \\"looked at me with a proud and triumphant glance.\\" Meanwhile Hans, the guide, is imperturbable, steady, and taciturn; he adds comic relief to the uncle's and nephew's extremes. As long as Hans receives his weekly wages, paid on Sunday, he is oblivious to all danger.Of the Verne novels that I have read, this is my second favorite novel, next to_ Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea_. There are two harrowing middle chapters, \\"Alone\\" and \\"Lost\\"--the sentence for the review comes from these chapters--in _Journey to the Center of the Earth_ which are unforgettable, and the conclusion of the book is ingenious. The plot is unpredictable and clever. Verne conveys the triumph and fear of the explorer during the nineteenth-century, a period when science became ascendant.The book delighted French readers in the late 1800s--in fact, French children would eagerly look forward to Verne's latest before the Christmas holidays. Similarly delighted, I read much of the book on my commute to work on the subway, and looked forward to it in the morning and early evening."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Jules Verne's Journey to the Center was an excellent book because instead of the usual facts that are written down he tells us a story that has theories and facts of the earth included with in the storyline. Most of the book takes place in the earth itself, but in the beginning most of it takes place in Iceland. This book is about a professor and his nephew that make a discovery that there is a way down to the center of the earth if they ascend down a mountain in Iceland. On they're way they meet a guide that leads them to the mountain called Mt. Sneffels. After that they descend down in to the mountain. They keep going down toward the center. They face many dangers and difficulties, such as thirst, light, getting lost, some injuries and fatigue. Later in the book they make discoveries that other scientist would have thought that they never existed. Jules Verne went straight into the story after giving the characters an introduction. The story was really good because it kept you in to the book and it also was fun to read while you learn something's as well. Compared to other books like this one I find that Journey to the Center of the Earth was better than the others. That is just my opinion though. Jules Verne did an excellent job on writing this book. He includes facts like how the earth is made up. This book is very informative without you realizing that you can learn things. I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure and science related books because this book is packed with adventure and has a lot of facts related to science. When you finish this book you finish it with new knowledge."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"As an avid reader of Jules Verne, I enjoyed reading this book very much. I am not much for reading alot of books, but when I do read he is the authur that I choose. I thought that Journey to the Center of the Earth like all of his books was very well writen and very well developed.I especially like these types of books because, they seem that they could actualy be real and certain places mentioned could actually exist. The book starts off with a young boy telling the story. His name is Harry and he lives in Hanburg with his uncle. His uncle's name is Professor Hardwigg. He is a professor of many different sciences like philosophy, chemistry, geology, mineralogy, and many other sciences. In the beginning of the book the Professor makes a discovery. His discovery is a small piece of paper that is called a Runic manuscript. The hard part was trying to figure out what langauge the paper was writen in, but once it was deciphered it appeared to have directions that lead to the center of the earth. So professor Hardwigg being the adventurer that he was, was ready to set off for Ireland, which is were the paper said to go first. Harry being only 13 had no choice in the matter but to go. They took a ten day trip on a boat to Ireland and when they got there, they were supposed to go to base of a mountain where there was a cave that they would enter that would lead them to the center of the earth. The cave seemed to go down and down forever where it lead them to the very depths of the earth. When they reached the center of the earth they came across a blue sky and an ocean. They built a raft to go across it and in the middle of crossing they ecountered two prehistoric monsters fighting around them. In the story they also encounter living fire. In the center of the earth any wrong step of wrong turn could lead to most certainly death or being trapped down there forever. To find out more details and what happens in the rest of the book, you will just have to read it for yourself.Like I mentioned before the reading experience of this book was very good. The characters were very well developed, because of the information given about them and also how they were used throughout the story. Professor Hardwigg for example was a great character because he was a very smart man, but also a great adventurer. In the book as soon as the professor figured out what the paper ment he was ready to begin the journey. Harry was another great and well developed character, because of the information that was given in the beginning. Also, who would have thought that a 13 year old boy could have cracked the code before his smart uncle, so he plays a great role in this story.The plot was very well developed and very well laid out. The story went step by step not leaving out anything and everything was very well explained. In the story they talked about having to learn to repel and in the story it told exactly how and why they did this.I would recommend this book to anyone with an open mind and to people that think that this could actualy happen. Overall I enjoyed reading this book very much and I hope that this review will help anyone interested in reading it or people just reviewing it."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Jules Verne's classic novel Journey to the Center of the Earth is a must read for any science fiction book lovers. I rate this book four stars because this book has great imagery and is very believable considering the fact that this journey never took place.This book deserves four stars because Verne's imagination makes this book an easy read with his use of vivid descriptions of the journey. The journey starts off with a scientist who finds a map to the center of the earth. Himself, his nephew, and a guide journey down an old volcano towards the center of the earth. On their journey they find all kinds of, thought to be extinct, animals and cavemen.Although the three men find many exciting things they also encounter many hardships. The men are suffering from lack of food because they are miles from the surface of the earth, and they lack water because there are no water sources nearby. The men somehow find a river that is boiling hot due to the fact that they are inside a dormant volcano. When they find the underground world they also get food from the wild plants growing around them.In my opinion this book is one of the greatest science fiction books that I have read. Jules Verne is an excellent writer who wrote many great books. This book is about three men who go on an expedition to the center of the earth. The question that you have to ask yourself before you read this is will they make it out alive. Well you will have to find out yourself by reading this great novel."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Read this translation and not the British newspaper serial one. In some of the other Journey editions the names and nationalities of characters are changed and the first chapter reads differently. To check if you have an honest translation, see if the professor is named Lidenbrock (correct) or Hardwigg (fake).The characters on this mission boldly go where no man has gone before. They resemble some of the cast on American space voyage shows of the sixties. The Icelandic guide Hans is like Spock, stoic, unconcerned with ordinary problems and fearless.Prof. Lidenbrock is not really like Kirk, because he is not emotional. He is actually a lot like Spock also. In fact, Hans and Prof. Lidenbrock are both heroic figures.Axel the teenager(?) on the trip is more like Kirk. He feels emotions, often fear or regret. He also never wanted to go on the journey in the first place, and thus has some aspects in common with Dr. Smith of Lost in Space. However, morally Axel is as upright as the others.Verne took great care to place realistic details in his story. The early chapters where Lidenbrock and company visit 19th-century Iceland are not so much science fiction as they are travel literature, and Verne mastered that genre as well."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth is definitely a must read for science fiction aficionados and classic fiction lovers alike. Verne's sense of humor and incredible imagination make for a mostly credible, and quite enjoyable tale of a young man who accompanies his uncle on the journey of a lifetime.For the time in which it was written, it was groundbreaking in citing evolution. Darwin had only published his Origin of the Species 7 years prior to this novel's publication 1867. Verne embraces the theories presented in Origin of the Species, as well as drawing in other discoveries made in scientific circles of the time that support such theories. Verne also takes care to describe and explain many of the other scientific theories and ideas of the age presented in the book in such a way that he ensured Journey to the Center of the Earth will remain a classic for years to come. A wonderful work definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Yes there are different versions, The best one is the original in French. There are more than one translations into english, one with the Main character's name as Harry, the other as Axel.I read the 'Harry' version first, but only partway through as it was terrible! I thought Verne was a bad writter or something. But, when I was older, I found another copy (Puffin Classics btw), and I thought I'd give it another go. That was one of the best books I had ever read, it funny and imaginative. The characters even had character!Well, I looked into it, and compared my new version with the first book I had read and both of them with the original. Mine was pretty close. The names were kept the same, most of the sentences were similar in structure (so that someone like me who can't read french could tell that they were the same book).The 'Harry version' however, invented entire chapters out of thin air, discarded others and changed significant plot points. I hope this helps some of you decide which one to get, and that there is more than one translation.If the book starts with:\\"ON 24 May 1863, a Sunday, my uncle, Professor Lidenbrock, came rushing back towards his little house at No.19 Konigstrasse, one of the oldest streets...\\"You know you have the good version.Otherwise, I love this book and would recomend it to anyone, whether a science fiction fan or not."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This kindle edition is based on the 1871 translation which slightly abridged and altered Verne's original (for example, the Professor is here named Hardwigg, rather than the original's Lidenbrock, and his niece is here named Gretchen rather than Grauben). That's probably the most generally known English translation (it's the one I read obsessively as a child), and it's still a great read, but sticklers for textual accuracy might want to do a little more searching.As to the novel itself, while unquestionably one of Verne's masterpieces in terms of story, it's probably the one that's aged the hardest of all Verne's works, and almost all of the science in this text has been exploded, modified, or simply changed by the intervening hundred and fifty-odd years of scientific development. Because Verne was in part intending this book to be a source of scientific education, the characters spend a lot of time talking about geology, archaeology, etc., to each other, and since most of that's outdated now, modern readers may want to skip over the more scientific chunks of the book and simply read it as an exploration tale.From that perspective, the most interesting thing about this book might be that it's arguably the progenitor of the \\"Lost Prehistoric World\\" genre, and readers who want more in that vein might want to look up later books that focused more squarely on modern-explorers-in-dinosaur-country stories, such as Arthur Conan Doyle'sThe Lost World, or Edgar Rice Burrough's novel _The Land that Time Forgot_ or his _Pellucidar_ series (explicitly set in the hollow interior of the globe)."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This is a classic novel by Jules Verne. In the story, Professor Hardwigg and his nephew Harry discover an ancient parchment by an alchemist named Arne Saknussemm. They travel to Iceland and climb an extinct volcano called Sneffels. With them is the Icelandic hunter Hans. They journey into the center of the earth, in which Harry gets lost. They come upon and ocean and cross it. While they are on the sea they witness a battle of ancient sea monsters. Eventually they are thrown out of a volcano on Stromboli, an island in Italy. This was a wonderful book, but sometimes it went into too much detail. Still, a classic five star book. I don't see why anyone would give it 4 1/2 stars. It is simply absurd. I recommened this book to anyone with a good imagination."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This book proves Verne's greatness as a writer of fiction. The science in this science fiction flies largely in the face of modern science, yet the read is no less gripping today than it was in its infancy. The story is pretty simple. Professor Lidenbrock, a neurotically impatient scientist, discovers a cryptic manuscript written by a long-dead explorer; with the help of his nephew, he decodes the cryptogram to read an account of a journey to the center of the earth begun beneath a dormant volcano in Iceland. The nephew, Axel, a talented geologist and mineralogist himself, refuses to believe that the core of the earth is not exceedingly hot; additionally, he cares more about Grauben, the eccentric professor's ward, than risking his life on a scientific adventure. He proves unable to dissuade his uncle and thus joins with him on a journey to Iceland. There, they hire a stoic Icelander to lead them down into the earth. Most of the action takes place underground, with the adventurers suffering several trials, daring risks, and finally discovering a whole new world hidden miles below the earth's crust. The ultimate trial and danger they face consists of returning to the surface.Axel narrates the story, and the strength of the novel lies in his character. The professor and the Icelandic guide are unusual personalities, but Axel is very real and easy to relate to. He really does not want to go in the first place, and he is most liable to greet dangers and risks by bemoaning his fate and declaring his party done for in their foolish efforts. It is he who suffers the most privation when the men's water runs out, and it is he who finds himself lost in the utter blackness of the caverns for three days. When things are going well, though, Axel becomes wildly excited about the mission and temporarily forgets about his fears. This all goes to make him a very sympathetic character. Without him, the story would be a rather dispassionate account of an impossible journey by bland, unbelievable characters. You do have to shift your mind into low gear a few times when the characters begin speaking about the different types of minerals and rocks they are encountering, but overall the plot is rather thrilling, and you cannot help but begin early on trying to ascertain a way in which the intrepid explorers can return to share their discoveries with a skeptical scientific community. Verne knows how to tell a story, and you don't have to know a single thing about science to enjoy this novel immensely."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This is a wonderful book by Jules Verne but this is just a terrible translation. Just read the first page of the preview and you will see. e.g. \\"Our good Martha could not but think she was very much behind-hand with the dinner\\" Is that even English? Seek out William Butcher's wonderful translation of this great story by Verne."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This is an exiting book full of adventure.

They climb in to Mt.Sneffles with a guide named Hans. They have lots of adventures with prehistoric animals and travel in places you wouldn't even expect. The ending is very exiting but you will have to read it to find out. I recomend this book to people who like adventure stories.

To clarify the isue of \\"two versions\\" and the confusion this creates, any version of this great novel mentioning Professor \\"Hardwigg\\" is a literary fraud, a complete re-write, and not a translation of Verne at all. The would-be Verne-improver changed characters' names and many plot details.The shame is that this old bogus version is still not recognized as such and is still being sold as if it were truly Verne. Sadly, this is the one many of us grew up reading. Any true translation (such as in this Puffin Classic) identifies the professor as \\"Li(e)denbrock\\" (and that is how you can easily distinguish the real vs. the sham). There are old translations that get it right, but in modern times two translations stand out: one by Robert Baldick (this one) and one by William Butcher. They are both good, the difference mainly being a matter of style. Some prefer Butcher; I happen to prefer Baldick. Don't let the fact that Baldick's may appear in a children's imprint deter you from considering it. It appeared first in 1965 as an adult Penguin book, and twenty years later (unchanged) as a Puffin. Butcher's is more recent and, as he is a noted Verne scholar, his credentials certainly carry weight. But that doesn't make him a better wordsmith. We read Verne primarily for fun and for the thrill of adventure. Baldick's translation enables us to do just that. I highly recommend his translation in this Puffin edition to anyone, child or adult. But whichever edition of this wonderful novel you may be considering for purchase, and no matter who translates it, give it the Lidenbrock (READ) vs. Hardwigg (AVOID) test to be certain you are reading the actual story Verne intended."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This is some sort of re-write, perhaps for American audiences? It's not nearly as good writing as the original. Get the original for free at [...]. The version I am reading was published in 1906."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Everyone should read some Jules Vernes. A late 19th century French writer, he influenced many people with his enthusiasm for things scientific. In Voyage, the protagonists are a scientist (who discovers a message indicating a journey to the center of the earth is possible), his reluctant nephew, and the quiet-man native guide. An expedition is organized immediately, and the adventure begins. Once you get past the writing style which may be strange to the modern reader, and you suspend your disbelief on certain things (like just how many supplies they were capable of carrying), the tale can captivate. Here is a writer who relishes the scientific advances and discoveries of his age, and is writing about them. The reader can absorb the geologic understandings of the period, as well as the way in which the scientific community operated. It is the age of the gentleman scientist, the ancestor to Indiana Jones. And Verne's delight is infectious. By modern standards it's less exciting than, say, a Jurassic Park. But there's underground seas, strange animals and plants, delirious visions, and hardships of thirst and being lost in the dark to entertain you. Be aware of different translations: our book group had much hilarity discovering the differences in our editions: some seemed edited and condensed compared to the others (and as it's not copyright protected, some of our tattered paperbacks didn't even give the original date or the translator's name), some had wonderful illustrations, some had illustrations that apparently were for a different book, and some had none. Some editions had footnotes, which were interesting in their own way, apparently dating from the original French. There are even different names for the uncle and nephew. Judging from my translation (one of the uncredited ones), it's no great literary effort. But it's entertaining enough to keep one reading, and to amazed at this seminal storyteller and his influences on many who followed him."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"I've just recently found out about the different translations of this book.

It extensively concentrated on rock formations, climates, geology, Paleontology, etc. A science fiction should have some science in it, of course, but there was a lot in Journey to the Center of the Earth.Now, this book was written at a time when people didn't have television, internet and color photography was still young I think. Nothing could paint that picture of the mysterious behaviors of the prehistoric animal or the awe of an underground cavern for you. You had to rely on a really good imagination.

The book format is alright, but could do with a little editing to clean up errors which are mildly distracting."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"A great classic for free on amazon! An awesome addition to my collection on my kindle! Can't wait to read it!"},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"A really good adventure. One that I would read again. The action was well paced and had a good cast of characters."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This book was so great. I actually got into it after watching the movie journey to the center of the earth. Very interesting. A must read if I may say so myself. And I'm really not that into books"},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"After reading about half a dozen chapters I had to give it up because this translation just doesn't do Vern justice. This translation is more of a re-write, and sadly the translator can't write. Find a different version if you really want to read it.That being said, it's a great story and well worth the read if you can find the version by Penguin Books."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"It didn't blow my mind or anything, but I really respect how Verne always tries to explain the science behind his writing. It's a nice light read."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Was one the the first Jules Verne's stories that I read and was great to revisit it in electronic form."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"PLOT: Armed with ancient directions, courage, and intelligence a scientist, his nephew, and a hunter search for the center of the earth and adventure.POSITIVES: This is a masterpiece. I am a Jules Verne fan and this is one of his best works. It is full of danger, suspense, excitement, and passion. I read this to my children as they were growing up and the story stayed with us all through the years.PROBLEMS: It is of course dated. This book requires imagination. It is long (44 short chapters). I usually read a chapter each night to my kids on a book such as this. If I couldn't finish the book in a month the children got restless.PROPOSAL: Purchase an audio version. This is one book that I'd rather hear read than read myself."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Adventure, suspense, bravery, sea monsters, underground caverns, unbearable heat these are just a few of the wonderful subjects this book has to offer. The story begins when Professor Hardwigg finds a very old book with a piece of parchment in it. On the parchment was a form of writing in some secret code. When the Professor and his nephew, Harry, discovered its meaning they were both shocked to find out it was the instructions for a journey no man thought possible, the journey to the center of the earth! Almost immediately they went on the journey picking up a man by the name of Hans to be there guide. There were many hard times in this adventure. For example, the Professor thought that they would find water in an abundance only to find that there was none till Hans made the discovery by drilling through a wall. Who knows how they will ever survive. I would give this book a very strong four out of five stars because of its ability to keep you wondering what is next."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Reading this book is an amazing adventure, as evidenced by a century of avid readers. I picked it up on a lark and decided to read the first five or ten pages to see if it was my type. It was easy to read, enjoy and visualize, and I quickly finished it.The story revolves around a young man and his uncle, who is a scientist. They discover a route to the center of the earth (hence the title), and the novel is about their journey. Once you get 100 pages into this book, you aren't able to stop. The things they find boggle the mind, but seem so real.100 years from now, people will still be enjoying Jules Verne, because he captures the imagination of the young explorer."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Recently I read this book for school. I had liked the books &quot;20,000 leagues under the sea&quot; and &quot;Around the world in 80 days&quot;. So I was expecting a good book. This book is magnificant. It takes a while before the team finally starts down to the center of the earth. But one good thing about this is the fact they don't use a drill to go down (They hike instead). Also, sorry to ruin the book, but they don't even make it to the center of earth. The book however is still enjoyable. A wonderous and excellent tale I would reccommend for fans of Jules Verne or of adventure stories."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Forget for the moment the established theory that the center of the Earth is a ball of fire, and enjoy this wonderful adventure written over a century ago that offered an alternative view. I'm a big fan of Journey To The Center Of The Earth. I've read the book and seen the movie countless times, and still never tire of it. Alien Voices attempts to tell the story in a way that would suit a modern audience, while still retaining the spirit of the original. Long, descriptive passages can be circumvented in the aural medium with a few lines of dialogue or sound effects, and tighten the pace. Projecting the fascination of the unknown and portraying science in a highly positive way is indeed very Verne, and in this Alien Voices get it exactly right. Leonard Nimoy is an unsurpassably brilliant actor who brings the crotchety and irascible Professor Lidenbrock to life with panache. This is one man whose voice is perfectly suited to audio. John DeLancie unfortunately overdoes his part way too much for my liking, being too soppy and emotive as Axel. Still, that's the way Axel was written, so I can't say he got it wrong! The acting all round is competant, though it's mostly Nimoy and DeLancie who we hear, and they are seasoned professionals in film and t.v anyway. Put this on the headphones, and the sound quality becomes most evident, and you'll soon be taken away into the past. A worthy interpretation, for the most part, certainly to be congratulated for being far truer to the novel than the nonetheless highly enjoyable 1959 film."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Download all the great classics possible.

Seeing as it is free and the Kindle can hold thousands of books, there is no reason not to download this amazing novel. for Jules Verne diehards like Emmet Brown, I will warn you that there are a few veery slight discrepamcies between this digital copy and the original text, but it is not different at all in story or plot. For those unfamiliar with basic geology and other sciences, DO NOT belive everything in this book. Verne was an extremely inelligent ma ahead of his time, but that cannot replace a century and a half of sciemtific progress since publication. However, what we now view as inaccuracies (theories of te period debated and expressed by two main characters) in no way mar the book or make it the least bit less pleasurable to read. Despite having progressed from science fiction (for at the time the book\`s events obeyed all contemporary assumptions on geolgy and prehistory) to fantasy, I would recommend this enduring classic to anyone I know, and as I am doing right now, to people I don't know. While not tremendously long(if you read just an hour a night you'll be done inside a week) it is certainly worth your time and will not fail to entertain you."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"It took me a little while to get through it because it goes into so much detail, but overall I enjoyed it.

It was a well written creative classic. He really sinks you into the depths of the earth with the charactors. There were times I would hold my breath and then think wait...I'm not down there. lolHe had to think a lot to write this book and how it would really be to go down in the earth.There are three men who climb down a dormit volcano and start a journey to find the center of the earth. What they experience and see when down in the depths is only as amazing as the imagination. The \\"giants\\" and sea creatures, the world underneath. And then return to the surface of the earth, a truly amazing journey"},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"I bought this classic for my son. He has had his nose buried in since the day I gave it too him.And I couldnt beat the price. Thanks Amazon !!"},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This was the first book I downloaded to my kindle. I was so engrossed with the story. I couldn't wait to see who it actually ended. I understand why this is considered one of the great classical stories. Absolutly loved reading this."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Just finished reading this, Harry and the Professor set off to retrace the steps of Arne Saknussemm, who discovered the passage to the center of the earth. They start off in Iceland where they pick up a guide named Hans who speaks so little in the book you often forget about him. The story moves along slowly until about half way through the book. That's where the action begins, I have seen I think two movies based on the book and neither were close in story to the book. The science is dated and even a little silly, however it does not take away from the story. Not the most memorable of the (Classics) I have read but an enjoyable read all the same.."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"It's an oldie but a goodie. That's what I like to say about books that are written so long ago and yet they still remain relevant and entertaining. A Journey to the Centre of the Earth is no exception. While the original publication goes back to 1864, it is a fun romp nonetheless. It should be noted that, over the years, different translations of the book have been made. This version from Amazon comes at the low, low cost of free. One notable difference between this translation and the original is that the name of one of the main characters is changed. But these things are trivial, as the story of a professor, his nephew, and a loyal guide is entertaining the whole way through.The Good: There were a few things I really liked about this book. First, the adventure. The excursion into the unknown was fascinating. Nevermind that what happens in the book could never actually be real; when you are reading the story you imagine that it is. You feel the danger and suspense as the three explorers go deeper into the earth and discover many fascinating things. Also, I found it interesting that the story is written as if it is an actual, educational account. Throughout the entirety of the book, the narrative explains the meaning of certain scientific terms and past discoveries that are relatable to what the explorers see and experience. It certainly is a fun journey to follow them as they make their way to the center of the earth!The Bad: One problem with a book that is so old is the terminology and phrasing. There are many words and phrases used that we just don't use today. At times, I had some trouble understanding exactly what was being described or talked about. For instance, on more than one occasion it mentions how the explorers stopped to have \\"repast\\". This isn't a term most would use today, and it simply means they stopped to eat or have a meal. Also, the pacing in the beginning is a little slow, and the real fun of the adventure does not begin until about a third of the way through the book.The Ugly: This one is not really a fault of the book, after all, I have to take the time period it was written in into account. This book has seen a few adaptations in the film industry. The result is that I was expecting some of the things I have seen in the movies. Despite all the wonderful things seen on their journey, all of what they see is plausible for the time period written. Instead of finding areas with lack of gravity or floating rocks, the explorers happen upon a world stuck in the far past, thousands of years before their journey. All of it, in a sense, was real at one point. Many of the movies today depict things that have never happened in the earth's history, and fantastical things that it will probably never see either. If you are expecting an account following what has been shown in film, you may be disappointed.Overall, I really liked A Journey to the Centre of the Earth. It was fun to see into the past in more way than one and appreciate the perspective of a science fiction writer from a century and a half ago. I highly recommend you read this, if you haven't already. This is classic science fiction. Like I said at the beginning, it's an oldie but a goodie."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"Excellent story; Verne is the master of science fiction! The story has a constant pulse of science and adventure that kept me reading. The story is also steeped with various metaphors and insights into Verne's personal life.Verne was truly a genius - I know many people will disagree because of the fact that clearly this story, overall, is impossible but first of all it is actually solidly backed by the amount of science that was known at the time and second it was written to entertain and hopefully educate people in some science/geology and hopefully encourage them to begin analyzing the world around them and to go on an adventure.The story could be enjoyable as a light read but I would encourage people to really read into it, especially the father/son relationship between Axel and the professor as this will prove to be a very insightful look into attitude towards his own father. Also, the series of discoveries through mistakes and chance provides a rather different, if not comical, look at the true art of scientific discovery that Verne invested so much of his life.I would highly encourage anyone, especially if you are interested at all in science, to read this and other of Verne's works. If nothing more his books will certainly entertain you and open your eyes to the wondrous world all around you, even under your very feet!"},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"I haven't been an avid reader for ages.. that is, until I found this book.

Thank you Amazon!"},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"The free Journey to the Center of the Earth ebook is a very poor translation with a main character named Harry. The plot is butchered and the narrative is a mess. If you would like to shell out a couple of dollars and get a very good translation and a much better read, you should look in to the Literary Classics Collection version (Journey to the Centre of the Earth - Full Version (Illustrated and Annotated) (Literary Classics Collection)) or the SF Classic edition (Journey to the Center of the Earth (Illustrated Collectors Edition) (Active Table of Contents) (New Translation) (53 Illustrations) (SF Classic)). Regardless, the main characters in the \\"good\\" translation should be Axel and professor Lidenbrock."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"I enjoyed Journey to the Center of the Earth a surprising amount. Before finally reading this unabridged version, I had become very familiar with the basic plot by reading an abridged version several times in childhood. That (10 made me aware of the novel's obvious flaws, such as the wimpy narrator, the preposterous science, and the sudden ending, and (20 seemed to assure that I could not be surprised by much in the story.But I was. The premise and story were just as ridiculous as I expected and the characters were sort of cartoons, and I loved it all anyway. there's an undeniable charm, and even humor, to Verne's narratives and to his narrative voice, and the sillier the novel was this time, the more I enjoyed it. The ending is still a little too easy for my tasted, but I was also just sad, at that point, that the quick-paced ride was ending. I doubt that I will understestimate a Verne novel again."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"I still very much enjoy this book decades after I read it the first time -- still a fascinating idea with intriguing characters. It's no surprise that Hollywood has been able to use it routinely as a gold mine for new film projects decade after decade (the best, in my opinion, is still the James Mason version).And, yes, the science can be a bit dated (I mean, what do you expect more than a hundred years later?), but in a way that's part of the fun of the book, too, picking out those things that you're like \\"Whaaaa? That's not right.\\" Heh. Or trying to track down some of the places or items Verne mentions and see if they really are real. The writing can also be a bit slow, but again that's expected given the era in which it was written, when pretty much all the writing of that day had those sort of pacing, but nevertheless it's an enjoyable read. You just need to be a little patient with it.And it's nice to find this book and so many others free for download here on Amazon. It helps me revisit all those classics I loved as a kid."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"This review is for the Robert Baldick translation, published by Puffin Classics. I have not read any other version, but from the research I have done, this seems to be one of the more faithful translations available. In the essay, \\"Journey Without End: On Translating Verne\\" William Butcher (a respected scholar who has published some of the most recent - and some might suggest, most faithful - versions of some of Verne's works) has spoken highly of Baldick's translation.While the science behind the story is obviously outdated, the story is still an excellent one. Not only is it a rousing adventure, but it provides an insight into open minded thought at the time it was published. In this context, it hardly matters that the theories presented have been disproved, because the manner in which they challenged the status quo is admirable. Professor Lindenbrock even states, in the course of a discussion with his nephew (slightly paraphrased, as I do not have the book in front of me at the moment): \\"Science is a series of mistakes, but mistakes which it is useful to make, for they lead us to the truth.\\" As a bonus, the Puffin edition comes with some extra notes that explain our modern understanding of the center of the earth.The eccentric professor and his timid nephew engage in a series of adventures that are now familiar territory for science fiction (decoding of a long forgotten message, discovery of an ancient world, etc.), but are none the less entertaining. The introduction of the book goes so far as to claim that Professor Lindenbrock is the very first \\"mad scientist\\" in fiction, and it is at least certain that his character provided inspiration for the plethora that would later inundate literature and television.This book was my introduction to Verne, and it has inspired me to check out his other works. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"In the age of instant gratification, this one is special. Preparing slowly the adventure, making sure every small detail was well thought off and well planned, taking the time to prepare the plot, the characters and the scenary, you won't find many books like this today.I gave it four stars, even though I think it rightly deserves five, because people, especially kids, will probably not have the patience to enjoy the slow pace this book unfolds.

On theme is you should never give up. This is showed by Axel's uncle, he keeps going on without caring about the dangers that lay ahead. He also can persuade them by his voice that is all knowing leads Axel to believe that he should keep going on. This act of bravery helps them through their toughest challenges.This book is somewhat believable because they describe the scenery so well that it seems real not just in a book. But the book seems unreal because we all know what happens in real life so this book breaks the natural laws of the earth.

It reads similar to the Lord of the Rings, which also goes into great detail about the scenery ect... However, unlike Lord of the Rings this book takes you UNDER the ground and in the 1800s and therefore does not have mythological or middle-earth dialogue.

The professor's nephew has a different name in each book too, but the Icelandic guide (Hans) is the same. From everything else I can tell, the settings, plots, etc., are IDENTICAL.

If you haven't read it yet you should read it because I think you would agree with me!"},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"In nearly all cases where a book is turned into a movie, I much prefer the book. This is one case where the screenplay is superior to the original story.Almost everyone has seen the movie (now out on DVD) starring James Mason and Pat Boone as the intrepid explorers, so the comparison is inevitable.I had just finished Jordan Stump's new translation of Verne's 'Mysterious Island' (Publisher: Modern Library; December 10, 2002) and was thoroughly delighted, so I was eager to read another of Verne's works.While the book starts out in good form, it really starts to drag a bit and getting to the actual point of the descent into the interior of the earth takes too long. Once there, we have only the Professor, (Hardwigg, in my copy's translation); Harry (Alec/Pat Boone in the movie) and Hans. No academic scoundrel (Professor Goetaborg) to race them to Iceland; no evil Count Saknussem to dog their steps and wreak havoc; no Mrs. Carla Goetaborg to keep the crusty Professor in line; and no \\"Gertude\\" to add comic relief. Instead, we are treated to a rather, well, unexciting account of what is of course a very imaginative journey.Frankly, without the additional characters and plot elements provided in the screenplay, it gets a bit boring down there. Which is, of course, why the screenwriters livened up the story to include, especially, the evil Count Saknussem. It needed that element of a diabolical plotter out to thwart the expedition to increase the tension and mystery.If you want the best of Verne, read the aforementioned new translation of 'Mysterious Island'. You will not be disappointedIn the present case, buy the wonderful DVD instead and grab the popcorn."},{"Title":"A Journey to the Center of the Earth","review":"While not the most riveting Sci-fi thriller, JTTCOTE should certainly be on every science fiction fan's shelf. The plot is quite suspenseful but a bit anti-climatic. Please keep in mind that it was written in 1862, the damn Civil War was on! The end is a bit silly, but everything else is written brilliantly.

He did considerable research in geology and he attempts to make the story as plausible as it can be based on the knowledge of 19th century science. Even though we now know that the &quot;journey&quot; can't be made, Verne is still successful in his tale. A German scientist, the irascible Professor Otto Lidenbrock, and his nephew Axel, uncover an ancient manuscript that reports of an earlier explorer's journey to the center of the Earth. The two travel to Iceland and, with the aid of the quiet and resourceful Hans, they enter an extinct volcano. In their travels, they discover an underground ocean, forests, and have to return to the surface via an active volcano!

The division between classes is very notorious. I have to admit that I found myself struggling for the first 100 pages or so, but then afterwards I was hooked. I am not to unveil the main trama but this is the story of a man that fights his way up the slums (with some help) and at this point the author provides us with many surprises, up until the end of the book. Things that had been building up in the 100 previous pages finally start falling together in a carefully laid out fashion, and a very romantic way. The feelings are intense."},{"Title":"The Gambling Man","review":"Rory Connor is a gambling man plain and simple. Born into a poor family, even his mum knows that someday he will make something of himself. He collects rents from the local habitants for the local gentry. The patriarch dies, leaving his plain, spinster daughter to carry on the family business.Rory is pressed to find gambling games that will afford him more cash in order to buy a house for his upcoming marriage and a small business venture for his brother. Rory pilfers a small amount of cash to enter a fixed game with the Pitte brothers, a local gang. A mistake that cost him Rory his conscious as a close friend goes to jail for a year for thievery Rory committed. He manages to win a large amount of money but is badly beaten and left for dead.While recuperating he is visited by his fianc&eacute; and also Charlotte Kean, the lady of the manor. It's easy to see that she is smitten with him and continues to engage him in his rent collector's role.He marries his intended but is plagued with guilt over his misdeed and confesses during a nightmare. His new wife is furious at what he's done and leaves him to return to her family. She is then commissioned by the mistress she works for to accompany their family on sea voyage, where they are all lost at sea. While mourning is loss, a year goes by and Rory is promoted to bookkeeping by Charlotte.Finally no longer able to contain her affections for Rory, Charlotte makes propositions him with an offer of marriage--in name only. He will not be required to fill his marital duties and will in fact reside in his own apartments.Rory of course makes her his wife in every way, giving her a happiness that she could only dream of.Charlotte has been busy collecting evidence against the Pitte brothers and a crew of malcontents that plague the docks, and in fact were responsible for beating Rory and other crimes against the local humanity.Though everyone is whispering about Rory's marriage to Charlotte, he finds himself falling in love with his plain, gentle wife. She informs him that she is with child, and he is beyond happy--until he learns that his first wife has returned, a shell of her former beautiful self, and bitter when she finds out that he has remarried.She threatens to expose him even as Rory declares to her that he loves his new wife and that she is expecting.The Pitte brother's burn Rory's brother's business and redemption is satisfied when Rory enters the burning building to save him. With his body on fire, he manages to save his sibling, but incurs fatal burns and survives long enough to declare his love once more to charlotte.Catherine Cooks tells stories the way we author's today are no longer allowed to. Always filled with passion, and redemption, Catherine always showed the cruelty as well as the beauty in the lives of those who weren't always rich and powerful. Her stories includes their downfall, as well as their redeeming qualities.

L. Mencken of the 19th century (or Mencken was the Bierce of the 20th century). His timeless and ego-deflating observations of Homo Sapiens reminds us that today's 21st century politics and pop culture were well-known to this 1842-born iconoclast. For instance, he defined a conservative as, \\"A statesman who is enamored of existing evils, as distinguished from the Liberal, who wishes to replace them with others\\" (1993 p.18). He defined a homeopathist as \\"The humorist of the medical profession\\" (p.51). He defined a clairvoyant as \\"A person, commonly a woman, who has the power of seeing that which is invisible to her patron-- namely, that he is a blockhead (p.16).

He was awarded the nicknames 'Bitter Bierce', 'the Devil's Lexographer', and 'the Wickedest Man in San Francisco'. It is a compilation of Bierce's favourite definitions from his magazine, the Sting. They remain cuttingly true today, although they were written at the end of the nineteenth century. For example:Monday, noun. In Christian countries, the day after the baseball game.Monkey, noun. An aboreal animal which makes itself at home in genealogical trees.The Devil's Dictionary is great not only as bathroom reading, but in helping one muddle through today's society. I only wish Bierce had written more.More, adjective.

It is timeless in a rare, hilarious way, yet chances are you have never heard of it unless you are an AmLit scholar working on satire or found it by chance like I did while prowling the web for free ebooks.Bierce took no prisoners; the book is both politically incorrect and timeless. This is not a contradiction in terms. It is as relevant now as it was a hundred years ago, and will remain relevant and funny for centuries to come, because human character doesn't change on such small time scales. By the standards Bierce sets to intelligent humor and satire, Mark Twain is a bumbling schoolboy and whoever spawned South Park is an aspiring amoeba.In a different country, The Devil's Dictionary would be taught in school and university, and the author would have streets and landmarks named after him. (I know, because I'm from such a country, and we have a Bierce equivalent who lived in the same period and is now considered a classic.) The reason why \\"The Devil's Dictionary\\" is virtually unknown, ignored in the classroom, and excluded from the list of American classics is that the US is such a God-fearing country. There are two obstacles to this book being afforded its rightful place among the best in American lit: the devil in the title and the atheism of the author. (One can only guess what Bierce would have written after putting together the Biblical story of Jesus throwing the businessmen out of the temple and the decision to inscribe \\"In God We Trust\\" on American money, for example. Ambrose, we need you so badly!)"},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"The Devil has nothing on Bierce, (except maybe a pretty good blackmail file with color photographs). Bierce plays with the English language and presents his cynical and humorous view of the world. Biting satire would be appropriate here if the use of an ordinary dictionary were permitted. With Bierce's included definition: \\"Satire, n. An obsolete kind of literary composition in which the vices and follies of the authors enemies were expounded with imperfect tenderness.\\" However, this book isn't obsolete, but becomes more evidently true as time goes on. An excellent list of definitions that insult everyone in general and everyone in particular. This book is a necessary tool to carry in your pocket and correct people's definitions at cocktail parties. You could tell people the definition of a Saint, 'n. A dead sinner revised and edited'.

In fact, he was actually invalided out of the Army after being shot in the head, and only after that did he become a writer. Perhaps his experiences in the war generally, and that catastrophic wound in particular, did something to his mind, because his writing remains unparalleled in the annals of dark, sardonic wit.Not least among the products of Bierce's twisted view of the world is his famous (or perhaps one should say infamous) \\"Devil's Dictionary\\". Like most of Bierce's work, the diabolical entries in his dictionary originally appeared in a series of newspaper articles, and only later were collated into a single volume.Bierce was primarily a journalist and short story writer, who did not write novels, and perhaps that explains the principal reason why he is not as well remembered today as are many of his lesser literary contemporaries. The fact that his \\"Devil's Dictionary\\" defines the novel as \\"A short story padded\\" speaks volumes of the author's disdain towards that particular literary form.Nevertheless, no person who considers himself truly literate and educated can afford not to be acquainted with the work of the incomparable Bierce, and most particularly with his unique \\"Devil's Dictionary\\"."},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"I've got several editions of this, most recently on my Kindle.

I could not put it down. You don't read this book sequentially, but rather it is a book to leaf through, stopping where you find a word that interests you. With the format of a dictionary, Bierce sets up the look and feel of the official word, which is what we expect from a dictionary. Then, reading the definitions, you at first think, &quot;Bierce is being a wise guy.&quot; But after a few more definitions, you realize that Bierce is actually delivering a concise treatise on Western Culture by giving you a shot-by-shot commentary, using as his basis the essential element of any society -- its language. Birece may not have realized it when he wrote the book, but The Devil's Dictionary aligns with some 21st-century literary experimentations with concise presentation, irony, and non-linear exploration. Even reading it non-linearly, however, you soon find you've read every entry in the book. Then, of course, you'll want to start again...My favorites are the definitions pertaining to religion."},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Beginning in 1881 and continuing to 1906, Ambrose Bierce created a series of sardonic word definitions of his own. Many of these were collected and published as The Cynic's Word Book, which he later protested was \\"a name which the author had not the power to reject or happiness to approve.\\" So in 1911, he pulled together a collection that was more to his own liking and called it The Devil's Dictionary. The entries are a tad uneven in quality, but most are amusing and some are great. Each reader will have his own favorites, some of mine are as follows : ACQUAINTANCE, n. A person whom we know well enough to borrow from, but not well enough to lend to. A degree of friendship called slight when its object is poor or obscure, and intimate when he is rich or famous. ALLIANCE, n. In international politics, the union of two thieves who have their hands so deeply inserted in each other's pockets that they cannot separately plunder a third. BIGOT, n. One who is obstinately and zealously attached to an opinion that you do not entertain. BORE, n. A person who talks when you wish him to listen. CONSULT, v.i. To seek another's disapproval of a course already decided on. CYNIC, n. A blackguard whose faulty vision sees things as they are, not as they ought to be. Hence the custom among the Scythians of plucking out a cynic's eyes to improve his vision. DICTIONARY, n. A malevolent literary device for cramping the growth of a language and making it hard and inelastic. This dictionary, however, is a most useful work. DISCRIMINATE, v.i. To note the particulars in which one person or thing is, if possible, more objectionable than another. EDUCATION, n. That which discloses to the wise and disguises from the foolish their lack of understanding. FUTURE, n. That period of time in which our affairs prosper, our friends are true and our happiness is assured. HISTORY, n. An account mostly false, of events mostly unimportant, which are brought about by rulers mostly knaves, and soldiers mostly fools.... A member of a large and powerful tribe whose influence in human affairs has always been dominant and controlling... He has the last word in everything; his decision is unappealable. He sets the fashions and opinion of taste, dictates the limitations of speech and circumscribes conduct with a dead-line. POLITICS, n. A strife of interests masquerading as a contest of principles. The conduct of public affairs for private advantage. And, my choice for the very best among them : CONSERVATIVE, n. A statesman who is enamored of existing evils, as distinguished from the Liberal, who wishes to replace them with others. By all means, read it and pick out your own; you're sure to find a few that tickle your fancy. GRADE : A"},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"'The Devil's Dictionary' is an interesting, very intellectually cynical collection of proposed definitions to words collected by Ambrose Gwinett Bierce, a journalist, writer, Civil War veteran, and general misanthrope, who disappeared without a trace in Mexico about 1914. In the words of H.L. Mencken, Bierce has produced 'some of the most gorgeous witticism of the English language.' Bierce delights in irreverence and poking fun at all aspects of life.Bierce's own definition of dictionary gives some insight into his general thought patterns:'Dictionary, n. A malevolent literary device for cramping the growth of a language and making it hard and inelastic. This dictionary, however, is a most useful work.'This would lead us to conclude (most correctly) that Bierce is a world-class cynic. What is a cynic?'Cynic, n. A blackguard whose faulty vision sees things as they are, not as they ought to be. Hence the custom among the Scythians of plucking out a cynic's eyes to improve his vision.'Originally published under the title 'The Cynic's Word Book', most of the definitions in this book originally appeared as part newspaper columns. There have been many imitators, but this is the first and finest collection. Arranged as a dictionary, it provides an interesting writer's tool for finding a unique perspective on words and phrases. There are more than 1000 entries. A few examples include:'Outdo, v.t., To make an enemy.''Universalist, n. One who foregoes the advantage of a Hell for persons of another faith.'Fair warning -- those who do not like cynicism and scathing wit will find this book irritating, and sometimes offensive. Bierce is a product of his generation; political correctness wasn't in vogue then, and, even if it had been, Bierce would have been one of the sharpest critics.As a Christian priest, I take great delight in the insights from Bierce's criticism of religion in general, and Christianity in particular.'Christian, n. One who believes that the New Testament is a divinely inspired book admirably suited to the needs of his neighbor. One who follows the teachings of Christ in so far as they are not inconsistent with a life of sin.'Why does this ring so true? Of course, there is the old adage that if you scratch a cynic, you'll find an idealist. Bierce would undoubtedly have described himself as a realist, but buried beneath many layers of cynicism, one can sense the idealism.Why did Bierce go to Mexico? Perhaps his underlying idealism led him to a country that was awash in revolutionary ideas; perhaps those ideas are what cost him his life. Perhaps he went underground? It is possible we will never know.The publisher of this volume, one of but many reprints of the text over time, says: 'The caustic aphorisms collected in \\"The Devil's Dictionary\\" helped earn Ambrose Bierce the epithets Bitter Bierce, the Devil's Lexicographer, and the Wickedest Man in San Francisco. The words he shaped into verbal pitchforks a century ago--with or without the devil's help--can still draw blood today.'This book is very useful for generating ideas for writing and reflection. It is a good counterpoint to 'guides to positive thinking' kinds of material, and can serve as a tempering agent on such collections."},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"I'd skip this and purchase the UNABRIDGED version. Some of the definitions left out in this version are among Bierce's best. Also, the complete work is not so long: no reason to abridge something that in full length is only 100 or so pages long."},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"Bierce's misanthropy and glorious cynicism remain a breath of fresh air, never having lost their ring of truth for the better part of a century. His aversion for hypocrisy, formal education (He was of humble origins and self-educated), and religious self-righteousness are appropriately barbed. His disillusionment with concepts such as patriotism (&quot;The first refuge of a scoundrel&quot;), are particularly interesting, considering his rural midwestern upbringing and heroic service in the Civil War. The most consistent and I think interesting theme throughout this volume is his disdain for the institution of marriage. Long before marriage was seen by many as a burden and divorce became unstigmatized and commonplace, Bierce's definition seems prophetic for his time: &quot;An institution consisting of a master, a mistress, and two slaves, making in all two.&quot;"},{"Title":"The devil's dictionary (The 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature)","review":"This edition doesn't obliterate all the merits of a literary classic, but it comes remarkably close.Do yourself and Ambrose Bierce a favor: purhcase a copy of The Devil's Dictionary put out by a reputable publisher instead. Whoever released this version didn't see fit to identify themselves, possibly for fear of crmininal proscecution. Defiling a literary masterpiece may not be a crime in the United States, but this release makes a good case for it becoming one.Overlooking the fact no biographical or editorial information was deemed necessary for inclusion, the thugs involved in this crime weren't even responsible enough to check the accuracy of the text. In one instance, the use of the word \\"is\\" for \\"if\\" is obvious enough for the reader to reconstruct Mr. Bierce's original intention, but in other cases, his words are so carelessly mangled, his meaning is beyond comphrehension.As written by Ambrose Bierce, The Devil's Dicionary is a uniquely wonderful reading experience. If I could rate this version with a negative number, I would gladly do so. As it is, one star will have to do.

Bierce is best known for his ghoulish horror tales, which were on a par with Edgar Allan Poe, but his greatest work was The Devil's Dictionary. A scathing parody of Webster's dictionary, Bierce's volume was a showcase for his brilliant, caustic wit. This is Bierce at his best, mixing comedy with social commentary, unleashing his anarchistic convictions to the hilt! Bierce blasts away at God and country and all that is respected and proper. He defines patriot as &quot;the dupe of statesmen and the tool of conquerors&quot;, a Conservative as &quot;a statesman who is enamored of existing evils&quot; and a clergyman as &quot;a man who undertakes the management of our spiritual affairs as a method of bettering his temporal ones&quot; and so on. Nothing is sacred and no one is safe in this classic work of 19th century American literature which continues to attract just as much controversy and outrage today as it did when it was first published.

Not all of the definitions are funny, but the majority of them really take no prisoners and it is very good at pointing out the little things we all still see in this modern day and age -- those little things we think to ourselves but dare not say outloud.The only problem with it is that, true to its time, there are some racist and mysogynistic overtones to some of the definitions [the only reason it didn't get a full five].

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Plato: Phaedo","review":"Plato's immortal Phaedo is here presented in a beautiful translation, with, surprisingly, a commentary that sheds new light on the meaning of this foundational dialogue. According to the authors of the commentary, it is a dialogue written to steel Socrates' friends, and through them us (the readers),for the final inescapable act in life--our dying--and to show through Socrates--his courage in the face of present death, and his words of encouragement to both companions and friends as he slowly approaches death's doorway--that a life lived well (which is what Socrates himself tried to do) is proof enough, or ought to be, against our fear of entering the unknown world that awaits each of us upon our death.The commentators--professors at St John's College--offer an interpretation of some of Plato's symbolisms in the dialogue that is both surprising and deeply revealing. (But I won't spoil things by announcing what these symbols are and mean; you'll have to read this wonderful book for yourself to discover that--and perhaps grow from it,too, as Plato/Socrates would have desired.)I have read this dialogue, in other translations, more than 20 times, at least, since college--yet surprise after surprise greeted me as I read through this truly insightful introduction. The authors ought to be given the ancient Greek Olympic prize (free food for life) for their brillance and insight.

However, this book did not mark any of them. Also, it seems like this piece wasn't edited at all. Many of the passages have random characters like c& just left in the middle of a sentence. Also, whenever there is a translated verse which has caused controversy among the translating community, the book will add parenthetical statements as long as a paragraph to discuss (in a very convoluted way) the different translations which may be substituted.All in all: I'm really not sure what I bought, but I had to do my entire reading assignment by finding Phaedo online for free.

I highly recommend it to readers both beginning to read Plato and those well seasoned. The introduction is informative, and Brann's expertise in classical Greek and philosophy shines through."},{"Title":"Plato: Phaedo","review":"\\"Phaedo\\" is one of Plato's best and most important works. Though well worth reading by itself, the fact that it is widely anthologized - e.g., in The Trial and Death of Socrates - makes it very hard to justify a standalone.Though apparently early and not as complex or philosophically influential as later ones, \\"Phaedo\\" is immensely important in portraying Socrates' death. Along with the aforementioned dialogues, it is our clearest picture of the historical Socrates and would be invaluable for this alone. Indeed, I have read hundreds - perhaps thousands - of books, and this is one of my ten or so favorites, mostly because of how moving the depiction of the great man's last days is. The story of Socrates' last moments is part of world literature's very fabric, an immortal part of Western cultural heritage. However, the works have great value even aside from this; a few have indeed questioned their historical veracity. This does not affect their philosophical, literary, and political worth, which is of the highest, making the book doubly essential.\\"Phaedo\\" ostensibly details Socrates' last moments, including his last look at his wife and child, his last dialogue, his last words to friends, and his actual death. A large part of Socrates' image comes from this, and its potential historical value is inconceivable, though its historicity can easily be doubted since the work itself strongly suggests that Plato was not there. Even so, it is likely accurate in regard to the things that really matter and certainly a fine account of how it very well could have been. It is extremely moving; shot through with pathos, it is one of the most affecting things I have ever read. One can surely not read it without being overcome by emotion; I can hardly even think of it without misty eyes. Anyone who respects and admires this central Western civilization figure will be profoundly touched; his famous last words seem comic out of context but are very much otherwise here, telling us much about Socrates and moving us yet further. This would be one of the greatest works of all-time if it had no other aspect, but it is also a fine dialogue appropriately dealing mostly with death. Plato examines perennial questions like the soul's immortality and metempsychosis very thoroughly and thought-provokingly, and the conclusion - unsurprisingly, given the circumstances - has uncharacteristic certainty. It may not convince our cynical, empiricist, science-loving, twentieth century-surviving age, but the argument is certainly well-made and in many ways admirable. The dialogue touches on other important subjects also and is generally seen as the culmination of Plato's early, Socrates-centered thought.The ever-important translation issue must also be kept in mind. It goes without saying that anyone who cares about intellectual issues, especially applied ones, must know Plato, as should anyone who wants to be even basically well-read. However, this is far easier said than done for most; he is so different from what now passes for literature, to say nothing of pop culture, that he is virtually inaccessible to general readers. Yet the importance of persevering cannot be overemphasized; the payoff is well worth the effort. As nearly always in such cases, reading him becomes far easier after the initial difficulty; no attentive reader will ever think Plato easy reading, but he is utterly absorbing once we get used to his style. He has a near-poetic beauty that all agree has never even been remotely approached in philosophy, and such mesmerizing prose is rare in any genre. His dialogues are an incredible form at once intellectually and aesthetically pleasing - an inspired combination that has perhaps never been bettered; many have appropriated it, but none have matched it. All this means that picking the right translation is probably more important with Plato than any other writer. This Benjamin Jowett translation is now quite old but still very accessible; it will work quite well for most, but anyone struggling should try a more recent version. For the average reader, the more recent, the better is generally true. The important thing is to read Plato in some form, and those who happen on a translation that does not work for them should keep trying until their mind opens in a truly new way - and once done, it will never close again."},{"Title":"Plato: Phaedo","review":"I have no desire to critique Plato or to give a synopsis of his Phaedo. What drew me to this review is actually the translators' introduction. Brann, Kalkavage and Salem do, what I think, is an excellent job at breaking down the imagery and themes of the piece while adding a tremendous amount of background. If this were my first encounter with Plato or Greek thought in general, I would find the introduction to be infinitely valuable. For example, the translators point out that Socrates' execution is being postponed due to a celebration. As it goes, each year the Athenians, in accordance to their vow to Apollo, send an emissary to Delos. Before they return, the city must keep itself pure and not put anyone to death. This is to commemorate Theseus' recovery of fourteen young Athenians from the Minotaur of Crete. Now in the Phaedo, Socrates is Theseus, the fourteen present are the same from the Minotaur's labyrinth and the Minotaur represents death itself. Personally, I found that little bit of information both charming and useful. The introduction is jam-packed full of such goodies that will help the reader gain a deeper understanding of this piece than if he or she were to just read it alone."},{"Title":"Plato: Phaedo","review":"If it was up to me to preserve just one of the dialogues of Plato for posterity it would be the Phaedo. That is because this is the metaphysical core of the teachings of Socrates (the main character) as told by Plato. As is emphasized in the text, death is the main topic of concern for the true philosopher- and that is what is covered here. However, there is nothing morbid about it. This is a message of hope, for Socrates establishes the divinity and immortality of the soul. The good man, he who has purified himself through the love of wisdom (Philosophy) goes to a higher, purer realm to be with like-minded souls and the gods themselves. The bad man also goes to his just reward with those of like character.If I was to abstract the core truth here it would be that the true philosopher is always trying to free his soul from the body- for only then is the soul free of the distractions and distortions that can corrupt it and keep it from direct perception of the Ideals (Absolute Truth, Good, Beauty, and Justice.)You easily see where the Church borrowed so much of its basic theological underpinnings. In fact, reading this work abolishes forever in your mind the idea that the pre-Christian pagans were in anyway necessarily savage or barbaric in their deepest spiritual beliefs. This is spirituality more pure than anything preached by the Church- and it is supported by reasoned argument and not appeal to empty faith and authority.The closing of the dialog is probably the finest depiction in Western literature of the death of a great and good man. You truly concur that Socrates was indeed the wisest and justest and best of all men."},{"Title":"Plato: Phaedo","review":"Socrates is unique among philosophers, not just for his place among the early Greek philosophers, but also for the fact that he is the most famous philosopher to never write his own books. What we know of Socrates comes from contemporary accounts and students, most particularly Plato.Set in 399 BCE, the Phaedo is a reconstruction of Socrates final conversations with friends on the day he died.

Since you're reading this I guess you're interested in Plato's philosophy and this work in particular. I'll just say few words and then will let you to dive into the book and find the meaning for yourself.This is the book that belong to Plato's later works, and debate continues whether Socrates in this book is historical Socrates or just voice of Plato. If you take into consideration few Aristotelian lines than first option would be the true one. But, no matter which one is right, Socrates here is presented as few characters of world literature are. I can not speak about philosophy here, so I shall speak about style. Bearing the posture of romantic poets, and if you picture ancient greek dungeon as some reneiscance castle dungeon, you'll have the setting. And tht's it.

Why does the philosopher seek death but avoid suicide? What is so attractive about death to Socrates?This is a masterpiece of a book. While Socrates does not prove the immortality of the soul, his arguments for such, as in the \\"law of opposites,\\" the \\"theory of recollection\\" and the combination of the two, make way for a very interesting and mind enhancing read and is a hell of lot more valid, intelligible and religiously inclusive than any of the biblical literalist's security hold in fallacious illusion, or was Socrates and Plato infallibly inspired? Was Homer infallibly inspired? Of course not. In turn, Socrates is counter-argued with the \\"theory of attunement\\" and subsequently argues back for the immortality of the soul.His thoughts which entail the body as the inhibitor of obtaining true wisdom, that philosophy aids a man to go beyond his body, so that at death he can be released from the body and use his wisdom to achieve a higher realm of true wisdom, as the body acts as a place of desires that prevents men from perceiving the world of ideas apart from the world of appearances. The death of the body is the release of the soul and the condition of the soul, either that controlled by desires or that of philosophy that has brought it to a higher realm, will determine where the soul travels to after death.Socrates further gives us a description of the round, spherical earth. This exposes the fallacy of biblical literalists who attempt to prove biblical divinity by quoting Job 40:22 and Isaiah for the spherical earth, or does that make Socrates inspired? His further description of the earth's hollows by water and the place called Tartarus brings us to the identical words of St. Paul, who certainly was influenced by many non-Christian teachings, which permeated his entire belief system. Also Socrates gets Eastern in the reincarnation of the soul back to the world of desires, including that of animals and insects, which makes this book a fascinating read to say the least. This book is a gem and great masterpiece to contemplate on. I love Plato - and Socrates too."},{"Title":"Plato: Phaedo","review":"I guess the main idea here is whether or not the soul is immortal.Does the soul exist outside of this physical, earthly experience ?I've only begun reading Plato after years of reading a lot of other new age type books such as the Edgar Cayce material and Dr. Brian Weiss.Plato is often consistent with those new age ideas but he expresses his thoughts in a more poetic way.Plato and those others believed in reincarnation and even being reborn as an animal.A new age theory about this is that if you go back to 10,500 BC and beyond you had a lot of people running around with for example the body of a human being but the head of a horse, tree branches for arms, etc..Most people had tails back then.This was a result of people projecting themselves into this physical dimension and getting entangled in the animal and plant worlds. As they did this across multiple incarnations they started to develop those animal appendages in their physical bodies.It was in ancient Egypt around 10,500 BC that the priest Ra Ta and other Atlanteans helped these \\"things\\" to rid themselves of these animal characteristics.That \\"mystery of mysteries\\" the sphinx is a creature that is part human and part lion. Don't think this doesn't have some very deep and hidden meaning.Another key point in the book is the death of Socrates. He dies like a true philosopher, not in fear, but calmly.At one point Socrates actually proves that one plus one is not equal to two.

The translation (1) has a flowing literary style that does justice to the rich feel of reading Plato's own prose, (2) is remarkably precise in its reflecting of the original language, with the result that, when one notices something interesting going on in the language of the translation, one will consistently find it is reproducing what is found in the Greek. In both these ways, this is a very trustworthy text--the reader can confidently presume to be experiencing Plato's writing. The dialogue itself--Plato's _Phaedo_--has few parallels for philosophical, literary and cultural depth and importance. It is the conversation Socrates has on the day of his death with a number of philosophical admirers. It is a rich discussion of the nature of knowledge, the nature of virtue, the ultimate nature of reality and especially the nature of death itself. The introduction by the translators is also uncommonly good for putting the reader in a position to read the text well. This is the only translation of the _Phaedo_ that I will assign to my classes.

The Phaedo preserves the moment where Socrates earned his immortality, forced to commit suicide by the Athenian democracy.Oxford's edition is the only accessible volume to give the Phaedo the individual treatment it merits. Gallop's translation is clear, dramatic, naturalistic, and compelling. Included are an extensive introduction, an outline of the arguments of the dialogue, and copious explanatory notes, as well as a bibliography for further reading.To hear Socrates lecturing his students on the nature of the soul and his assurance of the life to come as the moment of his execution approaches is inspiring and uplifting. As great as any Greek tragedy, the Phaedo recreates a moment where one of the greatest of men shuffles off his mortal coil and &quot;puts on immortality.&quot; A powerful, moving, and transforming read; not to be missed!"},{"Title":"Plato: Phaedo","review":"The Phaedo is a third-person account of the philosophical discussion between Socrates and his friends on the day of his death. Socrates accepts his fate most amicably, arguing that death is the means by which to achieve the aims of true philosophy, for only by escaping the evil of the body can the soul truly acquire wisdom. Socrates renews his argument that learning is in fact recollection, supposedly proving that the soul exists before birth. He also argues that everything comes from its opposite; if death comes from life, then life must come from death. The proofs he offers for his belief that the soul is eternal do not strike me as very convincing.As the account of Socrates' final hours, the Phaedo is a corollary of sorts to the Apology and Crito, but it addresses certain themes those earlier dialogues did not. In many ways, the Phaedo is a precursor to much of the philosophy of The Republic, in which the concepts of the eternal soul and the invisible Forms addressed here are threshed out much more satisfactorily. Given the importance of these concepts later in The Republic and the formative yet lengthy discussion of them here in the Phaedo, this is a crucial dialogue in terms of understanding the overall philosophical arguments of Plato."},{"Title":"Plato: Phaedo","review":"My reading in Plato begun with Parmenides. Which is pity, to think about it, since Parmenides is to this day considered to be one of the most esoteric. Contrast to Parmenides, where young Socrates stands up against this old thinker, Phaedo reveals old Socrates who now discusses things in fully down-to-earth terms. In fact, Socrates at this time is a dying one. And his tragic end is so well presented that it actually reads like a novel. Back to my point, this book is, I think, the most appropriate as a starter. Then you could trace back to Plato's more abstract discussions. Nowhere in Plato's works his conception of the idea is more clearly explained than in Phaedo. This also summarizes Plato's outlining of philosophy. A must-read."},{"Title":"Plato: Phaedo","review":"This book is combination of poetry and philosophy. The time before the death of Socrates and his last great teachings. It is a mile-stone in ethics. Socrates teachings can (and have been) compared to and elevated above the teachings of Jesus. Along with its ethical value, the book reads magnificantly. 'Phaedo' gives Plato his rightfull place as an all time great writer in the company of Homer, Shakspeare, and Goethe."},{"Title":"Plato: Phaedo","review":"_If it was up to me to preserve just one of the dialogues of Plato for posterity it would be the Phaedo. That is because this is the metaphysical core of the teachings of Socrates (the main character) as told by Plato. As is emphasized in the text, death is the main topic of concern for the true philosopher- and that is what is covered here. However, there is nothing morbid about it. This is a message of hope, for Socrates establishes the divinity and immortality of the soul. The good man, he who has purified himself through the love of wisdom (Philosophy) goes to a higher, purer realm to be with like-minded souls and the gods themselves. The bad man also goes to his just reward with those of like character._If I was to abstract the core truth here it would be that the true philosopher is always trying to free his soul from the body- for only then is the soul free of the distractions and distortions that can corrupt it and keep it from direct perception of the Ideals (Absolute Truth, Good, Beauty, and Justice.)_You easily see where the Church borrowed so much of its basic theological underpinnings. In fact, reading this work abolishes forever in your mind the idea that the pre-Christian pagans were in anyway necessarily savage or barbaric in their deepest spiritual beliefs. This is spirituality more pure than anything preached by the Church- and it is supported by reasoned argument and not appeal to empty faith and authority._The closing of the dialog is probably the finest depiction in Western literature of the death of a great and good man. You truly concur that Socrates was indeed \\"the wisest and justest and best of all men.\\""},{"Title":"Plato: Phaedo","review":"The introductory essay of this edition is superb. It emphasises the monster in us that need to be slayed to free ourselves. That monster, ie the Minotour, is originated in the opening passages of Phaedo.Phaedo explains why there is a considerable gap of time between the sentencing and the carrying out of the execution. He refers to the myth of Theseus saving 14 people from the monster Minotour.Socrates is the Theseus, he is saving the 14 people who are with him at that time (see 59B for a list of the 14 companions of Socrates). The Minotour is the fear of death and the fear of argument (logos).The book itself is also divided into 14 sections:I. OpeningII. Separateness and the care of deathIII.Argument from contrariesIV.Argument from recollectionV. Songs for childrenVI. Argument from invisibilityVII. Lyre and the weaverVIII.

Though his arguments often make bold jumps that are difficult to reconcile, he does a more than admirable job of molding a logical argument for the existence of the soul, by taking on a number of possible objections to the theory, objections which are both abstract and somewhat scientific in nature. By likening the soul to the Forms, or the basic abstract properties of the universe, he argues that the soul not only must exist, but must also exist indefinitely, due to its very nature. This book is no doubt worth the read, as it provides an exceptional reflection on death and human mortality, and is a great starting point for Plutonian philosophy."},{"Title":"Its All Right Now","review":"Charles Chadwick's It's All Right Now is simply a lovely novel, a beautiful read that I was sorry to see end. The narrator, Tom Ripple, begins writing down his thoughts on his life in the early 1970s, essentially so he can look a little more busy at his dull job. He seems to be about thirty at this point and is frankly not a very likeable protagonist. He is married with two children and eventually his wife leaves him. At the start of the novel, his main pasttime seems to be watching television. He keeps writing, however, and as his life progresses, he grows into a likeable, thoughtful man, a good friend, a loving father. There really isn't much of a plot in the novel, no one thing other than Ripple's character development as he searches for meaning in his life, in any life. But with the way Chadwick writes, for some reason, I found I didn't miss the plot. Ripple is a remarkable character and I found myself truly enjoying this novel. It is a rich, highly satisfying work, one that I believe will stay with me for quite some time. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Its All Right Now","review":"Ever grow sick of hearing about the next great writer, usually young, usually an enfant terrible?Then you may be plesasntly delighted to find the book which (I'll admit) takes some time to grow on you....but oh, the rewards are great!Written by a British civil servant, Charles Chadwick, this book took 28 years to complete(!) and the result is a finely nuanced plot that unfolds slowly, not in the brief snippets of sound bites that we've gotten so used to in real life. This is a book to savor, as Chadwick unfurls the life of Tom Ripple, a man who simply records his perceptions about life."},{"Title":"Its All Right Now","review":"Let me start by saying it is 100 degrees around here, my air conditioning is broken, and I am sweating like Patrick Ewing.Yet I am still going to give this book the VERY RARE 5 Stars. I love the glacial pacing of the character development, the deliberate advancing of the plot, and the way Chadwick does sadness. It will make you ache.Perhaps those who don't care for this book prefer the leaden dialogue and Must See TV pacing of foul crap like \\"Angels and Demons.\\" Who knows? Put on some Ahmad Jamal, pour a glass or ten of wine, and get lost in the world of Tom Ripple."},{"Title":"Its All Right Now","review":"Charles Chadwick's sprawling (682 page) novel is an amazing feat. It takes a mighty story to glue a reader's eyes to a tome of this size and that is why this is such an odd victory: there really is no 'story' per se, just the private musings of a man who describes himself as a gray being - \\"I've noted before, I think, that the impression I seem to give is one of neutrality. I feel pretty neutral about that.\\" Language of this sort becomes not that of ennui but of profound introspection on a perceived common life.Tom Ripple is a loner, avoiding contact with other humans whenever possible, a man who goes to extremes to just be anonymous. His main driver appears to being convinced that he - and the rest of the world's inhabitants - are simply 'all right'. He avoids interaction with neighbors (even a disarmingly acute need to confront a pederast) and with troubled people in general. His aloof stance creates a safety cocoon for him: \\"A friendship loomed, making me feel decidedly unfriendly. I accepted of course.\\" Though events occur (in abundance) around him, Ripple skirts them or at best denies any interest in intervention.Yet despite the continuing pages of interior dialogue by a man removed from the world while walking the turf of that world, there is something about Tom Ripple that creates an indelible character, one of those literary creatures that become part of our vocabulary. Think 'Rabbit Run', 'Catcher in the Rye' and at the same time remember this is the first novel by a 72-year-old author! Quite an achievement. Let's hope there are more books from this Charles Chadwick. Grady Harp, August 05"},{"Title":"Its All Right Now","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer. This starts slowly. In fact, at about 120 pages I still wasn't sure I was even enjoying what I was reading. (This is partly affected by the blurb inside the front cover which gives away some plot points, so you are waiting for them to happen as you are reading.) But then, I got sucked in. The book is nothing but the typed thoughts of the main character, but as he gets older, you know more and more about him and his family, and he became a friend I felt I was listening to. The plot of the book could probably be summed up in 5 sentences, so don't read it for plot. Read it if you find you like the author's voice. I found myself genuinely sad at the end of the book."},{"Title":"Its All Right Now","review":"Like one of the earlier reviewers, I was sorry to see Charles Chadwick's It's All Right Now end. The story is a first-person narrative told by Tom Ripple (the everyman who makes \\"ripples\\" rather than waves with his life and work), and Mr. Ripple is engaging enough that you miss hearing his story when the 700 plus pages are done.That said, I am a patient reader, but I thought Mr. Chadwick's editors did him a great disservice letting this book go on so long. There are large portions of the book that are quite tedious and should simply have been cut. Way too much description of setting and characters' looks, which wears on a reader when the book is already so long and so without conventional plot. The most interesting parts of the book are about Ripple's family (we see the family and Ripple develop over about 30 years' time) and his philosophical ruminations on finding meaning in life in the face of the fact that we are all going to die.Still, as I said above, I was sorry when Chadwick's book ended. Ripple is a bit morose in his musings, but he's smart enough and real enough that I miss hearing from him. This book will stay with me for a long time."},{"Title":"Its All Right Now","review":"Quite simply the most engrossing, moving, funny, intelligent book I've come across this century. To simply draw parallels, as some have done, between Tom Ripley and Harry Angstrom, of \\"Rabbit...\\" and allude to this book as the British equivalent thereof would be a grave error and fall far short of the mark. This guy's writing is sharp as a tack, witty as hell, and each and every sentence simply will not let you go...hence my Dickens reference, and, believe me, I don't reference our greatest novelist lightly! There were times while reading this one that I was so touched, so affected, that i had to put it down and ruminate for a spell before i was ready to pick it up again. Do yourself a favor and remember why you love reading so much."},{"Title":"Its All Right Now","review":"I agree with the other reviews except I thought it was totally involving throughout. As my days went by there was always a background of Tom Ripple that drew me to continued reading. Hard to shake off his philosophy and world view.Also, I dont find anyone talking about the humor which starts on page one. True, he does evolve, but his basic goodness and acceptance of life is apparent from the start. The punning is clever and often hilarious; particularly the reactions of the other characters to his broad based humor. I loved it when he interacts with Fogarty whom he recognizes as his match. There are so many gems to savor.I would like to read his unpublished novels.This is a must read book."},{"Title":"Its All Right Now","review":"Because of the length of the book, you know you're in it for the long hall. But it is very well written and very, very funny. It is actually dense with humor, and sometimes you must re-read sentences in order to follow the train of thought, because the author, literally, does not let up. The character is fascinating: pathetic, winning, selfish, charming, lost, hilarious all at the same time. I had just finished reading the very powerful and very dark, Revolutionary Road, by Richard Yates, and I very much needed some humor. Some of the same issues, regarding marriage, work, life, exist in both books, but It's All Right Now made me feel able to \\"meet the day\\" again with laughter, and a more gentle irony."},{"Title":"Its All Right Now","review":"This is decidedly not a book you can't put down. It's more a book you keep putting down and returning to later. Written as a fictional memoir, it is comprised of a large number of vignettes along the fictional author's life. As such, it would have been an excellent novel for serializing. There isn't enough action or drive to keep you reading hour after hour, but there is enough charm to keep you coming back. So this is best as a book to work through in pieces when you are between other books or just want a short stretch of light reading.At heart it is the reflections of an undistinguished man with a sense of humor about all the people around him, and about the life he leads but is largely detached from. It is filled with excellent character studies, but that only adds to the episodic nature of the journey. It is a book worth reading, but only on its own terms. Don't expect to be sucked in and swept away."},{"Title":"Its All Right Now","review":"Chadwick has written an engrossing story of a man trying to make sense of the world in which he lives and sometimes (often) doesn't seem to fit. The book spans most of its narrator's life, focusing intently on the years he was married and had two children, to the years after his divorce and the decades of loneliness and partial triumphs and the continuing hope of finding love (or at least a simpatico companion) as he, Tom Ripple, tries to find his place in the sun. It is a journey into the heart of the heart of a man that is reminiscent of Tolstoy's journey into the hope of Levin's search for meaning in ANNA KARENINA, or Prince Andre's in WAR & PEACE. I mean to say that for the delination of character, Charles Chadwick is that good, approaching his subject with an open mind and an enduring compassion that makes you fall in love with him and the pure wisdom of his words. ITS ALL RIGHT NOW is a big book, but it's a fast read and Chadwick needed those many pages in order to tell his story the most fulfilling and expressive way it can be told. For insight into human behavior, Chadwick is as good as any humanist writing today."},{"Title":"Its All Right Now","review":"Charles Chadwick's first published novel (he's 72) is amazing. Tom Ripple, a self-confessed \\"ordinary man,\\" records his perceptions of women, marriage, and his relationships with children, neighbors and British society, over 30 or more years.Tom's is a unique and enthralling narrative voice. Self-effacing yet sly, it draws the reader into Tom's head and before long, one begins to sympathize with this seemingly unsympathetic character. Tom does, almost imperceptibly, grow in insight over the years. His obsession with sex diminishes as he ages. He becomes more aware of the feelings of others as he experiences the physical decline and loneliness of age.This is not a novel of great events or grand actions. It is rather a leisurely-paced, nuanced view of an ordinary life, told in a fresh, expert and extraordinary style. I hope Chadwick has another book in the works."},{"Title":"Its All Right Now","review":"I was impressed by the cover blurbs from Jonathan Safran Foer and Benjamin Kunkel and, since I found the book used for $2, figured it was worth a shot. Chadwick is obviously a talented writer, but to like this book, you must want to listen to the very particular voice of the narrator. I gave up after about ten pages.Here's a short excerpt (from pp. 40-41) that, I think, fairly represents the book:\\"To continue that line of thought a little while longer: I've read of ugly men who have been exceptionally successful lovers -- this going along with women not being much fussed about physical beauty. That's probably piffle but reinforces (exacerbates?) the pleasure of contemplating the day when the man is the sex object. I have been known to have absurd thoughts on this prospect, being glanced at, say, on the Underground as some girls are (by that sort of girl) and not glancing away, oh dear me no, slipping my visiting card into her possession by various subterfuges, or being followed up the escalator and accidentally bumped into in the street, therefrom on to a pub and thence ad libitum, to become thoroughly Latin about it. I doubt this ever happens the other way around. Men haven't got the bollocks, to coin a phrase. . . . If I ramble on a bit more like this I might get it out of my system -- not that that is what it is, shambling about all over the place as it does, and as for getting it out of it, no chance of that, it being largely what the system is or would be if there was anything systematic about it.\\"If you like this sort of thing and can imagine sitting through 679 pages of it, knock yourself out."},{"Title":"Its All Right Now","review":"We are having so much fun with Charles Chadwick's book.

There are so few really good men in the world today and,oddly, Tom Ripple is one of the best. I became so fond of this poignant man. Then my husband started the marathon reading. \\"When's it going to get better,\\" he moaned. But soon he, too, was captured, sunk into Tom's on-going life story. Next, we gave it to a neighbor. \\"I'm up to Poland and didn't get any sleep last night,\\" she complained. So it goes, a ground swell for a voice that we can't forget. We keep talking about this bewildered man whose instincts carry him and us through difficult times. It really is going to be all right in this old world of ours. Tom Ripple says so and I believe him."},{"Title":"Its All Right Now","review":"This is a very, very long first novel published by a 72 year old Briton. What makes it unique is that the author has chosen to recount in some 679 pages much of the daily life of a quite ordinary, middle class man who is in his 40's (and married with young children) when the story commences (I should estimate in the late 1950's or the 1960's). The novel demonstrates that there can be drama in the \\"untold stories\\" of everyday living. So, don't expect exciting James Bond plots or John Grisham. Rather, the central character (Tom Ripple) commits to paper the commonplace events in his life as they unfold, involving such topics as marriage, divorce, children (both young and as adults), insufferable bosses, growing older, the impact of severe medical conditions, and the consequences of early retirement from one's employment. The novel is in four sections, and carries through until Mr. Ripple appears to be on death's doorstep, as we pass into the 21st century. It is the skill with which the author writes about these common occurrences that makes the novel so interesting. While the book certainly could have done with a bit more concise editing, it never is dull and moves along quite nicely. An illuminating interview with the author is included. If seeking a unique read, this is the book."},{"Title":"Its All Right Now","review":"Slow to start and at times slogging pace and it comes together in an almost haunting fashion. The ordinary and tedious life with mostly faintly fleshed out characters somehow gets somewhere - really not much of anywhere actually which is the only place Ripple could go. Talk about the accidental life! And yet he keeps you around.It's significant that other reviewers also were Updike and Rabbit Angstrom fans. Like the Rabbit stories its hard to get it out of your thoughts after the read."},{"Title":"Its All Right Now","review":"\\"It's All Right Now\\" is an unusual book. It is essentially a diary spanning several decades in the life of Tom Ripple, an unremarkable English fellow. The book starts very slowly and it reminds me of some of Nicholson Baker's works in its excruciatingly detailed descriptions of mundane domestic happenings. To be honest, the first third of the book is tedious, rambling and exhausting and more than once I was tempted to put it away.Chadwick peppers his writing with numerous parenthetical comments and introspective musings and his often clumsy self-aware commentary (\\"You probably skipped most of that\\" and \\"I sit at this typewriter, unable to sleep\\", for example) becomes awkward at times. In one particularly odd scene, Ripple makes some rather creepy observations about his daughter and then reveals his desire to see her naked. He then goes on to ponder the potential \\"wholesomeness\\" of incest. I could have also done without a remarkably vivid description of Tom's threadbare yellow underpants.However, as Chadwick matures, so does his writing. He is at his best when describing the beauty of nature and the weaknesses of his fellow man. Particularly touching are Tom's last conversations with his mother and father as well as an extraordinarily beautiful chapter describing his last meeting with his ill daughter-in-law.People feel comfortable confiding in Tom Ripple, and these moments also ring true. The neighbor with the alcoholic wife, the other neighbor who confesses his constant depression and yet another neighbor with an insane daughter all trust Tom with their secrets. He listens intently and politely to their stories, offers his sympathy and does whatever he can to help.\\"It's All Right Now\\" peters out at the end, but if you stick with it and you can get past Tom Ripple's insecurity and corny jokes, you will be rewarded with occasional eloquent insights and a vivid sense of what it means to live a life of quiet kindness."},{"Title":"Its All Right Now","review":"I was sitting at a 3-6 Hold'em table and made the acquaintance of two Turkish men.

This anointed successor to owner/publisher Sime Silverman created that paper's unique style of slangy abbreviation, a slanguage that has been forgotten in modern times. Green's most famous headline, STIX NIX HICK PIX, from 7/17/35, meant that rural folks didn't like movies about rural folks.VARIETY lingo (&lt;--a good example right there) shortened words that often weren't in need of it. CRIX meant \\"critics,\\" CHIX was a chiseler, CHI meant Chicago. NABES were neighborhoods, B.R. was a bankroll, and B.O. wasn't what you think, but \\"box office.\\" Other terms were quite original. A MUGG was a Variety staffer. A TRENCH UNIONIST played in a pit orchestra. TOOK THE VEIL meant retiring from public life. THIRD SEX is one that survives. Others still in use are OBIT, PREZ, ORG, EATERY, DEEJAY and VIDEO, all words that first appeared in VARIETY.Joe Laurie Jr. was a vaudeville monologist who found a new career on radio, as a regular panelist on \\"Can You Top This?,\\" the riotous joke-telling program. His and Green's knowledge of Show Biz arcania is simply astounding.We learn within the covers of SBFVTV, that television was already a coming thing in 1926, and that the CBS system for color broadcasting was made standard in 1951.

Will Rogers' radio impression of Calvin Coolidge was so spot-on and humorous, the Prez boiled over it.A 1916 Hawaiian-themed song craze resulted in such gems as \\"Yacki Hacki Wicki Wackie Woo,\\" \\"Since Mary McCue Came Back From Honolulu\\" and \\"Yacka Hula Hicki Dula.\\" Too bad there wasn't radio back then!Celebrity passings are noted throughout this chronological popular history. Broadway shows and the film industry are covered as is radio from its infancy. Vaudeville's demise following the perfection of sound films is also detailed.

The reproductions are of a very high quality and clarity, some taking up 2 pages, allowing you to see the textures within the images. The text gives some very good insight on Powers' inspirations and personality, with some very funny stories. My only objections are - 1. There are a number of works produced in a fairly small format (4\\" x 4\\" or less) , and I would've gladly paid more if the publisher had enlarged them and expanded the page count. 2.

This book's large size: 9 by 11.5 - provides ample space to display many stunning examples of his otherworldly artwork in a generous format.At 128 pages the editor was able to include a wide selection of his painting.

They had a metal revolving rack of paperback books. Among these books were Ballantine science fiction and horror books. They were illustrated one and all by an artist named Richard Powers, who used abstract and semi abstract designs the like of which I had never seen before.There was the crouching nude man and the modern balconied buildings and the teardrop space liner with the pregnant belly and the eye in the sky that illustrated Arthur C. Clarke's _Childhood's End_ (1953). There was the grasping hand with the strange human figures in its palm and the manic yellow-and-orange abstract background of Theodore Sturgeon's _More Than Human_ (1955). There were the clenching apelike hands and fuzzy gorilla figures and strange machines for Poul Anderson's _Brain Wave_ (1954). There was the jagged snowman figure, the shooting pink flakes, silver meteor, and polar tripod for James Blish's _The Frozen Year_ (1957). The blue skull with a section of the head whizzing off like a comet for Don Congdon's _Alone by Night_ (1961). The witches and demons and shrunken head motif for Charles Beaumont's _The Fiend in You_ (1962). The jagged toothed figure standing beside the grandfather clock for H.R. Wakefield's _The Clock Strikes Twelve_ (1961).Not all of these paintings are in _The Art of Richard Powers_ (2001), ed. Jane Frank, but many of them are. And there are many more that I have not mentioned. Science fiction has been blessed with a number of highly talented professional artists-- Hans Bok, Ed Emshwiller, Kelly Freas, Lee Brown Coye, Virgil Finlay, and Jack Gaughan come to mind. But how many real giants? I would argue three: John Schoenherr, Chesley Bonestell, and Powers.Classifying the artwork of Powers may be moderately tricky at times. Sometimes a single painting was used on more than one novel. At other times, Powers did more than one painting for a single novel. Sometimes images were recycled. The grasping hand of _More Than Human_ may also be found in an illustration to a juvenile edition of _The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes_. The eye in the sky, the severed skull/head, the Alexander Calderlike robots reappear. But no single Powers painting was ever just like another. He was an original.I was particularly interested in a series of paintings that Powers composed around the imaginary city-world of fFlar. Some of these were originally painted for an illustration to another novel or book. Some were previously unpublished. They represent some of Powers' most off-trail and imaginative acrylics. They include pictures of Ur-cities, games, space prisons, heroes, and creatures.There are interviews with the artist, biographical tidbits ( I didn't know before that Powers had a passionate hatred of Richard Nixon), and an excellent index of his commercial art from 1945 to 1997. This book is a visual treasure. Get it. Save money for a while if you have to. But get it."},{"Title":"The Art of Richard Powers (Paper Tiger)","review":"Andy Partridge, formerly of the band XTC, recently released a very limited run of CD's with instrumental pieces inspired by Powers art, but because of the prohibitive cost of licensing a piece of his actual work for what would only be a 500 CD print run, he decided he'd use an homage picture instead... but what if the Powers estate did it the other way around and licensed Partridge's surreal pieces as an extra for a book of their own?

They will find his skill for characterization (which was always remarkable) honed to an even higher degree of excellence in this piece. The story is autobiographical and deeply felt by Wolfe and he succeeds in transmitting those feelings to the reader. It is my belief that even if he had written nothing else, his reputation could rest comfortably on this piece alone."},{"Title":"The Lost Boy","review":"Thanks to the auspices of the University of North Carolina Press this incarnation of one of the wonders of Thomas Wolfe rises out of the past intact. Apparently the original novella was written in 1937, then edited rather drastically for publication in Redbook (for reasons that are obvious in reading the full novella), the complete and unabridged novella is presented here in a fine edition that includes the illustrations by Ed Lindlof and the obvious commitment of editing by James W. Clark, Jr who also provides an illuminating and sensitive introduction to this edition.Every reader knows Thomas Wolfe's 'Look Homeward, Angel' and so will not be surprised to find this book falling into the same friendly autobiographical vein as Wolfe's other works. The novella is only 77 pages long but the imagery and skillful writing of Wolfe is present on every page. THE LOST BOY refers to Thomas' older brother Grover who died at theyoung age of 12 years form typhoid fever. In this book Grover is recreated for the reader in four parts. The first rhapsodic section is related by Grover himself and the various stores around the Square he remembered - Markham's piano store, the stingy old Crocker's candy store where he bartered for candy using stamps, the Garret's grocery store with pickle barrels, rounds of cheese, coffee grinder, canned fish and other delicacies. The afternoon is in April and the reason for Grover's being there is the World's Fair.In Part II we meet Grover's mother recalling the train trip to St Louis for the Fair and discover that Grover was the favorite of her children: she is trapped in the past, unable to get past the fact that her shining Grover died too young. Yet in this part is also included the reason the story was originally edited: there is an extended section where a Negro man enters Grover's cabin and, according to his mother and to Grover, he must return to 'his own cabin area'. In Part III Grover's older sister remembers the 1904 trip to St Louis and then recalls the details of Grover's illness and subsequent death form Typhoid. Pet IV is related by Thomas Wolfe himself as he returns in 1937 to the house where he and his family lived and speaks with the woman who lives there now - focusing on the large room where Grover died, a room now occupied by the woman's renters.'And then it would be gone again, fading like cloud shadows in the hills, going like faces lost in a dream, coming like the vast, the drowsy rumors of the distant and enchanted Fair, and coming, going, coming, being found and lost, possessed and held and never captured, like lost voices in the mountains, long ago, like the dark eyes and the quiet face, the dark lost boy, my brother, who himself like shadows, or like absence in the house, would come, would go, and would return again.'That is the story - four versions of a lost child - but the beauty of course is in the exquisite writing of Wolfe. He reminds us here of how great literature reads and because of the work of Clark and Lindlof we gain access to a work that has been dormant for far too long. Brilliant little book!

Well, there is one in the 'The lost boy' that I'd say I'll never forget. It goes: 'Light came and went and came again...' I would believe this is the best definition of Time I've ever read. It tells what we all already know - that the Time is here, all around, that it passes, eternally, incessantly, giving us no chance to do anything about it.

It is a compilation of viewpoints, or remembrances, of a boy who died at the age of 12 from typhoid (before there was such a thing as antibiotics). The remembrances are from the relatives' standpoint. The boy was apparently a mature, very intelligent and principled young man. As with the death of all children, the event was a sad one.There was one part which was disturbing, frankly sickening. During a train trip, the mother and son travel from Missouri, which has Jim Crow laws, into Indiana. As soon as the border is crossed, a black passenger moves from the black carriage into the white carriage. The mother objects and the black passenger explains that they are now in Indiana. The boy confronts the man and sends him back to \\"where he belongs,\\" in the process humiliating him. I can understand that Wolfe used that incident to make the point that Grover was courageous and principled, yet the specific instance is nonetheless sickening. This one event marred an otherwise good narration. (I would be curious to know what was Wolfe's stand on the race issue at the time) In short, Grover was no Huck Finn."},{"Title":"Deenie Men","review":"We brought this home from the library about 1945 when I was five.

It's a good read, but is very intellectual and philosophical - not your typical book about all the great God does thru the Saint but rather those great things in the context of life in St. John Vianney's time. Not for a lazy reader - it's too full of deep ideas."},{"Title":"The Cure D'Ars Today: St John Vianney","review":"This is an intriguing and pious treatment of St. John Vianney [1786-1859], but the book defies easy categorization. The outline is clearly the life of the mystical French parish priest best known for his extraordinary grace as a confessor, but the author has skillfully set Vianney in the aftermath of the \\"troubles\\" of his country--the Revolution, the Gallican Church controversy, Napoleon--while from time to time speculating on Vianney's spirituality and pastoral approaches vis-&agrave;-vis the post-Vatican II era.George William Rutler is honest about his feelings toward the Enlightenment. In an extensive appendix he provides an overview of the French Church and its relationships with the succession of governments from Louis XVI and beyond. In Rutler's view the \\"Daughter of the Church\\" was hardly the virginal bride, with most of its clergy and bishops nondescript and woefully lacking in vision and piety. Thomas Mores and John Fishers were hard to come by. Vianney's formative years run concurrent with a quarter-century ecclesiastical malaise, most noticeably in France but in actuality through much of Western Europe.Rutler describes Vianney's youth as the age of \\"the home church,\\" when domestic instruction and prayer carried faithful Frenchmen through a period of persecution, ambivalent priests [or no priests at all, in many circumstances.] He learned to farm but not to read, as Rutler puts it, though his early sense of a priestly calling compelled him to master reading skills, albeit with very modest success. His vocational aspirations were nearly derailed by military draft. For two years Vianney lived underground to avoid conscription. Rutler argues that the Napoleonic cause, poisoned, as it were, with assaults on the lands and the office of the papacy, was beneath the dignity of this pious young man.If there were religious superiors of character in France at this time, Vianney was fortunate to have encountered them in his formative steps to orders. His piety and faith, if not his book learning, seemed have been the deciding factors in his tenuous approval for ordination. Many years later, in my own lifetime, a seminary rector commented to me that \\"piety comes and goes, stupidity remains forever.\\" Vianney would be the exception to the rule.Once ordained, Vianney would serve a brief and rather successful term as an assistant pastor at Ecully until he received his own parish in Ars. Ars in fact had but one church--and seven saloons. The church had recently served as a shrine to the Goddess of Reason, among other things. If anything the residents of Ars were perplexed to see a pastor who actually cared about ringing the bells, providing instruction, and preparing his sermons. As is often the case, pastoral solicitude was not initially welcomed or understood by a people unbothered by matters of the soul, and episodes of enmity from time to time were not unheard of.But Vianney's gift as a confessor, a trait already noticeable at Ecully, soon became noteworthy in Ars as well. Rutler tends to assume that Vianney's remarkably austere life and spiritually are at its heart, and naturally there is truth to this. His fame reached far beyond Ars, but it is hard to gauge what contemporaries really thought of him. I was disappointed that the author did not say more about Vianney's ritual and practice within the confessional rite. For example, did Vianney have a rare perceptive psychological skill set that prompted his penitents to unburden their most secret crimes, vices, and sinful attitudes?For Rutler, the cause is less important than the effects. Not only did Vianney save individual souls, but he seemed engaged in a struggle for the reign of God itself in Ars, a turmoil that brought him face to face with Satan. Rutler treats of the demonic assaults upon the saint with appropriate balance, much as the Evangelists did in recounting Christ's words and deeds of the kingdom. Vianney also wrestled within himself. On three distinct occasions Vianney tried to flee Ars. Again, it is not clear precisely why. The most likely reason is his celebrity status as a confessor, which he probably found annoying and distracting. But most likely, the strain of confessional encounter, coupled with a profound sense of humility and inadequacy, led him to possible scrupulous fear that his penitential ministry just might be an outrageous affront to God in the sacramental forum. To his credit, he recognized these temptations and urges for what they were and did not succumb to them.Rutler's style is philosophical and meditational. He has a love [some might say a lust] for reversing familiar phrases to extract new meanings. While his sympathies lie with a triumphal Church, he is candid in his assessments about bishops and popes who compromised the holiness of the Church by opportunism, pride, fear, or intellectual arrogance. Vianney, in this framework, represents a restoration of the true dignity and spirituality of Holy Orders, a man unsullied by the type of \\"enlightenment\\" that muddled many pulpits in his day.One of the purposes of this book is a restoration of the Sacrament of Penance. Writing in 1988 Rutler could not help but notice the disappearance of personal confession from Roman Catholic life. Rather than rail about it, the author includes a second appendix, the sermons of Pope John Paul II given during a retreat for priests at Ars in October, 1986. The talks themselves are revitalizing and nurturing, a reflection of Vianney's exhortations to see parochial sacramental life as the extension of the Reign of God. Rutler comments that when the event was announced, a number of priests protested to the Vatican on the grounds that Vianney was not an appropriate model for the priest of today. There is sadness in hearing of this, but the author does his best to make things right by giving us a heartwarming sense of what we are missing in contemporary parish life."},{"Title":"The Cure D'Ars Today: St John Vianney","review":"This book is not really a biography. Indeed, a reader should come to it with a fair amount of prior knowledge not only of the saint's life, but of his culture as well. It resembles our own.Rather, Mr. Rutler has given us a meditation on the meaning of the priesthood. Where today, when we seek a priest at all, we seek counsel (in the modern sense recognized by the psychologist and the social worker), the villagers of Ars lacked, without realizing it, a spiritual father. They found one in the Cure, who knew he would have to account to his Lord for every lost soul.Rutler develops an old-fashioned conception of the priesthood, as heroic as it is unabashedly paternal. I am certain that if we returned to this conception, vocations would increase ten-fold: boys naturally want to be fathers and heroes. The moment they see a real specimen of either they instantly recognize and want to act on this desire.My only complaint regards Fr. Rutler's adherence to Chesterton as a model of prose style. Paradox is interesting when used sparingly but often obscures the reality an author is trying to illustrate. Too often, Fr. Rutler allows a shimmering axiom to obscure by its brilliance the more substantial glow of surrounding exposition."},{"Title":"The Cure D'Ars Today: St John Vianney","review":"This is a very great book, and a true Masterpiece. I was deeply moved by its beauty and depth. Rutler uses language like a great composer without losing the central theme. He adds a new dimension to Saint John Vianney and brings to life the pristine soul of \\"The Cure D'Ars\\"."},{"Title":"The Cure D'Ars Today: St John Vianney","review":"I must agree with a previous reviewer; if you are looking for a biography of St. John Marie Vianney, this is not the book for you. However, if you would like to read about the message and meaning of the Cure's life, how it applies to Christians of his time and Christians today, then this book will provide all you need.If diction alone could convey the truth of a message, this sublime work would be enough to convince any of the truth of Catholicism. As it is, the book conveys spiritual truths through Rutler's lofty prose as a feast for mind and soul.It is not an easy read, and certainly takes some digesting. Nevertheless, it is well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Cure D'Ars Today: St John Vianney","review":"Rutler himself recommends \\"better\\" biographies of John Vianney for more comprehensive narration of the plain facts about his life. This book adds the \\"Rutler dimension\\", which studies the man's life and its impact on thousands within the context of the Enlightenment and the disruptive forces of the French Revolution. Throughout the book, while the focus is on this uniquely selfless priest, there is meaningful relevance to the a modern world deracinated from its Christian roots and steeped in secularism. This is both biograph and history, but few books of these genre are also inspirational. This is a scholarly book, but extremely engaging and entertaining in both narrative and the philosophical quality of the ideas presented."},{"Title":"The Cure D'Ars Today: St John Vianney","review":"I was looking for a biography of the Cure (at the Catholic Information Center in Washington, D.C.). In the process of that search, I discovered this book, and began reading. It was thoroughly engaging.

So many insights, so many points for reflection.This is a wonderful, extended meditation on the life of this wonderful saint of God. I am now reading it for the third time. Each time I have read it, I find some new insight. This is a must-read book. My only regret is that I cannot get a hardback copy to keep."},{"Title":"The Cure D'Ars Today: St John Vianney","review":"Father Rutler has a lyric way of portraying the heroic side of an obscure country priest. If only more people knew about the beauty of priestly service, we would have more priests. Read this book and begin a journey into understanding the priesthood for what it really is. This book is an excellent recommendation for laypeople who do a lot of work with the Church. They will understand their parish life in a much deeper way. Rutler's approach is more spiritual than biographical. Granted, he mentions the famous scenes, but he does not go into precise detail. I don't think he did any new research on Vianney -- what he does is give the Cur&eacute; a profile \\"for today\\". And it's worth the read!"},{"Title":"The Cure D'Ars Today: St John Vianney","review":"a previous reviewer stated the book was intellectual & philisophical. I only find it superficially so.

Scott is deliberately vague about dates, as his focus in this novel is not on historical events or persons. The story begins with Guy Mannering's chance visit to Ellangowan the home of the Bertrams a noble Scottish family somewhat in decline. It is the night when Henry Bertram is born and Mannering an amateur astrologer sets out to make a chart of the boy's future. He is disturbed by the result however, and declines to reveal what he has foreseen, asking the family to wait five years before reading the prediction. Mannering leaves only to return some twenty years later to find that the fate of the Bertram family has become intimately connected with that of his own and that somehow, despite his own scepticism about his abilities as an astrologer, his predictions in an uncanny way have mirrored events.Scott's skill as a storyteller is shown well in this novel. The story has a fast pace with lots of action and suspense. The major characters are confronted with the dangers of a lawless time, including murder, smuggling and abduction. Moreover, they must carry out their romances despite the disapproval of their parents. As is so often the case with Scott, much of the pleasure from reading the tale comes from the various minor characters he describes. Dominie Sampson is an unforgettable character hilariously awkward of speech and manner, constantly exclaiming \\"prodigious\\", but fiercely loyal to the Bertram family. Meg Merrilies, an unusually tall, mysterious gypsy fortune-teller, is likewise fascinating with her apparently supernatural ability to influence events. These and other characters, both the virtuous and the villainous, make the story continually interesting.The best edition of Guy Mannering is that edited by P.D. Garside. This edition, based on the first edition and manuscript, provides the best possible text, restoring for the first time a large number of lost readings and indeed some quite extensive passages. It also has a full glossary, essential for understanding the Scots dialect and archaic words in the novel, and an extensive set of notes. Guy Mannering is a really enjoyable novel and good fun to read. It is also relatively straightforward and so would provide a good introduction to Scott's Waverley novels."},{"Title":"Guy Mannering the Astrologer (Oxford Edition)","review":"This novel combines action, humor, unforgettable characters and intelligent writing. The author takes you into the landscape-you feel every bump in the road. A very accessible novel, considering Scott's other works. While I loved The Antiquarian, the Bride of Lammermoor, Waverly and Rob Roy, Guy Mannering is the best so far, with a plot that never falters and a few heroes that inspire admiration as well as inquiry. There is also little of the thick, unintelligible scot's dialect that can trip up the average reader. While Scott falls short on his female love interest,(she's only human) he excels in the character of the female lead, a brave gypsy filled with a sense of her own doom.Please read Scott. He's good, and good for you.Note to dog-lovers: the fun-loving Dandie Dinmont Terrier takes its name from this novel."},{"Title":"Guy Mannering the Astrologer (Oxford Edition)","review":"I read Walter Scott for atmosphere, for mood, for humor and characterization and perhaps most of all, to listen to his voice. Scott has an endearingly present narrative persona--he's that chatty, knowledgeable, and even slightly eccentric uncle, the one with all the hobbies and interests and entirely too many books, who seems to be a kind of expert on every subject. The best Scott novels tap into this feeling of cozy kinship and exploit it, and in the end this is often more important than the story proper.More than many other Waverley novels, more than Waverley itself certainly, Scott's second novel, Guy Mannering (1815), excels at producing this complicated, friendly, peculiar narrative hodge-podge. There's a bit of everything here, from romantic scenery to sharp satire, from a bookish name-dropping to curse-muttering gypsies. There's smugglers and kidnappers, astrologers and cranks, the Scottish lowlands and the English lake district. Like all Scott, there's old and new joyfully intermingled--a birth mystery worthy of Tom Jones yet a good deal of what would become Treasure Island. More Gothic and less historical than Waverley, more fun than Heart of Midlothian, less forced than Ivanhoe, this novel was an unexpected treat. It remains underrated and understudied.Consider that Scott dashed this novel out in six weeks, and you'll get some idea of both his own considerable talents and also the casualness, almost carelessness of its tone. Like all of his novels, Guy Mannering should be imbibed slowly, savored rather than gulped. Kudos to Penguin Classics for tapping into the Edinburgh Edition and providing us with a cheap, well-annotated text of this neglected classic!Addendum: Someone asked me, so I thought I'd add: this is the novel featuring Dandy Dinmont, for whom the popular terrier is named."},{"Title":"Guy Mannering the Astrologer (Oxford Edition)","review":"Guy Mannering is the second of the Waverly novels by Scotland's greatest novelist Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832). The novel was first published in 1815 cementing quondom poet Scott's best selling fame with the general public.The novel begins on a dark and stormy night in southwest Scotland during the reign of George III. England and Scotland were united as Great Britain in 1707; one of Scott's motivation for penning the Waverly novels was to introduce English readers to their new fellow citizens north of the border.Guy Mannering is a young Englishman who finds shelter from the storm at the estate of the Laird of Ellangowan. Mannering enjoys astronomy and astrology. He predicts to Mr. Bertram, owner of Ellangowan, that he will have a son who will face momentous events during his fifth, tenth and twenty-first year of life. That night is born Harry Bertram. A few years later Harry is stolen at the age of five by smugglers aided and abetted by the evil lawyer the odious Glisson.Sixteen years pass. Mrs Betram has died and her husband the weak laird also sinks into the grave insolvent. The lawyer Glissin obtains the estate. Nothing has been heard of little Harry who had been abducted on the same night his protector on a mountain ride Mr. Frank Kennedy, a government revenue agent, was murdered. Harry Bertram (under the pseudonymn of Mr, Brown) returns to Scotland. He had been raised in Holland and became a British soldier in India serving under Colonel Guy Mannering. Mannering and Henry have quarreled. Henry is in love with Julia Mannering the high spirited daughter of the Colonel. While on his way back home to Ellengowan, Henry meets Mr. Dandie Dinmont a colorful farmer who is being beaten by thugs on a dark road. Henry befriends him spending a week at Charliehope the home of Dinmont. Dinmont raises terriers and a breed is named for him. Harry is captured by smugglers but is rescued by the sybil witch Meg Merrilies who stand over six feet tallMeanwhile, Colonel Mannering has taken into his care Lucy Betram and Harry's eccentric clergical tutor namedDominie Sampson. Lucy is in love with Charles Hazelwood a wealthy lawyer whose family does not want him to marry someone of a lower financial strata of society.Harry shoot Hazelwood in an accident. He is imprisoned but eventually, through the help of his friends, is realeased. Mr. Pleynell, a lawyer, proves to the court that Harry is not an imposter but the real Harry Betram of Ellangowan. He weds Julia and inherits the estate. His sister Lucy becomes the bride of Hazelwood. The evil Glissin and the smugglers who stole Harry away end in grisly deaths.Guy Mannering is more interesting that Waverly. Scott's dense Scottish dialect will slow you down but there is an excellent glossary of Scottish terms and historical footnotes to make the novel easier to digest for 21st century readers. Scott is an acquired taste but is important as the father of the historical romance in fiction. He induced men, not just women, to become devoted novel readers. His colorful characters influenced writers such as Dickens and he was admired by Jane Austen. I enjoyed this book and you will too!"},{"Title":"Guy Mannering the Astrologer (Oxford Edition)","review":"As a child I struggled with Ivanhoe (though my English teacher's advice to skip the first 30 pages certainly did help). As an adult, I enjoyed Waverly but still found it rather hard going. With this background I approached Guy Mannering with some trepidation but ended up enjoying the book thoroughly. This edition is excellent and the notes and glossary are very helpful. The story moves fairly slowly compared with modern novels but the richness of detail, the topographic descriptions and especially the humor make it memorable. Read it when you have time to enjoy it and don't be put off by the rather archaic Scottish dialect (I was brought up close to the Scottish border but many words and phrases were completely unknown to me)"},{"Title":"Guy Mannering the Astrologer (Oxford Edition)","review":"Sir Walter Scott's second novel GUY MANNERING; OR, THE ASTROLOGER is built around three sets of incidents spread out between +/- 1760 and +/- 1782.--First incidents: around 1760 Guy Mannering, English, fresh out of Oxford University and on a walking and painting tour, finds shelter from the elements in a manor house called Ellangowan in Galloway in Southwestern Scotland. There he is hosted by its Laird, Godfrey Bertram, who is dining with his companion, the absent-minded, taciturn Presbyterian non-pulpited divine, Dominie Abel Sampson. The night of Mannering's arrival, Lady Bertram gives birth to her first child, a son, Henry, later usually styled Harry.As a joke, Guy Mannering draws on now passe astrological lore he had picked up from an early mentor. Mannering casts young Harry's horoscope. He had once before cast a horoscope: his girl friend's, and foreseen that that 18 year old would either die or be imprisoned at age 38. He now foresees a similar negative rhythm for the infant Harry: big trouble or great danger at ages 4, 10 and 20. Mannering's horoscope is wrapped up and hung around the infant's neck. It is still there to identify him 20 or 21 years later.On that birthing occasion we also meet a six-feet tall, broad Lowland Scots-speaking gypsy woman, Meg Merrilies. Meg is come to keep away evil spirits from the first-born son of a family that has allowed loyal Meg's tribe to squat on Bertram land for centuries. Her first words are a chant:\\"Canny moment, lucky fit;Is the lady lighter yet?Be it lad, or be it lass,Sign wi' cross, and sain wi' mass.\\" (Book I. Ch. 3)Meg foresees that young Harry will live a full 70 years but with three major breaks in his upward course, followed by three re-stitchings of his predestined path. We also overhear a meeting between the gypsy woman and a smuggling German sea captain, Dirk Hattaraick.--Second set of incidents: four years later, around 1764, the ambitious but impoverished Laird Bertram was appointed a justice of the peace. His devious estate manager and lawyer Gilbert Glossin was made a minor justice official. Good natured Bertram's new self-image required him to crack down uncharacteristically both on smugglers from the nearby Isle of Man and on the gypsies whose presence both his ancestors for centuries and he had tolerated. The Laird became great chums with revenue agent Frank Kennedy. Months later Kennedy snatched away from the boy's tutor, Dominie Sampson, four-year old Harry Bertram to let the youngster enjoy watching the arrest of Captain Hattaraick and his crew of smugglers run aground by a British warship.Witnesses who arrived later found evidence of a scuffle. Kennedy was dead, the boy Harry Bertram had disappeared. The County sheriff (not named) did a thorough investigation and ruled murder. Meg Merrilies was suspected and spent some time in prison before being released. The boy was never found. Shocked by the news, his mother gave birth prematurely to a girl (not named) and died. The murder remained unsolved 17 or more years later. And we have read through the tenth chapter of Volume One of this Three Volume novel.--Third Set of incidents: 17 years later or so, toward the end of the American Revolution, say 1782, the story resumes. Guy Mannering had married his sweetheart and become Colonel of his regiment in India, winning military fame. His teenage daughter Julia Mannering was wooed in India by a young recruit from Holland named Vanbeest Brown. Guy Mannering erroneously suspected this subordinate of wooing his wife, not his daughter. They fight a duel in which Brown is wounded. But bandits fall upon them and the combatants are separated. Mrs Mannering dies. Colonel Mannering resigns his commission and returns to England, enriched by inheritances. But the injured Brown has survived and eventually returns with the regiment to England -- unknown to Guy Mannering.Taking leave, love-stricken Vanbeest Brown traces Julia Mannering to Scotland where her father is keen to purchase the old estate of Ellangowan. But immoral lawyer Gilbert Glossin has dispossessed his onetime patron, the old laird, of his ancestral holdings.Meg Merrilies and Captain Dirk Hattaraick reappear, the latter, it develops, long protected by Glossin. New characters also make their appearance, most notably, the amiable lowland farmer Dandie Dinmont (the terrier breed will be named for him after Scott's novel). Dinmont provides an even warmer reception to young Vanbeest Brown than the Laird had given Guy Mannering two decades earlier.An austere, wealthy aunt of Miss Lucy Bertram dies in Edinburgh, having been persuaded by none other than Meg Merrilies that somehow her nephew Harry Bertram has survived and will soon return to claim his ancestral home. Guy Mannering, Lucy's host after the sudden death of her father, volunteers to go to Edinburgh for the reading of Lucy's aunt's will. The current sheriff of the shire, Mac-Morlan, gives Colonel Mannering letters of introduction to his predecessor as county sheriff, now a prominent lawyer in Edinburgh. We finally learn that lawyer's name: Paulus Pleydell, Esquire. Pleydell in turn gives Mannering letters of introduction to David Hume and a few other luminaries of the Edinburgh enlightenment. Pleydell also agrees to represent Dandie Dinmont in a property suit.All of the major players are now linked, in place and the plot gathers speed.The greatest family of the shire, the Hazelwoods, also come into play. The wealthy Laird of Hazelwood begins to think highly of the crooked lawyer Glossin. The laird's son, Charles, falls in love with Miss Lucy Bertram. It slowly seems likely that Vanbeest Brown is Lucy's missing older brother Harry Bertram, though this is first surmised only by lawyer Glossin and Harry's loyal old protectress, the gypsy Meg Merrilies.In a scuffle Brown/Bertram accidentally wounds Lucy's admirer Charles Hazelwood. All players shortly come together in a fiery ending so complicated that I had best leave its fun and denouements entirely to you.Themes embedded in GUY MANNERING occur in other Walter Scott works as well: gypsies, inter-generational tensions, a missing heir, the role of cities and lawyers in accelerating the sunset of the \\"auld ways\\" of feudal Scotland, the virtual impossibility of a poor untitled man marrying a rich titled girl -- or vice versa. Once encountered, some of the characters can never be forgotten, notably Meg Merrilies, Dandie Dinmont and taciturn Dominie Sampson with his repeated exclamation of \\"pro-di-gi-ous!\\"And we see old superstitions still holding sway a hundred or so country miles west of contrasting Edinburgh, with its immortal 50 year ascendancy in art, learning and science comparable only to eras of Periclean Athens and Medici Florence. -OOO-"},{"Title":"Guy Mannering the Astrologer (Oxford Edition)","review":"There are some appalling cliches here - the mysterious gypsy, a lost infant (who turns up as a strapping handsome adult, but who still has the identifying talisman tied around his neck) - but my guess is that these weren't such cliches back in 1805 (so this predates Il Trovatore by a few decades). Even so I was completely taken with this, and found the last 100 pages to be very compelling reading, put down very reluctantly."},{"Title":"Promised Land, Crusader State: The American Encounter with the World Since 1776","review":"Walter McDougall's 1998 diplomatic history, \\"Promised Land, Crusader State\\", is a highly accessible examination of \\"the American encounter with the world since 1776.\\" McDougall finds at the heart of our ongoing debate on foreign policy a multitude of diplomatic traditions we continually draw upon as a nation. Further, he documents the changes in these traditions as the United States progressed from its relatively weak and isolated origins to its modern status as one of the most powerful nations on earth.McDougall divides the US foreign policy experience into two periods. \\"Our Old Testament\\" period was marked by a sense of exceptionalism but also by a sense of the limits of our power and an inclination to limit our adventurism to our own backyard in North America. \\"Our New Testament\\" period reflected both our growing strength as an industrial and military power and our increased willingness to intervene overseas to change the world. Within these two periods of history, McDougall identifies eight distinct foreign policy traditions, each of which enjoyed a period of ascendency but none of which ever entirely vanished from our foreign policy debates.In his conclusion, McDougall finds that our ongoing debate has been shaped by the eighteenth century intellectual impulses of enlightenment rationalism and by Christian anthropology. The relative balance of these intellectual impulses has often determined the transitory shape of policy. McDougall judges the efficacy of policy by results, and by this standard, our experience has been a mixed one.\\"Promised Land, Crusader State\\" is highly recommended as an introductory examination of US diplomatic history.

Without freedom to grow, the nation would not be free at all.\\" (page 78)Unfortunately, on reading McDougall's curmudgeonly and loquacious text it turns out that he approves of overseas conquests and is annoyed by efforts to help the less well-off.To the extent that it ever made a net contribution, \\"Crusader State\\" has been thoroughly overtaken by Walter Russell Meade's \\"Special Providence\\" in terms of identifying the various enduring strands in U.S. foreign policy, and by Robert Kagan's \\"Dangerous Nation\\" and other sources in terms of clarifying that the American colonists went to war with Britain in the 1760s and 1770s over access to the Indian lands."},{"Title":"Promised Land, Crusader State: The American Encounter with the World Since 1776","review":"Temp review for the quick read I did as I just sold the book:Well written for the most part, easy to follow.Negatives:Federal Reserve Act relegated to one sentence.

The options range from the isolationism of Pat Buchanan to the interventionist nation-building of Bill Clinton. Anyone wishing to understand the ongoing arguments should read this terrific book. McDougall's compelling thesis is that there is a fundamental dichotomy in US Foreign Policy, with two competing doctrines each influenced by four different themes. There is the Promised Land (or Old Testament) impulse, which is based on four key traditions:OLD TESTAMENT (Promised Land) Exceptionalism (focus on liberty at home, avoiding entangling alliances) Unilateralism (as opposed to isolationism) The American System (Monroe Doctrine) Expansionism (Manifest Destiny)This was the prevailing approach to foreign policy--designed to protect America's liberty and independence from the outside world--until 1898 and the Spanish American War, at which point a New Testament gained ascendancy, likewise guided by four traditions:NEW TESTAMENT (Crusader State) Progressive Imperialism Liberal Internationalism (Wilsonianism) Containment Global Meliorism (reforming other nations internal problems)The adoption of the New Testament policy marked the triumph of the &quot;do-gooder impulse&quot; and represented America's desire to influence the rest of the world and try to make it a &quot;better&quot; place. Given this context, we can see that Buchanan and Clinton are representatives of two great historic trends in American thought; what remains is for us to decide between the two.After presenting the historic development of each of the eight traditions, McDougall concludes with a chapter on whether each would serve us well now. The only New Testament tradition that he sees any value in is Containment. In fact, he treats Containment well throughout the book. It seems as if he's a little overawed by George Kennan (the father of Containment). In particular, he gives the policy credit for defeating the Soviet Union. While he does criticize the price paid (huge debt, internal dissent, etc.), I believe that he overestimates the policy. First of all, if containment did work, it too 36 years to do so and that is simply too long. Second, it would seem that you have to consider the Reagan Era policy to be quite different than what had come before, especially the active support of counterrevolutionary movements in Soviet Bloc countries (Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Angola). Generally, the discussion of how US policy won the Cold War is somewhat weak.But his final conclusions, that we should return to the Old Testament--taking care of our own internal problems; being prepared to act unilaterally, if at all; remaining strong enough to deter challenges; and thereby, continuing to fulfill our unique destiny--is cogent and extremely powerful. This is a pivotal text for understanding our role in the world, past, present and future.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"Promised Land, Crusader State: The American Encounter with the World Since 1776","review":"I first saw Walter McDougall on the C-SPAN Booknotes show discussing this book in 1997. He impressed me so much that I went online and ordered it from Amazon instantly. It is a great read because McDougall writes clearly, concisely, and with a rare vividness for a scholar.This is not a book of American History per se. It is a book about American's developing and changing doctrines of how to deal with the world beyond our borders. McDougall discusses eight doctrines with four under the \\"Old Testament\\" heading (when America was basically turned inward and worried only about the Western Hemisphere), and four under the \\"New Testament\\" (when America became a player on the world stage and, briefly, a colonial power).Understanding these doctrines is essential to understanding America's changing place in the world. These doctrines conflict with each other and yet the all still echo through history to our present. This leads to some of the complexity in our present political relationships with the world and our own muddled sense of ourselves and our role in the world. Certainly, America has done some wonderful things for the world, but the wake of our great ship of state has also made navigation tough for some of the smaller barks trying to stay afloat in the storms of history.This is a fine book and a great read. I encourage everyone, especially students and young people, to read it carefully and to consider seriously the arguments Prof. McDougall has put forth. You will be better off whether or not you end up agreeing with him."},{"Title":"Promised Land, Crusader State: The American Encounter with the World Since 1776","review":"To many observers, American foreign policy appears schizophrenic--an odd mix of high-minded idealism and crass realism. On one end, American hegemony has coincided with an unprecedented degree of geopolitical stability and material prosperity; on the other, America has started fights when none existed and has meddled where it did not belong. In other words, some see America as a beacon, others as a beast. It is little wonder that the exercise of American power, most lately in Iraq, has proven so controversial.This ambivalence was well captured by Senator Fulbright who wrote that, \\"The inconstancy of American foreign policy is not an accident but an expression of two distinct sides of the American character. Both are characterized by a kind of moralism, but one is the morality of decent instincts tempered by the knowledge of human imperfection and the other is the morality of absolute self-assurance fired by the crusader spirit.\\" Walter McDougall, of the University of Pennsylvania, tries to cast light into these American contradictions by looking into the Old (\\"Promised Land\\") and New Testament (\\"Crusader State\\") of its foreign policy.Mr. McDougall's purpose is to dispel certain myths surrounding American foreign policy and unify seemingly inconsistent traditions. The former goal is achieved through a meticulous reading of primary and secondary sources; for example, Mr. McDougall renames the hallowed principles of the Old Testament: Liberty for Exceptionalism, Unilateralism for Isolationism, Expansionism for Manifest Destiny, and the American System for the Monroe Doctrine. The New Testament is similarly described in four traditions: Progressive Imperialism, Wilsonianism, Containment, and Global Meliorism.What connects these diverse traditions is the belief that foreign policy should never compromise liberty at home. What is more, these traditions coexist in the American mind and influence its foreign policy. In that sense, argues Mr. McDougall, simple dichotomies between realism and idealism miss the mark; American foreign policy is at the same time \\"good, bad and ugly.\\" Only after appreciating this reality can one hope of understanding the basic tenets of American foreign policy and make sense of its apparent schizophrenia."},{"Title":"Promised Land, Crusader State: The American Encounter with the World Since 1776","review":"This book is a bit dated, 9-11 was still four years away when it was published, but it does provide an insightful analysis of American foreign policy that holds true even since 9-11. Walter McDougall writes in a quasi-religious tone dividing American foreign relations into an \\"Old Testament\\" and a \\"New Testament\\" each of which is subdivided into four catagories. In this way he is able to catagorize the entire spectrum of American history from a fledgling nation to the remaining global superpower.At times he seems a bit too conservative for my liking (he refers to the former Soviet Union as the \\"evil empire\\" - not that I'm pro-Soviet, but I believe any form of imperialism is inherently \\"evil\\" in that if nothing else it wastes tax dollars on repressive regimes provided those rulers support American interests), but at others he hits the nail on the head effectively. For instance, he is critical of Wilsonian liberalism as unrealistic and illustrates how it failed to achieve any of its intentions. But then he acknowledges that Wilson was correct to claim that \\"democracy\\" among colonial peoples takes decades to develop. He also states that what works for America is not readily grafted onto other countries, especially those of the third world. In this respect he is critical of Bill Clinton's foreign policy and would likely equally be critical of Bush II's current war in Iraq. He even asks if Americans can be better Iraqis than Iraqis themselves? He thinks not.His chapters on Vietnam could easily be rewritten for today just by replacing President Johnson with Bush II and South Vietnam's government with that of Prime Minister Maliki. American forein policy has attempted the impossible, to export democracy as a commodity. The imperialism practiced by modern America is no longer true to what McDougall identifies as his \\"Old Testament.\\" We no longer can justify expansion for natural reasons such as protecting borders. By claiming areas such as South Vietnam (or Iraq) are vital to American interests, we fall victim to exactly what George Washington warned of in his Farewell Address.McDougall's style is not a simple read, but his theories are well thought out and strongly presented. He captivates the reader with his knowledge while making his point. He clearly has thought out his position on the history of American foreign relations and this book reflects that. I believe this work is important enough to warrant a second edition that brings his theories up to date. In the book he claims the policies of Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson had more in common than they were different. By that same token one can deduct from applying McDougall's theories to the present day that the policies of Bush II and Bill Clinton have more in common than they are different. It is up to the reader to learn what I'm talking about. Read this book and you will see what I mean."},{"Title":"Promised Land, Crusader State: The American Encounter with the World Since 1776","review":"I picked this book up in the discount section and was prepared to read a boring analysis of American foreign policy. I was surprised because this is a concise history of the development of American foreign policy. Professor McDougall also destroys some myths viewed as facts by the American public. One item is the Monroe Doctrine. McDougall details what the Monroe doctrine was in reality, not what they tell you in the American history books. The book is divided into two parts, Promised Land (Old Testament) and Crusader State (New Testament). In each section, there are four chapters detailing the development and stages of American foreign policy. I thought the outline and stages of American foreign policy was a nice touch in showing the reader how different things influenced American foreign policy.This is a great read for those trying to figure out American foreign policy. I actually learned how to view our foreign policy in the light of these eight stages in development and how Iraq and Vietman figure into the equation. This was written before the present Iraq war so it would be great to see how Professor McDougall views the present conflict. A good read."},{"Title":"Promised Land, Crusader State: The American Encounter with the World Since 1776","review":"McDougall attempts to outline \\"The American Encounter With the World Since 1776\\" in his small volume, \\"Promised Land, Crusader State.\\" Such an ambitious promise could never be fulfilled in such a small space given that there is little agreement about how to characterize \\"America's encounter with the world\\" and the effects that encounter has had on the lives of Americans (both good and bad).McDougall imposes a paradigm on American foreign affairs which is easily seen from his table of contents. McDougall tries to shoehorn the history of American foreign relations into these eight traditions (divided into two testaments), and does so with surprising results. However, such a paradigmatic book will always suffer from the fact that some things just don't fit and that there could be other paradigms that would be more useful.Still, McDougall brings attention to two important areas. First is the need for America to have the \\"moral high ground\\" when conducting foreign affairs. It is not enough for America to simply engage in games of power and politic, especially since such tactics were part of the Old (European) World and that America was the New (\\"exceptional\\") World. Second, McDougall leaves open the question of whether various historical actors were \\"heroes\\" or \\"villains.\\" This critical look at the foreign policy decisions made by people such as Jefferson and Wilson allows the reader to safely criticize their history without feeling \\"un-American.\\"Standing alone, this book would rank a 3 star rating, but if the value of this book is enhanced if one already has a background in the history of American foreign policy or is reading this book in conjunction with other background materials, hence a 4 star rating."},{"Title":"Promised Land, Crusader State: The American Encounter with the World Since 1776","review":"McDougall identifies 8 different traditions in American foreign policy, which fall into two &quot;testaments.&quot; The &quot;old testament&quot; consists of traditions such as liberty, unilateralism and the American System. Essentially, it involves Americans perfecting their own country and looking towards their own part of the world as the place they need to be most concerned. The &quot;new testament&quot; consists of such traditions as containment, expansion and meliorism. It calls for American to play a much broader role in the world's affairs, although for different reasons. McDougall does not purport to have written a comprehensive diplomatic history as to explain it and how it might be used to conduct future diplomacy. &quot;Promised Land&quot; is not highly ideological - some will find his questioning of the Marshall Plan's success and attack on foreign aid infuriating. Others will be unhappy with his assertion that the US is perhaps well served by its participation in the UN and Nato, as long as the USs ability to act unilaterally when necessary is not impeded. For example, he points out that Washington's famous injunction was against &quot;entangling alliances&quot; rather than all alliances and that those which serve the US interest without limited its freedom of action are consistent with Washington rather than opposing it. In perhaps the most interesting &quot;revision&quot; of the entire book, he repudidates the notion that America has ever been an isolationist nation, saying that it really was a concern for our ability to act unilaterally that was at issue and points to a long history of interventionism to protect US interests dating back to Jefferson and the Barbary Pirates. Finally, the book explains the role of religion in the changing nature of America's policies from that of a promised land where we would lead by example primarily to one where we would be more willing to intervene."},{"Title":"Promised Land, Crusader State: The American Encounter with the World Since 1776","review":"This book offers a good, sweeping history of United States foreign policy from independence through the present.

This is to be expected, I suppose. Giving Elizabeth another child, giving her powers she never posessed and creating a Bathory family legacy that would probably offend any surviving descendants just to spice up the story is all well and good, but it is misleading. At the beginning of the book the author claims to have written a lot from fact, but I disgress- the story is what I'm supposed to be reviewing. It's an interesting story and it passes the time, but apart from that I can't give it more than a lukewarm reccomendation. The love story between the nun and our blind hero is sappy and sickly-sweet, but descriptions of Elizabeth's crimes, though exaggerated, can almost make up for it."},{"Title":"The Tea House on Mulberry Street","review":"This book is so full of everyday people, with everyday problems.

I read the review by Publisher's Weekly on this one, as as per usual, I am not real sure the reviewers even bothered reading the book. Where on earth to they find these people to do their reviews? Anyway, this is certainly one of those books that should not be judged by it's cover. My one and only complaint is that the cover and the quote on the front of the book are quite misleading. This is not a typical cozy chick book, full of crumpets, tea and the like. It is a rather good collection of character sketches and situations that go far beyond. Had not my wife first read the book and recommened it, I probably would not have given it a second glance. Thank goodness for an alert wife! The writing is quite uncomplicated and quite readable. The stories are interesting and intertwine in a wonderful way. There is some bitter sweet sadness to some of the stories which is off set by some hilarious situations. If you are looking for a good, simple read about outwardly simple people, then this is for you. If you are looking for a cookbook and pages and pages of descriptions of various food groups and tea settings, then you will probably be a bit disappointed.

Ironically the tea house comes from her family yet Penny wants more out of life than the shop to include children but Muldoon's has always been Daniel's significant other; that's why he married Penny in the first place.Patrons come here as much to escape as for the desserts. Wannabe artist Brenda Brown comes here to drown her sorrows that her art has never sold. Henry Blackstock enjoys breakfast here before opening his bookstore, but recently comes here to mourn in private the death of his beloved gardens killed by his wife to \\"house\\" her book club. Overweight and filled with self pity Sadie Smith cheats on her diet here while she believes her husband cheats on her. After two decades overseas, Clare Fitzgerald hopes to find her lost love that she met at Muldoon's twenty years ago. Soon a fire will cause these lost souls connected through Muldoon's to complete their introspective reassessment of life.Well written in a soap opera way, the various subplots run throughout the novel linked by Muldoon's; enabling each of the prime players to seem real and unique.

Usually when such comparisons are made, the newcommer is lacking.....Sharon Owens shares the same Ireland that Maeve writes about....but writes in her own unique style. Her Ireland is contained within the streets of Belfast, and the inhabitants are usually hard working, ordinary people. Ms. Owens infuses each with humanity and humor and is never condenscending.

Brenda writing letter after letter to Nicholas Cage, as she nurses a cup of tea...all she can afford. Henry, escaping from his upwardly mobile wife and her Bronte loving group. While seeking refuge in Muldoon's he notices Rose in the flower shop across the street. Overseeing all this and more are Penny and Daniel Stanley...a married couple who run the tea room. Tea room is almost too grand a title for the bedraggled shop where Daniel perfects his cherry cheesecske and seems intent on hoarding every penny thay comes his way. Penny, at first greatful for Daniel's proposal of marriage has become weary fo his penny pinching ways and worries he married her for the tea shop she inheirited when her parents were killed. She wonders if there is a different life for her, and worries about what Daniel might be hiding. These and others provide the everyday traffic through Muldoon's.

Not everyone in town is a joy and pleasure, nor is everyone a cheery Paddy eejit.I liked this book because it didn't pretend to be anything other than what it is: a story about some folks. If you've read much by Irish authors, you'll recognize this endearing quality. Though one reviewer here complained that \\"there were too many people involved in too many petty and uninteresting affairs\\" -- isn't this exactly what real life is? As with Binchy's storytelling, there's a comfort to be found in a book where \\"uninteresting affairs\\" are exposed and explored-- aren't most of our days full of petty and uninteresting affairs?After all, not everyone works at a fashion magazine, dresses in Prada, and single-handedly saves the world (London) from fashion faux pas while gulping down G&T;'s, and romancing the cute boy.I like Maeve Binchy but I found \\"Tara Road\\" and \\"Scarlet Feather\\" to be flat and predictable.

Any fan of Binchy will be sure to enjoy the episodic style, the way the characters' stories entwine, and the gentle irony.

None of this is to say this is not a good read. But readers expecting a realistic tale, should look else where. On the plus side, the character studies are shapely drawn and I felt like I was coming to know real people. On the flip side, many of the events depicted were over the top, and depended on unlikely coincidences. There are some very funny sections and other sections that are aimed at having the reader reach for a tissue. I thoroughly enjoyed the first two thirds of the book, but towards the end it ran out of steam, with some of the stories come to a close well before the book did, while other pieces lacked the emotional punch that earlier sections delivered. There are no deep meanings to find here, the authors only apparent philosophy being, most marriages are disposable. Sharon Owens is a popular author in her native Ireland, but this is first book published in the US.Recommended for readers who enjoy detailed character studies, over the top events and neatly wrapped up happily ever afters.A Note on my ratings:. I give 3 stars to a book that I consider a good read for fans of the genre. I pay good money for books and I expect an average book to deliver a pleasurable read. I reserve 4 stars for the best a genre has to offer and 5 stars for amazing books that cross all genres and should be enjoyable to most readers."},{"Title":"The Tea House on Mulberry Street","review":"I have to say I was excited to read this book, especially since so many of the cover blurbs mentioned the similarity to Maeve Binchy, who I adore, and the front cover blurb was clearly written by someone who has not read this book....unfortunately her blurb was the one that sold me on it! Celia Ahearn said something to the effect of 'made me dream of pastries' and gave the sense that this was a book to curl up and get lost into.Not quite. For a book that is set in a Tea House, there is very little focus on food. There could have been so much more done with it in that sense, really played up the pastries and had fun with it, but no, this book was much like a piece of cake, that is beautifully frosted, but when you take a bite, it is dry and stale.There are too many separate stories here, that don't intertwine or really engage the reader. We don't spend enough time with any one character to get attached. Except for Sadie Sponge. I quite liked her. But Brenda, the young artist with a crush on Nicholas Cage? Her stories seemed so out of place, and frankly, quite boring. There were two twin sisters that had an earlier chapter, but were never heard from again, so what was the point of having them there? Same with Henry and Aurora and Rose, boring, boring, and more boring. This story had potential, if the focus had been more on Daniel and Penny with maybe the subplot of Sadie.If you are looking for the trademark warmth and depth of story that Maeve Binchy is known for, I'm afraid that you will be disappointed here."},{"Title":"The Tea House on Mulberry Street","review":"Lovely tea shop and would have liked life to continue inside the shop rather than being taken on a ride through the crazy streets.

I had never heard of it until I saw it at Costco and I'm so glad I bought it. Following the lives of the owners and customers of the tea house, it never stalls or bores. Ms. Owens joins the ranks of Binchy and Pilcher and I will look for future books."},{"Title":"The Tea House on Mulberry Street","review":"This book is an easy read. Very interesting, funny and enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Tea House on Mulberry Street","review":"I bought this book while on holiday because the review on the front cover from the Irish Independent said, \\"Maeve Binchy meets Joanna Trollope...Gives you a warm glow like a nice cup of tea.\\" I was disapointed in it because it was a quick, simple read and not at all like either of those authors. Those two authors tell a meaningful, entertaining story while making you think about friendships, life choices and love. This book tells a entertaining story with little substance. Pick it up for what it is and you'll be entertained for a few hours."},{"Title":"The Tea House on Mulberry Street","review":"Enjoyed this gentle story that keeps you capatured and you feel that you know the people in the story and were they live. It kept me interested all the way though"},{"Title":"The Tea House on Mulberry Street","review":"My first thought on reading this was, \\"what a delightful little story.\\" While it starts out a bit doom and gloom with several failing relationships, it somehow brings humor into the gloom and ends with the happiest of endings.The main couple, Penny and Daniel Stanley, are the owners of the Tea house. Daniel is a workaholic and more concerned with his penny-pinching than anything else. Penny is disappointed in the relationship and goes on to have an affair due to Daniel's cold ignorance of her feelings.Another couple, Sadie and Arnold are also having trouble with their relationships. Sadie on a continuous stream of diets finds out about his affair and after doing so, plots the most delicious of revenge that you can't help smiling in glee with how it turns out.Rose, Aurora, and Henry make up another lovers circle. Aurora is more concerned with her book club, and the addition to her house (done by Arnold) rather than her relationship with Henry. He prefers to pitter in his garden all day long that is eventually destroyed by the addition. While at the tea house he meets Rose, a recent divorcee who owns a flower shop and loves gardening as much as him. As Aurora draws further into her club and a new man, Henry and Rose plant something beautiful.In addition to these stories there are also two side stories. One is of Clare, who used to live in Belfast where the teahouse is located and is in search of a long lost love. The other is Brenda, a failing artist who is in love with Nicholas Cage.Towards the end of the novel, a fire somehow fixes many things for the characters and everyone receives a happy ending. A bit mushy for some, but sometimes a little lightheartedness is needed in a read."},{"Title":"The Tea House on Mulberry Street","review":"Welcome to Muldoon's Tea Room home of delicious cherry cheesecake and meeting place for the vast array of characters who inhabit this Belfast neighborhood. Owners, Penny and Daniel Stanley have done little else but work in the tea house for the duration of their seventeen year marriage and that mundane existence is getting pretty old for Penny. Their story is the focus of Sharon Owens THE TEA HOUSE ON MULBERRY STREET, but the truth of the matter is that it's really the customers who make a visit to this teahouse a real treat.Fans of Maeve Binchy will quickly find themselves comparing Ms. Owens writing style and characters to those of Ms. Binchy. Although a die-hard fan of Binchy, I was completely taken by the Owens characters. Her folks are definitely more aggressive and fallible and apt to give in to their feelings. My personal favorite in this compendium of personalities, was Sadie Smith who takes rather vindictive action when she discovers her cheating husband, Arnold plans to leave her and wed his \\"young honey\\" as soon as his parents are gone. Seems he can't divorce Sadie now since she is the caregiver for her husbands' parents and it would cut into his considerable savings if he had to hire outside help to care for them. Sadie's revenge is as delicious as a huge slice of chocolate cake whipped cream cake topped with ice cream and is sure to give every reader a big belly laugh.Then there is Brenda Brown, bohemian starving artist who spends part of her time being fired from various jobs, part of her time devoted to her art and part of her time writing fan letters that she rarely mails to the love of her life, Nicholas Cage.This is only a demitasse size sample of the engaging, amusing and vibrant folks you may run into at the tea house. Owen has a real talent for depicting the lives of ordinary people and their ordinary lives in an extraordinary way. The book is definitely hard to put down and your housework is sure to suffer.For my final thoughts on author Sharon Owens and The Teahouse on Mulberry Street I will rely on a quote from a teahouse regular, Brenda Brown, and state \\"I'm a genuine fan\\"."},{"Title":"The Tea House on Mulberry Street","review":"A recommendation on my reading board led me to The Tea House on Mulberry Street, and I'm so glad I made room on my crowded reading list!The characters & situations are real, well developed and sincere.

Sharon Owens is an author I hope to read much more of."},{"Title":"The Tea House on Mulberry Street","review":"I felt at home in this book. The characters are very believable. The storylines are very human and real. This is a light, enjoyable read. It should be on everyone's reading list!"},{"Title":"The Tea House on Mulberry Street","review":"Tea House on Mulberry Street is the story of a close-knit Irish community and the lives of about a dozen people who meet or have some connection with the Tea House. From the reviews I expected this novel to be a cozy story about a single couple and their friends. Instead I found a collection of semi-likeable (but at times obnoxious people), with whom I could share no empathy or concern.The primary couple- the tea house owners- especially the husband were irritating individuals who needed serious marital counseling. The girl artist (Brenda Brown), was a borderline stalker who writes Nicholas cage and would rather go on welfare, than get a job and pay her bills. Charming. Then, there's the husband who cheats and his plump wife (the only decent character in the lot!) who complains constantly that his wife is overweight. What, are there no fat people in Belfast? Then there is another cheating husband, and he's in love with a florist... Oh, and the charming twins... The list goes on...Overall, there were too many people involved in too many petty and uninteresting affairs. Perhaps if there had been one or two but 5+ couples AND their acquaintances? And I won't even go there about the ending. Particularly the relationship between the Tea House owner and her husband... Way too sappy.Overall, an average read. 3 stars. Would be better if the author had stuck two perhaps 2 couples and fleshed them out more. Buy this one used."},{"Title":"The Tea House on Mulberry Street","review":"Found this book rather simplistic and not very engrossing. I prefer a book that, along with the stories of its characters, adds layers of thoughtfulness. The Sunday Philosophers Club series by Alexander McCall Smith comes to mind, which I find much more interesting and thought provoking than this book."},{"Title":"The Tea House on Mulberry Street","review":"My advice is that if you read this book have a pen and pencil ready and take notes. You will not be able to enjoy the book if you don't. There are too many plot lines and they are jumbled together. Every time the writer jumped to a new plot line \\"couple\\" I spent the next 15 minutes of reading trying to figure out if we'd met that couple before, what they had done, what I knew about them, etc.I gave the book a three instead of a one because the stories themselves were quaint and an interesting look into relationships. If the writer would have taken one couple all the way to the end of their story before moving onto another couple this book would have rated probably a 4.5 to 5 review from me."},{"Title":"The Tea House on Mulberry Street","review":"This was a charming book with rich, colorful characters that as a reader I completely lost myself in.

Sharon Owens isn't there yet, although I found the characters' story-beginnings to be engaging enough to read through to the middle of the book. By chapter 12, I felt the characters lacked those real qualities that make one care deeply enough about their lives that a reading stop is unthinkable. It's not a bad novel - just not great."},{"Title":"The Tea House on Mulberry Street","review":"I found a copy of this book at Big Lots of all places (I didn't know they sell books there) and snapped it up since it sounded so cozy and I love Irish tales. It is very cozy and sweet, but predictable and with too many characters to have any lasting feelings for ... which is why I rated this book a three-star.The setting is in a little tea house set in Belfast, Ireland. The owners of the tea house are young and falling out of love with one another. Penny, the young housewife finds herself dissatisfied after 17 years of marriage to her husband, Daniel, who always seem to have his nose in a pastry cookbook. Then there's Sadie who discovered her husband is having an affair with a young woman. There's Brenda, a starving artist who dreams of Nicolas Cage. There's Clare who returns home from the States for a short trip on an assignment from her magazine. She left Belfast as a young woman but still hasn't forgotten her true love that she only knew for 19 hours. There are more stories of different residents who frequent the tea house and their stories are very short but interesting.Their stories all entwined with one another and based on the tea house where they know the owners, Penny and Daniel. But some of the stories are either too short or too improbable ... and like another reviewer in here, this book would be much better if she had focused on just several characters, not on many. But the stories are written wonderfully and once I got past the first few chapters, where everything seems to be so dreary, it got more interesting and the flow of the stories started moving.This is an interesting book, perfect for an evening of reading.

The really chilling aspect of this story is its author's depiction of the afterlife.There are also some decent stories that are worth a once-over:\\"Drawer 14\\" by Talmage Powell - A morgue attendant sees a corpse in a drawer that's supposed to be empty. This story has a kicker at the end.\\"Professor Kate\\" by Margaret St. Clair - A family of witches is hunted by a posse in Indian Country.\\"School for the Unspeakable\\" by Manly Wade Wellman - You will soon guess what is going to happen to the new boy at the prep school, but it's still a spooky read. I'm prepared to bet money that the author originally set this story in England, but the editors changed the location to North Dakota to fit it into this collection.\\"Clay-Shuttered Doors\\" by Helen R. Hull - A woman returns from the dead to host her husband's dinner party.\\"Poor Little Saturday\\" by Madeleine L'Engle - An original fantasy, but more about witches than ghosts--I think. A woman in a deserted, boarded-up plantation house befriends a boy with malaria.\\"Great American Ghost Stories\\" also features a so-so story by Harlan Ellison--\\"Pretty Maggie Moneyeyes\\"--I think he was feeling sorry for himself when he wrote it; and a really awful early Lovecraft: \\"Herbert West - Reanimator.\\" When Lovecraft is bad, he is really, really bad and this story's got sentences like, \\"Not more unutterable could have been the chaos of hellish sound if the pit itself had opened to release the agony of the damned, for in one inconceivable cacophony was centered all the supernal terror and unnatural despair of animate nature.\\"Yes, indeed. Most of the stories in this book have never been anthologized, as far as I can determine, except for a duet by Ambrose Bierce: \\"The Boarded Window;\\" and \\"The Stranger.\\" But the editors could hardly have called their book, \\"Great American Ghost Stories\\" without an entry from the man who defined 'happiness' as, \\"an agreeable sensation arising from contemplating the misery of another.\\""},{"Title":"Great American Ghost Stories","review":"Herein lies a fine collection of Ghost Stories.

Anyone really involved in the South African conflicts would recognise parts of themselves, or their friends in the different characters that are described in the book.

She is articulate and I think she knows it. Like other readers, I'm not sure exactly what she was about, fiddling with the raw emotions of the soldier she calls K. She's a married woman flirting with this soldier, and then near the end of the book she begins flirting with still another man. Makes you wonder if she made a habit of tearing stories out of people whatever the cost. Surely she could have shown enough pure journalistic interest in this African that he would likely have shared his emotional life story. If she had, there would be no question that, paired with her extensive writing talent, she would have a true winner of a book.

This is a haunting, adventurous journey through war torn Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. Alexandra Fuller is a wonderful writer and you can hear, see and smell every minute of this story. This is a must read! A story that will stay with you always. So good, in fact, that it should be made into a movie along with Alexandra Fuller's \\"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight.\\""},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"Alexandra Fuller has done it again. Written in her off-beat style, it is hard to put the book down."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"Alexandra Fuller's book Scribbling the Cat is somehow both languid and horrifyingly intense. Ms. Fuller's portrayal of \\"K,\\" a white soldier who fought in the bush war for the white minority dictatorship in then Southern Rhodesia, is loving, critical, pathetic and inspiring in equal measure, often at the same time. K is a natural character, equal parts Crocodile Dundee, Atticus Finch and Archie Bunker, who, despite his sharp racism and hair trigger temper, is somehow sympathetic and noble.The book follows Alex from her life as a young mother in Wyoming, a transplant from Rhodesia, visiting her parents in Zambia, the former Northern Rhodesia, where they moved following the erosion of freedom and economic justice in Mugabe's Zimbabwe. They know K, who lives up the road, and Alex and he strike up a friendship of sorts. Their interactions consist mostly of sitting in the open talking about K's life, especially during the war. For all of his bravado, he is a deeply traumatized individual, resentful as much of his own atrocities as those committed by ZANLA and ZAPU, the rebel armies he fought. They continue to spend time together, eventually taking a booze fueled trip to K's friend's compound, up the Zambezi, which dominates the area. Alex, after growing too close for comfort to this troubled warrior, simply goes home to her life in America. I don't want to fill too much in here, as I could not do it justice.What makes this a five star book ultimately is Fuller's prose. She is a writer on the order of Hemingway or Steinbeck, able to describe natural settings and the human animal with a concision and melancholy that works in funny anecdotes or horrifying war stories. I hope that you buy this book, it is fantastic."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"Alexandra Fuller's stellar storytelling ability (of which anyone who read Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight is well aware) has not diminished. But both the premise behind the story and the book itself are a bit of a mess. On a Christmastime visit to her parents' banana farm in Zambia, she questions her stoic, reserved man-of-few-words father about his role in the Rhodesian War. He, who (p 32, 33) \\"was called up into the Police Anti-Terrorist Unit,\\" tells her, \\"We were just a bunch of bumbling farmers buggering in the bush without much of a clue.\\" In the following section, she provides a bit of background on the war along with some commentary (p 36), \\"It is tempting...to think of the Rhodesian War as being about right and wrong, black and white. The truth is, of course, blurrier than that...it was also a war of clashing nations and conflicting ideals.\\" During the same trip, she meets an intriguing former soldier of the Rhodesian Light Infantry Commando Unit, \\"K.\\" After walking miles to his farm and spending the day with him, she seems as determined to extract enough details of his experiences during the war to fill a book as he is to convince her that she is \\"the one.\\" He is an often tearful, born again Christian (of which she appears to feel some disdain), with a violent, tragic, sad past. She soon returns home to her husband and children in Wyoming, of which (about the state) she writes (p 72), \\"...had seemed like an acceptable compromise between my Zambia and my husband's America...\\" Considering that census figures from 2005 show Wyoming as 94.8% white and from 2002 that the population density as 5.1 persons per square mile, her contention is ludicrous. Back in Zambia the following October to obtain information for a newspaper article, she convinces K to join her on a road trip to Mozambique. The purpose of the trip (which begins four months later), besides the obvious (great material for a book), is to allow K to revisit his old war haunts, thus \\"Road Trip With An African War Veteran\\" might be a more accurate subtitle. Fuller describes K as (p 71, 72) \\"a fantasy or a nightmare,\\" \\"an act of God. Or of evil. Or of both,\\" \\"shell-shocked,\\" and \\"explosive.\\" And the trip does not disappoint. K becomes even more enthralled with Fuller (and even threatens to leave one night out of jealousy, which is not entirely unwarranted) and shares stories about his war-time experiences (usually involving tears) and post-war life (usually involving religious references). K's friend of a friend hosts their visit, which involves lots of fishing, story-sharing and the presence of a 160-pound lion cub whose antics provide a nice bit of comic relief from all the dreary war talk. Although worth reading, the misleading subtitle, author's passive (get the story by any means necessary?) behavior towards the infatuated K, and overuse of the word \\"scribble\\" result in a story that seems a bit forced at times. Better: Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight and A Long Way Gone by Ishmael Beah."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"Readers of Fuller's first book, Don't Lets Go..., will likely be both pleased and disappointed with Scribbling The Cat. Fuller has lost none of the poetic earthiness and honesty that makes her work so delicious. Sadly, the story line seems somewhat lacking in substance, given the complexity and gravity of the war. Readers are provided with a only a vague itinerary (Mozambique battlefields) and only the briefest thumbnail sketch of the conflicts' major events. Also missing is the charm of Fuller's own innocence. Unlike her first book, birth and fate are not why she finds herself in precarious circumstances. Rather, it's her own questionable judgment and admitted desire to push the envelope. Nevertheless, the characters are memorable, and once again Fuller brings to life the land in all its sensory glory.The book reads like a gifted-but-underachieving student's school report. As if she attempted to overcome a dearth of solid research by relying heavily on descriptive talent...B+"},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"Couldn't put it down -- admired the writing on every page. Cringed at the war veteran's searing pain, laughed aloud at the author's laconic descriptions of African village life and the permeable boundary between human and animal (insects, crocodiles, hippos, etc) living arrangements.Note the equally strong negative reactions of many other customer reviewers -- it moved them, too!"},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"A well written and fairly well researched book... and an immense disappointment. A married woman, happily undertaking an \\"adventure\\" in landmine-ridden Mozambique with a man who is clearly in love with her. Sadly this, together with the fact that yet another unmarried man also falls for her charms, completely detracts from the story. Furthermore, I am a displaced Zimbabwea, and my father and husband both fought on the wrong side of that war. Their memories of that time are somewhat different to Ms Fuller's, and it's very doubtful that a man as tragic and scarred by his internal demons as K would open his heart to this relatively unknown woman. Having read Peter Godwin's excellent \\"Mukiwa\\" and \\"When the Crocodile Eats the Sun\\" I can honestly say this book falls a distant way behind those two."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"After finishing Scribbling the Cat, the reader comes away with a history and an understanding of why it was important for Fuller to write this story. In her signature way, it's honest, interesting and she tells the story without judgement---which is why her writing is so compelling. However, if this book had been written before Don't Let's Go, most readers would not have been compelled to read futher. I think because it is a sort of travel log, it lacks that compelling pull of what happens next because what changes and what is learned is internal within the people in the story. But that being said, if a reader has an interest in Africa, Fuller's life lends us a keen eye to life inside. Read Don't Let's Go first is my only advice"},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"In the end, the reader is left wondering why the Who, What, Where, When is not complemented with the longed-for Why. Namely, why a book that slams to a dead-end? Fuller attempts unsuccessfully (as an afterthought?) to depict herself as someone much in need of \\"closure\\" (not her term) with respect to her white-colonial childhood in war-torn Zimbabwe, and in so doing is overly obtuse in sporadic representations of empathy with ruined lives, black and white. Her stylish, semi-metaphorical descriptions of African ambiance too often seem detached from larger literary purpose, amounting on the whole to high-flown travelogue. The impulsiveness of her travels with a psychically (pre?)-damaged war veteran leads her, and us, nowhere except to disgruntling uncertainties about her, the narrator. Irresolution, multifariously manifested, unfortunately scribbles the book."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"I was greatly diappointed in Fuller's newest work for a multitude of reasons. Being familiar with all the areas she tells us about, this can only be a work of fiction and hence a great disappointment to her once loyal and supportive readers:1. She changed names of places both in Zambia and Zimbabwe for no apparent reason. What's the point of changing the name of Mazabuka, Lake Kariba or even the Zambezi River itself? Why change the name of Milton High School (which incidently was NOT a bastion of Jewish boys!)2. K, I believe is totally fictionous or a combination of antedotal stories. What he did during the Rhodesian war is just too much to accept. Incidently, the RLI never, repeat never, sent four-man \\"sticks\\" into Mozambique. Any attacks were done by significantly larger patrols of force, involving not only the RLI but the SAS and often supported by air units. Small teams would have been sent in by the SAS and/or the Selous Scouts.3. Fuller has a husband and two children in the US and yet leads 2 men in her journey with her sexual prowness?? I can only conclude that Ms. Fuller needs to speak with somebody that has a couch in his/her office?4. The title \\"scribbling\\" is new to me. It was not a term ever used in Rhodesia. The only thing you even scribbled was in your note book!! So, why the lie??I can go on, but the short message is that this is a work of fiction. Fuller has a very engaging writing style, Hemmingway-like, but the story is pure BS. Just in case you didn't already quess, I am no longer a fan of this author and will not read any more of anything she publishes."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"Alexandra Fuller's Childhood memoirsDon't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight: An African Childhoodwould be a must pre-read BEFORE reading this book- otherwise her lack of presence (except as an observer) in Scribbling the Cat would lead one to think she is, perhaps, shallow and niave.Other reviewers here have stated that Ms Fuller is cruel, manipulative and lacks honesty, I disagree - it is a telling of the story - and \\"K\\" opened up to her (even if he was struggling with a delusion that she was the \\"promised one\\") of his own volition. Other reviewers have critisiced her for bring a married woman travelling in the company of unmarried men -I suspect the sense of outrage and male ownership of women's lives and bodies have more to do with that opinion that acknowledged in the reviews. From a different perspective, who would care if the story was told by a man - about his wife and kids in Wyoming?This story is honest - Alexandra's adventure into the life and history of \\"K\\" the former Rhodesian soldier is more journalistic that autobiographical - she protects herself (and if you read her childhood memoir one would understand why) and is trying, I think, to sort out her shame and guilt of having been raised in white Rhodesia. It is thought provoking, disturbing and gives one a sense that despite the horrors of war, the useless, bloody wars of Africa and the atrocities men perpetrate on women and each other - that there are some redemptions. It is a road story and I was immersed in a different viewpoint and moved by it, cried and laughed. Her prose is beautiful. I have never read such aching longing for a country left - her descriptions of the Southern African night sky particularly - similar to the Inuit who have 40 words for white/snow - Bobo Fuller has 40 descriptions for the night sky in Southern Africa - each as evocative as the last.I highly recommend Scribbling the Cat if you have a heart and want to see a glimpse of the inside of the effect Africa has on white people."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"The author Alexandra Fuller grew up as a young white girl in both Southern and Northern Rhodesia in the 1970s as black freedom fighters or guerilla soldiers fought a violent war for independence from their colonial master, Great Britain. Clearly, there is confusion to be overcome when you are brought up as a good, honest, caring, responsible person and yet you end up on the losing side. Were your values wrong and were you really a bad person underneath? Fuller, now married with kids and settled in the USA revisits her parents still living in Zambia, the former Northern Rhodesia. The trip back was an attempt to find answers to that conundrum.Fuller embarks on an overland journey from Zambia through Zimbabwe, the former Southern Rhodesia, to Mozambique visiting the sites of former guerilla skirmishes and hiding holes where the white resistance fighters camped in the African bush. She is driven by a man known only as \\"K\\" who himself fought on the losing side in the Rhodesias before moving to fight as a mercenary in Mozambiqe only to become a loser again. K is a complex character, a one time murderer and torturer, moody, a blindly faithful born-again Christian and understandably carrying a lot of psychological baggage. He lost his young son to illness and has long since been abandoned by his former wife. He now farms a few hectares of land and ekes out a simple living alongside a river in Zambia near Fuller's parents. Her and K's journey to the old battlefields brings Fuller into contact with other former white mercenaries. Gradually their ongoing nightmares and \\"lives on a knife's edge\\" are revealed through a bizarre series of incidents. It is clear that they are afflicted in the same way as veterans from other conflicts such as Vietnam and the Gulf wars.This hardly surprising revelation appears to be the conclusion to the book which meanders rather meaninglessly. The story was disappointing in the sense that it really went nowhere and didn't shed any light on Fuller's original quest to find out about herself and the childhood influences on her personality and character. Sadly, \\"Scribbling the Cat\\" didn't reach the heights of her best selling maiden novel \\"Don't let's go to the Dogs Tonight\\"."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"I don't know what to say; rather, I have too much to say. I didn't grow up in a godforsaken war zone as Fuller did in Africa but I was neck-deep and more in the colonial environment of Panama. This book cut me to the quick. Even without my background, however, the book is a special compilation of pages that very much need to be read. It's an unusual and amazing book; a reminder of how humanity stretches and can be brought to the edge of redemption before it knows it's not quite human any more. This book will be on my end-of-year Best Books list, no question. Even though I still am flumoxed by its contents. Which, I think was the writer's point. In which case, she done just fine."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"With so few books about the conflict in Rhodesia, it's disappointing when somebody comes up with something that is so factually inaccurate. Although the story is well written, there are too many mistakes - or exaggerations - to make it a plausible or credible account of the Rhodesian war, and the people who fought it.Two thumbs down."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"Provides good insight into the life of a soldier during the Rhodesian war and is appropriately graphic in parts. The author's ralationship with her subject gets a little tedious and annoying. Worth reading but there are better books out there about the experiences of Rhodesian soldiers."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"This was a huge disappointment for me because I really enjoyed Fuller's book, \\"Let's Don't Go To The Dogs Tonight.\\" Problems with this title included a lack of focus for the first half, followed by an apology for a wartime event (during the Rhodesian conflict) that suddenly becomes a vehicle for slandering the efforts of those who fought against communism and terrorism. I tried to read on, but after a few more pages my copy found its way into a McDonald's trash can near Gate 17 in Reagan National."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"I liked this as a follow up to her original!

I found \\"Scribbling\\" to be rambling and without purpose at times. It seems unfinished and incomplete."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"i just got back from Zimbabwe and I don't think Mrs. Fuller is exagerating the experience she had in Southern Africa on this trip. The book is surreal because the country, the experience of the disenfranchised minority of white Zimbabweans and the remaining effects of the war are still being felt. The result of Mugabe's recent attempts to hold onto political power by making farmers and his political opponents the enemy has plunged the country into inflation of about 6000 Zim to 1 US dollar. Her language, the local Zim phrasing, the words used to discribe the birds calls all make the experience more real and alive. But the book is about more than biography but about war and how it effects individual people. I listenened to it on tape with a Vietnam vet who recognized many of the feelings expressed. Those who accuse Mrs Fuller of explioting K ignore the fact that she is honest enough to share her own mistakes and frailties. I would recomment this book highly."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"There is a certain subgenre of literature about the Third World that insists on reminding the reader of the heat, bugs, filth, poverty, and misery on every page, turning the problems of the developing world into a sort of fetish. Scribbling the Cat epitomizes the style. In this book full of vivid images, very little actually happens; the protagonist, \\"K\\", is a crazed, violent pseudomystical freak on page ten and a crazed, violent pseudomystical freak on page 250. Two stars not one due to Fuller's strong, vivid prose."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"One could have their spat with the author about not revealing herself, or more of her role, in the events she portrays. But, she has captured the essence of war, and the impact of war on the psyche, as very few have. \\"The Thin Red Line\\" comes to mind, as does Hemingway. The author is not up to those standards of writing, generally, but she has captured moments, distilled essences, that offer rare insight into war and how the people who are in it see that time. She gives us moments of truth - descriptions of what really happens in war - that are so rare they may be unique. These descriptions apply to the warriors who came home from Troy, the western front of WW2, and Vietnam.The author also gives us insight into Africa, and black Africans. Why they are what they are today, how they became that way, and what they politically are.Her plot, on the other hand, has no pretensions of greatness. It has no overriding theme, no great catharsis. Rather, it ends in a very unsatisfying manner, but exactly like real life. In real life, we don't have neat endings, or conclusions, and in this case, neither does the author or her characters.You don't often get this kind of reality. Most people who have been there won't talk about it. Just because they won't talk doesn't mean the impact isn't real. This book manages to capture some of that reality. And, she doesn't just capture the warriors psyche, she captures the enemy, and the civilian supporter's psychological realities.As a bonus, the descriptions of Africa, and life in Africa, are incredibly illuminating. My copy of this book had 251 pages of writing - but an encyclopedia of description for one who is discerning enough to see it."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked this book up, but was looking for a change of pace. Unlike most of the readers here, I haven't actually read the other book of hers. It was simply something different.So the book starts off rather charming. People wandering around Africa (Zambia, I suppose) and just describing the absurdity of the condition. Describing the landscape and the people. I enjoyed that. A refreshing change.As it continues, we actually begin to notice ... what aren't really flaws in the Author's character so much as, well, as the Amazon reviewer put it, craters. You start to see that both the people (K and the Author) are fairly scarred and unhappy people.This goes on, and the unhappiness really increases substantially. I found the book to have gone from charming and lighthearted to depressing and rather bleak. This, perhaps intentionally, seems to coincide with the landscape. We start off in Zambia at the downright comical parents' fish farm, and continue to a somewhat bleaker K's home, and then back to the States, thoroughly unhappy and indeed missing everything in Africa, and then it gets really unpleasant -- lost in the African outback, being chased by a pet Lion (!), and so on.So while it might be hard to finish, as the change is so drastic (although mercifully slow), like other art, it is sometimes painful, and we as readers are compelled to do so.As another reviewer mentioned, there just isn't a hollywood ending. It ends. There isn't anything tied up or completed, the threads of the book remain, sadly, frayed. That, however, I suppose, is the Author's point.I'd been trying to decide between 3 and 4 stars for the book, and erred on the side of 4. I'd probably read it again, but I'd make sure to do it at a time when I wasn't looking for anything pleasant or uplifting."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"This is another amazing book by Fuller. Buy it. Read it. Soak up all of its unflinching honesty. What a wonderful and refreshing thing that there are no Hollywood endings in this book, or pretty bows that tie everything up all nicely. It's raw and so completely human. And so beautifully written.Stunning."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"I bought this book because I loved Alexandra Fuller's first book. However, this one is riddled with factual errors. First, I was born, raised and educated in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. There is not and never has been an Mweni junior school. Milton junior and senior were popular with Bulawayo's jewish community. Is this what K means? and whose error is it? K's or the author's?Second, even the cover is wrong. Zimbabwe's civil war occured during approximately 1967 and 1980. By 1981, the date mentioned on the fly leaf, the war had been over for more than a year.Not up to the high standard of the first book, I fear."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"The author should have stated that this book was fictitious rather than stringing the reader along. The first few chapters are engaging, but it is unrealistic that she would leave her family and, on a whim, travel with \\"K\\" to his old Rhodesian War haunts. It was also a fallacy to suggest that she was so naive as to not pick up on his attraction for her. I was truly dissapointed by the self-promoting arrogance of this author and the trivialized generalizations that were haphazardly made about Africa. A true waste of time."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"After reading Fuller's first book I was surprised at the uncritical praise given to it. It was hardly credible given her age at the time of the events. The post-modernists might excuse her but given that it was supposedly autobiographical I found it hard to trust. The same is true of her latest work. There is an air of exaggeration about it that left me wondering whether this is a work of fact or fiction. Ms. Fuller certainly seems to have some trouble with depicting other than an extremely biased and overly emotional rendition of life in post-colonial Africa. Perhaps the fact that she has chosen to live in the USA contributes to her angst but if one wants to balance out the story she tells I suggest Paul Theroux's \\"Dark Star\\" and the works of others. There are far more intelligent and better written books on the market than that which Ms Fuller has written."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"I've found this very informative, as I have just started learning about Rhodesia, with only small tidbits from old SOFs"},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"This is one of the must amuzing and informative books I have read about Africa and being African. I started to read it one night for an hour before sleep and didn't put it down untill well after dawn. Fuller brings to life a vibrant late twentieth centure Africa. Lets Not Go to the Dogs Tonight blossoms in both style and content. It is brilliant."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"I was very unclear about how to rate this book. It's brilliantly written and about a subject -- the brutality of the war in Rhodesia and the human fallout from it -- that we don't know much about in the US. It's an amazing, up-close picture of a desolate part of Africa, that is nonetheless teeming with life and interesting individuals.But there is a kind of patent dishonesty going on here that clouds the book's best intentions and the author's considerable storytelling gifts. The story is straightforwardly presented as authobiographical, but Ms. Fuller is incredibly stingy with revealing herself (while she virtually guts her subject, the former White Rhodesian soldier she calls \\"K\\"). In order to get \\"K\\" to open up to her and tell his absolutely wrenching, devasting story, Ms. Fuller manipulates him in an unusually cruel way -- she allows him to fall in love with her (even though she is a married woman with two children back in the US) and continues her deception throughout a long road trip, during which he confides his darkest secrets to her, believing that she is \\"the one\\" -- the perfect mate sent to him by God to heal his loneliness and his pain.Although the stories of military violence, racism and horrific African poverty are deeply affecting, I was profoundly disturbed at the way Alexandra Fuller obtained K's life story. In many respects, she hurt and victimized this terribly damaged man in ways that are psychologically worse than violence -- by betraying his trust. (When I was in high school, there was a not-very-nice term for women who use their sexuality to keep men on a string.) Furthermore, Ms. Fuller is coy enough not to let us know if the attraction was at all mutual or what the state of her marriage was. After all, she has left her husband and children back in Wyoming...it matters a great deal to the reader if she is purely a writer in search of a story (however manipulative) or if she is actually a unhappy wife looking for a potential lover. This unspoken story nagged at me, especially the last part of the book where Ms. Fuller actively begins a flirtacious relationship with ANOTHER ex-soldier...basically trivializing not only her mysterious marriage but her confusing relationship to \\"K\\".The last time I was so distracted from the content of a non-fiction book by the actions of the author was Kathryn Harrison's \\"The Kiss\\", about that author's adult love affair with her own biological father. As bad as incest is, somehow Alexandra Fuller's deceptive and cruel manipulation of \\"K\\" to get a clever and unusual story bothers me even more. Certainly it should make the reader think about just how far it is reasonable or moral for a writer to go to obtain material for a book...does the fact that \\"K\\" had a truly fascinating story to tell mean that it was OK to use him and to break his heart?In conclusion, I found this story to be sadistic and disturbing, although the author is a fine writer and superb storyteller, she has a lot of work to do in developing a conscience."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"Alexandra Fuller's second narrative of Africa tells about her friendship with a former Rhodesian soldier code-named \\"K\\". After soldiering in the bloody civil conflicts in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and Mozambique, K tries to start a new life of farming in Zambia, where he lives on the farm next to Ms. Fuller's parents. In a visit to her parents from her adopted American home, the author (nicknamed Bobo) meets the former soldier K, and on somewhat of a lark, gets him to agree to take her on a road trip back to Mozambique, to show her where he fought as a mercenary soldier.There are many ugly, brutal details about the African civil wars in this book. Although the reading is painful, the message is important...war creates \\"fatal cracks\\" in both the soldiers of war and civilian bystanders, cracks which take the rest of a lifetime to repair. Bobo undertakes this story thinking that she could better understand the violent man that K has become by \\"walking a mile in his shoes\\". Yet the reader comes away with the lesson that war leaves a different impression on all who are involved.Ms. Fuller's writing is beautiful and non-judgemental. The book is interspersed with amazing snapshots of the African people and countryside. I definitely recommend reading Ms. Fuller's own memoir first, \\"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight\\". And be warned that the images in \\"Scribbling the Cat\\" are quite graphic. Nonetheless, this story is a compelling look at Africa, both today and during its civil wars of the 1980s."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"Alexandra Fuller is a white woman who grew up in Rhodesia in the 1970s. Life was harsh and there was a war on. Eventually, her parents lost their farm and had to leave the country which is now called Zimbabwe. Eventually the family settled in Zambia and still live there. Alexandra, however, married and moved to Wyoming, where she lives with her husband and two children. One day, while visiting her parents, she met a man who had been a soldier in the defeated Rhodesian army. She was fascinated by him as well as the whole story of what had happened in Rhodesia during her childhood. A few months later she planned a short trip with him into the land where the fighting occurred. It was a journey of discovery for both of them. This book is the result of that journey.Let me explain the title. The word \\"scribbling\\" means \\"killing\\" in the slang of the region. And it refers to the expression \\"curiosity killed the cat\\". She decided to take this trip because she was curious. It's as simple as that.The former soldier, who she refers to as \\"K\\" is war hardened. He's now a loner, living on a farm he literally carved out of the African bush himself. Some native Africans work for him but his relationships with them are simply that aof boss and worker. His former marriage had ended in divorce and it was clear from the beginning that he was interested in Alexandra even though she was married.She wasn't interested in him in that way. And I'll say right up front there that even though towards the end of their trip there was some romantic tension between them, it never materialized. The book instead is about their relationship to Africa and the way that Africa itself has shaped their personalities.I live in New York and my whole life is one of material comfort. I turn on the water tap to get water, the air is free of insects and flies, electricity gives me light at night and cools my apartment in the summer. For Alexandra's African family and also for \\"K\\", these are luxuries. They are constantly lighting fires with a match in order to boil water for tea. Their homes have no electricity. They are always sweat soaked from the horrific humid heat. Taking a shower means pouring a bucket of water on themselves. If they have a car, gasoline is very expensive and they do not use air conditioning. All this is a given.During their trip, K told Alexandra stories. He remembered the guns and the death and the terrible fright. He admitted to atrocities with deep regret. Along the way they met some of the men he had served with. They were all hardened war veterans. One of them lived alone on an island with a lion. Another kept smoking unfiltered African cigarettes even though he obviously was suffering from lung disease. They talked about old times. And how they had to go for days without water and it would get so bad they would be willing to kill each other for just a sip of the precious liquid. They romanticized the fistfights. And, one of the most interesting things was that they all seemed to accept the life they were thrust into and remembered the years of the war as a time in their lives that they felt very much alive.Wisely, the author focused her book on this trip and subtitled the book \\"Travels With An African Soldier\\". Personally, I might have liked to hear more about her husband and children back in Wyoming. I also would have liked to see a map included somewhere in the book. But I think her intent was to focus on the impact of war on people, and on the small sub-set of Rhodesian soldiers. By doing this, she made her story universal.I loved the book, couldn't put it down and definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"I read this book almost two years after reading this author's first book, \\"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight\\" which was one of my all time favorite books. I don't believe Ms. Fuller's intent was for this book to be taken as literally as some readers seem to taking it. Don't look for flaws in facts. She purposely said she was \\"covering her tracks\\" like \\"any good soldier\\" would do. I loved this book almost as much as her first book. That says a lot. She is a wonderful writer. Her marriage is her own business to those reviewers who blame her for not discussing it more in this book. Obviously anyone concerned about her marriage or the factual flaws do not get the reason for this book. This book is not meant to provide answers. Instead, it simply propounds more questions for the reader to contemplate. Authors that imply that they have all the answers bore me to no end. Perhaps that's why I love Ms. Fuller's writing so much. She has no such egotistical pretense in her writing. Instead, this book is about much, much more than the seemingly dry subject of traveling through various parts of Africa with an ex-soldier. This book is about \\"Life, Death, Love, Hate and God\\" among other even less tangible things. I loved it and will read it again. Thank you again, Ms. Fuller, for another wonderful book about your experiences in Africa. We seem to share some experiences of living in a place that does not make often make sense or fit into other person's scope of reality. Your writing sometimes reminds me of what it's like to live in the Virgin Islands, a subject I hope to write about one day as eloquently as you write about Africa."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"While I was waiting for my copy to arrive, I wondered at the title, and what could be meant by 'scribbling'.As a schoolboy in Rhodesia, growing up as the clouds of war gathered, I had never heard the term used, except in the sense of something you did with crayons, on paper. As a teenager, living in the married quarters of KGVI Barracks in Salisbury, where my father was a regular Army officer, I never heard the expression being used in the context of killing someone. In January 1976, when I was conscripted into the Army, and in the subsequent years that I spent in an operational unit, as a national serviceman, and later as a territorial, I never heard of anybody being 'scribbled'. Like 'K', I spent time at Mukumbura-by-the-Sea (good ol' Siddi-el-Mukkers!), but nobody that I recall ever used the term.We talked of culling gooks; slotting floppies; drilling zots. Getting 'pulled' meant getting shot (fatally or otherwise) as did 'taking a round'. Getting 'blallered' (as 'K' puts it) generally meant getting very drunk, although it also meant to kill. Sometimes you heard of people getting whacked, or popped; the American personnel who drifted in, looking for post-Vietnam excitement, added a whole new glossary to our war-talk -but, still, I never heard of anybody being 'scribbled'.In common with the casual brutality of all wars, we had a variety of terms for killing - but I never heard that one.So - belief suspended - it was no surprise to read some of 'K's' fantasies about operating in Mozambique. Although the Rhodesians spent plenty of time in 'Porkers', it was generally as part of a large, organised cross-border operation. Single 'sticks' didn't go wandering into Mozambique, in hot pursuit or otherwise - only the Selous Scouts did that, and only for very high-level intelligence gathering. The notion that an RLI commander would let four of his men go deep into Mozambique after a single terrorist is ridiculous. FRELIMO might not have been the greatest soldiers in the world, but there were a helluva lot of them.Although it was an interesting read, it was a disappointing one; despite Ms Fuller's undeniable writing skills, I guess you can't really expect a third-party account to be accurate.Will I be buying Bobo's next work? I doubt it."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"Though she was only a child, the memory of cheering white soldiers on to victory in the Rhodesian war haunts Alexandra Fuller, and probably always will. Fuller, author of the acclaimed memoir Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight, understands that war-which ultimately led to black minority rule and democratic elections-probably as well as anyone alive today.It was a war about race, she explains in her latest book Scribbling the Cat. Minority white leaders did not want to surrender the upper hand in Rhodesia, later renamed Zimbabwe. Even so, the good guys are not always so easy to sort from the bad guys: black soldiers fought on the side of white oppression and black communities have been known to nurture their own tyrants.On a visit to her parents in Zambia, Fuller concludes that writing about the war from the point of view of \\"K,\\" who fought to keep Rhodesia white, will unlock previously untold secrets. She contrives to travel with him to Mozambique, the site of many war atrocities.They travel in about the worst discomfort imaginable-unpaved roads, a dearth of modern plumbing and no refrigeration. Being on the road with a nosy journalist might try anyone's patience, and K is no exception. Adding to the tension, K has a crush on Fuller.Fuller hopes to deliver something meaningful about the nature of war and the scars it leaves on its fighters, especially those whom contemporary ethics have found to be in the wrong. K discloses gruesome memories; most shocking is his assault on a young village woman who later died-after betraying the location of Rhodesian liberation soldiers. But K's stories don't add up to much in the way of revelation or insight.\\"Nothing K and Mapenga had told me, or shown me-and nothing I could ever write about them-could undo the pain of their having being on the planet,\\" she writes. Her frustration in trying to make sense of war's horror is her finest point."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"What is most striking about a book that contains multitudes of gob smacking passages is Alexandra (Bobo) Fullers excruciating honesty. At every turn in this story of her return to Zimbabwe there is an opportunity for an easier and more palatable course. Bo's hard drinking hellfire willed and most definitely bigoted mother is shown in all of her grace and courage, rather than an easy stereotype of colonialism, which is an almost impossible balance to achieve with one's own parent. Ultimately Bo's decision to enter her own Heart of Darkness with K., a brutal, broken and heartbreaking former soldier of the wars for Independance makes sense if there was no other way to heal the damage and accept the beauty that being from Africa has left her with. The conditions of their travel (hellish heat, corrupt officials and the Furies that lurk at every watering hole and dune) and K.'s sudden outbursts, both intensely savage and tender by turns would make a woman less dedicated to finding the truth at whatever costs catch the first plane out of Africa. For an understanding of what war, any war, actually costs this book is unparalleled. I heard the author speak here in Wyoming recently and I can't stop thinking about what she said about her attempt to heal herself, to make whole what had been broken in herself and in K. She said that what they had done instead was to wrench those wounds open and dig their hands deep inside, gripping the most sensitive, raw depths of each others shame and hurt. By laying open these wounds and exposing their flaws without flinching or turning away they were both given a greater gift. I shrink to say that the result was acceptance or something easy. There isn't anything easy about this book but it is searingly honest and it also bears mentioning really funny in a sort of death may come soon why not crack a joke here, what have I got to lose way."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"Satisfying and captivating. This is a haunting, yet beautifully textured, continuation of Fuller's younger life memoired in \\"Don't Let's Go to The Dog's Tonight\\". After skimming over seven years of living the fat life in the US she's drawn back to the raw life of her African childhood to research the wars which raged on around her youth. She encounters soldiers reluctant to reveal the realities of being a warrior, including her father. Bo's faced with a new understanding of her own history, the people she's left behind and of the war torn Africa (specifically former Rhodesia and Mozambique) that was beyond understanding as a child.Though this isn't meant to be a history lesson in itself, however, it's timely; considering the HIV epidemic and the many conflicts currently raging round the globe, the attitudes of those that start wars, and how wars effect so many for so long.Her travels are written with the eyes of a painter along with humerous, soulful, philosophical observations of what it is to be human here on earth. It's all here; love and longing, fear and hatred, courage and bravado, depression and abuse, faith and endurance, peace and tranquilty: and advice from Alexadra Fuller's father, \\"Don't look back so much or you'll get wiped out on the tree in front of you\\".We're left wondering if Fuller has learned the lessons from her travels with a soldier that are obvious to the reader regarding accountability and vulnerabilty. I missed the unapologetic observations she's famous for regarding her view of her role in this journey. Fuller finds herself, however, unapologetically halfway around the world from her husband and children with some pretty questionable characters and claims she is the same person she was at the beginning of her journey. I loved this book but I can't help but feel it's a memoir written too close to real time to be completely told. I'm not sure if she hit the tree or not but maybe that was her intention. Read it and decide."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"From reading Alexandra Fuller's Don't Let's Go To The Dogs Tonight we expect excruciating honesty. We certainly get that in Scribbling the Cat but here Fuller also holds back as much as she reveals. While other reviewers find this dishonest, or even immoral, I think much of the understated tension in the story between Fuller and K provides bold richness to the narrative. It is obvious that Fuller is holding back. That this author can do this (for more often than not she uses words like a scalpel to scrape away at the layers of reality to get to the core, and can lay bare a character till we feel we are viewing an x-ray) is a testimony to her genius. We see Fuller experiencing the Africa of K, and the enigma of K himself, while holding a vital strain from the reader: why, beyond the similarities of their common heritage, is K so intriguing to her? Little hints are scattered through the book, like the bread Hansel uses to mark his way back home: on pg 137 of the hardcover K informs Fuller that his ex-wife had an affair, and says \\"'she was possessed. What else can make a woman do what she did?' I puffed hard on my cigarette and said nothing.\\" Here, Fuller the writer is holding back her cards. At moments like this, Fuller saying nothing is almost as good as Fuller providing us with a thousand words. Later, K seems to get at Fuller's essential core when he says \\"You play with men. You know that? You play with men and you play with their feelings and you are going to destroy yourself. You are going to destroy your family.\\" That Fuller allows K to utter this (whether she believes it or not) is gutsy and intriguing. As is the quote she puts in her own mouth \\"Why do I push people to destruction?\\" After Fuller and K argue about her brief moment of intimacy with Mapenga [which Fuller tells us was only kissing, but lasted \\"some minutes\\"] Fuller explains the reconciliation with K as \\"The routine of tea, the casual domesticity, the drying underwear on the fence, the unfed cat, the two-o'clock-in the morning quarrels, and the implied apology, the unwashed dishes. From a distance, whatever this was could easily be mistaken for a marriage.\\" Fuller and K in fact become a husband and wife and their intimacy is so complete in its intensity that its physical consummation is irrelevant. We see two people, like naked souls, trying desperately, through the medium of their individual lives, to understand what it is to be alive. If this is not intimacy, what is? The theme of this book is the civil war in Rhodesia and the effect it had on K, his comrades and Fuller. But an understated element is there as well, getting dragged along like a shadow. We have a writer pushing the outer envelope of experience to get at something essential. She is fearless in pursuing K regardless of where it takes her. And the reader of this book feels almost voyeuristic as the elements put into the book (and those left out!) give the startling appearance that real life is unfolding before us; it is ugly, it is pretty, it is grave and disgusting, but a feeling of absolute veracity strings all these elements along - and the result is mesmerizing. Ultimately, for me, this book is about how to craft an excellent book: what to put in, what to leave out, and how to explain life without reducing its mystery.I think Alexandra Fuller is a masterful writer."},{"Title":"Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier","review":"\\"Scribbling the Cat\\" feels like an excuse that a bored married woman gave her husband to go have an adventure. Never before have I been so acutely aware of (or speculated on) a writer's ulterior motives in the telling of her story.It felt as if she was censoring her writing. Was this to protect husband/children? Was this because she was being dishonest with herself? Whatever the reason, I felt as though she was being dishonest with me, the reader.The story of 'K' is laid bare across the pages of her book in, at times, painful reading. Fuller claims that she undertook this journey with 'K' to confront her own Rhodesian past and tell 'K's story. Yet, at the end, I know as little about Fuller as I did in the beginning. She reveals nothing of herself -- other than the occasional \\"thin\\" explanation that to me felt more like rationalization than anything else.I find the work fundamentally disingenuous, although Fuller is undoubtedly a skillful word smith and creates a compelling narrative."},{"Title":"Late Marque Spitfire Aces 1942-45","review":"Redoubtable writer Alfred Price writed a good book, which gives a general picture of the pilots who fought in this kind of airplane.

This book is small enough to be called a pocket visual dictionary and has an exceptional variety of clear, well-organized, indexed images.While some categories, like the human anatomy section, provide detailed vocabulary well beyond my needs, other sections are wanting of some basic classroom vocabulary. Words like binder and binder paper are not included, but I have yet to find another visual dictionary that includes them.

So, I checked Amazon to see if they have any foreign language visual dictionaries and they have this one and it is completely comprehensive and includes just about every single photo/German word association imaginable, including technical words.

The author spent years researching, collecting and testing authentic, seasonal farmhouse recipes (from all over the country) made with only the freshest ingredients. (The recipes are full-proof!!) This is one of the few books that allows everyone to make some of the most appetizing Italian dishes--just as the Italians do. Everything is explained in detail--from ingredients to techniques to customs to mail-order sources--in one of the most complete books ever written on the subject. And if this weren't enough, the flavor of the food is beautifully captured in some of the most exquisite photographs ever taken of Italy and its food. This book is a MUST for anyone who likes to cook and/or eat the most mouth-watering Italian cuisine!!"},{"Title":"The Four Seasons of Italian Cooking: Harvest Recipes from the Farms and Vineyards of the Italian Countryside","review":"This is a great Italian cookbook, very different from most of the cookbooks you see. Not only does it have great recipes but it also tells great stories about all the various farms the authors visit. And it also tells you how you can visit the farms yourself. The pictures in particular are very interesting. They are not the usual slick shots. It seems like they were all done on location and they have a feel of food photo-journalism.

I was able to read this cookbook while at the farm, and made a note to immediately try to find it when I returned home. Amazon is the only place to get it, since it is now out of print. It was only released in America, so you can't even find an Italian version of the book. The other recipes from other cooks featured in the book look equally as good.

Have come to really enjoy this series! My husband is British and reading this feels like \\"home.\\"According to her webpage, Ann Purser lives in the East Midlands, in a small and attractive village which still has a village shop, a garage, pub and church.

Lois is tough, funny, and extremely loyal. The story line in all the Lois Meade books is entertaining and will keep you wondering what will happen next, but Weeping on Wednesday was the best. Can't wait for the Thursday book."},{"Title":"Weeping on Wednesday (Severn House Large Print)","review":"I continue to read this series. I picked up Murder on Monday and enjoyed it enough to read Terror on Tuesday. There was something about 'Tuesday' that bored me, but I'd already ordered Weeping on Wednesday, so...After the disappointment of 'Tuesday', I was pleasantly surprised by Wednesday. The romantic thought of living in an old mill peaked my interest and the family that lived in it did too. I do wish Ms. Purser would include more descriptive passages to help the reader feel as though he's there, enjoying the sounds and smells of the village. My interest was captured by the anxious-on-the-inside, prim-on-the-outside spinster, Enid Abraham, whom I immediately liked. In fact, it would be a great idea if Ms. Purser moved Lois and family out of the village and allowed Enid to play sleuth. She has the tenacity and intestinal fortitude it takes to dive into a criminal investigation. The plot, what plot the story contained, was familiar yet still enjoyable. I wasn't bothered by the simple plot, but I have to confess that I don't care for the series' main character, Lois Meade. She's often rude, allows her gem of a mother, 'Gran' to do most of the caretaking of the family (Lucky Lois), and snips at her husband Derek. Lois annoys me in that she can't decided if something is \\"interesting\\" or \\"interestin'\\". Since my own grammar is imperfect, I don't mind a dropped 'g' at all, but I do wonder why Lois's grammar goes downhill when she speaks with Inspector Cowgill. Does he intimidate her or does she want to appear to him as the cleaning lady she was instead of the owner of a cleaning business that she is? Whichever, I'd like for their relationship to be a bit more defined. Do they have a secret hankering for each other or is the author just teasing us to add another facet to the characters? I have another confession to make - I'm several pages into 'Thursday' and I'm enjoying it, but if Derek calls Lois 'gel' or 'me ducks' one more time, I think I'll pitch the book right out the window the same way someone's pitching the calendar pages out the windows on the covers of the gel's books."},{"Title":"Weeping on Wednesday (Severn House Large Print)","review":"A new series for me and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. Well written, with characters strong and believable. Ms. Purser tells a story, gets you interested in the people, places and events and then wraps it all up very satisfactorily, never leaving you hanging about unsolved events. Have the next installment on order!"},{"Title":"Weeping on Wednesday (Severn House Large Print)","review":"Enjoyable story in the Lois Meade Mystery series. Well written, with believable characters and situations. Although the 'mystery' was not particularly complicated, it was well presented and neatly resolved.* I enjoy Lois and her family, and the interactions. And I enjoy the charm of being immmersed in the culture of English countryside life. (although I could use a glossary from time to time)*(I don't much care for light mystery stories where the author thinks it is necessary to throw in implausible twists or blatant red herrings - or continually put the hero/heroine in peril.)This series is not guilty of that.I look forward to the rest of the week, by Ann Purser."},{"Title":"Weeping on Wednesday (Severn House Large Print)","review":"Spunky, no nonsense Lois Meade delights as before.

It portrays a dainty and quaint life in a charming English village, with a rural touch. You can almost see an English garden and smell freesias.Lois Meade, the main character, is the supervisor of a cleaning service that she started. One of her recently-hired cleaners is a bit mysterious if not eccentric. There is a mystery surrounding this woman's family. We don't know if the woman is involved in something shady or if she is just an innocent bystander. But by the end of book, all questions and curiosities are answered.This English series is one of my favorite cozy series. It is interesting to \\"visit\\" England, have teas, go to pubs, sit in an English garden. Some of the words they use are different than the words we use. But not so many that you can't understand what they are saying - only enough to make it more interesting."},{"Title":"Weeping on Wednesday (Severn House Large Print)","review":"The Lois Meade mystery series is extremely enjoyable!

Wits have likened the Mill to a setting straight from the Hammer horror films, and rumors have always surrounded the Abrahams. But... when Enid Abraham applies for work at New Brooms, Lois Meade decides to give her a try.While Lois is making sure her two new employees meet her exacting standards, Lois's husband begins receiving anonymous letters insinuating that his wife is having an affair with a local policeman. People begin disappearing and strange things begin to happen, and Lois wonders if Carthanger Mill holds the key to a terrible secret.I enjoy this series. Lois is a wild child who grew up, settled down, and now has children who are giving her grief. The Meades are a loving family, and Lois extends that caring behavior to the people who work for her.It's fun to see this series mature. When I read the first book, I saw it painting itself into a corner by having Lois cleaning the houses in just one village. The second book in the series had her broadening her horizons, but it presented another problem: constantly meeting the policeman in the woods to pass along the information she'd gleaned. This third book in the series addresses that. (You simply cannot get away with something like that when you live in a village!) I'm definitely looking forward to book four. Lois is becoming one of my favorite characters."},{"Title":"Weeping on Wednesday (Severn House Large Print)","review":"Ann Purser did it again.

A great read for divers, and anyone interested in the Caribbean."},{"Title":"Deep Into Blue Holes: The Story of the Andros Project","review":"I once had a copy of this book; sadly, no longer. I loaned it to a friend who moved to higher places and well, I never got my book back.Although not a caver or a cave diver myself (I am too scared of tight little dark holes), this book is very appealing for that very fact - the &quot;squeezes&quot; that the divers go through to find the &quot;ultimate&quot; cave makes for terrific reading. So much so that it could (almost) make me take to cave diving. The book has numerous full colour plates showing the terrific underwater scenery of the Blue Holes (of Andros Island in the Bahamas). If you're into diving pictures, they alone are worth the book.Rob Palmer is one of cave diving's greats. He's dived with pretty much the who's who in the world of cave and 'extreme' (depth) divers. While the book tells in detail hopw each dive is conquered, sobering thoughts jump to mind when a story relates how the divers turn a bend in the channel they think they are the first to discover, and find the body of a previous explorer who got lost and couldn't find his way out.....Gripping stuff.

It is much more than that if the readers involve themselves in understanding the technology used in Palmer's efforts to explore deep and stay long. Cutting edge at the time and very expensive, it's now available to all cave divers. As an aside, Palmer, now deceased, is rolling over in his watery grave if he can see the ecological damage done (and still being done) to those beautiful Bahamian inner spaces.

It is a valuable addition to an Mercedes collection."},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Canon Eos 3","review":"If you're familiar with the Magic Lantern Guides (MLG), you already know this book as they all follow a common pattern: the basics of photography intermingled with operational specifics about the camera.Everything in Canon's EOS 3 manual is covered here, but in a more expository manner. Whereas the original manual lists features and how to turn them on and off, MLG tells you more of the how and why. Moreover, photos and diagrams are given to expand on important points.Basic operational functions are covered first while advanced functions are introduced in a graded progression. Thus, you if need to get started fast, read the first few chapters and save the advanced features for a rainy day.The final section of the book is a survey of selected Canon lenses. Again, they cover the basics--lens classifications &amp; uses--while surveying the various models.I have 2 negative points about this book: 1) Some of the images are second-rate stock photos; and 2) the text needs professional editing (wordy &amp; grammatically incorrect at times).Who needs this book? Not an experienced photographer--they should stick with Canon's manual. However, a beginner would benefit from MLG's complete explanations, equipment survey and novice photo tips."},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Canon Eos 3","review":"This book is nothing more than the factory owner's manual with a bit more explination.

The central theme is the ship and it's missions. The charecters of the crew bring this mass of steel to life and give it personality. There are strong charecters amongst the officers as well as the Sailors. Likewise there are officers and Sailors that one would cross the street to avoid. they are all thrust into the confines of theat attack transport Belinda and give the story so much of it's richness. The captain is a driven man and his goal is to make his ship the best attack transport in the Pacific Fleet. HIs drive whittles down the rough edges and shows up the weak leaders and followers. He makes few friends but ultimately gains the respect of many. This book is an excellent leadership text and would aid many, in the military as well as the civilian world, as they work with what they have been given and turn their people into a cohesive whole. This is a masculine book; women appear only in letters. It is a monastic existence as the men serve the Gods of War and now that the bulk of U. S. Naval ships are crewed by men and women, it is a reflection on an era that is rapidly slipping into the realm of memories."},{"Title":"Away all boats,: A novel","review":"Kenneth Dodson poured a lifetime of seagoing experience into Away All Boats. I had the opportunity to get to know this remarkable man before his passing just a few years ago and heard some of the true-to-life experiences aboard U.S.S. Pierce that formed the basis of this book. Away All Boats is a story that will leave you feeling as tired as McDougal and the other men of the fictional U.S.S. Belinda. It's a strong story of teamwork, loyalty and people faced with challenges beyond human endurance. It's also a true picture of what life was like aboard a Navy attack transport. In fact, this book has long been required reading at the Naval Academy for it's accurate picture of amphibious warfare. Like McDougal, the protagonist in Away All Boats, Dodson skippered merchant ships in the 1930s. He got to know Charles Lindbergh while carrying him, Anne Morrow Lindbergh and their aircraft back from an Asian airline route scouting trip. Dodson spent the end of 1941 dodging Japanese forces in the Pacific before voluntarily leaving command of a merchant ship for a lieutenant's berth in the U.S. Navy. If you want a three dimensional look at a seldom covered aspect of WWII Navy operations, Away All Boats is a top pick."},{"Title":"Away all boats,: A novel","review":"I read this book a long time ago and I'm long overdue to read it again. I've spent some time at sea on merchant vessels and research ships. His descriptions of life on board make you feel like you are right there with all the sounds and smells of a working ship. It's one of my favorite alltime books. It's a great movie too. Not just for lovers of sea stories."},{"Title":"Away all boats,: A novel","review":"This was recommended as a leadership lesson and truly is a great example leadership. Military in nature of course but the lessons in coaching the best efforts out a diverse group of people is not lost on the reader. Fabulous story"},{"Title":"Away all boats,: A novel","review":"Not an easy read but worth every minute. Helped save my life. Really it did."},{"Title":"Away all boats,: A novel","review":"Excellent military fiction! I picked up this book (1954 edition) at a public library free offering three years ago and just now starting reading it. Surprisingly well done, and reminiscent a bit of the Seafort saga and The Big 'E'"},{"Title":"Superlearning 2000","review":"Before reading this review I will give you some idea of my background so you can judge my review on the basis of my experience. I am a multilingual language teacher and writer with a keen interest in accelerated learning techniques, and have been such for several years. I first became interested in Superlearning several years ago as a possible method for increaing both my own language learning rate, which is considerable, and that of my students. Superleaning looked like something really new and innovative, and, having read the original Superlearning book, I decided to buy several Superlearning products from their website, including the audio course, special learning cassettes and a language course produced by the authors and based on the exact procedures laid out in their books. I wanted to be sure I was doing it properly. I also wish to point out that the products are not cheap by any means, well, not in price anyway. In terms of quality of the materials, recording and presentatiom, I have never encountered anything so cheap and shoddy!Five years later, and after even more extensive research and experimentation with the system, both personally and in my classes, I can only say that almost all of this system is a sham. It doesn't work. I used a language course produce by them, and found no benefit whatsoever in it. The only benefit I got was to use the course, which I would also like to point out is nothing more than 3 tapes and a very thin and cheaply produced pamphlet of words and phrases and, on occasion the recording did not match the transcript, was to use the tapes without the highly distracting breathing exercises and do it the old-fashioned way. I made my own tapes too, as per the instructiosn in the course, which was a vastly time-consuming process, and had the same lack of result as the \\"professionally\\" produced languages tapes by the authors themselves!There is no doubt that proper relaxation, relaxed breathing, positive suggestions and classical music can have varying degrees of benefit on the students, but the method you will find in ALL the books and programmes produced by Superlearning leaves a great deal to be desired!I was interested by another reviewer's reference to a researcher from Monash univerity and her work into Lozanov and Superlearning. As I don't think a text link is allowed ina review, you might like to do a web search for \\"The personal website of Uschi Felix\\" at Monash University for a lot more information about Superleaning and the validity of some of the claims made before you are tempted to part with your hard earned and get a disappointment.Having tried to contact Superlearning with questions and complaints, I can only attribute the lack of service and, indeed, acknowledgement I encountered to the fact that they must get a lot of commenst from some very dissatisfied people! I urge you not to buy into this scam. You are being taken for a ride.To those reviewers who are getting so excited by the promises in the Superlearning products, all I can say is try it and see. Remember - I was just like you a few years ago!"},{"Title":"Superlearning 2000","review":"First, if 0 stars were an option, that would be the rating. This book has about 4 pages of good information, the rest is just either advertisements for other related systems or stories about how the system has worked around the globe with \\"miraculous\\" results. The first part of the book, I guess is supposed to be dedicated to the theory of the system and the second part is the practical application/explanation portion. But really the whole thing is just a poorly disguised testimonial by the \\"con-artist authors\\" as to how great the system is.I'll save you a little money with a summary.....1. Do a relaxation exercise 2. Put on some 60 bpm classical music 3. read information for 4 secs while breathing in 4. take in no information for 4 secs while breathing out 5. Repeat this cycle over and over until completed.I honestly can't say enough bad things about this book. Even in the \\"application\\" section, where they are supposed to actually teach you how to use the system, all they do is tell you stories about how the system is a worldwide phemomenon. A total waste of paper/trees, sadly I bought it :-("},{"Title":"Superlearning 2000","review":"A lot of sensational ideas contained in this book, not necesarily true. I found this book... almost two years ago... It seemed very exciting to read. . . After reading through the whole thing, I found that it wasn't very helpful except as a reference to other books. Way too many references are given, way too many people mentioned. The last section, part three was maybe the best section. It gives guided visualization and the basic autogenic traing. This can be found on the internet though,(autogenic traing); guided visualization, I noticed, after reading a few other self-help books, are a part of all(or most) self-help books. The reason I give this three stars, and not two is for all the references to books that I would like to buy to read further, and the interesting mind-enhancing machines recommended. This reason is also why I gave it only three and not four, the resources where exhausting, the examples of all the people using these methods became very boring. Story after story after story, but not much on how to or why, except in a later section in the book.If you have this book, and are thinking about buying SuperMemory by the same authors, don't do it! Almost all the information is a copy. They are almost the same book except for a couple of small sections (maybe a couple of pages), about \\"water babies\\" and a very small section at the back (a few pages) refering to a couple of memory tricks, or mnemonics, that can be found anywhere. . . and better ones at that."},{"Title":"Superlearning 2000","review":"I found Superlearning 2000 to provide a wide array of relaxation techniques and advice on classical music. At some points, the authors also discuss using affirmations to prod the unconscious to whatever we seek to achieve. While I found the book to be packed with good advice and well worth the reading, I found two problems: the paperback version is 470+ pages long, and, to paraphrase another reviewer, the authors *really* want to sell you this book and their techniques. Most of the stories they provide are interesting, but at times I felt as if I was stuck in a very long commericial. Some trimming would have helped an already good book."},{"Title":"Superlearning 2000","review":"Actually Mr Schneider is right on the ball! I have researched products by the company &quot;Superlearning&quot; and by Ostrander and Schroeder and I can only say that you are wasting your money on a scam! In the original &quot;Superlearning&quot; book published in 1979, Ostrander and Schroeder make claims that 1000 foreign language words can be learnt in one session by doubtful students with almost full retention of the data. In the very same book, they contadict themselves by talking about how effective learning is connected with a positive attitude. They present their system that doesn't work. Take it from me! In addition, the so-called one day 1000 word experiment was actually conducted over 11 days which, if you read Lozanov's book &quot;Outlines of Suggestopedy and Suggestopedia&quot;. Ostrander and Schroeder got it wrong. Furthermore, in their later work they suggest that the same technique is started with only 30 words and you are told that you should repeat the material as many times as it takes until you know it. The ultimate disclaimer, but a far cry from the outlandish claims made by this pair of frauds! In fact, I worked out that, if you follow all the advice, then you will need to expose yourself to the material at least 27 times in order to learn it!!! Oops! That's a far cry from 1000 words in one session with full retention, isn't it! And believe me, that is a conservative estimate! They claim that you can learn everything at once. Research shows that little by little and building on what you know is the correct way to learn effectively. You can see that can't you? I feel very strongly about fraudulent garbage such as this being put onthe market. It is a shame that in the USA people have the right to write what they want to. The claims made are false: they are just sensation. Look athte mistake in quoting from the Lozanov book. Either they made a stupid mistake, which means that they are unprofessional, or they did it for the sensationalism which helps them sell products, which are all, essentially plugging the same time-wasting technique, and that is also unprofessional. Either way, Ostrander and Schroeder are a pair of shysters. There is no &quot;Super&quot; in &quot;Superlearning&quot; and from my own experience and what I have heard from many others, there is no &quot;-learning&quot; either. Finally, to the people who gave this book good reviews, what were you reviewing exactly? If you were reviewing the book, then you will find it to be well written and interesting - it would have to be to make up for the content - or actually the &quot;Superlearning&quot; technique - some of the advice is good, but it's cribbed from other sources like Colin Rose - but if you actually try the technique, then you'll see! Don't read the book, say&quot;that looks great!&quot;, be misled by all the so-called &quot;testimonials&quot; like Christian Drapeau who &quot;created a great work upon himself&quot; - they've used that same example in all their books and tapes!, review the usefulness of the book. An obvious aphorism, I know, but &quot;Don't judge a book by its cover!&quot; Don't be fooled by sensation. Go on results."},{"Title":"Superlearning 2000","review":"If you like to listen to fluff, then by all means, buy this tape. You don't get any information on how to execute any of this information, or anything else useful. What you do get is something that is akin to hearing about someone else that is doing really well. You hear it, and it's nice, but YOU want to know how to do it yourself. That is where this tape falls woefully short."},{"Title":"Superlearning 2000","review":"Unlike the majority of the books on this kind of subject I have read, this one contains an incredible amount of practical information that is useful. The first third of the book describes what is possible, the potencials, the blocks, the hangups that enhance or deter us when we learn. The second third contains a HOW-TO manual to create your own unique program to suit your needs including learning languages effortlessly, removing emotional hangups, completely getting rid of stress and tension and embracing the continuously changing world. The last third contain exercises for things like stress management and guided visualization.Again, this is the best book of it's kind I have seen out of more than a dozen. I can not suggest it strongly enough."},{"Title":"Superlearning 2000","review":"Don't buy this tape! If you are going to spend your money then buy the book &quot;Superlearning&quot; instead. While I am a great fan of mind expanding techniques I would say that this tape is just &quot;interesting&quot; to listen to. It does not tell you the techniques and I only found a little value from it rather than a lot. I already had a copy of &quot;Superlearning&quot; which, incidentally, I found very good, so I thought that I would just get the audio of this one to listen to in the car to brush up on new wrinkles. I am not saying that there is anything wrong with the superlearning technique, I am just saying don't buy this if you want to learn about it!"},{"Title":"Superlearning 2000","review":"I read this book when it was first published, and was inspired to try the techniques. I have returned to it many times since then for further inspiration. It is really sad to read reviews declaring that Superlearning is a scam; I would suggest that any tool - and Superlearning is surely no more than a tool - is only as good as the person using it. Or perhaps only as good as their expectations - and their intentions. For myself, I have used the techniques to radically change the way young students learn - students who in fact, had been described as having significant \\"learning difficulties.\\" They gleefully proved the pessimism wrong. As a mature university student, I tried the techniques on myself, and achieved very real success - in the 90 percentile for a linguistics paper, for example, on one third of the usual study time.The book needs to be read with an open mind - and the techniques approached with no preconceptions. By all means be analytical - but that means analysing ALL possible reasons for any lack of success; it is so easy to unwittingly introduce variables. My vote is for Superlearning as a significantly empowering technique."},{"Title":"Superlearning 2000","review":"Frankly, there is some good stuff in this. It is a pity that all Ostrander and schroeders stuff is just ripped off from other authors! At the heart of Superlearning is a technique that claims that people can learn 1000 foreign language words in a day with almost 100% recall. Yeah right! In fact, a researcher at Monash university shows how Ostrander and Schroeder's claims are just wild distautions of Georgi Lozanov's book! In 1979 when the original book came out you could sort of forgive the authors for being duped by a so called supertechnique for learning from Communist Europe. But come on girls! You're still plugging the same old stuff. They are releasing more and more tapes and books built around this fraud! How do I know it's a fraud? Try it and see! can S and O &quot;superlearn&quot; 1000 words and remember them? If they can, I'll take this back, but I want to see it firsthand! Also, have you, the readre, ever heard of something called a computer? Of course you have! They have them in almost every school in the States! That is because they work! How many of you have heard of Superlearning? Do you really think that if this really worked then the State Department wouldn't have set it up in every school in the land? Hey! It gets better! In the 1979 original, S and O claim that people could even learn 3000 words in a day! The game's up girls! This is just a money-spinner!"},{"Title":"Superlearning 2000","review":"A must for anyone who wants to learn how to run their brain efficiently."},{"Title":"Superlearning 2000","review":"You might like this book if your obsessed with this topic or your totally new to it. I would have to say that these ideas do work, but little is actually offered for the size of the book. For me this was very basic and boring. If your a successful learner you probably already do or at least know the general ideas here. If your having trouble learning or concentrating this could be of use but there's nothing in particular that would make me recommend it. I'm sure you can find a more exciting learning course, but if not it will work in a pinch."},{"Title":"Superlearning 2000","review":"I give the book 1 stars because it was a review of the previous books written with nothing new to offer. However, with that being said I purchased this book in 1991 \\"Super Memory\\" and followed it to the letter which led me down the path of \\"Brain Mind Research.\\" Moreover, I brought Super Learning and Super Learning 2000, all the tapes and other product's. In addition, I can say after 20 years of researching and trying over and over the techniques given from these books. Nothing has worked to enhance my learning capacity except exercise, 8 hrs sleep, and a proper diet. So, my advise was just given to you, do the following save your money and move on........ One last thing, if you tried to follow the exercises in the book their is no way possible on this earth that you could get through a semester of college doing it the way the book suggests it is way to time consuming. It is unrealistic to believe that you can relate your present school courses to the Super Learning techniques and be ready for an exam. However, with that being said, remember the fact I spent twenty years finding ways to relate this stuff to reality!!"},{"Title":"Superlearning 2000","review":"Interesting and very well researched. But after buying their tapes and trying out the &quot;classical music&quot; technique they promote, I didn't experience the accelerated learning that was promised. (The exaggerated claims of most of these self-help courses do get annoying after a while.)"},{"Title":"Superlearning 2000","review":"I found this book to be interesting, in that it discusses various techniques for increasing mental capacity and memory retention. These sections I found moderately interesting and useful. Especially interesting is the idea that classical music can increase intelligence. This, at least, is a technique you can employ without too much trouble. However, the numerous sections on &quot;positive affirmations&quot; and how to breathe properly were extremely annoying. I skipped the last few chapters because I couldn't stand it any more. I kept thinking of that neurotic, self-affirming sissy character from &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot; If you followed all this book's details for breathing and repeating things to yourself, you could become a truly neurotic and self-absorbed person. Also, the writing style was repetitive and boring. Too much &quot;how-to,&quot; and not enough &quot;why?&quot;"},{"Title":"Superlearning 2000","review":"I must confess right off the bat that I didn't finish reading this book (or listening; I'm reviewing the audio version). After 20 minutes of the author telling me how great Accelerated Learning is, why it's better than traditional learning methods, and droning off a seemingly endless list of &quot;sucess stories&quot; about people who have used the method, I found myself thinking, &quot;are you ever going to get to the point, and tell me the actual method, or is this entire book nothing but a sales pitch?&quot;Maybe they should re-title the book: &quot;Why Superlearning is the greatest thing since sliced bread&quot;, with a sub-title &quot;We're not going to actually tell you anything about our method, just convince you why you should be excited about it&quot;.Perhaps readers with more patience than I will be richly rewarded by sticking it out, assuming the authors ever do get to the point.

Strongly recommend it.Received product in excellent condition."},{"Title":"Superlearning 2000","review":"This is an excellent work-much in the character of the earlierversion. It emphasizes proven techniques to enhance learningand the environment for learning. A strength of this volume isthat the techniques can be utilized in daily life to introducethe conditions most conducive to a meaningful learning experience. American education teaches reading, writing, math,computer schools and the liberal arts. Most schools do not teachlearning utilizing any step-by-step or disciplined approach.The Ostrander work teaches us how people learn and providesmodel exercises to nurture life-long learning skills. Forthis reason alone, the acquisition is well worth the price paid.This book answers the question \\"Why doesn't my kid learn?\\".For instance,the author introduces the reader to breathing exercises to oxygenate the body so that the mind is relaxed and prepared for concentration. Classical music is introduced as a motivator in facilitating the process of learning and setting theconditions wherein it can occur optimally. The book is well worththe price if the reader actually PRACTICES some of thesetechniques in order to master them. Nothing less than a seriouseffort at following these techniques will be required in orderto appreciate this text. Dr. Lozanov was a pioneer in perfectingtechniques to facilitate healing through relaxation techniquesaimed at obtaining optimal functioning of the mind. I havemodified some of these learning techniques during intensivestudy sessions and they are useful incrementally. Nothing takesthe place of intense motivation aimed at accomplishing importantgoals. These relaxation techniques can facilitate the conditions so that learning can occur; however, the individual needs themotivation to learn. This motivation is accomplished frequentlyby setting goals and visualizing attainment as a condition precedent to performing the work necessary to accomplishelusive goals. Again, this work is valuable incrementallyas a motivator. It is incumbent upon the individual to applythese techniques to translate motivation into action . Goal congruency is critical as a condition precedent to goal attainment. If an individual does not believe in the necessity to attain the goal, then all of the motivating forces will be to little or no avail.This text is useful for readers who keep an open mind .It is necessary to read these techniques dispassionately andhonestly attempt implementation before assessing whether or not this work will be helpful to you.The techniques have validity; however, the reader must struggle through the considerable processes outlined in the text in order to achieve the maximum benefit.This work could be helpful if you have a child with learningissues and you've tried everything to no avail. The techniquesoutlined may be helpful in structuring a learning experienceto compensate for motivational problems, attention-span problemsand a whole host of issues related to early childhood intervention . To be maximally beneficial, you must make anhonest attempt at implementing the techniques outlined in thisbook before making any pre-judgments.People pay professionals thousands of dollars to intervene incomplicated cases involving learning difficulties and motivation.This text provides very valuable advice at little cost. As such,it is well worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"Superlearning 2000","review":"it's just full of commercial and telephones, I don't know about the tape, but this book is RUBBISH!!"},{"Title":"Superlearning 2000","review":"I'm a student and this book has helped me immeasurably.

She is a gifted writer and her story is compelling. As a man, I had no idea that what Ms. Morris-Grant went through would be considered abusive behavior. My eyes have been opened and I am ashamed. Buy this book! It will open your eyes. I await her next book!"},{"Title":"Whom Shall I Fear: A Spiritual Journey of a Battered Woman","review":"This book is written with such clarity, love and hope. After surviving being shot in the head by her husband, Ms. Morris-Grant uses her total recall of the events leading up to and following that event to give readers a clear understanding of the confusing/contradictory emotions and circumstances that make domestic violence so dangerous and difficult to escape. A must read for anyone who is supporting someone as they deal with an abusive relationship."},{"Title":"Whom Shall I Fear: A Spiritual Journey of a Battered Woman","review":"I am pleased to recommend &quot;whom Shall I fear&quot; to any and all readers. Ms. Morris-Grant reveals all sides of the story in dissecting her life from her childhood up through the present day in relation to her own self-image and her relationship with herself, God, and, most compellingly, her husband.She is typical of many women who are abused verbally but who don't know what to do and are actually in denial about the existence of a real problem. Her husband is portrayed as endearing. I found that I, too was as surprised as the author when unappealing aspects of his character pop up. Ms. Morris-Grant strikes a balance. There is no glorification of herself and her actions. She is brave, she is strong, but one never feels that she finds herself to be infallible. Indeed, the flawed and honest portrayal of a wife and mother breaking away painfully, trying to identify the issues that plague her life, and to cope with them is done expertly. You feel as if you know a man who one could portray easily as a monster, as a man who has the chance to follow several roads, but who follows a tragic one. You feel as if you know the author extremely intimately, and she is also a regular woman who has several paths to choose from. She, however, chooses a path filled with light and makes the best out of what could be a devastating turn of events.For anyone who thought that batterers (or worse) have horns on their head or have 'DANGER' clearly written on them, and who don't understand what goes on inside the life of a victim, here's a great book. to anyone, like myself, who has witnessed abuse of this nature, I say the same.

An excellent read."},{"Title":"Jimi Hendrix: The Ultimate Experience","review":"This book opens the wounds of Jimi's death anew. The author pieces together, as best he can, with recollections from family, band mates, and contemporaries the crushing price fame held for Jimi Hendrix.

True, he had his own demons, but there seemed noone who was really there to care about the &quot;person&quot; Jimi, only what they could get out of him.

The best reason to read this book is the diversity of perspectives that it gives you on Hendrix. You hear from people who loved him, who just randomly bumped into him, and even a couple who could have done without him. There's no author's bias that you have to tease out on your own. There are an assortment of takes on Hendrix. You can judge for yourself what is valid and what isn't, based on whether it is corroborated by other accounts of the same event. A truly fascinating way to look at the life of a legend."},{"Title":"Jimi Hendrix: The Ultimate Experience","review":"Jimi Hendrix was undoubtedly one of the most distinguished and most talented guitarists ever to walk the planet. His life started out in the gutter: no mother, a father overseas, and nothing to rely on but himself. Soon however, he found his true calling, the guitar. One of his father's friends had an old Stratocaster and one night while he was drunk, he sold it to Jimi for hardly anything. From this point on, his life changed drastically; he took his guitar with him everywhere he went, even going as far as sleeping with it. His guitar took him all over the country, to England and back, and then back to London. On his last visit to London, he passed away.

This is the single best book I've read (among scores!) in the 15 years I've been presenting a voice workshop showing people how to play around with their sound, syntax, expressiveness, and verbal fluency. Great stories... John Barrymore rhapsodizing over an apple for weeks to developing expressiveness... students cracking through wooden deliveries to discover dreams and dragons heretofore strangulated by polite reserve... elocution teachers gone near mad with preciseness... professional drama training and the ongoing arguments over verbal clarity and the mumblers of the 'keep it real' school.

Even though there is no explicit language, there was a subtle sexual undertone throughout the work that was frightening. It is one of those books that people love to hate and hate to love because it hits so close to home for people in so many walks of life. I think the reason it can touch so many people is because it makes people wonder about how well their friends would think they are doing rather than how well they themselves think they are doing. \\"What would I look like if the mirror were to show my 'inner' self rather than my 'outer' self?\\" is the pervasive question here."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I enjoyed reading this book I chose it because of the Author. I had not read anything by Oscar Wilde until this book and it is a good read.The Picture of Dorian Gray"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I really loved this book from the beginning to the end. I'm a fan of Oscar Wilde, and I could'ntmiss this great classical novel. The book is dominated by two amazing and strong personalities :Dorian Gray,a character full of life, and his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton.The story is deliciously dark and unusual, and as far as I know this is the only novel Wilde hadever written. It provides an interesting look on the society of the time through this multi-layeredstory, and Dorian Gray is a perfect representation of the human species. The novel depicts anundeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, and allows thereader to understand better why it upset the British society that was emerging from the socialconstraints of Victorianism. I appreciated the beauty of his writing style, always elegant, witha flow that looks like poetry all along the book. The conversations exchanged are also witty andpoignant.Maybe some people could find the flow of the story quite slow, or with too many descriptions,which may not give enough room for imagination. Also the text was a little small, but remainedvery readable.Anyway, I highly recommend this book. It is a great way to start discovering Oscar Wilde's workthrough this book full of mystery, which still asks today this valid question: \\"What are peoplewilling to sell to get eternal beauty?\\""},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It arrived very quickly.

You're supposed to read it because it's a classic (no need for quotes around classic). On the other hand, it's pretty much about giving in to one's lesser wants and needs. We've all probably seen Dorian at one time or another. If we're lucky, we see him before the fall. There is something about a beautiful youth who has yet to fell the fingers of corruption. Many have seen him during the process of corruption (gosh...we may have even participated in said corruption). We've probably even seen him near the end of the process. Oscar Wilde's novel is brilliant. It covers the process of corruption very well. The ending is cliche, but it wasn't (probably) at the time.And, since I'm writing this for the e-book (uncensored), the model on the cover of the book is, ummmmm..., worth considering being corrupted by or corrupting."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This free classic version for my Kindle was very good!

Couldn't be happier with the purchase."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I've developed a general rule to avoid free Kindle editions of virtually anything, and it paid off handsomely when I picked this edition. There were two Penguin Kindle editions. This one for $.99 and another for free. As with other free Kindle editions labelled \\"Penguin\\", the edition was not Penguin, it was a \\"Pocket Book\\" edition. This one, for a buck, is true blue Penguin.To further validate my point, this edition has many addins which are often missing from a cheap Kindle edition. First, it has a history of the book's writing and publication, an outline of Wilde's life, an excellent bibliography covering both 19th and 20th century works, two appendices on 19th century reviews of the book and on the provinance of this edition. It also has notes on the chapters which explain things understood by a late 19th century Londoner, but which have been lost to us. An example is the term \\"Japanese effect\\" referring to a style adopted by some late 19th century painters, mimicing some aspects of Japanese art. A leading example was the great portrait artist, James MacNeill Whistler.In a word, it is a complete, genuine Penguin edition, cheap."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was reading the graphic novel: Jaka's Story (Cerebus, volume 5) by Dave Sim and Gerhard (which I strongly recommend anyone to read, together with the sequence: Cerebus, volume 6, Melmoth) when I met the fictional character &quot;Oscar&quot;.In that story, &quot;Oscar&quot; discussed with Jaka's husband, Rick, about a poisonous book (&quot;The Picture of Alfred Douglas&quot;), written by a certain Lord Henry Wotton! Any resemblance with the reality? :) &quot;Oscar&quot; told that he asked to Lord Henry how did he explain his success after saying that &quot;to be popular one must be mediocre&quot;? Lord Henry answered him that &quot;in this matter as in many others, he was the exception that proved the rule&quot;.Reading these passages, I was charmed with the Oscar Wilde character and decided to read the true &quot;The Portrait of Dorian Gray&quot; written by the true Oscar Wilde.I think the passages in Cerebus clarified to me what this book was about (modern graphic novels have the power to illuminate one's thoughts). One should not read this book looking for coherence. All the characters are incoherent, and this is one of the genial points in this book. People are not coherent, so fictional character must not be coherent either!In the preface the author, himself, says that art is quite useless, though it is the thing he loves most to do! The artist Basil says initially that a picture, done with heart, belongs to the artist. Later, he gives the picture to Dorian Gray. Henry Wotton throws along all the story a series of poisonous thoughts that he doesn't follow!Other genial point is that Dorian, although being evil (and could be considered a villain in his own story) is not punished for what he does!Sybil Vane commits suicide because of him, but nobody was able to connect her death with him. Later, he kills Basil, but he just disappears with the body, with no consequences. Near the end, when we think that he is going to be killed by Sybil Vane's brother, he escapes easily from him. Only when, by caprice, he makes the foolishness of trying to destroy his portrait, is that he finds death. That is, he dies merely by accident, not because of his vicious or crimes.If, instead, he just tried to cut the picture he would learn that it would have the effect of hurting himself physically. Then he would guard the picture, and proceed living his life of eternal youth and beauty (that is, until some day some insects, or rats, or something, decided to eat his canvas... :) )These are for me the mistakes of many writers, and what turns the end of many stories so boring and so unsatisfactory! The first one is that they want to produce a plot and tie all the characters of the story (as though it was necessary, and as though all characters deseverd to be well developed!!). The second is to try to create characters that evolve learning with their mistakes (as if everybody learned with their mistakes and stopped continuing doing them for all their lives!!!).Borrowing the words of Lisa Simpson (in one of those funny, crazy, genial, Simpsons' stories), the moral of Dorian Grays story is that it has no moral!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"All art is quite useless. Or so believed Oscar Wilde, perhaps the foremost member of the Aestheticism movement of the late nineteenth century. Wilde and his followers believed in art for art's sake: he thought his works needed no meaning beyond beauty. The Picture of Dorian Gray achieves some level of philosophical meaning nevertheless, but whether the book is worthy of the label 'genius' is questionable.This novel tells the story of Dorian Gray, a vain young man with a powerful personality. At the beginning of the novel Dorian has a portrait painted by the artist Basil Hallward, and Basil decides never to publish the painting because he put too much of himself into it. Dorian keeps the painting, wishing that its image would grow old while he himself stayed young. Eventually his wish comes true, and his increasingly Epicurean lifestyle causes the painting to rapidly age and grow uglier while Dorian himself stays young and beautiful.Despite its authors claims about art, the novel provides considerable insight into human behavior and the depths of apathy and vanity a man can reach. It is at times horrifying, but at others the writing itself can seem vain. Wilde often seems more concerned with flattering himself through his writing than with producing anything valuable which, of course, is consistent with his aesthetic philosophy, but that hardly benefits the reader, and I at least disagree with Wilde and believe that a work of art with no real value should not be considered art. Strewn throughout the novel are quotable passages which give the impression of intellectual depth but at closer inspection seem to contain little more than vanity: \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\" \\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"I did enjoy the novel overall and found it insightful, but I think Wilde's writing is generally too selfish, which is a natural result of his philosophy: the core issue is that I disagree with his philosophy and am therefore bound to find at least some fault with the art it produces."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is quite a book. Mr. Wilde has quite a literary ability. His characters are as vibrant as a Van Gogh, his plot is tense, and he has quite a gift for quips and comebacks. All of this combines for a great piece of literature, regardless of the topic or story.This book explores the darker side of humanity, along the lines of Faust, Dr. Jekyll, and Lord of the Flies. We all feel this dread and anxiety deep within our soul; Wilde does not hold a mirror, but a picture for us to look upon and marvel. You get the chills up and own your spine as you watch Lord Henry seduce Dorian Grey.I think the high point of the story was in Chapter XI when Dorian sets a mirror next to the foul picture and goes back and forth looking at his baby-face and then the incubus in the painting. What is crucial is that Dorian is so detached: he sees himself as the smooth-faced god, but in reality, he is the demon in the picture. But his detachment is what is so crucial. He knows what his soul looks like, but he doesn't care!At times this books seems like a play, which has Wilde's native element. But the prose has such a smooth flow that you do not notice. I found myself constantly underlining Wilde's aphorism. He has a gift for one-liners, and his book is quite a charming read."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book is very interesting, although it starts out slow.

It may be fiction, but truth lies within the pages of this book. Oscar Wilde has painted a truly perfect representation of the human species with his character Dorian Gray. A character so full of life that you can't help but be drawn into the book. I was unable to put it down after reading the first page!When you open this book, you are not just reading a story, you are looking into a mirror. You see yourself in Dorian Gray's position as he goes through his trials and tribulations. Regardless of who you are, everyone feels and, at some point, thinks along the line's of Dorian Gray. For some, they may have even traveled down a similar path. It is for this reason that Oscar Wilde was able to create such a realistic character. He created something that people can relate to because each of us has a Dorian Gray within us, at least, to some degree.I don't know if Wilde meant to be so philosophical or psychological with this story, but it is a work of genius. I believe that this book should be part of the required reading material in some age appropriate schools. I doubt that it will, but I feel the character of Dorian Gray and his 'life' would be an eye opener for many.I highly recommend this book to anyone even vaguely curious about it. I honestly cannot understand why this has a single bad rating! If your still not sure after reading the reviews, check with your local library about borrowing it. If you like it, then buy it and save it to read for later. I've re-read mine several times now and have yet to grow bored or tired of it."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray is absurdly good-looking. Utterly infatuated, Basil Hallward captures Dorian's youthful beauty in a portrait.While posing for this portrait, Dorian meets Basil's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, who charmingly preaches hedonism. Lord Henry's efforts to corrupt Dorian work quickly. Convinced that youth and beauty are the only things worth having in life, Dorian looks upon his finished portrait with cruel jealousy. His image will never grow old, but he will.One wish sends the plot of the novel into action: Dorian wishes the portrait would age, while he stays youthful.Enter a lover whose heart Dorian breaks. Her despair coerces her to suicide. With her death on his conscience, he notices an evil glint in the eye of his portrait. Over the years, Basil's painting begins to age. Dorian sabotages reputations and even commits murder, all the while looking as young and beautiful as he did on the day his portrait was painted. However, the portrait-a grotesque reminder of his double life-documents every immoral act.Focusing on duplicity and aestheticism, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a captivating and cinematic tale. Oscar Wilde's knack for dialogue is what made him a famous playwright and parts of Dorian Gray are rich with clever play-like exchanges.Lord Henry's wit is exceptionally tantalizing. But he doesn't seem to take himself too seriously, whereas Dorian adopts everything Lord Henry preaches with the conviction of a Southern Baptist. He's basically just a dumb pretty person that everyone coddles despite the fact that he's a terrible human being.**Side note**The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's only novel. The book was scandalous when it was released in 1891 because of clear homoerotic undertones. Dorian's lovers are both men and women. Though not overtly sexual, Basil's infatuation with Dorian is questionable. Wilde himself had an affair with Robert Ross."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read quite a lot and I have not been so entranced by a book in a very long time.

Based on this merit alone it is worth reading. If you're a connoisseur of literature it's mandatory, and if you're not, it's highly recommendable.It tells of the life of Dorian Gray, who, upon meeting Basil Hallward (his painter's) friend Sir Henry Wotton, begins to fret over the ephemerality of his youth, and makes an involuntary wish for...Well I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so I'll leave that out. Chances are, going in, you know the premise of the novel, but I still don't want to risk a spoiler. Either way, slowly, he starts to lose himself, and the gentleness of his nature, and he is driven to \\"sin\\".It's a good read in many ways. For one it is an easy read, it can be enjoyed whether you are sitting at home or travelling. In another it is thought provoking, you could pull about two hundred quotes out of it and apply them to your daily life (and I'm not exaggerating). And lastly, the story line is gripping.If you're approaching this after experiencing Wilde's plays then I should warn you, there is no comedy here, in fact there is barely even a resemblance to the tone of his plays (although some of the dialogue is fairly similar).Either way, this is a damn good read and I certainly recommend it.If you're interested in gothic literature, this is highly, highly recommended, as are the above titles."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The story is pretty standard.

The characters except Dorian all come off as rather shallow, but I suppose that is the point of the story."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"definitely an interesting book. a classic. would read if you are into classics. quite violent and shocking. i should have seen it coming, but it was still good"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This haunting tale is fraught with discussion points ranging from the \\"curse\\" of beauty to the state of our souls to the consequences of our decisions and actions.

Some classics are just kind of boring, but this one was quite a surprise! I really enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is one of the most elegant novels in the Gothic canon; that it is also one of the most sinister is hardly surprising given Oscar Wilde's curious aptitude for tempering the macabre with the sensuous and the frivolous with the fatalistic.A considerable scandal upon its publication in the early 1890s, the novel still reads as slightly homoerotic, even if only in the most clandestine and aphotic of ways. Woven through its themes of beauty, decadence, age, and the nature of art is a thread of shimmering doom that becomes more poignant the longer one spends with DORIAN GRAY and the more one considers its relationship with its author.It is a peacock's fan of luminous wit and glimmering color, dripping with venom and smelling of strange perfumes. We are all familiar with the general flavor of things: an innocent and exceptionally beautiful youth has his portrait painted one fateful afternoon; upon viewing the piece, he is paralyzed by the sudden revelation that one day he will be old and hideous while the painting will retain its beauty and life. In a devil's bargain, he wishes that it would be the other way around. And then, under the influence of a particularly deleterious gentleman, Dorian Gray begins to change: his innocence gives way to corruption and his beauty seems apt to languish under the spell of opium, cruelty, and languor. One day Dorian notices that the painting has begun to transform, while he himself retains all the beauty of an innocent despite the ever-swelling ocean of his sins...Few works of literature are as effervescent as DORIAN GRAY and just as few are as utterly pessimistic; that it is capable of fusing remarkably disparate parts into a whole that is absolutely cohesive is a fascinating example of its author's gifts. Like Wilde's SALOME, DORIAN GRAY is as colorful as it is bleak, and even its weaknesses, in context, seem like strengths.Seldom is an artist's most famous work also his most erudite and brilliant: this is one of those works. I have approached it perhaps six or seven times in the last five years, and each reading has left me more enraptured than the last--which is high praise for a novel that relies a great deal on suspense and aesthetic splendour. I consider it one of the finest things I have ever read--daring, sultry, venomous, eloquent, and radiant in its own decay.(From my Gothic fiction blog:[...]"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"My impetus for reading this book, since I read few novels, was a book entitled \\"The Ripper Code\\" by Thomas Toughill. That book's author posed the theory that in writing \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Oscar Wilde was attempting to point the finger of guilt at one of his erstwhile friends, and possible homosexual lovers, as London's \\"Jack the Ripper.\\" This intrigued me, particularly since Wilde's book was published only a year or so after the last of the Ripper murders, and, as Toughill noted, Wilde and his suspect lived only about six miles from the Whitechapel district, where the murders took place, and Wilde clearly chose the date of the last Ripper murder, November 9, 1889, as the date which brought his story to its climax. So, in reading this book, I couldn't help but bear that in mind.After reading this book, it is clear that Wilde based some, if not all, of the main characters in his novel on persons whom he knew and, in all likelihood, on actual conversations he had had with those and other prominent people in London society. And there are certainly clear similarities between at least two of the most prominent characters in his novel and Wilde's friends: namely Dorian Gray, himself, and Wilde's presumed suspect, George Francis \\"Frank\\" Miles, an artist who contracted syphilis and died in 1891 shortly after the final Ripper murder; and Dorian's first love and suicide victim, the young actress Sybyl Vane, and the actress, Lilly Langtree, who Miles and Wilde both knew in her early days and whose career they clearly advanced. Other than that, however, there is little to suggest that Wilde was attempting to point the finger of guilt at Miles or at anyone else.As for the novel itself, I found it to be extremely interesting and hard to put down. I was particularly impressed by the author's apparent insight into human nature, as reflected in some of the ideas expounded on many occasions by Dorian Gray's friend and mentor, Lord Henry Wotton. Some of those passages were rather long, and perhaps a little tedious, but still interesting if one persisted. I consider this to be a classic which most readers would enjoy, but, in my view, Wilde simply drew on his experiences and chose certain events and characters to help sell his book. Frank Miles can rest in peace --- at least for now."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have seen the old movie several times, and it tempted me to order the book. Oscar Wilde was a \\"wild child\\", and he gives a glimpse into the often vain and decadant world of English society through the wanton excesses of Dorian...who appears to remain beautiful, youthful, and untouched by evil. It is Dorian's portrait that decays with every misdeed, including murder. The picture haunts Dorian as he travels among the rich, and also into the opium dens and low life of the waterfront. This edition contains a glossary of lesser known terms and references, for us modern folk. It was a quick and fascinating read."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I knew relatively little going into this book...and what little I did know was from less than 100% accurate retellings such as in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or references from cheesy shows or horror flicks (I think perhaps there was a reference in Scooby Doo somewhere?). I had the basic gist...there's a guy, Dorian Gray, who has some magical painting that ages while he stays young and wonderful forever. Not much to go on, but I was still excited to read it. I was pleasantly surprised that the book had much more depth to it.&lt;u>Plot&lt;/u>The plot is intriguing and has been used in other stories, though I think this one has more depth than I've seen before. Essentially, Dorian makes a wish that he will be forever as pristine as the painting made of him and that instead the painting will take on it the toils of his life. Whatever supernatural forces allow this to happen are irrelevant...the wish is granted.It's more than a simple \\"young forever\\" contract. Although age plays into the plot in a couple of places, the primary things that distorts the picture are the vices that Dorian engages in. The first transformation of the painting happens after an intense argument with the first woman he loved. It was interesting to me how quickly Dorian recognized the cause of the change for what it was, but had he belabored the motive for too long, the pacing of the book would have stalled and become unacceptable.Dorian uses his \\"power\\" to be ruthlessly reckless in his living. Dorian Gray becomes entirely uninhibited, taking everything to its limit, seeking absolute pleasure. He even sneaks out at night (so as not to tarnish his pristine reputation) to the \\"bad side of town\\" and lives a sort of double life in opium dens with gangs and prostitutes.In many ways (perhaps because I so recently read it), I felt many similarities to the morale commentary presented in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I felt that Wilde did a better job of delving into the psyche of the hypocritical character, largely because we were able to get into Dorian's head and think and feel with him, while in Jekyll/Hyde, we were kept at a distance by a third person narrative.&lt;u>Characters&lt;/u>There are three pivotal characters in this book.The first, obviously, is Dorian himself. For the first many chapters (perhaps nearly the first half of the book in fact), I wasn't terribly pleased with Dorian as a character...he felt very flat to me. He was basically a mirror to one of the other primary characters (Harry) and didn't ever show his own opinion. He was hailed as pure and beautiful. Perhaps it's all the art references in the book, but I often felt as if Dorian existed more as a classical statue than as a living, breathing character. As his interaction with the 'picture' progresses and once he takes some rather unexpected steps, he became a deeper character and a lot of fun to be with.The second primary character is Lord Harry (or was it Henry...blast those Brits for swapping those names interchangeably so often *grin*). Harry exists as the provocative, cynical, always-with-a-comment-about-anything mentor to Dorian. Harry is absolutely encouragable and a lot of fun to listen to. His speeches often have to do with the pursuit of pleasure at any and all costs and the hazard of a virtuous and peaceful life. His influence over Dorian is profound. As I mentioned above, it often felt as if Dorian existed merely as a mirror for Harry's advice. Harry didn't seem to follow all of his own advice, but Dorian took it readily to heart and strove to live a 'come-what-may' existence. Harry had some of the funniest and most profound comments of the entire narrative. He's a fabulous character.The third character I want to point out actually existed as more of a background character, but I feel the need to call him out merely because of his pivotal involvement in the plot. I actually can't even remember his name now...but it will suffice to call him, \\"the artist.\\" He's the one who paints Dorian's picture. He's the one who introduces Dorian to Harry. He's the one who tries to give Dorian good advice to counter all the reckless advice that Harry poisons him with. The artist was kind of like Dorian's \\"Jiminey Cricket\\"...his conscious that was often (always?) ignored until it was far too late. He showed up in surprisingly few scenes considering the huge importance he had to the plot.&lt;u>Style, Pacing, etc&lt;/u>The language used in this book was truly beautiful. Wilde wrote flowing, vivid descriptions of characters, places and actions. At times it was very poetic. It may be a bit too flowery for readers who don't enjoy that sort of description...it came very close to being 'over the top' to me in a few places. Still, I generally enjoyed the formality of it and the life it gave to the text. The first dozen or two pages were tedious to me...whether because of the language or just the style and thematic pacing, I'm not sure.The pacing was a bit slower than I would have liked. The main difficulty I saw was that Wilde was trying to present so many themes that he often had to result to lengthy passages praising or condemning one thing or another. There were often very long monologues by one of the three primary characters mentioned above. Harry's were generally offset by bits that made me laugh by their extremity while speeches from Dorian and the artist sometimes made me want to slap them and tell them to shut up.&lt;u>Overall&lt;/u>I was a little torn on my overall feeling for the book. It took me a while to get into it and there were long passages that were drudgerous to push through. However, from a high level, this is one of the better books I've read this year...or even for numerous years. It had a plenitude of intriguing themes that left me thinking in between readings. It had a lot of humorous quips and paradigms as presented by Harry that I laughed out loud at. It had surprising twists and tension that left me curious as to the true outcome (as opposed to that from rip-off stories). There are a couple of spots that could be considered \\"climax\\"...the confrontation with the artist is the main turning point in the book. Personally, I would have rather seen more pages after that turning point than before it. I think the last 1/3 of the book was far more engaging. At the same time, the buildup was necessary to promote the intended mood.Overall, this is a book I definitely recommend, with the caveat that you should be aware that it does slow down at points. Just push through those. The overall work is worthy of a couple of slow zones. In fact, perhaps those slow zones serve the purpose of allowing more pondering.****4.5 stars"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This was a rather difficult book to get through. Lots of old English and lots of footnotes describing what the words or phrases meant. I struggled through about 3/4 of the book, but then it picked up and I managed to get it read. In the end, it was worth the time and effort but does take some patience to get through. Not for everyone."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It makes one think what would happen if one were to remain young/immortal. Part of our lives revolve around aging, preparing for that, and what have you, while Dorian doesn't have to. It's really interesting to see how his inside goes on decline while his outer self remains young. It's overall a good read, and I'd recommend this to anyone who is in need of a good, classic read."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book was difficult to read at first. I accept that the great ones always take a while to hook you as they build the characters. It has been a while since I read this book and yet much of it is fresh in my mind. Not a beach read. It's too deep. A story like no other I have ever read."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"While this is Oscar Wilde's only foray into novel-writing, I must say it is justifiably called a classic. The use of descriptive language and mood is exquisite.The only downsides that I can mention would be how slowly it moves in some spots. Once in a while, the story takes sort of a vacation, and you are given a lot of details that don't really apply to the overall plot. Some of the things that are discussed are good at shedding light on some of the things that Mr. Gray was doing throughout the years that this book took place, but they can get a little boring. Truth be told, I skipped most of one chapter because it went on, and on, and on about the things that piqued Dorian Gray's interest. It doesn't stop there, but it explains why it did, what he did about it, and some other people that he associated with while he was pursuing a certain subject, like gemology. In this edition, many of the names that are given through these pages are given an endnote in the back, but to the average person these don't hold much interest. Even to some hardcore fans of classic literature and Gothic Horror could find certain chapters (one at least) very tedious.That being said, there is certainly more good in this book than needed to balance out the less interesting parts. In the beginning, we get to see where the corruption of young Mr. Gray comes from. As the book progresses, you can see the corruption finally consume him, culminating in a surprising finale. I read at work, and my jaw dropped more than once, which I only realized after a co-worker brought attention to it. Even though most people have heard of the themes in the book, this is a fine example of taking an existing theme, and making it into a brilliant new idea.The ideas contained in this book can be a little disturbing to some with a weak stomach. Some of the language can be a little stiff and hard to read, but remember it was written in the 1890's.This book is highly recommended for anybody who has an interest in the Classics or Gothic Horror. Not for the faint of heart, but if it's ever crossed your mind to read The Picture of Dorian Gray, pick this book up! If you want to start reading Gothic Horror, I would suggest something a little lighter to start with -- Edgar Allan Poe, The Phantom of the Opera, or something like that. Those are a little easier, and give you a good idea of what the genre is all about.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\`So, Henry, how is that young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of yours progressing, hem?Lord Henry paused to saviour his glass. Pleased, he set it down, just so, beside his dinner plate, and turned to Lord Fermor.\`Pundits say troubles come in threes, Uncle,' replied Lord Henry. \`What the pundits omit in their gabardine rush to spread their misery to others in a foolish attempt to alleviate their own, is that the best in life never travels solo. Take, for example, the wine and dinner before us. Both French. Together they constitute a meal to entice the gods down from the Mount. When did you ever come across a bad French meal, or a good French man? Yet when wine and food march together, they repay the Creator.'\`No doubt,' replied Lord Fermor, \`but you evade the issue. I asked about the young chap you have taken into your entourage, you know.' Lord Fermor struggled to recall the name, \`that chap who poses for Mr Hallward here.'Basil Hallward felt the heat of recognition first on his brow, then running through his whole body. A retiring man, more at home with his easels and sitters than at high table, he shrank from the public glare.Recognising the signs, though failing to sympathise with them, Lady Agatha piped up.\`Mr Hallword has many sitters, do you not, Sir.'\`Er, yes, indeed I do,' replied Mr Hallward, grateful for the prompt. \`For example, just today I encountered a young man of exquisite appearance, youth in all its pomp. He has promised to sit for me. Lord Henry, I fancy, will try to take him away and teach him of the world, thereby spoiling him as a object d'art.' He laughed to denote humour, simultaneously glancing at his friend to convey the serious meaning behind his joke. Keep away Lord Henry, the glanced announced, shielded behind the laughter. Keep away from this young man lest you send him on the eternal search for fulfilment and in so doing corrupt his soul.Lord Henry roared.\\"Why Basil, you surpass yourself! Hiding a serious message behind a joke so that you may deliver it in public. Would that the Good Book decked itself in such garlands, the better to frighten the masses. You are a greater artist than your canvasses know.'\`I fear my husband is avoiding your question, Lord Fermor,' laughed Lady Victoria. \`When it comes to hiding a serious message behind the veil of farce, he may rival Dante himself.'\`What is the name of your young beauty?' Inquired Lord Henry amidst the general humour. \`I only ask,' he pressed, \`so that I may avoid him. Let us hope I have more success than Eve, who expressed no desire to harvest the only tree in the garden that contained a serpent, until admonished not to. Of course,' Lord Henry continued, \`our Creator did not warn off the firstborn with laughter on his lips. Had he done so, perhaps we would be consuming ambrosia still. Mind you,' he reflected, \`this French cuisine is an adequate substitute.'\`Yes yes yes Henry,' broke in Lord Fermor, \`but what about your young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e? Has he a fine future, seeking the dark mysteries of life of which you profess to be so fond?'\`Should he avoid hubris, I see for him a long, comfortable and satisfactory life.'\`And should he fail to avoid hubris?' teased Lady Agatha.\`Then I see for him immortality in print and prose. Hubris is man's affirmation of his living soul, his insistence that all must be as he ordains, and his rage that it is not. Should Basil paint hubris he would reveal Caliban.\`Modesty, on the other hand, is pleasing to the casual senses but fleeting, like snow on the chimneystack. Modesty and prose combine to produce the barely adequate. Hubris and prose combine to produce immortality, but not personal happiness.'\`And this choice, modesty of hubris, is one you see before Dorian Gray?' queried Mr Hallword.\`Dorian who?' Lord Henry responded. He reached again for the reassuring certainty in his wine glass. \`I was referring to my Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, Oscar Wilde.'"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is definitely a disturbing book. I think there is great worth in reading it, particularly when paired with a book such as Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe or Les Miserables by Victor Hugo. Contrasting Dorian's sordid downfall with with the heroic ascension of Uncle Tom or Jean Valjean is particularly beneficial.The Picture of Dorian Gray begins with Dorian, a young and handsome gentleman who is involved with philanthropy, sitting for a portrait while his new friend, Lord Henry, a sarcastic and hedonistic man of society, watches on. Dorian is described as being \\"unspotted from the world\\" and his beauty inspires the artist to his very best work. Lord Henry exclaims how lovely the portrait has turned out, but laments that it is too bad that the picture will stay young forever, whereas Dorian will eventually age and lose his youth and beauty. A vexed Dorian makes a wish that he will stay timeless and the picture will age instead of him.Taking Lord Henry as a mentor, Dorian sets out to apply Lord Henry's selfish and narcissistic worldview into nearly every facet of his life. In time, Dorian realizes that his wish has magically come true. He remains beautiful, while his painting takes on all the consequences of his wicked actions. As the debased Dorian sins more and more, the picture becomes more hideous and tortures Dorian's soul.Despite being filled with Wilde's signature wit, this is a haunting story showing the consequence of selfish character and the downfall of the soul due to despicable and hideous behaviors. Dorian loses his inner beauty long before he realizes that his soul's ugliness will destroy him.It's interesting to note that he chooses a French novel as his own Core Book, a personal classic which guided him throughout his life. In comparison, Uncle Tom and Jean Valjean both chose the Bible as their Core book. Near the end of the book, Dorian laments, \\"You poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that. Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It does harm.\\"Wilde clearly shows that books exert an amazing influence over our lives. We must be wise in our choice of what we read. As Thoreau once said, \\"Read the best books first, or you may not have the chance to read them at all.\\" I would only add to that, \\"Read the best books most often, for they will color your soul.\\""},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A classic and moving novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde discusses man's desire for youth, as well as his involvement in vanity. A tale of two differing personalities, the story is enticing, yet grippingOscar Wilde does an excellent job of revealing the contrasting atmospheres throughout the book. He does a fine job depicting the lighter side of Dorian Gray with images of life and excitement for example when he is getting painted, the light is bright and it takes place near a garden filled with beautiful flowers. Wilde is also able to portray the dark and menacing side in Dorian Gray as he eventually commits murder. Dorian Gray comes off as such a complicated character which makes him so interesting. He wants to fulfill his desires but is unable to do so successfully. People can feel how each person has a part of Dorian Gray in him or her. We all have our flaws we want to fix, but we should not become obsessive over them or it leads to destruction as seen in the book.The story is fascinating in that it is able to capture reader's interest because the mysteries in the plot are so intriguing. Although the book has that characteristic gothic element of a man living without the fear of death or consequence, The picture of Dorian Gray is still an accomplishment because it is written beautifully through the character description.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth the read, as readers are guaranteed to be captivated by the mysteries the character Dorian Gray holds."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Story:Dorian Gray is an adonis who is reminded or rather made attentive to his own beauty by a gentle artist friend (or lover) of his, Basil Hallward, who makes a breathtaking portrait of Gray. The portrait eventually becomes a favorite with Dorian, which also mirrors, in its painted face a sombre reflection of his own misdeeds and immoralities -- each time he commits it -- by growing uglier and uglier. He guards it with extreme care and caution everyday wanting none to see it found marred by his iniquities. Early in the story Dorian happens to meet with a reckless rich man, Lord Henry, a friend of Basil, who cares not a tithe for morality and its dull unattractive ways but believes in living life to the fullest at any cost. He preaches hedonism as sacred and purity a sin. Both Lord Henry and Dorian take an instant liking towards each other the day they meet. This friendship has an obvious deleterious effect on Dorian in that he kills himself repentantly after realising the worthlessness of his having lived a pompous, immoral, wicked and greedy life. Just before the story ends, he kills his well-wisher Basil too.How the story is arranged:Initially, the first few chapters seem to move fast and the story gains momentum. Just as the reader becomes inquisitive, a dull tone appears making the following chapters languorous. Wilde becomes a bit didactic in elaborating on the various interests Dorian picks on in his later adult life. Also, as one naturally imagines Dorian as a young lad, we then suddenly find him a thirties something in the last few chapters without a clear and smooth manifestation of this transition from adolescence to manhood. Most of Dorian's life is sinfully adventurous and in spite of that is portrayed quite uninterestingly. No events are specifically narrated upon and the emphasis on homosexuality can be smoothly sidelined. Overall, the story is good only if viewed as a philosophical inquest into human nature. Anything beyond that may disappoint the reader.Relevance, Reflections and Conclusion:The entire story is a narration of essentially how importantly one's mind makes one's personality, how one's personality makes one's deeds, and how in turn those deeds make one's soul. Of course we do not really fashion our soul, we only help it manifest it through our deeds. Gray's character is a reflection of the kind of narcissist weaklings in humanity who lack the courage to face their dark corners, while constantly finding strength and support in being mentored (actually misled) by feckless perverse people, like Lord Henry here, who lead them increasingly towards moral obscurity. How different the world would be if each one of us could reason out \\"responsibly\\" all that seems perverse and sacred, and yet not give in to anything perverse or sacred until one has found it true himself! I have also found the concept of blame game in this story very interesting. Do we not often dutifully blame others for our own darkness and failures, just as Dorian Gray blames his friend Basil Hallward for turning him into a deplorable narcissist? A responsible man always shares the burden of his own actions, rather than carelessly and callously point fingers at others -- a good lesson to learn! The story also raises deep philosophical arguments at every nook and corner if one plunges deep into the characters of the story attentively. Simple sentences like \\"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing\\" had me thinking and I found it strongly relevant in today's consumeristic hegemony. There are many more such dialogues which raise questions about the importance of femininity, marriage, purity, aestheticism and so on. Anyhow, to read it for its \\"own sake\\", or to try to finish it in a hurry, will certainly make it very boring and tiresome. But for those who inveterately love to question and investigate the world they live in with its various dogmas, theologies, philosophies and doctrines either propagating or thrashing morality, this book makes an interesting read. Since I do not possess a bent of mind that appreciates a tragic ending, -- I consider human life very precious --, I was sorely disappointed to see the protagonist, Dorian Gray, dead in the end. In fact I find this style of defeatist writing/ending a flaw in itself though it appeals to many. Plainly, if I were the author, I would have given my protagonist a new life, a new philosophy, a new guidance, and a new hope. HOPE...without which the entire humanity cannot exist."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was an amazing book that had an incredable thought process.

It's easy to see why the book aroused so much controversy when it was released, and why it had an integral role in Wilde's subsequent imprisonment: the moral dilemna the book presents is disturbing even today. Wilde was truly a great writer; it's obvious from reading this book. Not only was his wit top-notch as is often ackwnoledged, but his prose is very smooth and polished, very refined. Wilde's attitudes towards art are well-known - indeed, he says in the book's introduction that \\"all art is quite useless\\" - but it seems obvious now that he was a natural talent. I hesitate to say things like He was meant to be a writer, but it certainly seems true of Wilde. This is one of the books that shakes our moral foundations. Wilde's high-class lifestyle is well-documented - it seems his surname was utterly appropriate - and one can definitely see where the plot and perhaps some of the details of this book came from his own experience. Undoubtedly, the main premise of the novel - a man selling his soul for eternal youth - most likely sprung from a desire that Wilde himself expressed. Perhaps he was having doubts about his hedonistic lifestyle even when this book was written, several years before his imprisonment. One can conjecture all one wants, but the fact remains that this book is a marvelous piece of work. The wonderful, polished prose is a joy to read - with aphorisms abound - and I, for one, see it as a deep regret that this was the only novel Wilde ever wrote. We missed out on a lot of great literature, especially with the general disdain the plays are now looked upon with in our society. Alas, read this masterpiece, and you will miss out less."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book in 6th grade and have loved it ever since.

After his two year sentence on Abnormal Sexual Vice his career literaly ended but even though he is gone, his writing is still fresh, enjoyable, and always a favourite."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"&quot;Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist...&quot; says Oscar Wilde's Basil Hallward - and every book is the author's autobiography. Wilde provides an irresistible coupling of his fascinating wisdom and seductive voice in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY, a self-portrait.In a story of forbidden love, Wilde languishes in an idyllic setting eager with curous onlookers whom he delights in stimulating. He insists upon being provocative and alluring, taking 'strange pleausre in saying things that he is not sorry about having said.' THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is an image drawn by a lover whose passion for realism is transcended only by the hands of a writer who leaves everything to your imagination. As Dorian Gray protests, &quot;Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to.&quot;But this IS a book about thinking - and deeply. A book that fathoms the deep erotic recesses of the human heart and speaks its language perfectly."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray was definately an excellent book, although the wording was somewhat outdated. It is an excellent piece of work, but I just had one question about it. Do you really think it was all Dorian's fault that everything happened?

Lord Henry put outrageous ideas into an innocent litte head, and should be noticed as the fault of all of Gray's actions. It just killed me that no one realized what was really happening! But besides that question of fault, it was a grade A book, that I would read again, but not without a dictionary by my side. I recommend it to anyone who likes intelectual reading, and who is willing to sit through outdated talk. Just go for it, it's worth your time, and better yet... it's a short novel!"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A tale of beuty, love, innocence and cruelty. Wilde did a wonderful job of telling the story of young Dorian Gray, a timeless beuty that never shows his age and whose face never displays his sins. He betrays close friends, is fuel for many a suicide, is down right cruel and unfeeling to any of his numerous loves, is selfish and self immersed; yet his young, beutiful face never shows a trace of ill being. Being in a room with him, drowns anyone with pleasure, peacefulness and charm- it is impossible to look at his face and believe that someone so sweet and innocent in looks would commit any of the evil he is rumored to have done. Instead of himself being affected, a portait of him as a young man endures the strain of his uncouth behavior.This timeless tale, set in England at the turn of the century, would be an excellent story line for any modern novel and would make a wonderful movie. Wilde's writting style is proliferic, poignant and delightful. It captures the language of the time period, yet was easy to read and easy to relate to. Wilde conveys the evil of the aestetic world and how it can drive one to stop at nothing for fear of losing it. And though he hints at such controversial topics such as drugs and homosexuality; it is neither detailed nor graphic; and is only slightly touched on. Throughout the novel, Wilde creates an image and lets the reader fully develop it for himself. I absolutley adored this book and highly reccomend it to anyone. Not for a moment did I think it dull, or too wordy. It is a very easy read (which is difficult to say of such a classic), and incredibly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book fits Wilde's description of a cigarette as a perfect pleasure - portable and brief, yet leaving you unsatisfied. Like Dorian Gray himself, this book is superficially charming, with its numerous and clever epigrams, but with some very ugly undercurrents, e.g. virulent anti-semitism, misogyny, and homosexuality. We never connect emotionally with Dorian Gray, who never matures into a complex or interesting character, but remains as some gay ideal with psychosis. Read Henry James' &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; or Edith Wharton's &quot;Age of Innocence&quot; for a far better written, devastating attack on Victorian morals and hypocrisy."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Indudablemente Oscar Wilde es uno de los m&aacute;s grandes escritores de la Literatura Universal; pero m&aacute;s que eso fue uno de los pocos que se atrevi&oacute; a enfrentar a una sociedad adoctrinada y primitiva, siempre dispuesta a estigmatizar aquellos que no se alineaban con los patrones impuestos por ellos mismos.

A good friend of his paints his portrait. Dorian Gray sees it and makes a wish not possible - to stay youthful forever. He doesn't grow old but the picture of him does, in the most awful and frightening ways.Dorian shows his friend who painted the picture how it has changed - his friend reaches for a knife and charges at the picture. Dorian restrains his companion and kills him with the knife. Dorian grows more and more evil as the picture grows from awful to hideous. Dorian tries to repent in the end and stabs the picture and the picture returns to how it was at the start, and the hideousness of it that tells who he has become shows on him at last. He has stabbed at it and at himself, so he dies repenting.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my favorite book over the summer because it was easy to read and easy to get into.

She was the first one that introduced me to \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" because she is four years older than me."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Best to label this story a fantasy despite the fact that such fantasy is revealed in only a few paragraphs. Most of the book is what used to pass as witty dialogue between stifled, elite Englishmen and women. Most of this dialogue displays the thinking of a totally amoral Lord Henry who verbally paints everyone he meets as a slivered character reflecting his own amorality. To Lord Henry, one's belief in anything is proof of one's deranged thinking. Both he and Dorian experienced continued hedonism but with no gratification.The reader is forced to accept the premise that an artist painted the portrait of Dorian and in so doing captured the young man's soul on the canvas. While Dorian lived the portrait kept aging while Dorian retained his outer, youthful appearance. Thus no other living character in the story had any evidence of the aging ugliness of the portrait. At Dorian's death the living portrait, the soul of Dorian, returned to its pristine, youthful glow.Throughout the story the reader is joined with the character Dorian in accepting the portrait's brutal transformation. But with the array of deaths that followed Dorian's heartless cruelty the reader kept being confronted with the pointlessness of the tale. The reader would like to have witnessed Lord Henry's response to the apparent suicide of Dorian Gray who he worshipped throughout the tale. But no such ending was provided."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The essence of the book can be summed up when Dorian Grey wishes that his portrait to age, get old and decay but he should remain young and beautiful for ever! He not only accomplishes it but convinces others to this remarkable feat. He is so conceited, self absorbed and without any conscious that after he murders his true friend, he goes to bed and has a good night sleep. Dorian Grey is one of the most bizarre charecters in literature. I guess we all have a little bit of Dorian Grey in us at times, hopefully in small doses. Lord Henry, the quick witted,brilliant companion is none other than Oscar Wilde. Aremarkable book. If it were written today, there would be lot ofcontroversy as the male charecters bond so freely.

The first few pages are incredibly interesting. They are written extremely well and are filled with facinating ideas. That doesn't last long, though. After the forthy-somthing page the reader begins to understand that Oscar Wilde uses a lot of words to say nothing. And he does say something, you won't notice it because it's strangled to death with a lot of useless information.However, I do think the book does make a good read. You can't really blame Wilde for writing the way he does, since he, himself, says on the second page of this book: &quot;The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one adimers it intensely&quot;, and Wilde does admires his work intensely and for that we &quot;owe' it to him to read &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I enjoyed reading the book, and thought that it was a great allegory.

Certainly, it is dated insofar as many other Edwardian novels out of Nineteenth Century England seem trite and shallow (faring badly with what was coming out of Russia at the time: Gripping, universal, human stories from titanic authors like Dostoevsky or Tolstoy). But, cultural handicaps aside, let's give Wilde his due: The book is a treasure trove of wit--from his brilliant epigrams to its very fascinating plot, which anticipates Magical Realism by at least 50 years. That is to say, when one thinks of &quot;Twilight Zone-esque&quot; writing one is put in mind of Kafka, Borges or Grabriel Garcia-Marquez. The best in World Literature.

It is beautifully done like a silk tapestry or a work of art. His ideas about life and what place art has in life are equally as interesting. It is obvious to the reader from the moment he or she picks up the book that it is mostly about art, as the title itself shows---The Picture of Dorian Gray. It becomes clear to the reader Art was the true basis for this book. Dorian himself is a physically beautiful man who collects art, and he enjoys all the splendor of a fashionable existence. Oscar Wilde was a man who also shared interest in these things so it clear that the base for his most successful book is his ideas about art ( as show in the preface) the relation ship between artist observer and art. The characters in this book are playing the parts of his opinions of art wonderfully and in doing so reveal to the reader their inner most thoughts and feelings.Dorian and his painting that he holds so dear each have a different place in Oscar Wilde's ideals as the art and the artist .One of Oscar Wilde's statements about art is \\"The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the artist is the artist's aim\\". (3). Dorian's outside appearance that he \\"reveals\\" becomes an illusion, a sort of mask, which hides or \\"conceals\\" his inner unhappiness and inability to live. Dorian's outer persona becomes his \\"art\\", the elegant illusion that he offers to the world, while his inner feelings are the \\"artist\\". Dorian's \\"artist\\" is his soul, but in fact while he is revealing this beautiful surface to the world and enchanting everyone he is concealing his true self. He separates himself from the aging and corrupted painting. Putting on this act is to \\"conceal the artist\\" which is the artist's aim. For Dorian Gray, hiding away all signs of aging and keeping up a surface youth, beauty, and innocence is creating himself as a work of art. This point is further illustrated in the text when after basil's visit to him he nearly goes mad about protecting his painting or his soul \\"when his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly, and wondered if he had thought of peering behind the screen.... yet he thought it best to be on his guard...his eye fell on a large purple satin coverlet heavily embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century Venetian work ...Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing...Now, it was to hide something that had a corruption of it's own, worse than the corruption of death itself-something that would breed horrors and yet would never die.\\"(103-4). The most obvious point that this paragraph shows is Dorian's need to \\"conceal\\" his soul or himself. The Venetian coverlet symbolizes Dorian's \\"art\\" or need for splendor and beautiful things to conceal his true identy. Dorian's need to conceal himself is shown with literal symbolization he is taking his art or Venetian coverlet and putting it over his \\"painting\\" to hide his soul. As the paragraph goes on he describes the painting or his \\"soul\\" in a way that shows you his true feelings about his soul he thinks of himself as being corrupt, horrible, and worse than death and naturally wants to separate his art or outter self from his painting or inner self. Oscar Wilde's theory's about art and artist's relationship connects perfectly with Dorian grays feelings about himself.Dorian has no conscience about other people's feelings because he does not expect his own which relates to Oscar Wilde's opinion that an artist has no ethical sympathies. Oscar Wilde says, \\"No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style\\" (p. 3). Dorian seems to be without human emotions. He remembers his parents only through their outward appearance--- the lips or shape of the face that he has inherited. He does not remember their feelings for him or his attachment to them. It may have been that he was raised without emotional ties. The only time that his family is mentioned, Dorian calls his memories of them hateful (p. 103). In Victorian High society, feelings and emotions were considered less worthy than opinions or ideas. This has caused Dorian to grow up and not understand moral conscience he believes that the only thing that is important is new innovation and ideas, because he was taught to be that way. That is demonstrated when he decides to show Basil his soul:\\"You can tell the whole world about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody would believe you, if they did believe; they would like me all the better for it. I know the age better than you do\\" (p, 133). He says that his age---the end of the nineteenth century---was more pre-occupied with style than substance, so his youthful glamour---and the fact that the had a secret for escaping ageing---would inspire envy and imitation, not horror. But it is show in the story with basil's reaction to the painting or his \\"soul\\" that people will in fact be horrified by someone who destroys their soul by keeping themselves enterally young and beautiful or renovating their \\"art\\". And by saying \\" I know the age better than you do \\" he is actually proving the opposite and that he doesn't have any ethical sympathies because he so obviously doesn't the nineteenth- century does care about a persons soul. It also relates to the modern day struggle over plastic surgery whether it is a way to keep yourself beautiful or a way to become obsessed with your appearance and destroy your morality you could say that a modern day Dorian Gray is a Michael Jackson someone who is once loved and admired by his public but then after turning to plastic surgery and shopping to better his appearance he becomes a joke and loses his admiration much like Dorian Gray. They both do not relate to the public and have lost their moral conscience do to constantly trying to better their appearance or better their \\"art\\". Dorian Gray doesn't understand other people's ideals because he is not willing to except the fact that he thinks of his internal self as an ugly disgusting thing. Dorian plays into Oscar Wilde's opinions about artists not having ethical sympathies because he does not understand moral conscience of his society. He also shows the reader his inner feelings that he thinks of himself as something awful.Basil and Dorian are like art and observer basil's ideals about Dorian are mirrored on to him. Basil Howard's influence is reflected in this quote from the preface; \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their own peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" (p. 3). The spectator in this story is Basil Howard. Basil Howard sees Dorian through his own eyes as a beautiful young man who is full of life and innocence. Basil's soul of truth, love, kindness and caring for others is put into his painting. Dorian's external appearance is appreciated by a spectator (Basil) so it begins to mirror what the spectator sees, and other people also come to see Dorian as a prince of art. Like when an observer looks at art they interpretative it in their own way. This is shown when basil comes to talk to Dorian about the way he is perceived to society \\"I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you. I want you to get rid of the hateful people you associate with...you have wonderful influence, let it be for good and not evil\\" (p, 132). This shows basils admiration for Dorian and the way that he thinks of Dorian that it mirrored in the way that he will see him. He is in fact saying that he wants to lead a life where the world respects him and that he has wonderful influence because all he knows about Dorian Gray is what he knows about himself. In the page before basil talks about Dorian's face and the way that he looks means that must not be a bad person but that is only a surface opinion, like that you have of art, once you learn something about the artist, you interpret in another way. Basil doesn't know Dorian's \\"artist\\" or soul he doesn't see him he only sees himself, so basils beautiful heart and soul are projected onto Dorian's appearance. Again Oscar Wilde's ideals of the relationship between the artist and the spectator are interpreted on to his characters Dorian is just a mirror of basil, Just as art is just a mirror of the spectator. It also shows that basil wants to respected by the world, and have wonderful influence.A person could spend days and pages and pages explaining why Oscar Wilde's ideas of art reflect on the characters of The Picture of Dorian Gray and what it reveals about the characters true feelings. Here are the most important Dorian Gray and his painting reflect on the his ideas of the artist and the art, Dorian Gray and his ideas of artists not having ethical sympathies, and that Dorian and Basils relationship is the same as the art and the artists relationship. And a person could also go into the fact that according to Oscar Wilde's ideals about art the critic is he who can translate into another manner and I hope that was done in this essay.please anyone don't steal thi sessay as your own, because believe it or not if your teacher is smart and will type in the first sentance of this essay in google and this will come right up and you will be expelled.thank you for reading"},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Who knows? But right-wing orthodox Catholic monarchist readers will be required to steel themselves through the first two chapters which consist of a drawn-out slap fight between Elton John, Graham Norton and Ian McKellan. Now I like a cat-fight as much as the next guy, but a tussle among effete Brit cats with man parts is just icky. So the narcissistic homo-erotic banter opening the book was significantly under-appreciated by this reader. But after you get through those chapters the book gets much, much better.It is difficult to maintain that the book represents a defense of amoral Aestheticism, since the embodiment of the aesthetic ideal, Dorian Gray, is shown to be a damned man. That is not to say that Wilde embraces Catholicism in the novel, as the narrator often posits confusing opinions on issues of conscience and sin. At times Wilde seems to suggest that only immoderate (quantitatively speaking) behavior is immoral; and yet, at other times, it appears some actions themselves ought to be avoided. Is Wilde acknowledging that there are exceptionless moral norms? And what is the reader to make of rotten Wotton, whose epigrammatic phrases seem so akin to Wilde's? Hallward points out that Wotton's cynicism is a pose. He never says a moral thing, but he never does a wrong thing. So are we to take his Wilde-isms seriously? Are we to take Wilde seriously? Wilde says art is neither moral nor immoral, yet Gray is poisoned by A Rebors, a book by another decadent author who, oddly enough, also converted to Catholicism. And then there's the picture itself, the fruit of Hallward's homosexual obsession, which is clearly cursed, in spite of its initial apparent beauty.Wilde's protests notwithstanding, it is a book with a moral informing the reader that he cannot escape his conscience, that he cannot reject nature and nature's God, and that the wages of sin are death. But therein lies hope, for if God is to be believed regarding the wages of sin, then why should we doubt Him regarding our Redemption? Unfortunately, this message is made ambiguous by an author who, rather than unintentionally creating a distorted image of an idea that cannot be fully represented, intentionally peppers the novel with paradox for the sake of cuteness. But the Truth is not cute. He's terrifying, and Wilde knows better. Therefore the book is best left to the orthodox or the decadent. The lukewarm will simply be confused."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray was a tedious read. I did not particularly enjoy it that much, although I acknowledge that it is a good piece of literature. It is very well written and full of details and vivid descriptions.

I couldn't relate to the British aristocracy system and was utterly appalled at how unbelievably shallow the characters were, although Wilde was probably going for that effect. I was also disappointed with the ending. I thought the point of the novel would be to eliminate the stereotype that bad people are ugly, but it just perpetuated it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a book that makes them think. It is also recommended to people who like books from this era (late 1800's) and have a lot of time on their hands."},{"Title":"Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Will someone please tell me why this \\"uplifting classics\\" edition uses an image of Thomas Jefferson on the \\"cover\\"?
