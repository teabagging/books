Wrong in that it's wasteful in money and human performance. The book gives many ideas on what to do instead, stressing the importance of feedback to the individual and the performance of the organization. It is more that a cook book of what to do on this important topic. The authors give the science behind their thinking and experience. I hope that my competition does not find out about this book."},{"Title":"Abolishing Performance Appraisals: Why They Backfire and What to Do Instead","review":"Tom Coens and Mary Jenkins have put together a great compilation of years of profound knowledge, and added to that knowledge with even more convincing arguments for ridding ourselves of this destructive practice.

They explain why in their book, which also traces the development of the appraisal method and analyzes why companies have stuck with a tool that simply doesn't work. Although the authors tend to redundancy, their writing is clear and engaging, and they support their message with passages from major business leaders, scholars, consultants and researchers. Old hands might view their suggested alternatives as pie-in-the-sky solutions to employee management and motivation, but we [...] recommend this book to optimistic managers who believe that there must be a better way."},{"Title":"Abolishing Performance Appraisals: Why They Backfire and What to Do Instead","review":"Coens and Jenkins had the guts and innovative thinking to address a fundamental issue in the global workforce: abolishing performance appraisals &amp; the leadership that is required to have a healthy work environment. This book is a must-read for business owners, managers, and HR executives who are focused on creating an environment where people can contribute, perform, communicate, innovate, take pride in their work, and have fun learning. Based on the theories of management from Dr. W. Edwards Deming, Coens and Jenkins have not only focused on the theories, beliefs, and assumptions of leadership, but also on the practical skills needed to abolish performance appraisals and lead people! Do we really think that people will learn, contribute, cooperate, be passionate about their work and the customer when they are judged, rated, ranked, and intimidated? The insights Coens and Jenkins provide are awesome and real world! This book is an excellent tool and stimulus for leaders and managers to challenge the way people are treated and motivated and to build an environment where people love their work and the culture they are in. It is easy to retain people; it is really a no-brainer, as long as there is a culture that is healthy and enables people to learn and grow and share their knowledge. Personally I have seen hundreds of companies that destroy people; they are in a self-destruct mode; today they may be leaders in their industry; 10 years from now they will struggle to survive. But those organizations who challenge their current beliefs and assumptions, and the old systems will create innovation---in their practices and their thinking. This is what Coens and Jenkins have so artfully described in their focus on Abolishing Performance Appraisals. This is one of the top 5 books every executive should read and apply as soon as possible."},{"Title":"Abolishing Performance Appraisals: Why They Backfire and What to Do Instead","review":"There should be a huge audience for this book, if others have had anything like the experience I had as a manager years ago. I was asked to complete performance appraisals for the 25 people who reported to me. At the outset, it seemed like a routine process, but it quickly became a font of bitterness. With each employee, I earnestly voiced a combination of heartfelt enthusiasm and helpful criticism. And, invariably, each employee glommed onto the \\"bad\\" stuff and walked away crestfallen. Only after I myself set up a forum for receiving appraisals of my own performance did I have any sense of the devastation wrought by the appraisal process. At the time, I was sure I hadn't done it right, that there was a better way to get my incisive criticism across to to those whom I was appraising. But just as Barry Oshrey, in Seeing Systems, has revealed the patterns of perception and behaviors depending on whether one is a top manager, a middle manager, or a front-line employee, Coens and Jenkins, in Abolishing Performance Appraisals, have revealed the systemic bases for the dismay experienced by virtually everyone who has participated in appraising others or being appraised. Even the recently-become-sacred 360-degree appraisals can be fatally flawed, say the authors, if what they are about is judgment and evaluation, rather than helpful feedback.In describing alternatives to appraisal, the authors have written a detailed handbook on feedback, coaching, dealing with poor performers, and compensation. Coens and Jenkins quote a telling comment from Douglas McGregor pointing to the tendency of managers to ignore the results of research. In marshalling not only an impressive array of research, but also nicely bringing the research to life with \\"true stories,\\" the authors have produced a remarkably useful handbook for managing in the new century."},{"Title":"Abolishing Performance Appraisals: Why They Backfire and What to Do Instead","review":"This book is a valuable asset to everyone who leads and interacts with people. Jenkins and Coens have clearly presented a case against performance appraisals that leadership has needed to know for years. We can only hope that it is read and taken to heart. They present a sound case about how destructive appraisals can be to the human spirit, and the bottom line. As an international business consultant who had worked with Dr. Deming, I was happy to read that the authors did not stop at presenting the case, but offer numerous suggestions, case studies and a specific process to create an alternative that is appropriate for each organization. No \\"cookie cutter\\" approach here, Coens and Jenkins approach is clearly in line with Dr. Deming's teaching that you must study the system first before you change it. Implementing a new system, without fully comprehending how it aligns with the purpose of an organization will only create new problems. Jenkins and Coens book will guide leaders to do what is right for their individual organization."},{"Title":"Abolishing Performance Appraisals: Why They Backfire and What to Do Instead","review":"This book becomes more relevant every year! For organizations that want responsible employees, it challenges leadership to consider the assumptions that drive traditional HR performance appraisal processes - most importantly those arising from the common \`parental' or \`patriarchy' model of leadership and organizational development.In this research-based analysis of the multiple purposes of performance appraisal, a labor attorney and an experienced HR professional team-up to explain why appraisals backfire - and they clearly accomplish that key goal of the book. In particular they explain why, in a world in which 98% of people see themselves as being in the top half of performers, the requirement to force-rank employees is a demoralizing and demotivating policy - if you then connect pay raises to this policy, it is a policy to pay money to demotivate the majority of staff! What responsible leader wants their name on such a policy?So, is there a solution? Yes, but not a ready-made one. Because the authors recognize that the performance appraisal process is only a part of a highly integrated organization framework (the authors refer to this as \`The System' - others ask you to think 7-S model) that drives organizational effectiveness, the book does not recommend a one-size-fits-all solution to replacing performance appraisals. Instead, it recommends that the reader make a paradigm shift away from the patriarchy model to a more adult to adult concept, think about what the organization really wants to accomplish (what problem is to be addressed), and provide choices for different individual situations. The book is not an easy read, nor does it provide a feel good solution - it is recommended for thoughtful practitioners who want to know what questions to ask for their situation, rather than what answers others have found for their own, perhaps very different, situation."},{"Title":"Abolishing Performance Appraisals: Why They Backfire and What to Do Instead","review":"If you grapple with performance appraisal, then it might be worth thinking through the assumptions that you have built your performance appraisal system upon.

As a Human Resource Director at a large, Midwest manufacturing facility, I see first hand the impact of performance appraisals on both the company and the individual. I have never felt comfortable with the appraisal process, but always feel responsible for assuring its proper implementation. Despite my best efforts, the process never works as it is intended. Numbers continue to get in the way of meaningful conversation, ratings are rarely accurate, people continue to feel bitter and betrayed, and managers, in general, are uneasy with the process. This book has done several things for me. First, it validates my discomfort with performance apraisals.

Coens and Jenkins have created a lasting and important contribution to the serious debate about the effectiveness of performance appraisals."},{"Title":"Abolishing Performance Appraisals: Why They Backfire and What to Do Instead","review":"This book has more perspectives and detail about the problems with performance appraisals than you would have learned about in 20 years. As a result, the suggestion to abolish performance appraisals comes as no surprise (especially since that's the title) and the logic is appealing, as well. To get rid of performance appraisals will be difficult in most companies, because people will not be able to imagine what the alternatives can be. The book's rich detail about the problems, and then the many suggestions in it for how to develop replacements fill those gaps.If you are like me and dislike performance appraisals, get this book to help you to migrate away from them.Since I never liked performance appraisals, I abolished them years ago in our consulting firm. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the mechanisms that I had substituted for performance appraisals were consistent with the authors' recommendations.I am a big believer in complexity science, and like to see organizations operating in more free form ways. You have to eliminate strait jackets like performance appraisals to get to that point.The thrust of the alternative is to place the responsibility with each person in the company for their own development, but be sure that they get access to the resources and feedback they need to improve. This is also very revealing because people vary enormously in how interested they are in improving. If you put the ball in their court, you will learn a great deal about the future potential of the people in the organization. Some will try very little. Some will try a lot. Many will not follow through. But you will have opened a doorway through which the most motivated to improve can go as far as they want. That's terrific!The only part of the book that I disagreed with is that the authors think that all performance measures are bad. In my experience and in my research, I find that performance measures that people set for themselves that they think are important are extremely valuable for focusing and stimulating performance. The authors seem to think that employees will always focus on goals that help their little area rather than the whole company. That occurs only when people don't understand how the whole business works. That's an education issue, not a performance measurement issue.After you have read and begun to apply this book, I suggest that you also think about where else in your organization you have bureaucratic practices that stifle innovation, hurt morale, and slow down progress. Then, use this book as a model for how to undo those harms as well. In many companies, processes for controlling capital expenditures and authorizing new product development often have these effects. As a result, little experiments are inhibited that the company can afford to fail in by processes designed to keep from making big mistakes with billions.Free up everyone to feel good about themselves, to become better, and to cooperate more freely to improve the organization!"},{"Title":"Abolishing Performance Appraisals: Why They Backfire and What to Do Instead","review":"This is an important and well written book. The authors, Tom Coens and Mary Jenkins, think it is time for organizations to begin treating employees like the adults that they are. There is too much patriarchal and paternalistic hand-holding, and way too much time spent monitoring, evaluating and judging individuals. The authors advocate dropping the ritual of performance appraisal as a vital step, in itself, and for the &quot;undercurrent&quot; that appraisal represents, towards freeing the human spirit in organizations. This undercurrent &quot;hangs like a cloud, pervades the workplace atmosphere....&quot; It is the &quot;personnel policies, human resource practices, and most importantly, the organization's unseen culture (values and beliefs) about people. It sends messages that people are not interested in working or improving the organization, messages that people are children who need to be directed and controlled in an atmosphere much like a traditional school.&quot; This is powerful stuff.Coens and Jenkins want us to get busy on working together towards improving processes and the system of delivering value to our customers, and give up the quest for finally pinpointing, once and for all, who the &quot;1&quot;s, &quot;2&quot;s, &quot;3&quot;s, etc. are in the organization. They want us to quit thinking that a person's value and performance can somehow be reduced to a number. They explain how this is a fallacy and illusion, given the impossibility of separating out the individual's contribution from the contribution of the system or environment that she works in, inherent measurement and judgment biases, and organizational politics. More importantly, such reductionism is degrading and demoralizing to the individual. And &quot;we trivialize an individual's work, often involving heart and soul, from something unique and wonderful into a cold and sterile numerical rating that purportedly signifies the person's total contribution.&quot;The approach the authors take is to first surface, then examine, and ultimately attack the assumptions underlying appraisal, and then to build alternatives from &quot;newer, more hopeful assumptions.&quot; They are thorough and convincing in making the case to abolish performance appraisal.W. Edwards Deming, who mentored Jenkins, was often asked, &quot;But if we eliminate performance appraisal, then what will we replace it with?&quot; He would reply, &quot;Try leadership.&quot; Whereas Coens and Jenkins would surely support such a true and succinct response, they also offer specific guidelines and methodology for an organization to wean itself from the nonproductive and harmful anachronism of performance appraisal. For example, they describe how to effectively &quot;debundle&quot; management concerns, such as motivation, coaching, counseling, retention, discharge, goal setting, pay, promotion, and discipline, which are often packaged as part of the appraisal process.I highly recommend this book for anyone who values dignity, respect, and trust in the workplace, and who believes that holding such values is crucial in striving for true organizational excellence."},{"Title":"Abolishing Performance Appraisals: Why They Backfire and What to Do Instead","review":"Abolishing Performance Appraisals makes a powerful case for removing this well intended yet ineffective ritual organizations have been requiring for decades. Indeed, Coens and Jenkins provide solid reason why appraisals have to go, to be replaced with quality feedback mechanisms including coaching and support structures that enable employees to maximize their own potential. No one reading this book would challenge its basic argument. My primary concern was in the prescription. They recommend you recruit a group of stakeholders as your design team, to explore the problem in your own organization, and to arrive at alternatives that align with your organization's mission. Considering that Coens and Jenkins affirm W. Edward Deming's claim that 94% of performance outcomes are attributable to the system, they are less robust in offering concrete guidelines on what \\"the system\\" should look like. This book is excellent in describing the history of the problem and highly persuasive in its message. It accomplishes that goal. If the reader is interested in exploring a system that is a clear alternative, that is simple in scope and provides a strong transition from the current mess, I recommend you pick up Catalytic Coaching - The End of the Performance Review by Gary Markle. Equally thought provoking on the issue, but a stronger set of steps on how to approach the problem."},{"Title":"Abolishing Performance Appraisals: Why They Backfire and What to Do Instead","review":"What a wonderful gift Coens and Jenkins have given to us!

The sad part is, in a country as technically advanced as the US, this same process has been used in corporations since World War II. Can you name another technology still in use from that era?As a Performance Management consultant I've reengineered appraisal systems based on employee and management needs, so the book's title put me off initially. Performance mesurement and feedback is critical in a high performing organization. But the authors' approach is right on target. Organizations should NOT stop measuring, but measure and feed back accurately within an adult-to-adult context. The data on how humans behave puts traditional PA systems to shame. What a waste of resources!Performance Management systems can be reengineered at little direct cost and return REAL individual, group and organizational performance improvement. I've found that nearly all PA systems are compensation rather than performance focused, and actually keep employees from the accountability the organization seeks. What's worse, these systems are often the only source for employee feedback!Coens and Jenkins capture and dispel all the well-meaning assumptions of traditional Performance Appraisals, while also providing solid PERFORMANCE-BASED alternatives. For example, and with no apologies to the lawyers, individual performance documentation is only needed when there is a serious performance problem, and that is quite rare. Positive performance data is available in other, more productive ways. Why burden the entire organization, demotivate employees, and waste valuable resources when treating adults as adults can actually improve BOTTOM LINE PERFORMNACE?The book is not for everyone, but managers who have always felt sick about using their company's PA process will be delighted to know that they were right all along. People know how to do this, and company bureaucracy just gets in the way.No business has extra people or money. I've effectively used these same principles for years. Thank you, Tom and Mary, for documenting a process for 21st century Performance Management."},{"Title":"Abolishing Performance Appraisals: Why They Backfire and What to Do Instead","review":"First, let me reveal a potential source of bias - I've been practicing employment law, primarily from the management side, for more than 27 years and I have known Tom Coens for almost 20 years. Having revealed my potential biases, let me say that I found this to be an insightful and provocative book. I found the chapter on 'Dispelling The Legal Myths and Dealing With Poor Performers' particularly helpful and I am recommending the book to Human Resources Directors and employment lawyers with whom I work. As Tom and Mary point out, a myth prevalent at companies around America is that performance appraisals are the bedrock of defense against employment lawsuits. While it is true that objective, carefully considered, employment appraisals can be helpful in the defense of lawsuits, such appraisals are often the exception rather than the rule. As Tom and Mary note, unfortunately the press of business, the &quot;halo factor&quot;, politics, disinclination of managers to discuss criticism and sheer laziness often compromise the effectiveness of performance appraisals both for their primary purposes and for the secondary purpose of utilizing such documents in the defense of lawsuits. In fact, it is not unusual in my practice to have the following conversation with a client. Client: We can't take it any more. We need to fire Employee X ASAP. He has been performing below par for years, but the bar has been raised and we can't afford to carry him any more. Me: Let me guess, Employee X is in a protected category and has gotten &quot;satisfactory to good&quot; performance appraisals for the last several years because Manager Y did not want to step up to the plate and tell him the real problems with his performance. Client: How did you know? Tom and Mary effectively address this problem and, better yet, give practical solutions to documenting performance and discipline while providing alternatives to excessive reliance on the performance appraisal system. I highly recommend their book."},{"Title":"Abolishing Performance Appraisals: Why They Backfire and What to Do Instead","review":"Perhaps no other workplace topic is so hotly debated, so universally loathed, so burdened with anxiety than that annual ritual known as the job performance evaluation. More than one supervisor has said it would be easier to write one's own obituary than tackle the yearly job review.The book, \\"Abolishing Performance Appraisals,\\" has a simple way of addressing this task. Don't do them in the first place!The authors argue that performance appraisals are not working in ways they are intended to - to reward, motivate and improve work forces. Instead, such performance reviews demoralize employees and frustrate supervisors. The primary problem, the authors state, is that using one process for so many complex activities (although filled with good intentions) is idealistic as well as dispiriting. And, they continue, no amount of tweaking can solve the problem. The only true solution is to put appraisals to rest.Human Resources professionals will find this book most useful in determining how they can lead the charge in breaking away from tradition and moving closer to become a more progressive company. However, it is this challenge that will make the reader's head hurt.The book is well written and thoughtfully done. It is divided into three parts with the first two addressing why appraisals fail and examining the core reasons behind performance reviews. These first eight chapters depict clearly that appraisals are flawed with destructive, though unintended effects. All of author's arguments make sense - common sense - to an extent where one finds itself pledging never to conduct a performance appraisal again.It is the third part of the book that provides the reader with headaches. Although there is a sixteen-step process for making the transition from traditional performance appraisals to alternatives, there is no solution. As early as the Preface, the authors give ample warning about the endpoint by stating over and over again that there is no one model that answers all the questions they have identified. They state each company must find its own solution. In addition, they bring to reality that there is no shortcut. In fact, their recommended method usually takes two years to implement encompassing much effort, time, and cost.The concepts of this book, in a nutshell, are: getting to the underlying assumption of why performance appraisals are used and create a new way of thinking to change current strategies and systems; encouraging supervisors to provide honest feedback and communication to employees by maintaining daily, two-way communication; empowering employees to be responsible for themselves - for their careers, for receiving feedback, and holding themselves accountable for the work to be done; giving leaders the freedom to choose for themselves the most effective ways o f working with people; moving away from and individual performance company to a organizational improvement company; and creating a culture where the company provide all of its people the tools, training, resources, and environment to do all these things mentioned.The difficulty an HR professional will face in their industry is winning over top management to support these initiatives. Usually, management holds fast to traditions. Firms with proactive leaders may find some resistance at first but should be able to garner support easily.This book encourages you to be a witness to the performance appraisal funeral.

I have come to this conclusion through my own experience and through the persuasive writings of Peter Scholtes (The Leader's Handbook) and W. Edwards Deming (The New Economics) and other authors.Coens and Jenkins have written a thoroughly researched and documented text that provides a wealth of information on why performance appraisal should be eliminated, and what instead should be done to perform the functions it allegedly achieves.Pages 306 and 307 provide an excellent summary of principles that can be used to improve organizational performance, coach employees, provide feedback, determine compensation, make promotion decisions, develop employees, help poor performers, and provide appropriate legal documentation in the event of a lawsuit.Figure 10.1 on page 286 provides an excellent summary of the process necessary for an organization to free itself from the grip of individual appraisal and refocus its attention on improving system performance.

So much of this book rehashes the obvious points of journalism. I don't, for example, need to know what an inverted pyramid or nut graf is.

Blogs, for example are no longer just personal journals. They are a part of most news agencies, as an extension of beat reporting. They are often not connected to a person, but a topic. Many points have drastically evolved since this book was published.I would not recommend this book for teaching. Rather, use articles and chapters from books published by the experts of their fields.

It easily lands on my short list of best cookbooks dedicated to a specific regional cuisine. While Elizabeth David's book on Mediterranean cuisine maintains an important place in the literature of Mediterranean cuisine and Claudia Roden's book on the food of the Middle East improves the depth of coverage over David, Wolfert's book tops both of them in depth of coverage and may rival David's book for insights into the culinary wellsprings of the region.Outside of writing on the Mediterranean and the Middle East, I find Wolfert's book to rival those of Diana Kennedy on Mexico and even match the quality, if not the seminal influence of Julia Child's 'Mastering the Art of French Cooking'. The main edge I would give to Child's book is that it succeeds in bringing a more limited topic into a bit clearer focus.Wolfert does not cover the entire Eastern Mediterranean, and her book gains from the focus she put on the four areas she covers. These are:Northern Greece (Macedonia and Thrace)Turkey (Anatolia)Georgia (bordering on the Black Sea, south of the Caucasus)The Levant (Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Israel)While Georgia does not border on the Mediterranean, Wolfert finds that the cuisine here is very similar to the other three regions she has chosen, which makes sense since Georgia borders on Turkey and probably shares much of the same agriculture as northern Greece.Wolfert shares with Kennedy a love of her subject, which matches or surpasses that of even native writers. Paula gives us practically every aspect of her search of local, authentic recipes from stories about her local contacts through thoughts about how to adapt authentic recipes to American kitchens to reflections on those features which distinguish great cuisines, as she does when discussing pilafs, where she says \\"For me, any cuisine that makes plain starches so beguiling is a cuisine of great sophistication.\\" The accuracy of this statement hits home immediately since I just got finished reviewing a book on Tuscan food which manages to make stale bread, dried beans, and corn mush into interesting food.That this is a great book still requires some qualification to identify the audience for which it is best suited.First, it is an essential volume in the library of cookbook collectors and food scholars. Like Kennedy and unlike David and Roden, Wolfert maintains the touch of the scholar in her writing in citing connections to local sources and native language documents. For the cookbook reader and collector, I also offer the opinion that Ms. Wolfert is an excellent writer, or, she has a really crackerjack crew of editors at Harper Collins to tighten up her prose.Second, it is probably one of the very best cookbooks for natives of this region transplanted to the United States. There are books on the cuisine of Turkey and Greece, but I suspect books on the food of Georgia are pretty uncommon.Third, it is a great book for non-natives who happen to have developed a taste for this food.Fourth, this is a superior source of recipes for vegetarian dishes and for ways of substituting bulgar wheat for rice in various dishes. The book is also a great source of yogurt recipes, including directions on making it at home.Fifth, the book takes special note of recipes, which are suitable as Meze dishes.Sixth, the book gives more coverage to breakfast and lunch and to the food appropriate to Ramadan. When other authors gloss over this last subject, it is like they are ignoring the presence of the 800 pound gorilla in the room.There may be people who will not get their money's worth out of this book. Like Wolfert's most recent book on slow cooking recipes, these recipes are all rather long and clearly benefit from long cooking times. If speed is your thing, go to Rachael Ray or a general cookbook author like Mark Bittman. Both have adapted dishes from Wolfert's canon.For my money, this is easily one of the top ten (10) cookbooks available in English. It's geographic range is eclectic and it may not replace books specializing in Greek or Turkish or Lebanese cuisines, but it's approach to food writing is a great model for others."},{"Title":"The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean : 300 Healthy, Vibrant, and Inspired Recipes","review":"This is one of my very favorite cookbooks. Though the recipes can often be very involved, they are so meticulously written and tested, it is difficult to fail with them. Additionally, as an anthropologist, Paula Wolfert puts the food into its cultural context, and she has done an excellent job of making the book readable and interesting. Because her recipes are always very true to the source, the techniques are often different from the instructions one might get from recipes written by restaurant chefs. These dishes come from homes and therefore can be cooked in homes. Everything I have ever cooked from this book has been not only interesting, but highly memorable. Her recipe for chicken stuffed with rice, lamb, and pine nuts is fantastic. This book is a must for serious home cooks."},{"Title":"The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean : 300 Healthy, Vibrant, and Inspired Recipes","review":"What a wonderful cookbook for the serious cook who is interested in new recipes, other cultures and healthy food with a nice mix of history of a given recipe or dish. Ironically it was a negative review or slam, about the authors many (50) Kibbeh recipes that perked my interest and made me want the book.So when I got the cookbook within a couple days of ordering it I went straight to the kibbeh section and had to smile, because it is so interesting because it reminded me of a favorite Italian cookbook with a lot of recipes for different meat balls, or a cookbook I have that has dozens of different types of hamburger recipes. It's awesome.The book is big and the variety of recipes is vast, with some of my favorites that call for chickpeas, or roasted peppers, fish or chicken. Am a huge fan of pilaf and love her recipes. Love the Macedonian chickpeas, eggplants and tomatoes on page 252, which is easy to make and will make an impression for family and friends."},{"Title":"The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean : 300 Healthy, Vibrant, and Inspired Recipes","review":"I cannot agree with previous reviewer. This is the very best cookbook on this area on the market today. Great recipes and memorable prose. Author makes these cuisines come alive! This book won both the Julia Child and the James Beard awards...and both prizes were well reserved!"},{"Title":"The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean : 300 Healthy, Vibrant, and Inspired Recipes","review":"Wolfert is recognized as one of the true leaders in bringing the cusine of this part of the world to us. Having one of her previous works on couscous and Moroccan food, she is an expert.I have not been able &quot;yet&quot; to cook much from this book, but what I have tried is just unbelievable in its uniqueness: Georgian Chicken Tabaka with Fresh Blackberry Sauce, Pear-Shaped Meatballs Stuffed with Creamy Eggplant and Macedonian Pork Smothered in Leeks.Give this one a try. It's healthy, your family and friends will go wild over the unique smells from your kitchen. This will become for you as it has for me, a &quot;go-to cookbook.&quot;Wolfert's intros it each dish give such an interesting perspective of the culture and usage and her discovery of them. Reminiscent of Bert Greene's wonderful &quot;Kitchen Flavors.&quot;As spice is at the heart of this cuisine, she includes an excellent appendix on them, as well as sources."},{"Title":"The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean : 300 Healthy, Vibrant, and Inspired Recipes","review":"This cookbook does not give the reader/cook a chance to learn the basic techniques and tastes of the cuisine, but concentrates on particular recipes with lists of ingredients so esoteric that even when I was living in the eastern Mediterranean I was unable to prepare them. And because this is such a recipe-particular rather than general taste-and-technique cookbook, it is difficult to be flexible with the recipes in terms of substitution. This is a cookbook for the purist and not for the practical cook."},{"Title":"The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean : 300 Healthy, Vibrant, and Inspired Recipes","review":"The person who bitterly wrote that this book has &quot;millions of kibbeh recipes...&quot; actually did a favor to me. His or her derogatory statement triggered my purchase: I finally found the book I was looking for!!This book made it to the list of winners of Julia Child's Awards, and it is by far the best guide to prepare dishes like Kibbeh or kibbi I have found. Kibbeh is the national dish of Lebanon and a staple of Middle Eastern Cuisine. A really nice treat to all!My kibbehs turned out GREAT for the first time!!! My frustration is over!! The &quot;exotic&quot; spices can be purchased online, just like the book. Not a big deal to me."},{"Title":"The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean : 300 Healthy, Vibrant, and Inspired Recipes","review":"This is the most exciting cookbook I have discovered. It is not only entertaining and inspirational to read but every dish has a depth and intensity of flavour which excites not only my family but every guest who has sampled it. My reputation as a cook has been enhanced and my enthusiasm for trying new recipes regularly is never diminished. The research that has gone into this book and love for the people who have introduced her to their recipes is apparent on every page.Some of the dishes take time to prepare but many can be made in advance and are great for entertaining small or large crowds."},{"Title":"The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean : 300 Healthy, Vibrant, and Inspired Recipes","review":"I adore this cookbook and never tire of reading the recipes and fascinating intros to each. Paula Wolfert does an amazing job a painting a picture of the food--you can almost taste it even before you walk into the kitchen. I found the plethora of kibbeh recipes exciting and it was a real thrill to have them work on my first attempt. Unlike many of the reviewers, I don't find the ingredient lists 'esoteric' (this may simply be b/c I spend way too much time ordering spices from Penzeys and visiting Indian groceries), but I have also had great success when when skipping or substituting ingredients. My all time favorite recipe, and worth the price of the cookbook alone, is the \\"Split Tummies\\" which are softened eggplant stuffed with a lamb/spice /pinenut mixture (I often use turkey) baked over a bed of vegetables. At the height of summer, when the garden is bursting with peppers, tomatoes, greens and eggplant, this cookbook is a joy!"},{"Title":"The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean : 300 Healthy, Vibrant, and Inspired Recipes","review":"This is one of my favorite cookbooks. I received it as a gift years ago from friends in the printing world. The recipes are easy to follow. Ingredients may not be common to westerners, but Wolfert takes the time to explain them, give alternate options to those that are hard to find, and provides sources to find the \\"uncommon\\".I adore the yogurt-herb stuffed grape leaves, the basmati rice and potatoes, the lebanese tomato salad, the walnut stuffed eggplant with pomegranate, and so many others in this book. I've taken samplings from this book to a friend's annual Persian new year party in the past, and everything has disappeared in a flash.Buy this book. You will love it!"},{"Title":"The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean : 300 Healthy, Vibrant, and Inspired Recipes","review":"Ever since I first purchased her cookbook, Couscous and Other Good Food from Morocco, I have been a fan of Paula Wolfert. Her recipes are not always easy, but they always produce great food. Buy the book."},{"Title":"The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean : 300 Healthy, Vibrant, and Inspired Recipes","review":"This book has the ambitious aspiration of describing the kitchens of the eastern Mediterranean. As such it is totally inferior to Roden'sThe New Book of Middle Eastern Food, which has a similar geographical focus. The current book doesn't really provide much of an overview of the region, but jumps into recipes rather quickly. I have tried a couple of recipes and they produce good results and many more recipes seems quite interesting. However, I really dislike it when a book with this level of ambition provide ingredients substitutes. For instance, do they really have mozzarella cheese in Lebanon? (I don't mind mentioning of replacement, but first I would like to learn about the original ingredients). I have still given the book a relatively high three stars because the recipes are not bad, but the book doesn't deserve higher, especially since there are superior alternatives.To get a better overview (but still impressionistic rather than encyclopaedic), I would recommend Malouf's \\"Saha\\" (Lebanon & Syria) and \\"Turquoise\\" (Turkey). The above mentioned book by Roden should be your first stop if you only want to buy one book."},{"Title":"The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean : 300 Healthy, Vibrant, and Inspired Recipes","review":"I wasn't looked for the &#34;Mediterranean Diet&#34;, let me start out by saying that. I wanted solid volume to add to my ethnic collection of cookbooks. This beautiful book does it - I bought a used copy through an Amazon seller, and they were terrific. I became familiar with Macedonian cooking growing up and have since been exposed to others in the region - Turkish, Bulgarian, Serbian, Albanian, etc., - wanted to be able to do some of them myself, and here they are!This is a very satisfying book that should meet both beginner and more advanced needs! Instructions are clear, and there are a lot of drawings and interesting pictures, too!"},{"Title":"The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean : 300 Healthy, Vibrant, and Inspired Recipes","review":"This is exactly what I was looking for. The information and layout of recipes is excellent."},{"Title":"The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean : 300 Healthy, Vibrant, and Inspired Recipes","review":"I truly love this book. I am a mother with two small children, which leaves me with little time for elaborate meals, and I am certainly not a serious cook or very experienced cook, but I have found this book to be very useful. There are a number of recipes that I have used dozens of times, and several more that I use on special occasions when I have more time to cook. There are also many &quot;speciality&quot; recipes that I have not had a chance to try, but it does not limit my enjoyment of this book. I have enjoyed trying new ingredients and replicating some of the dishes I tried while living in the Eastern Mediterranean. I especially appreciated the Georgian recipes since I did not know much about Georgia- and now we have the Georgian cheese bread pie often since my two-year-old loves it. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean : 300 Healthy, Vibrant, and Inspired Recipes","review":"I have made many of the recipes from this book and have enjoyed the results of my efforts. Ms. Wolfert is a recognized expert on the cooking of the region, and as such could have used her status to impart her experiences with the culture as well as the food. One book which does this beyond compare is the book by Sonia Uvezian: A culinary journey through Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan which is now unfortunately unavailable. Kudos to Ms. Wolfert for including sources for hard-to-find ingredients at the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean : 300 Healthy, Vibrant, and Inspired Recipes","review":"An interesting cookbook if you want to learn about the area. But after leafing through it a couple of times, I can't find anything that looks worth cooking : It's focus is on authentic, local cusine rather than recipes that an American cook could make with readily available ingredients. Grab theWilliams-Sonoma Essentials of Mediterranean Cooking: Authentic recipes from Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, The Middle East, North Africaif you want inspiration and a great collection of useful recipes."},{"Title":"The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean : 300 Healthy, Vibrant, and Inspired Recipes","review":"I agree with the Russian reviewer that the ingredientlist sometimes gets too esotoric. I felt the same wayeven though I am very familiar with the region'scooking. The problem had to do with Wolfert'sexclusive attention to the Kurdish cooking, a fireyand spicy way of cooking compared to the regularTurkish or Greek Mediterranean cooking. And what was the reasonfor including a million different kibbeh recipes,all essentially the same spicy meat ball. That wasa waste of time. May I also add that Georgian, andNorth Balkan(Bulgaria, Romania etc) dishes have NO business in a Mediterranean cookbook. True Eastern Mediterranean is Turkish,and Greek cooking, anything else is a wannabe. Yes, you can throw in a few syrian, and north egyptian dishes but can you find calamari in Syria, Kurdish Diyarbakir, Bulgaria, or Romania? I don't think so. Wolfert incorrectly identifies these regions as mediterrenaen when they are anything but."},{"Title":"Internet Law and Business Handbook: A Practical Guide with Disk","review":"The forms needed a lot of tweaking, there were parts that referred incorrectly to other parts.

Every day they begged for me to read it to them, and even tried to convince the substitute to read it to them when I didn't have it in her plans!! I find it totally amazing how a \\"papaw\\" took the stories and lessons he has shared with his grandsons over the years, and wrapped them all into this book, which captures the imagination of children. This \\"papaw\\" really GETS children and shows that through his sense of humor. The book is full of mystery, history, lessons about life, sportsmanship, and family ties. I especially appreciate the lesson called \\"It's Free\\" and the story about the Baby Farm of Rangsit (an orphanage in Thailand). There are riddles to solve in order to discover the location of the diary, which is needed to save Papaw's life. There are ghosts and ghouls and a wizard which create some scary parts. This is a great book for children to read. I think is is perfectly matched to the 8-12 year old age range, but I'm telling you, this 50+ truly enjoyed it, too! Thanks for enriching my classroom, Mr. Shepherd!!"},{"Title":"The Buzz on Golf","review":"This is not a book about learning golf. For that there is Bobby Jones's book. This is not a book about the swing. For that, I love Ben Hogan's book.

The writing is appalling and a wasted opportunity for Bruce (foremostly) and Rick (who keeps mum most of the time) to provide a candid, frank and interesting portrayal of the band and of Paul Weller. Much of the tone is snidely, the authors sort of creep around the subject of Paul Weller in the hope of not directly offending him, but instead serve him up with loads of indirect put-downs and patronising gibberish which in fact, has the effect of making Bruce come across as the [not so bright member] of the band - with all his fretting and tantrums - rather than Paul who comes across, (if you read between the lines) as a hard-working guy who loved his music and seemed to spend much of his waking hours writing songs (and drinking!) Sure, Paul had has faults, who doesn't, but the tone of the book only elucidates Bruce's shortcomings, not Paul's. The toilet paper anecdotes are truly beyond the pale.The worst aspect of this book comes towards the end when, horror of horrors, Paul decides to leave the band. Bruce's subsequent reaction sort of goes to show he probably doesn't possess a great deal upstairs, and it illustrates how far out of touch the band were with each other at that point. They didn't seem to communicate much in 1982, maybe Bruce & Rick were scared of Paul? So Bruce was lost in an island of despair and fretfulness over the closing of band. He does his best to serve up the hackest reviews of the Style Council and tell his readers it wasn't the sort of stuff he was interested in, forgetting that a couple of pages earlier he'd said they (Bruce & Rick) surely could have turned their hand to anything Paul wanted to do. Go figure.This review isn't an anti-Bruce jibe. Bruce I think (going via the sleeve notes of the Jam at the BBC CD release) has realised that things, ie, the Jam ending when they did, was in hindsight the best thing for all of them, and the band. This book could, and should have been a lot better. It's most disappointing that it lacks any real depth, analysis or candidness about Paul and the band and their songs because this would have been the opportunity to provide that. But the book reveals nothing of note about Paul and his artistry and musicality, and all it says about Bruce is that he merely regarded it as a career - no true love of music revealed there, nor does Bruce reveal in himself any true depth of character. A shame, they were a Classic band.Some of the ... boys-in-the-motel anecdotes are amusing but that's where the book tends to level off. As said, it says more about Bruce and his shortcomings than it does about Paul. Big shame that. Anyway, the photos are great."},{"Title":"The Jam: Our Story","review":"The Jam has turned out to be a major influence on me. Rather than hear about the wunderkund who still sells-out halls and makes great music at his leisure, I felt more curious about the rest of the band, who were basically discarded.The book has great anecdotes about the early days, touring, working hard, and coping with the sudden end of the band. There is no bitterness, which was good. There are also great photos (with not so great captions), and some stuff about Paul that I don't believe even Paolo Hewitt knows. I highly recommend this read for any fan of the Jam, and anyone who thinks they know what it's like to be in a successful band...Think again! If they would've made it here in the US, we would all be listening to much better music now...trust me."},{"Title":"The Jam: Our Story","review":"&quot;The Jam - A Beat Concerto&quot; is the authorized bio of the band and a great book in its own right. However, author Paolo Hewitt was (and is) a close confidante of Paul Weller and one always wondered if Messrs Buckler and Foxton were being given completely fair and/or truthful treatment, especially the parts concerning Foxton's actions during the final days.The other 2/3 of the Jam have resolved this problem by issuing this memoir, a mostly terse and factual book. As Weller wrote most tunes and was the political lightining rod, Buckler/Foxton stick to tales of tours, practical jokes, etc. They do address the power struggle that evolved with John Weller, their manager (and Paul's father)."},{"Title":"New Perspectives on Computer Concepts Fourth Edition -- Comprehensive","review":"As a computer instructor, I have seen several intro to computer textbooks, and while this one is pretty good at explaining the material, the order of the presentation of the material is not the most logical. After the initial system basics in chapter one, the book moves right into multimedia, worksheets, databases, etc., then goes back to explaining the computer's architecture, how data storage works, etc. If you're an instructor shopping for a text, you can find better-organized texts relating to this topic. I suggest Peter Norton's intro to computers or Computers in Your Future (QUE E&amp;T Publishing).

Imagine leisurely exploring an entire country on horseback!There are several pictures in brilliant color depicting the diverse people, the spectacular scenery including magnificent snow capped mountains and swift large rivers, and many black and white pictures as well, enabling us to join in the ride.Robin and Louella Hanbury-Tenison explored this magical country on horseback together and vividly describe their adventures, sharing them with readers who love true and exciting accounts. Proceeds from their expedition raised money for charity entitled Riding for the Disabled. They are an English couple with environmental concerns as well. This journey is one of many as they explored other parts of the world in other books.This book also provides insights into the economic and environmental problems in New Zealand. You will learn a great deal of the country's history.Imagine riding horses up high mountain peaks covered with snow and then descending to the hot dry valley floors, seeing native animals up close, talking with shepherds and owners of the huge sheep farms, sleeping in various kinds of weather both outside and sometimes inside primitive huts, grazing horses, basking in lush natural surroundings in what they call \\"the most beautiful country in the world\\"! As you read this highly descriptive book, you can almost smell that sharp fresh air after a rain and see the colorful rainbows, all the while riding in a comfortable saddle on eager healthy horses. The entire country is well described in every way possible.Want to take a journey to a special land on horseback? For a true adventure story you will not forget, read this book and others written by Robin Hanbury-Tenison, an explorer extraordinare!"},{"Title":"The nursery-manual: A complete guide to the multiplication of plants (Rural manuals)","review":"This book is easy to understand. May be a bit old fashion in the wording. But it still gets the information out there for the beginging gardner or for some one with years of exper. Would be a great gift."},{"Title":"Brain-Wise: Studies in Neurophilosophy","review":"The mind/body problem, as understood by philosphers for the last few centuries, has been buried under a mountain of neuroscience. One can of course still tunnel into this mountain if desired and dig further in the mine of armchair argumentation and speculation. But more and more philosophers are abandoning this mine, and employing their unique talents and restless desire to get at the truth, to a view of the mind/brain that is more in tune with empirical research. It is perhaps difficult for the traditional philosopher to make this transition, for they feel perhaps that they are abandoning their commitment to the goals they have set. To these philosophers science is a derived field of knowledge, and has an underlying foundation given by philosophy. To turn against this view would be a sacrilege to many philosophers.The author of this book is one of the best examples of what can happen when a philosopher has made the decision to investigate what neuroscience has to offer for the understanding of the mind/brain. It is packed full of highly interesting insights from someone who has been deeply engaged in research in neuroscience and neurophilosophy. The advances in neuroscience in just the last few years have been breathtaking, particularly in experimental methods. Some of these developments are discussed in the book, along with good arguments that cast further doubts on the ability of philosophical speculation to produce a workable theory of the mind (brain).The need for such a theory of mind (brain) is argued especially well for in the first few chapters of the book. The author emphasizes that merely refuting various materialist views of the mind (brain) will not by itself lead to an understanding of it. The dualists and idealists must put forth a constructive theory of the mind that will assist not only in forming a theory of knowledge and thinking, but also with shedding light on the cause of Alzheimer's and other mental disorders. The author gives as an example of this the ideas of the neuroscientist John Eccles who held that the mind-brain interaction is mediated by a &quot;psychon&quot;, but the properties and dynamics of psychons were never elaborated on.The author bases the book on three hypotheses, namely that mental activity is brain activity and can be studied scientificially; that neuroscience is dependent on cognitive science in order to know what phenomena need to be explained; and that to understand the mind one must understand the brain at all levels of organization. The examples and argumentation/counterargumentation given througout the book bring out these hypotheses especially clearly, and the author expresses a rare intellectual honesty in all of the discussion. This is perhaps because she has chosen to assign weight to both the scientific and philosophical viewpoints, and such a careful consideration will only raise the level of objectivity, and suppress the vitriole or subjective biases that sometimes accompanies discussion of the mind/body problem.One of the most interesting discussions in the book concerns the scientific study of consciousness, in particular the discussion on &quot;Crick's assumption&quot;: there must be brain differences when a stimulus is presented and the subject is aware of it, and a stimulus is presented and the subject is not aware of it. The author discusses a fascinating experiment, dealing with &quot;binocular rivalry&quot;, that allows an experimental study of Crick's assumption. This discussion, among many others in the book, are excellent examples of what is now available experimentally to help settle the mind/brain debate. In another example, the author points to the use of artificial neural networks with recurrent projection to model consciousness-related functions such as attention and sensory perception. She also discusses a clever experiment to test this idea, but cautions that even if back projections are necessary for consciousness, it is known that they are not sufficient. The author then draws up a list of possible experiments that might identify the neural correlates of consciousness, which, even if shown to be not viable, will assist in the fulfilling of the goal of viewing consciousness in terms of mechanisms. In addition, and to emphasize the necessity for a hierarchical &quot;systems level&quot; study of consciousness, rather than merely at the &quot;neuronal level&quot;, she discusses the very interesting work of Antonio Damasio on viewing the capacity of consciousness as the outcome of high-level self-representational capacities. His work, as discussed by the author, emphasizes the role of evolutionary pressures in shaping the nature of human consciousness. Further, the author addresses (nine) of the arguments against a scientific theory of consciousness in terms of brain function put forth by those who advocate dualism. She is not shy about saying that the dualist theories are beginning to appear as an &quot;outdated curiosity&quot;, but she analyzes these nine objections fairly and objectively, and she is clearly open to possible future arguments put together by dualists.The author also discusses some &quot;hardcore&quot; issues in philosophy, such as free will, epistemology, and religion. She addresses some possible reasons why nonempirical epistemology continues to be around, one of these being the rise of modern logic in the twentieth century. The other is the slow progress in the understanding of the human brain. Both of these reasons are interesting because of their importance for research in artificial intelligence. Both formal reasoning and an understanding of how the brain does pattern matching, generalizations, and induction is crucial to the efforts in machine intelligence. Fortunately, the author and others like her, with their formulation of ideas like the ones in this book, will be of enormous assistance to those involved in bringing about the rise of intelligent machines."},{"Title":"Brain-Wise: Studies in Neurophilosophy","review":"Traditional philosophy has had a rough time lately. The wealth of new information on the brain is forcing us to re-think what the mind is and how it works. Churchland offers the most comprehensive and understandable overview of these challenges currently in print. This outstanding panoramic view of &quot;brain science&quot; provides any reader with challenging questions and offers means to derive the answers. These come not from the reader's knowledge of cognitive science, but from the applicaton of logic. Churchland imposes few responses of her own. Fluent in the science and its presentation, she has varied experience in cognitive science. Her earlier book &quot;Neurophilosophy&quot; coined a term indicating where further work is needed and how the results might be applied. This book brings us up to date and enlarges on that earlier study.The book is well organized with a superb Introduction surveying the history of thinking on the mind-body relationship. Brain research, hindered by physical difficulties and traditional thinking, was slower to develop than other sciences, such as astronomy or physics. The fundamental organization of brain structure and mechanics are well described and illustrated. The remaining body of the book discusses the three &quot;big questions&quot; philosophy has dealt with over the millenia: Metaphysics, Epistomology and Religion. Each topic is defined with an historical synopsis. Applications of the brain's reaction to phenomena as applied to the subject fill the remainder of each section. Bibliographies and Internet sites are listed at the end of each section within the topic.The questions she poses are the &quot;deep&quot; ones - pondered and debated for centuries. We call them &quot;deep&quot; because all prior thinking and arguing hasn't resolved them. What, she asks, is the neurobiological basis of consciousness, the self, and free choice? Churchland contends that neurosciences are, at last, bringing answers in view. Her queries aren't limited to classroom debate. She addresses ideas many of us have pondered. Her approach is still novel in the minds of many - she wishes to merge science and philosophy into an integrated discipline. This seems simple, but the task is immense. Tackling it with confidence, she proposes methods for the merger and applies examples.Churchland simply asks, &quot;what is the evidence supporting the notion?&quot;. If there is no buttress available, she urges dismissal of the idea in favour of a new thesis. She teaches us to look for ourselves - what are the pitfalls of blind acceptance? The traps we have fallen into may be filled in with empirical evidence. The result, she stresses, is a sounder footing for our thinking about many issues, moral, psychological and ethical.Classifying this book as a &quot;textbook&quot; may have been appropriate for the earlier edition, clearly this volume goes beyond the realm of academia. Churchland's expressive style makes the issues available to anyone interested in the subjects of belief, behaviour, &quot;free will&quot; and how we deal with them. Churchland has adapted an effective trove of illustrative material to enhance her excellent prose. Ranging from photographs through various graphics, the illustrations provide further explanation of the points she makes. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"},{"Title":"Brain-Wise: Studies in Neurophilosophy","review":"Well, it took more than a decade, but finally those interested in philosophy and neuroscience get an up to date version of Churchlands's NEUROPHILOSOPHY, the groud-breaking and field- creating textbook. Churchland, witht he clarity that characterizes her writings, and the no-nosense naturalistic viewpoint she takes, explains what neuroscience has to say about philosophical problems like consiousness, freewill, the self, theory of knowledge, religion (the fact that some of these problems in fact are now considered neuroscience problems, not philosophical ones, show that neurophilosophy as a field has been succesful, as has been Churchlands approach). But philosophy is still of value, only that its value only exists when it takes science seriously. Just as ancient philosophical problems like the origin of life, the nature of matter, space and time, have become the subjects of independent scientific fields of biology and physics, the mind, and its faculties, is being reduced to the field of neuroscience. There is no reason why this fact should be seen as unexpected or strange or weird. It is as obvious as it can be, and it has brought unprecedented understanding and predictive power, facts that render dualism and its branches an unecessary burden, and a potential setback towards understanding the mind.The chapters are well written, clear and referenced superbly, with notes and suggested readings. The choice of topics is timely, and Churchland does a good job (although understandably she presents mostly theories in accord with her views and what she thinks is really important) of presenting the main theories and keeping them clear even when omitting certain technical details. The philosophical parts are also well argued for, and her position is defended well. I have allways thought the Churchlands to be the most seriously naturalistic and common sensical of all cognitive scientists. Although the chapters will not explain the self, learning, representationalism, or even less, consicousness, they will point the reader towards what seem to be the right paths to be taken towards genuine understanding.This book is simple and reader-friendly, the kind necessary to ilustrate the layman that there is little of philosophy worth arguing for left untouched by scientific advancements. Science is just philosophy that is understood,effective, that explains, and that makes genuine progress. We have a much more complete theory of the mind after 50 years of neuroscience research than we got in thousands of years of philosophical discourse. Neurophilosophy is the branch that aims to ground philosophy of mind in neuroscience research, and this books is the best introduction to it out there. Churchland has done it again, and although much work remains to be done, given that the mind is seen by some as the last standing mystery, the progress made for a moment brings back confidence in our ability to understand these issues...finally.In sum, philosophers, cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, psychologists....anyone that uses the word mind, consicousness, self, thinking....should have this book, and pretty much every intelligent reader should too."},{"Title":"Brain-Wise: Studies in Neurophilosophy","review":"This masterly book summarizes a prodigious amount of research about the workings of the brain. Author Patricia Smith Churchland introduces the basics of neuroscience to the realm of philosophy. She says that present scientific knowledge about the brain makes it implausible that there is any such thing as an immaterial mind or soul. A committed materialist (although she does not make the case for materialism), she puts a mass of incomplete scientific evidence before you and says that more scientific evidence will emerge over the next decade or so to complete the picture and solidify the case. She does not do justice to contrary views, which she introduces as straw men, easily knocked down. That said, we find that Churchland provides a valuable, highly readable discussion of the challenges neuroscience presents to philosophy. She makes it clear that any philosophy of consciousness must be informed by knowledge of the brain."},{"Title":"Brain-Wise: Studies in Neurophilosophy","review":"Philosophical purists will criticize Churchland for refusing to engage the philosophical \\"tradition\\" on its own terms, i.e., she refuses to stick her head in the sand and theorize as if neuroscience and psychology didn't exist. Rather, what Churchland has done is invert this traditional philosphical stance : survey the scientific results on topics philosophers have wanted to claim as their own: consciousness, free will, the self, human knowledge, religion, and the like (each gets a chapter in her book). That is, make a conscious effort to bring empirical results to bear on these thorny problems of human existence. While neuropsychology can't provide decisive answers yet, its data provides new ideas, new constraints, and casts doubt on those doctrines (such as the 'unity of the self') previously taken as sacrosanct by the head-in-the-sand philosophical establishment.Overall, a very clearly written book, with lots of interesting ideas and data. If you want your traditional convoluted philosophical treatise, go somewhere else. If you want to be invigorated with new ideas and data from cutting edge neuroscience, then pick up this book!"},{"Title":"Brain-Wise: Studies in Neurophilosophy","review":"While tough sledding in sections for those without a grounding in biology, this volume weds an overview of philosophy from Aristotle to the moderns, to the latest studies in how the brain and its constituent parts actually \\"work\\", and discusses in clear language the tentative conclusions that can be currently drawn.

Luckily, I was pleased to find that the class and this book contained just the right amount of philosophy. The book raises several philosophical questions, then provides scientific data about the brain and nervous system to either support or disprove classic philosophical thoughts. It helps show that while philosophizing about the mind may have been useful in the past, today's new methods of examining the brain allow us to be much more scientific about the process.This is the first and only textbook I've enjoyed reading."},{"Title":"Brain-Wise: Studies in Neurophilosophy","review":"Brain-wise is, to say the least, a less than impressive effort from a philosopher as prominent in philosophy of mind as Churchland is. A short list of complaints includes:-Churchland collapses the distinction between 'consciousness' in the phenomenal sense ('subjective character of experience') &amp; 'consciousness' in the psychological sense (awareness or self-consciousness)(see Chalmers, 'The Conscious Mind')-most of her conclusions are simply asserted rather than argued, &amp; when she does make arguments they are startlingly simple-minded-the book completely overstates the progress of neuroscience, a field still very much in its infancy. She speaks about neuroscience as if she were in complete awe, which is quite unjustified, &amp; she seems to have a bad case of science-envy-she assumes that all sciences are reducible, which ignores the fact that (as Chomsky argues, although to say he 'argues' this neglects to express the obviousness of his conclusion) we are cognitively limited beings, &amp; that there may simply be aspects of the world that are beyond the reach of our scientific capacities.-she hauls out the tired vitalist analogy-she admits the failure of logical supervenience of the phenomenal on the physical, yet fails to see why this counts against materialism (again, see Chalmers)-the section on religion is just feeble, &amp; includes not one original thought. Most of her 'insights' are along the lines of 'the prospect of [death] ... need not be [unsettling] ... one can live a richly purposeful life of love and work--of family, community, wilderness, music, and so forth--cognizant that it makees sense to make the best of this life'.Anyway, I suppose someone interested in philosophy of mind should read this, if only because Churchland and her husband are such celebrities in the field. But don't expect much. As an introduction to neuroscience, I am not in a position to judge Brain-wise; my hunch is that if you simply want to become informed as to the latest developments in the field, there are more appropriate books out there. As philosophy, the book is depressingly weak."},{"Title":"Brain-Wise: Studies in Neurophilosophy","review":"This book is only one example of the current practice by philosophers of essentially abandoning their craft and worshiping at the altar of science. Philosophy had always tried to go beyond observation of perceived physical reality alone, and deal with questions such as--in the branch of philosophy known as epistemology--how is knowledge of that reality, or of matters like principles of logic and mathematics, acquired.What is pitiful is that the author of the book tries to subsume even these questions under physical science, thus putting the cart before the horse. She tries to find answers to what constitutes consciousness by studying the brain, forgetting that our knowledge of the brain and other physical occurrences depends itself on their manifestation in consciousness. We first have to know how reality is constructed in our minds, before exploring further physical particulars.The author of the book, and she is not the only one to do so, goes as far as attempting to define consciousness in terms of the brain, committing the gross fallacy of equivocation. The fallacy consists in giving a name a new meaning and then trying to prove something about the originally named. But something proved about the newly meant does not thereby apply to what was meant before.A basic endeavor of Professor Churchland is to eventually in some such way equate consciousness with some part of the brain. But although she tirelessly cites and illustrates minute and extensive studies, she fails to indicate what kind of findings so made would establish that identity. In the process, while a number of times branding other authors with circularity--with assuming a fact before proving it--though she does not say where the circularity resides, she indulges in the persistent circularity of arguing for the brain as the self while beforehand assuming that the brain, as the self, learns and so forth, and she names a chapter accordingly (p.321).Circularity, the act of begging the question, is, to be sure, another fallacy, and the book contains additional lapses of logic. Earlier in the book (p.55) its author suggests that if A implies B then not-A implies not-B. This commits the fundamental fallacy of \\"denying the antecedent\\", and the book exhibits other failures in reasoning. Its author, concerning again definition, argues (p.267) that \\"the indivisible\\", which was the original meaning of \\"atom\\", turned out to be divisible. This is of course a glaring contradiction. The word \\"atom\\" was later applied to a physical unit found divisible, but this was merely a redefinition. The book asserts similar nonsense regarding parallel lines. They are in geometry defined as straight lines that never meet, and the book's author claims they meet. She is obviously not only illogical but insufficiently acquainted with geometry, in some of which parallel lines are said not to exist, rather than to, contradictorily, meet. \\"Half knowledge is worse than no knowledge\\", as they say, and a similar warning can apply in general when philosophers dabble in science.By wanting to in the preceding manner downgrade past understandings, the book tries in the main, as do related ones, to forcibly dispense with the presence of consciousness by insistence that it must be material, instead of viewing it, alongside other events connected with matter, as the phenomenon it is, and by which all reality is ascertained."},{"Title":"Fifth Sunday: Stories (Callaloo Fiction Series)","review":"Most readers are more familiar with Rita Dove, the poet.

All indications were that it was failing as a form of government, to be overwhelmed by fascism and communism. This novel represents a dark vision of what lie ahead, where all people have lost their individuality, people are assigned their station in life at an early age and any form of non-conformance was met by death. People refer to themselves as our and to other individuals as their.The main character has the name Equality 7-2521 and although very intelligent, he has been given the task of street sweeper. All aspects of his and everyone else's lives is completely regimented, there is not the slightest room for deviance. As a consequence of this, \\"progress\\" is very slow; candles were discovered and approved for widespread use fifty years earlier.Yet, there are signs that things were once much different, Equality 7-2521 and his co-workers discover a subway tunnel and other remnants of a more advanced age. They steal away and begin learning about scientific and technological marvels. They eventually are able to build a simple electric light, but when they show it to the leaders, they are imprisoned and sentenced to death.Equality 7-2521 flees into the uninhabited forest and with his female companion Liberty 5-3000 they find an abandoned house and take up residence. There are books in the house and Equality 7-2521 soon learns that the two forbidden sacred words are \\"I\\" and \\"ego.\\" The story ends on a high note with the female pregnant and Equality 7-2521 planning to re-introduce technology and individuality back into society.Given the seeming relative power of fascism and communism compared to the democratic states in the late 1930's it is easy to see why Rand would write such a pessimistic story. Fortunately, democracy is more resilient that her fears, yet this book is still an excellent reminder how fragile and precious individual liberty is."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Selling: Increase Your Sales Faster and Easier Than You Ever Thought Possible","review":"brian tracy's my hero. period. although note that if you actually have a *GOOD* product (like apple's ipod, or ibm's thinkpad) you're probably not gonna need all the numerous techniques to \\"GET\\" the sale. tracy's basically focused on how to get a \\"yes\\" out of people when they're really wanting to give a \\"no\\" (because you're product doesn't sell itself.) which of'course is important, but is more targetted towards the rougher side of sales: like car sales or telemarketting, or just plain influencing people."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Selling: Increase Your Sales Faster and Easier Than You Ever Thought Possible","review":"You love this book!

The author places an emphasis on improving self-esteem, and encourages salespeople to set personal goals in life to improve their problem solving in general.When the author tackles the subject of why people buy a particular product, most of his points are marketing 101, but he effectively breaks down two major motivations that many sales books don't. He delves further into the psychology of buying with a point-by-point list of basic customer needs, and how you can appeal to them. The book carefully explains how all purchases are ultimately made for an emotional reason, and that consumers simply find ways to justify their purchase with logic only after the sale. One technique I found particularly useful was how to ask a question that would help you determine a customer's \\"Hot Button\\" and use it to encourage a purchase.While some of the techniques dealing with face-to-face meetings aren't addressed in other sales books, there are many tips that seem to be Sales 101. Granted somes salespeople may not maintain eye contact with clients, give firm handshakes, or focus on personal grooming, but some of his advice seems to be fairly common knowledge. That in particular is the only reason why I gave the book four stars instead of five, but the book in otherwise should on the shelf of anyone involved in advertising as well as sales."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Selling: Increase Your Sales Faster and Easier Than You Ever Thought Possible","review":"This is one of the best sales books I have put my hands and eyes on.

Usually when a new Brian Tracy book or audio program comes out, I invariably buy it.Such was the case with The Psychology of Selling. This book is 8 chapters and 219 pages. It is a condensed version of his tape program which came out in the 1980's and sold over a million copies.I have given this book a three instead of a five because I feel that this book is not as deep as Advanced Selling Strategies which Tracy wrote nearly 10 years go. This book, The Psychology of Selling falls somewhere inbetween Advanced Selling Strategies and Be A Sales Superstar, another book written by Tracy back in 2002. My personal favorite Tracy book on sales is Advanced Selling Strategies.This book should not be confused with the great audio tape program of the same name. That program has far more depth and material than this book.Nonetheless, The Psychology Of Selling is good reading for a new sales person or for a Tracy fan like myself who merely wants a quick synopsis of some of Tracy's best selling ideas. This book is like an printed abridged version of Tracy's audio program.I read the whole book in one night. What I got out of it was a reminder of Tracy's best ideas and perhaps a few things that I had forgotten. In that regard, it was a worthwhile investment.Good book, but being familiar with Tracy, I feel he could have included more meat."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Selling: Increase Your Sales Faster and Easier Than You Ever Thought Possible","review":"A good book on developing your sales technique. Worth a read, but be warned that at least 50% of the content is 'old news' that you probably have already read in other sales books.However, the OTHER 50% is worth reading, and will help you master the little nuances of the sales and closing interview.A lot of emphasis on the 'behind-the-scenes' aspects of the science of selling - from where the title."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Selling: Increase Your Sales Faster and Easier Than You Ever Thought Possible","review":"I have to admit, that when it comes to sales training, my personal favorite is Tom Hopkins with Brian Tracy right behind. Why listen to both? Because I have always believed that you should get training from various qualified sources. Another one of my favorite trainers is James E. Rohn. Mr. Rohn advises to get advice from as many people as possible. When it comes to selling, I am looking for maximum effectiveness. Tracy and Hopkins have walked the walk, have both set sales records along with being great trainers.Tracy is more into the consultative approach although he uses some of the tried and proven closing techniques that sales professionals use. What impressed me about Tracy is that he speaks from experience having been selling since he was ten years old. He has taught more than 500,000 students in over 500companies. Like Tom Hopkins, he has walked the walk, talks the talk and is one great trainer as well.Using the combined advice of Tom Hopkins and Brian Tracy I was able to reach my monthly goal at my last job in only three days.The first time I used these techniques I moved from next to last place out of 71 sales reps to 3rd out of 75 reps in only one month. This stuff works.Right now I am using Brian's strategies in my network marketing company. They work very well.That said, being familiar with Tracy in particular his tape series The Psychology of Selling, I was expecting much more in this book than what is offered. By contrast, Advanced Selling strategies which Tracy wrote over ten years ago was a huge book, packed with information and had more than enough meat.Nonethless, The Psychology of Selling is a good book, a great primer for new sales people and a great refresher for experienced sales people as well.

But I was pretty disappointed because it takes the fun out of playing and is a slow, dull lesson one after the other. It might be all right for some, but I already knew tab that I taught myself. The whole book confused me and I became bored really fast. When I taught myself,a long time ago, I went right to my favorite parts of any music and took it from there. That made it fun and easy to learn. I could have never learned this way. This is just my personal story. For many , this book may be just what you're looking for. If you're a beginner, you can learn with it, but don't expect to be wailing away like a guitar god. You'll get it, but this book just takes a while. I'm pretty sure that this book is the way to go if you want the rote memorization that goes with the old fashioned way (that is the proven way).

It began as a dream to spread the love of reading, and knowledge out of the hands of the largely church-bound scribe copyiests. It would be interesting to know what he would have thought of the current state of book production, with the dawn of the internet and ebooks. I think he would be stunned at where we are now, and the sheer number of books available out there.The story also covers some of the difficulties he had in buisiness and development of his grand idea. The idea was not widely accepted by the Church, even though he dream was to spread the word of God to more people than old methods of copying by hand. &quot;God dwells in the hands of the scribes. God does not inhabit a machine&quot;, was the view of many Church officials. Gutenberg also proved himself to be a cany business man, weedleing investors of funds to further his vision, until he himself becomes unstuck.Written from the point of view of an older Gutenberg dicating his memoirs to a youthful scribe, this is an interesting look at the man who start the great book revolution, for which many of us bibliophiles give thanks."},{"Title":"Burnout Revenge (Prima Official Game Guide)","review":"This is a good guide.

He develops an argument that early Christian interpretations of Christ rested on seeing Jesus as a man who through his suffering became equal to God. This hopeful view allowed the exploited peasant classes who were dominated by the Pharisees, the Roman occupation and the Herodians to have some hope for the future given the projected immanent triumphant return promised in the gospels and in the teaching of Paul. As time passed and persons outside of the Jews homeland became adherents, the views of Christ changed and Christ was seen as created at the same time as God and equal to God. Fromm interprets this change as a way of substituting for the emperor worship common at the time and yet supporting the state. Religion becomes more spiritual with emphasis on the guilt of the individual that can only be alleviated by the agents of the church. Christianity changes from a revolutionary movement to a movement supporting the political system by the time of Constantine. This view of Christianity should be compared to Rodney Stark's, THE RISE OF CHRISTIANITY which offers a dramatically different interpretation of the same historical period."},{"Title":"The Dogma of Christ","review":"the first part with opinions about religion is veryinteresting, al lovable as his best works, thesecond part about catholicism might beinteresting for those interested in religiousstudies."},{"Title":"The Dogma of Christ","review":"Though the bookseller was in England, the book arrived on time and in fine condition.

There are very practical sections--planning our final years and our preferences for our care, and reminding us of how to reduce the trauma for our next of kin. There are uplifting and challenging sections that ask us to consider being a contributor to our society, in a way we could not do when we were in previous stages of responsibility.I would consider this book one of the most helpful books for anyone facing their 50th or 60th birthday.This book is written with a faith perspective, but addresses issues comfortably that need to be recognized by everyone in our secular society."},{"Title":"From Age-ing to Sage-ing: A Profound New Vision of Growing Older","review":"As we move from \\"age-ing,\\" there is an elegant way we may further embody who we are, where we've come from and what we've learned along the way to be of service to our world and those we love.

Using their concepts of &quot;elderhood&quot; and &quot;the art of life completion,&quot; Schacter-Shalomi and Miller survey the societal changes that they believe are synchronistic events that give meaning and purpose to the burgeoning population of elders in American society and other developed countries. An increasing number of writers share these men's belief that the aged are needed to guide humanity in its values, to influence the young to make the changes that consider the distant future as well as the present. Rabbi Schacter-Shalomi has spent his adult life studying numerous spiritual disciplines. He believes that the present easy access to ancient spiritual teachings that were once passed secretly from one generation of adepts to the next is for the purpose of allowing large populations to prepare themselves for their contribution to humanity as wise elders. The major theme of this work could be said to be the art of lving and dying with meaning. Going beyond the usual observations of the characteristics of our rapidly aging population, Schacter-Shalomi and Miller have offered sound advice on how an individual can find purpose in life beyond reproduction and career. They even offer specific &quot;Exercises for Sages in Training.&quot;"},{"Title":"From Age-ing to Sage-ing: A Profound New Vision of Growing Older","review":"Age-ing to Sage-ing is indeed a profound new vision for aging. In a time when our elder population is rapidly growing, it is important that people find meaning in their elder years. Rabbi Schacter-Shalomi has used his own journey as a stepping off point to assist people in making the most of the extra gift of years they have been given in this century. I highly recommend this book because it not only provides theory about becoming a spiritual elder, but also talks about tools for this and gives exercises for this in an appendix. Rabbi Schacter-Shalomi has an incredible grasp of a wide range of religious beliefs and a very wholistic view of spirituality. His message has provided inspiration for myself as well as mnay people I work with.

Which is utterly crazy, given that most people nowadays are barely half way through their lives at that point. It's like wanting to leave the restaurant somewhere in the middle of the main course and without tasting the dessert at all.I liked this book because it is one of the few to look deeply into the whole adventure of aging and to broadcast to the world that the later decades of life have a different - and surprisingly wonderful - agenda all of their own. It is time for us older folk to stop cringing about getting older but to open to the process and re-own our place as 'wise elders.' As I was writing my own book - ELDERWOMAN - which is specifically for women, this wise man's book was a marvellous resource for me. It is a full, rich book, worth reading and re-reading. The exercises are useful and practical and the ideas are powerful. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"From Age-ing to Sage-ing: A Profound New Vision of Growing Older","review":"My attraction to the first named author, Zalman Schachter-Shalomi was due to his reputation as a cabalist, the Jewish practice of mysticsm. When I bought and first read this book, in 1995, I was a mere 48 years old, much too young to put its sage advice into practice. This book is for the retired, and even then is not for everyone. When I lent it to my retired friend in California with whom I swap jokes on the internet, her comment was &quot;Although it was a difficult read, bogged down in places, and I didn't like how it was written, it did say a lot of important things and was worth reading&quot; 3-4 stars would't you say?In any event, the authors discuss the &quot;theory of spiritual eldering.&quot; There are several paths one may take in eldering. First, however, the authors confront the &quot;conscious transit of death.&quot; In part three of the book the authors discuss &quot;Spirual Eldering and Social Transformation.&quot; This section includes mentoring and elders as healers of family, community, and Gaia-the living Earth.Finally, an appendix is provided which includes exercises for sages in training.If you are retired or facing retirement and are at a loss for how to lead a productive life in your 'golden years' your time would be well spent in looking this book over."},{"Title":"From Age-ing to Sage-ing: A Profound New Vision of Growing Older","review":"My own spiritual journey was faltering when I met Reb Zalman and bought this book.

Its the sheep skin with some Latin on it that makes them more knowledgeable than our own elders.And Chapter 9 Elders as Healers of Family, Community and Gaia.

This book is intended for advanced ColdFusion use as the title states. If you're new to CF, buy WACK... it's an extremely thorough step by step guide and will also turn into an excellent reference tool. If you're just looking for a CF desk reference/companion, get O'Reilly's \\"Programming ColdFusion MX\\" (which doesn't really teach you too well, but is much better than WACK for just flipping to a page and finding what you want). Bear in mind that as of 05/17/2005 O'Reilly doesn't \\"have any plans currently for a new edition of that book\\" (quote from an e-mail I received from O'Reilly)... so get WACK7 if you really must have something on CF7's new features.The only thing preventing me from giving the book 5 stars is the fact that much of the content in this book is identical to what was available in the previous edition. However, the new CF7 content is invaluable and the book does contain an abundant wealth of new and useful information.If you're an advanced ColdFusion user (use CFCs, Custom Tags, UDFs, use clustering, want to further secure your CF app., integrate your app with C++/Java/.NET (no C#),etc. in your applications), you need this book."},{"Title":"Advanced Macromedia ColdFusion MX 7 Application Development","review":"This is a great book, but you should go to Mr. Forta's site to see all the corrections that have been made.Otherwise, this book is great like all the rest of his books."},{"Title":"Advanced Macromedia ColdFusion MX 7 Application Development","review":"Written by programmers for programmers, Ben Forta's sequel to his prior Macromedia Coldfusion Mx 7 Web Application Construction Kit provides a weighty and thorough instruction on all of ColdFusion's advanced features.

And, it was written in an interesting and readable manner.The competition and sport of the races themselves give a great basis for an exciting read.If you are doing a research project (like I was) this was the only book I would recommend - or, at least the first book. I could not find a book anywhere that showed the 1960 Rome Olympic course. Martin and Gynn had it. In fact, their race course map was better than the map a friend obtained for me from the Italian Olympic Library (Federazione Italiana Di Ateletica Leggera)."},{"Title":"The Olympic Marathon","review":"The authors, Martin and Gynn, have put together an unbelieveably detailed review of every Olympic Marathon in the modern era. The detail provided brings the excitement of each successive Marathon alive. The Olympic Marathon is, perhaps, the most grueling Olympic event, and the comprehensive coverage of each race makes the reader feel as if it's taking place before their very eyes. Read this book and you'll get a sense of the drama of the event, the personal history of the runners, and the historical setting of each race. The authors have even reconstructed old Olympic documents to trace the paths each Olympic Marathon took. The information in this book is truly encyclopedic, and the authors have given us with a wonderful sense of what this race is about. This book is a gem."},{"Title":"The Olympic Marathon","review":"Well done decent capsules on the Olympic Marathons up through the year 2000. The book contains very good descriptions of the contenders and the races as they unfold. Also contains a great collection of pictures such as Ron Clarke, who ran the 5K and 10K (medaled), leading the Tokyo marathon, finishing 9th. Beside the descriptions of the runners, the author includes the top finishers splits so you can see how they parried over the miles, includes a list of the top 10 finishers and the post race career of the gold medalist. The women of course join in 1984 when their first Olympic marathon comes into play. The stories, list of splits and finishers is just a great reference and the race descriptions are pleasant to read. One picture is so fitting and reminiscent of the seemingly bronze place finisher at the 2008 Olympics slipping to fourth in total helplessness on the last lap; there is an early picture of the leader of a race on the track running in the second lane on a curve while being passed on the inside by one and then a second runner, relegating the leader to bronze on that last lap and he appears, like the Ethiopian in 2008, to be defenseless."},{"Title":"The Olympic Marathon","review":"I have known David and Roger since the 70's and have other books by them. They love running foot races and it shows. You can count that this will be the best researched and well written book. I was not disappointed. I dug in and read the book over a couple of weeks. If it is not in this book then it is an unproved rumor."},{"Title":"You're Smarter Than You Think: How to Develop Your Practical Intelligence for Success in Living","review":"Some good ideas on how to fashion your thinking into more productive and constructive ways.The fundamental underlying belief Epstein writes in the conclusion is that enlightened self-interest will lead us to the recognition that we live in one world and that the welfare of each of us is tied to the welfare of all. This leads us to the fact that we are emotional beings and should be aware of those things that make us feel good or bad about ourselves. He furthers the idea that love feels better than hate and it is to our advantage that we generate this emotion in the world.Two Types of Constructive Thinking:Emotional Coping:1) Know which things you can do something about and which you can't. And if you can't don't waste time and energy with worry. Be Self-accepting.2) Don't let little things bother you. Be resilient. Don't over estimate a things importance.3) Consider yourself a worthwhile person regardless of your performance.4) Dwell on positive events, not negative ones5) Don't take things personally.6) The ability to deal with failure, disapproval and with negative emotions generally.7) Not to over-react or over-generalize.8) Avoidance of black/white, categorical thinking and labeling9) Avoidance of the tryanny of the \\"should\\".Behavioral Coping1) Be proactive rather than just imagining and or complaining2) If you have an unpleasant tasks create a way to make the best of it.3) Look at challenges as a opportunity, a way to stretch and grow rather than as threats.4) Think encouraging thoughts to get you through the hard times5) Think through carefully how to deal with unpleasant tasks.6) Be independent able to act and trusts on ones own decisions.7) Take reasonable, realistic risks.8) Maintains a sense of purpose9) Reaches out to help others and willing to accept help.Human Beings have 4 basic needs to be balanced:1) to obtain pleasure and avoid painHelpful belief: The world is a good and trusting place to be2) to make sense out of your experienceHelpful belief: the world is predictable, controllable and meaningful that is faith in the universe.I try to understand what is happening to me so that I can act with determination.3) have satisfying relationships with othersHelpful Belief: That people are for the most part, supporting, accepting, and trustworthy.4) think well of yourselfThat I am adequate and worthy of respect and love.Epstein states that the basic goal of therapy is to remove sensitivies and compulsions.Some points are:1) They develop from generalizations from past experiences.2) They vary in their serverity3) They become more intense in stressful situations.4) Reflect faulty categorical thinking, all or nothing, .Applying Constructive Thinking in the Workplace1) Maintain a problem solving attitude.Focus on solving problems--getting things done. Make sure of clear communication and what is expected of them.2) Be a flexable thinker. Know that there is a time and place for different sort of thinking.3) Pay close attention to inter-personal relationships at work.4) Take advantage of serendipity. Believe that things will turn out reasonably well.An optimistic outlook, a belief that one is in control of events, to tendency to interpret events as challenges rather than threats and commitment to long term goals.Work on creating fewer stress events in ones life. Interpret events in less stressful ways,Work on understanding and being aware of your intrepretations of events that trigger your sensitivities and compulsions. Identify the situations that you are touchy about. First is our construals, then secondary mentals processes and then behavioral decisions. It is possible to change your intrepretations to be more constructive. Epstein claims it is not willpower but the experiental mind that must change. Be wary of being negative and destructive about your own non-constructive thinking. It is a catch-22.Some destructive behavior is:1) Attacking: taking action to injure someone physically or psychologically.2) Uncontrolled emotional expression3) Overcontrolled emotional expression4) Self Punishment5) Excessive dependence6) Excessive Independence7) Withdrawal"},{"Title":"Locating Lost Family Members & Friends : Modern Genealogical Research Techniques for Locating the People of Your Past and Present","review":"I was skeptical about persuing a search, and very ignorant about where to start, and how to find what I needed to know, the &quot;Locating Lost family and Friends: Modern Geneological Tequniques for locating people of your Past and Present&quot;, gave me an insite and where to start.

The way the lyrics are is however, making it impossible for me to decipher the words to about 5 songs.

That's not to say that the first novel is bad - indeed, it supplies a great story with impressive character development, and I highly recommend it. But /Outlaw/ was marred by an unbelievable number of editing errors. /Heretic/ fares a good deal better.This time around, the story flows much more smoothly. /Outlaw/ had to struggle with setting the stage for this massive world that is, quite frankly, very unfamiliar to most Westerners - and rather foreign to the world of Magic in particular. /Heretic/ has none of this background baggage to deal with, instead plunging right in and letting the now-fully developed characters shine. There's a lot of action in this book, and a good deal of the pieces of the Kamigawa puzzle come together solidly. /Heretic/ is a very fast and enjoyable read.Of course, I still have to nitpick - /Heretic/ has more editing errors than a novel should. It's nowhere near as bad as /Outlaw/ was in this regard, but the errors do pop up enough that it can be a bit disturbing. But /Heretic/ is very worthy of a full 5 stars, and I will say that this is one of the best fantasy novels I've read in some time (due in no small part to the fabulous setting of Kamigawa itself). If you haven't gotten into this cycle yet, grab this book and /Outlaw/ and prepare for a great reading experience."},{"Title":"Heretic: Betrayers of Kamigawa: Kamigawa Cycle, Book II","review":"I managed to read this book on the bus ride to a state basketball game. McGough is a great writer that can carry the reader along from chapter to chapter, making me not want to put down the book. The content also gave me the answers to questions I had from Champions of Kamigawa. At first I was on Konda and his people's side, but now I am neutral as both sides (kami and humans) have issues. Toshi has become one of my most favorite characters, next to Ixidor and Glissa, from Magic novels. I anxiously await the third novel of this set."},{"Title":"Heretic: Betrayers of Kamigawa: Kamigawa Cycle, Book II","review":"The 2nd book of the Kamigawa cycle reveals more explanation of what Konda had really done to piss off the spirits. The lead characters are still Toshi and the princess. Toshi has grown more powerful since he \\"found religion\\" in the form of the Night Myojin. Like the first book, his power is more subtle and not the kind of world-wrecking power of Kamahl in Onslaught cycle.The heroes try to remedy what Konda has done, and in the process they met with the wizards and the soratami. The big bad spirit (O-Kagachi) appears and start wrecking havoc. Familiar characters in the first book also make appearances, like Konda, Godo, Kiku, Marrow-Gnawer and the Ogre (can't remember his name). Some new characters get couple of lines of mention, like Uyo. The white and blue dragons in the cards also appear in this book, but again their powers in the book does not tie with the card powers. For example, Keiga the Blue dragon is supposed to gain control of target creature when it dies. In the book it does nothing of that sort. Likewise Yosei the Morning Star did not show any extra special powers.If you play the card game, you will find that strangely enough, there was no mention of the Ninjas that featured so prominently in the cards for this 'block'. Likewise some famous characters like Ink-Eyes, Kentaro, or Higure never got any mentions in this book.This is one of the better written Magic the Gathering novels that I've read. Like the first book, Betrayers is a good and fast-paced read. If you like the first book, get this one too!"},{"Title":"Heretic: Betrayers of Kamigawa: Kamigawa Cycle, Book II","review":"Heretic: Betrayers of Kamigawa (Kamigawa Cycle: Book 2)By: Scott McGoughIn this the second book of the Kamigawa Cycle, we find our characters with some questions answered and with new views of the world around them. Princess Michiko now knows the cause of the Kami War and what her connection is to it and Toshi has finally found something to believe in and embrace.This part of the story takes place a few months after Michiko was \\"rescued\\" from Toshi and finds both her and her sensei Pearl-Ear locked away in imprisonment. Pearl-Ear is blamed for Michiko running away and not returning her in a prompt fashion. Toshi is a changed man, he has become a more spiritual person but still a member of the Hyozan Reckoners. Hidetsugu, the ogre is still in a rage over the loss of his apprentice and decides to wage war on Choryu's academy, at the soratami, and the Kami they worship.The final battle for Kamigawa has begun and the most evil presence in all of the spirit realm has shown itself in the area surrounding Eiganjo and the tower in which Konda resides. The evil spirit looks to gain what was taken from him over 20 years ago and will destroy anyone and everything in its path. But what remains to be seen is where Toshi stands in all of this. Is he really trying to help save Kamigawa, or is he just working towards his own goals?This book is awesome, no way I can score it less than a 10/10 (of 5 stars however you want to look at it). I just could not put this book down, I think I'm more entranced with it than the Mirrodin Cycle and that was one wicked awesome cycle of books. And as usual, try to work around the editing problems. Even with the problems, it's a very good read and very well written in my opinion."},{"Title":"Heretic: Betrayers of Kamigawa: Kamigawa Cycle, Book II","review":"Again, we begin with a extremely lucky and overwhelmingly overpowered protagonist who just got a whole lot more powerful. Which wouldn't be so bad, if he didn't abuse his abilities so much. Using, I think up to only 2 abilities, he managed to confront and beat every single encounter in the book. Its like the author came up with this trick and suddenly became aware that it can be applied to everything. While Umezawa's behaviour of abusing his two most powerful ability may be taken as the very human \\"don't knock it if it works\\" attitude, it makes for boring read.While the story is amazing overall, Toshi and his reckoners buddies could do with some real challenge once in a while. One begins to wonder why they're still criminals hiding around if they seem to have enough collective power to kick everyone's ass.All in all, a good story but somewhat lacking in substance a little. It seems a little too plain now that sides are drawn out and the endearing rogue thief Toshi in the first book is now superman with kryptonite immunity."},{"Title":"Heretic: Betrayers of Kamigawa: Kamigawa Cycle, Book II","review":"Few novels have keept me in the \\"shadows\\" like this one, the reason is it's main caracter Toshi Umezawa, a dishonor samurai that keeps a hidden agenda even to those \\"close\\" to him (he's not really attach to anyone but himself), he lives in the swamps and is accidentaly involved in a battle between beeings from the spirit world, a Princess and her escourts and a power mad Daymio.The book is loaded with rich caracters that give the writer the oportunity to share their tougths with you and show you the domain of Kamigawa trough their eyes.Remember that this is a fantasy book so be on the look out for some dragon action and a very nasty ogre.Heretic is the second part of a trilogy, so don't expect an \\"ending\\" right away.

The first is Talks to Teachers and the second Talks to Students. The talks to teachers are more technical, but they too are in clear, understandable prose. The Talks to Teachers open with a chapter on 'Psychology and the Art of Teaching'. There are also chapters on 'The Stream of Consciousness' ' The Child as a Behaving Organism' ' Education and Behavior' 'The Necessity of Reactions' ' Native Reactions and Acquired Reactions' 'What the Native Reactions are' 'The Laws of Habit' ' The Association of Ideas' ' Interest' 'Attention' 'Memory' ' The Acquistion of Ideas' 'Aperception' 'The Will'. The Talks to Students consists in three essays, 'The Gospel of Relaxation' 'On a Certain Blindness in Human Beings' 'What Makes a Life Significant'.In the first and most scientifically important section I especially took pleasure in the essay on 'Habit' James shows how our habits lead us to action in ways we do not know. And he shows how by putting on auto- pilot of habits many activities we free our minds for new creative efforts in everyday life.Perhaps the most well - known essay is 'On a Certain Blindness in Human Beings' where James teaches the inherent difficulty we have in understanding others perspectives and needs. Always the pluralist, the fox who sees many things, James strongly advocates our greater openness to others, our tolerance for their perspectives and actions as long as they do not damage ours. \\" Now the blindness of human beings is the blindness which we all are afflicted in regard to the feelings of creatures and people different from ourselves.\\"He asks of us a generosity in understanding.He illustrates his thesis by many quotations from literary works, including Tolstoy , whose 'War and Peace' he calls the greatest of all novels, and 'Crossing Brooklyn Ferry' of Whitman.The final essay is \\"What Makes a Life Significant\\" He opens this essay by telling of an incident from his own personal experience in which he spent an enjoyable week at Chattaqua a kind of paradise of reasonable successful rational secure American life. He later reflects however on what he felt missing in it. And this leads him to thoughts about the heroic struggle of life and why our lives seem to need some element of danger and adventure .\\" But what our human emotions seem to require is the sight of the struggle going on.The moment the fruits are being merely eaten, things become ignorble. Sweat and effort, human nature strained to the uttermost and on the rack, yet getting through alive, and then turning its back on success to pursue another more rare and arduous still- this is the sort of thing the presence of which inspires us, and the reality of which seems to be the function of all the higher forms of literature and fine art to bring home to us and suggest.\\"For James the meaning of life is bound up with our action in the heroism of the everyday life struggle. \\"It is the 'exercise of courage patience and kindness' which James sees as most important in giving life meaning.He also speaks in this regard of our acting in 'obedience to a higher ideal' As he understands it Education is a means of mulitplying and enhancing our ideals and thus enriching our lives. \\" And let the orientalists and pessimists say what they will ,thing of deepest- significance in life does seem to be its charactr of progress, or that strange union of reality with ideal novelty which it continues from one moment to another in present\\".James thus provides in his teaching- a philosophy of action for better enabling us to realize our life- goals."},{"Title":"Talks to teachers on psychology: And to students on some of life's ideals","review":"Although the century old language is a bit difficult to read initially, once you get rolling, it isn't difficult. The neatest thing is how amazingly applicable James' observations are in today's society. The book is fun and interesting to read. I learned a great deal."},{"Title":"Talks to teachers on psychology: And to students on some of life's ideals","review":"Beginning in 1891, William James gave frequent lectures to teachers in which he explained the psychology he had developed in his \\"Principles of Psychology\\" and offered suggestions on applying the science of psychology to the art of education. Similarly, beginning in 1895, James delivered a series of lectures to college students -- generally at schools for women -- on education and its purposes. In 1899, James gathered both sets of lectures together and published them as \\"Talks to Teachers on Psychology and to Students on Some of Life's Ideals.\\" The book was read widely and became financially successful for James.In his illuminating recent biography of James, \\"William James in the Maelstrom of American Modernism\\", Robert Richardson describes the \\"Talks\\" as a whole as \\"written in what we may call William James's third style.\\" He explains: \\"The third style is his plainest, clearest, most public style. It is at once vivid, personal, comprehensible, and without a shred of condescension. It is best exemplified in 'Talks to Teachers'. The longer James worked over a subject, the simpler and shorter and more direct he made it\\". (p. 360)The two sets of lectures are complementary with the first set explaining to teachers how psychology could be of use in the educational process while the second set explains to the students the value of the educational opportunities presented to them. The \\"Talks to Teachers\\" begins with what many people at the time saw as a mechanistic psychology rooted in physiology and developed in light of Darwin's theory of evolution. In many places, James encourages teachers to see a pupil in part as \\"a subtle little piece of of machinery.\\" An effective means of education endeavors to work with rather than against the nervous system. In successive short chapters, James discusses his fundamental theory of the \\"stream of consciousness\\" and applies it to learned behavior through exploration of reactions, habits, association, attention and memory. The lectures are lucid and clear and show both flexibility and wisdom in considering the process of education.James's focus throughout is on education as an activity fitting the student for the conduct of life in a wide variety of situations rather than as means of learning intellectual abstractions. James stresses the importance of the body and of physical activity in the learning process. His psychology begins with science and mechanism but it does not end there. I would like to point out two of what I found to be among the insightful observations of the \\"Talks to Teachers.\\" First, in the chapter on \\"Memory\\", James points out that the psychological abilities of the mind must be taken together in an individual and that a person need not be \\"cast down\\" by deficiencies in any single element. James stresses passion and desire as critical in overcoming any mechanical difficulties. He writes: \\"You can be an artist without visual images, a reader without eyes, a mass of erudition with a bad elementary memory. In almost any subject your passion for the subject will save you. If you only care enough for a result you will almost certainly attain it.\\"The other passage in the \\"Talks to Teachers\\" I wish to single out is in the concluding chapter on \\"The Will\\". Here James allows Spinoza to have the last word. James points out that there are two ways in which people can make choices: by saying \\"no\\" to something or by saying \\"yes\\" to its contrary. James opts for the latter approach. James writes: \\"Spinoza long ago wrote in his Ethics that anything that a man can avoid under the notion that it is bad he may also avoid under the notion that something else is good. He who habitually acts sub specie mali, under the negative notion, the notion of the bad, is called a slave by Spinoza. To him who acts habitually under the notion of good he gives the name of freeman. See to it now, I beg you, that you make freement of your pupils by habituating them to act, whenever possible, under the notion of a good\\". This is wise advice, from both Spinoza and William James.The second part of the book consists of three wonderful addresses to students: \\"The Gospel of Relaxation\\", the seminal essay \\"On a Certain Blindness in Human Beings\\" and its companion essay \\"What Makes a Life Significant.\\" The first essay is a still timely corrective to the tendency of many Americans to stress and to wrongly-directed effort. But second and third of these essays are critical to James's work in its entirety. The \\"blindness\\" to which James refers is the difficulty every person has in knowing the mind of another and in properly and sympathetically valuing what the other person finds important and significant in life. As James states in his Preface to \\"Talks to Teachers\\": \\"The facts and worths of life need many cognizers to take them in. There is no point of view absolutely public and universal.\\" James develops this theme through the use of literary examples drawn from Robert Louis Stevenson, Whitman, Tolstoy, and many other writers.In the Preface to the \\"Talks to Teachers and Students\\" James also underscores the importance of the essay \\"On a Certain Blindness\\". This essay is James's most direct statement of the value of pluralism, individualism, and democracy. He writes: \\"The practical consequence of such a philosophy is the well-known democratic respect for the sacredness of individuality -- is, at any rate, the outward tolerance of whatever is not itself intolerant. ... Religiously and philosophically, our ancient national doctrine of live and let live may prove to have a far deeper meaning than our people now seem to imagine it it to possess.\\"This short and beautifully written collection of essays is an excellent non-technical introduction to the thought of William James.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Talks to teachers on psychology: And to students on some of life's ideals","review":"My father always had this book at arm's reach.It was a pocket version.I can still see the tip of its well worn appearance comfortably peeking out of his tweed coat side pocket.Even as a kid it really peaked my curiosity,as at that point I had never read a book,'a real book',just the hardy brothers,and all that kid stuff we all recall as children.It appeared to be one of his best friends,and that in itself fascinated me.I considered my father even when I was very young to be a friend,in my mind,'father'was just a moniker.I never mentioned it to him for years.I finally mustered up the courage to ask what this book was.He said \\"guides to living\\".Yes \\"this little book\\" is my best advisor and tutor.\\"It has comforted me on many an occasion\\"Years later when I adopted an avid love for books,I read these wonderful essays.I go back time and time again,seeking advise from it's pages for a variety of reasons.These essays by William James originally published in 1917 remain as fresh and applicable to modern life as if they were written last year.James,the father of Psychology pours his heart out to you in these essays.My favourites are THE GOSPEL OF RELAXATION- THE ENERGIES OF MAN-ON A CERTAIN BLINDNES IN HUMAN BEINGS-HABIT an THE WILL.This book always travels with me.I hope you have a chance to read it sometime.Here is a little taste.This is an excerpt from THE WILL\\"Our strength and our intellegence,our wealth,and even our good luck,are things which warm our heart,and make us feel ourselves a match for life.But deeper than all such things,and able to suffice onto without them is the sense of the amount of effort we can put forth...\\""},{"Title":"Talks to teachers on psychology: And to students on some of life's ideals","review":"Amazing how insightful James was, and his ideas are.

Then the book was an assigned text for all students in English in New Zealand. The language and the concepts were then frankly beyond the comprehension of 15 year olds. As I grew older, I became aware of the position Kipling held in the Late Victorian era, and the period following the end of the First World War.I came to understand a little of what the British Empire meant in those times, and the great debt owed by the world to the British Army which subdued Iraq, Pakistan, and the Indian Continent for almost 200 years.Without the benefit of the bomb, with a tiny armed service, and a desire to provide fair and equitable government, the Raj governed fearlessly through the efforts of the thirds sons of many of the great English Families, while the fourth sons provided the humanity of the Church. Patterns we could well emulate again today!This was bread and butter to Kipling. In his early years as a huge supporter of the system, as a spiritualist after the death of his son in the First World War, and in his later years as the designer of the huge Military Cemetaries established in France and Belgium after the War to the Empire's dead, he truly became in his own words a \\"Builder of the Silent Cities\\".In 2006, the concepts of his writings are remote from many. In terms of the trials of people, and their attempts to rise over their circumstances through a sense of duty and moral propriety, Kipling's works are without peer. For those starting out to discover him, start with \\"Stalky and Company\\", and move to this book, and his other works as extended learning. I hope you come to love his simple characters as I have, and that your School System, and its weird sense of Boyhood Literature does not destroy the desire to read Kipling until your late 60'sThis book has brought great joy to someone in the prime of life, and brings back some important memories of Scouts, Church and Honour in a time when these are so sadly lacking."},{"Title":"Plain Tales from the Hills","review":"My copy has 36 stories, but Kipling's Plain Tales tells about life in British-occupied India from every imaginable angle. It's touching, it's funny, and at times it's unbelievably sad. Don't let the author put you off, this is a highly readable book. My personal favorites are &quot;Thrown Away&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Pale&quot;, but be careful; they're sad."},{"Title":"Plain Tales from the Hills","review":"Rudyard Kipling writes concisely and with great insight on a wide range of issues. With each story only taking up a few pages the depth of characterisation is superb. 'The gate of one-hundred sorrows' is one of the finest short stories ever written."},{"Title":"Plain Tales from the Hills","review":"Here we have a compendium of forty-two brief (3-8 pages each) tales of Colonial life, and originally targeted for those already familiar with an existence in India. Most of these charming stories were originally published in the Lahore \\"Civil and Military Gazette\\" (1888) but Kipling subsequently revised the tales (1890, as \\"Plain Tales from the Hills\\"), injecting them with more of the details and flavours of India so that the folks back in England could cognitively read of the Empire in the East.Featured are highlights of the lives of the British soldiers in late 19th-Century (Colonial) India as well as those of their wives, lovers, Indian associates, and even their horses. Kipling punctuates levity and outrageous behavior with sorrow and humility. He knew quite truly that one cannot cast shadows without light.Kipling's writings are much akin to tales scribed by eastern European and Middle-Eastern Arab and Persian authors: ergo, he told each of his stories as the details entered his head with an eye to the journey rather than to the destination. Here you will find an odd mesh of the subtle wit of Anatole France (A Mummer's Tale / The Red Lily (The Irresistible Stories of Anatole France series, Vol. 6)) meshed with a Dostoyevsky-ish slant on man's dark side (The Brothers Karamazov.) These encounters are all quite savory and gratifying to the avid reader of classic literature.Various critics have remarked on Kipling's insensitivity toward foreign cultures but, given that he wrote these tales more than 100 years ago, I see this commentary as a revisionist posture -- Kipling's views on ethnicity were shared by most of the English peoples of his era.I should also mention that the insightful and informative introduction written in the Penguin softcover edition by David Trotter prepares one to great advantage in digesting Kipling.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Plain Tales from the Hills","review":"The stories are wonderful. I've read a decent amount of Kipling and am always pleased to find more of them. This particular collection contains a bunch of really charming tales that range from funny through tragic. These types of short stories remind me why I love Kipling so much. As with all Kipling, it's worth noting that he was a product of his time and some of his writing could be considered offensive to the modern reader.This particular Kindle version is quite good with proper formatting and few if any typos. My only complaint (and only reason that this lacks a full 5 stars) is the lack of hyper-links in the Table of Contents. This makes it very difficult to jump to specific short stories."},{"Title":"Plain Tales from the Hills","review":"I usually like Kipling, but couldn't get through this book. The stories I read were all about the vain and foolish goings-on of the British in colonial India, told with a more voyeuristic than satirical tone. Sort of like watching a trashy soap-opera set during the Raj. I've read many fine novels about colonial society (e.g. The Siege of Krishnapur, The Long Day Wanes) and found the depictions of stubborn provincial habits and cultural ignorance to be interesting, outrageous, and often amusing, but in Plain Tales from the Hills they just seem pathetic."},{"Title":"Plain Tales from the Hills","review":"Too many people, when reviewing Kipling, review what the they assume to be the man, not his work. It is fashionable to think of Kipling as a nasty imperialist bigot, and all then flows from that opinion. In the end, such exercises, while occasionally entertaining, are pointless.Kipling was an extremely gifted writer who contributed a great deal to the art of the short story and part of the joy of \\"Plain Tales from the Hills\\" is that we get to see him developing. In many ways, his work here is fresher than his later efforts and while less well formed, on the whole I personally prefer them.Kipling writes with a incisive grace not often met with anymore; his descriptions are economical, immediate, and gripping. His ability to forcefully convey a complex impression with a single, often understated, sentence is unmatched. Unlike so many modern authors - and especially those in what now passes for \\"literature\\" - Kipling's prose does not get in the way of the what he is trying to show us. He never labors to be \\"literary,\\" which is quite refreshing.His insights into the human condition are well worth reflecting on today and cover the full range from light humor to irony to deep pathos: \\"The Gate of the Hundred Sorrows\\" is a masterpiece. The world Kipling portrays in one in which people were not yet alienated from each other or their environment; it is a world without the comfortable cocoon that those who snipe at him today generally inhabit, and for some that is problematic, since Kipling does such a good job of presenting that world with it's complexities, contradictions, and \\"unthinkable\\" things that were then, taken mostly for granted.I highly recommend anyone interested in Kipling start here before moving on to his later work (although I also recommend reading these stories in conjunction with his \\"War Stories and Poems\\" which also includes some earlier work).As for why I give this collection four stars and not five, that's only because I think \\"Kim\\" is markedly better and deserves five stars, which inevitably takes \\"Plain Tales from the Hills\\" down a notch."},{"Title":"Plain Tales from the Hills","review":"I don't agree with the racist aspects of the book. However, when one considers the era in which the book was written, such views were commonplace and give us insight into colonial India."},{"Title":"Plain Tales from the Hills","review":"I believe Kipling was wildly popular in his day. This collection of stories about English life in India may have entranced the masses and sold a lot of newspapers in the first decade of the 20th century, but in the context of almost exactly a hundred years later, they have lost most of their shine. While Kipling might have been the foremost raconteur of British India, compared to great short story writers like Chekhov, de Maupassant, or Twain, he comes across today as coy and contrived. Certain phrases make their appearance in far too many of the tales, for example: \\"Once there was a....but that's another story.\\" Cute kids, the wisdom of animals, the wiles of the fair sex, the unfathomable nature of \\"natives\\", gruff officers, perfect ladies, the one-dimensional earthiness of the common soldier---these are stories filled with stereotypes. Kipling's stories may hold your interest for a short time and you can wonder at the change in taste that has occurred between 1907, when he published these, and today. In many tales, Kipling depicts the lifestyle among the higher echelons of the British Raj, but only through a veil of irony or humor. A regular topic is the struggle for social status among the British; efforts to short circuit the pecking order and reversals suffered thereby. People marrying \\"beneath them\\" or trying to marry \\"above them\\" are often found here. Though people still refer to Kipling as \\"a writer about India\\", it is still true that he wrote about his compatriots, not about India. The two or three tales with Indian characters who are anything other than servants lack any depth. Even the pathos-filled \\"Story of Muhammad Din\\", which shows understanding, ultimately deals with illness as something inevitable in India---there are no questions as to why death comes to small children so frequently. Overall, Kipling provides a certain local color to British literature of the late 19th and early 20th century, but cannot be regarded as a great British writer on the level of Maugham, Conrad, Lawrence, Forster or Greene because he lacks broader humanity, deep thought, and universal vision."},{"Title":"Plain Tales from the Hills","review":"A fine collection of extremely well-crafted stories.But these pages are crammed with racism, with remarks on the worthlessness of a native indian's life, their stupidity and their weakness.One of the stories starts with \\"we are a high-caste and enlightened race\\", any man who shows interest in the ways of life of the natives is ridiculed over pages and the only remark on the death of a native child is: \\"They have no stamina, these brats.\\"Well written, but disgusting."},{"Title":"The Reading Woman: A Book of Postcards","review":"\\"The images in this lovely book of postcards capture the tranquil sanctuary and sublime beauty of women deeply immersed in the pages of a book.

But on the whole they they are interesting portraits of scholars who were among the most inspiring to scholars of the second half of the Twentieth Century.

They are handicapped by a theoretical stance which dismisses the biochemistry and physiology of boys, thus the book is full of politically-correct references to the 'social constructs of gender'. Perceptive readers of this book will come away with a much better understanding of why our education system fails most boys and it is not for the explanations given by Carr and Pauwels."},{"Title":"It Takes Two.Com: A Psychological & Spiritual Guide to Finding Love on the Internet Personals","review":"I admit I agreed to review this book with at least a tad of trepidation, not only because I'm now barely entering the second half of the 20th Century as far as technology, but also because I've always secretly nurtured a philosophical resistance to any form of human interaction that smacked of science fiction. For me this category included cloning, telepathic sex, and computer dating.So for two weeks I pretended not to notice this manuscript to which I'd committed myself, lying there among my gardening books on the bedside table. But finally I bit the bullet and opened to the Table of Contents. I became immediately, astoundingly engaged. Those clever chapter titles! &quot;Oedipus Seeks Older Woman,&quot; for starters. Wow. This was not your typical book about love on the Internet. I tell you it was a page turner -- a finely researched, entertaining and convincing argument in favor of computer dating.The authors are themselves persuasive examples of the validity of the much maligned phenomenon of cyberlove, having met through the Internet personals when Kenneth was living in San Francisco and Beverly in Tennessee. As if the glow of their personal relationship is not testimony enough (they could be the happiest couple I've met), their book includes perceptive recollections from other intelligent folks who found their own soulmates in cyberspace.It includes interviews with owners of reputable online dating services, offers advice on how to choose an appropriate matchmaking service, and provides tips on writing effective personal profiles. The book outlines precautions taken by dating services to protect the privacy of their clients, and guidelines to attracting sincere people.But it's not as simplistic or one-sided as that. The pitfalls are investigated and unsuccessful attempts examined. Participants describe their first-hand experiences with online dating. The characters are familiar and human, with all the usual flaws and fears we recognize (embracingly or otherwise) as our own. It's a page turner, I tell you. It's drama."},{"Title":"It Takes Two.Com: A Psychological & Spiritual Guide to Finding Love on the Internet Personals","review":"When I was searching for a book of information about online dating, I bought four books from Amazon. Three of these were silly and superficial in their approach. IT TAKES TWO.COM was strikingly different. Not only do the authors have the first-hand experience of meeting online themselves, but also in helping people resolve relationship problems. What I really enjoyed about this book were the many specific examples and directions for how to be successful online, and how to learn more about yourself in the process. Through accounts from people who have lost as well as won online, the authors explain ways to protect yourself as well as avoid hurting others on the way to finding a partner. IT TAKES TWO.COM was a very meaningful book to me personally, and I'm sure it will help many people in their online search."},{"Title":"It Takes Two.Com: A Psychological & Spiritual Guide to Finding Love on the Internet Personals","review":"It Takes Two.Com should certainly be a prerequisite for anyone placing or responding to an ad on an Internet personals site. The many stories shared by people who have used the personals demonstrate how we must know and love ourselves--our games, our illusions, our fears, our desires, our dreams--so that we may more fully experience genuine love with another. These stories validate that there are unseen forces ever present guiding us, and that LOVE is really all there is, even when brought and given to us via the Internet. Sharing the strength and hope from first-hand accounts is a very powerful learning tool for those willing to have an open mind and heart. The authors' descriptions and explanations of what composes the essence of a person, how our persona/archetypes are lived out in our lives, and how these then come to dictate who we meet when it becomes our written ad or email is right on! Even the stories of fantasy, constant courtship, married and flirting, and disappointment can teach us. For the reader who is willing, the catalyst is there to help see how our superficial actions are not conducive to an intimate, trusting, accepting, committed relationship--if that is what we truly desire. Of course, to have faith and be open to accept and recognize our destiny when it meets us face to face is also required."},{"Title":"It Takes Two.Com: A Psychological & Spiritual Guide to Finding Love on the Internet Personals","review":"The authors are both psychotherapists who came together via the Internet. Their online love story is transcendent, inspirational, and, yes, even magical. The Appels' book is most noteworthy for its emphasis on the powerful aura of spirituality which is evident when soulmates connect. There's no way to predict it. If there were a way to manufacture it, I'm sure it would sell better than Viagra. In 1979, psychologist Dorothy Tennov coined a term by calling this attraction limerence. In her book, Love and Limerance: The Experience of Being in Love, she speaks of this soul-to-soul connection and how it can enter one's life. Suddenly a stranger is known. Not only does the Appels' work reflect this wonderful state, but it permeates their romance and that of the couples who were also blessed in discovering their spiritual partners online. It Takes Two.Com is a book about spirituality, persistence, hope, faith, and the uniquely human need to be loved. Thanks to reading their book I am better able to recognize when a person I am corresponding with online is sincere about wanting an enduring relationship; able to identify those who are simply looking for someone to play a role in their fantasies; and how to spot those who prey on the unwary. I was one of a 1000 research volunteers who participated in the Appels' study prior to the release of their book. Although I have yet to meet my soulmate, I believe it will happen. And thanks to Beverly and Kenneth, I'll know and see him before I meet him."},{"Title":"It Takes Two.Com: A Psychological & Spiritual Guide to Finding Love on the Internet Personals","review":"The Appels have written a fascinating book about love and human contact on the Internet personals. This is not about the flirtations of the chat rooms. This is about a serious presentation of self in which a person says this is who I am, this is what I stand for, this is the way I lead my life, this is my passion and spirituality, and this is what I want from another human being. Unlike the usual ways of meeting a person-at church, on the job, through friends--these presentations of self on the Internet reach across time and space like a beacon. The Appels are both serious psychotherapists and their guidance is gentle and accumulative, and, from the first page on, deeply optimistic. They have made contact with over 1000 people who have used the Internet personals, and they recount their stories on virtually every page. This is, in a very real sense, a book of love stories. I was astonished by the wisdom of this book. I love the human speech contained in it. The Appels believe that in time millions of people will use the Internet personals and meet their beloved in this fashion. This notion astonished me."},{"Title":"Seasons of Grace","review":"If one wants a devotional book that is compassionate, pastoral, and biblical then one must not pass up on this one. Unfortunately, this book is not widely known among Christians (hence, the reason why it is \\"a hidden gem\\"). Though it may not be as well-exposed as other Christian living books written by well-known evangelicals like John Piper, John MacArthur, or Dallas Willard this book cannot be ignored. The book is written according to the four seasons and each section is geared towards how a particular season speaks to us spiritually. For instance, under the Winter season, Shepherd talks about the pain in the wilderness in our spiritual journey. Though geared towards individual matters, Shepherd does not neglect social and corporate issues that face Christians and the church. This is refreshing since many modern evangelicals have individualized the faith to the point where cosmic or social matters are put to the sidelines. However, redemption is also cosmic and corporate as Paul makes it clear in Romans 8:18-21. Shepherd rightly ties the believer's individual spiritual progress with his or her responsibility to the world. One will find this work comforting and challenging. Comforting in that it tells us that God is a faithful God when we are in the wilderness of despair. Challenging in that we are told to wake up from our spiritual stupor to serve the Almighty God. Another positive aspect of this book is its readability. Shepherd writes in an enthusiastic and sometimes humourous way that makes this book a treat to read. It is not dry and technical like most other devotional books but lively and uplifting. I highly recommend this book to all Christians who want to deepen their walk with Christ."},{"Title":"Problems in Elementary Physics (Mir Publications, 1971)","review":"I bought this Book in India in 1980.

He tries to find that kernel of truth, if there is one, using historical, sociological, psychological, and even physiological evidence. The result is enlightening, provocative, but sensitive as well.

Do I have the same strength as Gloria?... How can I prepare myself for the same or similiar events?... Lenhart's story is so well written, I had to frequently remind myself that this was her story, an account of her experience and not fiction. At the risk of sounding cliche, I cried and I laughed throughout the book as I made connections with my own life and Gloria's life experiences. I highly reccommend this work. Of course it is necessary reading for someone going through a loss, but also anyone in a marriage, relationship or for that fact a blended family.

Prevented?","review":"The author, Irving Walmann, was drawn into the study of &quot;mental illness&quot; by an occurrence in his own family.Understandable motivation.This book demonstrates his own intelligence and his determination, as well as his facility with words. However, his conclusions are shadowed by his admitted lack of formal education and credentials to write knowledgably on such an abstruse subject.Those who have such qualifications and credentials usually publish their insights in peer reviewed journals, and write in such technical jargon that their thoughts are indecipherable by laymen, which is exactly the way they want it.Mr. Walmann has done a masterful job of explaining his thought processes, but the thoughtful reader is unavoidably disturbed by the realization that other, more qualified people who have the necessary skills and knowledge in chemistry, bacteriology and biology and who have spent their lives seeking answers, must have thought of the same things. What were their answers?His first words in the Prologue, I must admit, caught my immediate attention: &quot;When one gets to the later years of life, as I find myself, one may sometimes stop to wonder about life itself. For me, the most amazing part of life is my awareness of my existence. Scientists study and think mightily about how living things may have come about on earth, but I consider it a much greater miracle that we know that we exist.&quot;Amen!His answers may be correct. I hope that they are, and that others pursue his hypotheses.My criticism of the book does not primarily involve its content, in any case. My harshest criticism goes to the publisher for the lack of editing and the lousy typography. The cover is professionally rendered.This is a very small book, only 164 pages including the Index, Glossary, and References. There can be no excuse for not doing a better job of editing it. The text jumps between 12 point and 10 point type without rhyme or reason. Instead of the occasional use of italics for emphasis, it uses bold face, underlining, and all caps. Every other phrase, it seems, is parenthetical, and within the parentheses the type is a different size. Altogether, the effect is disconcerting. It is as if the author himself, without any training in the graphic arts, had set his own type. The illustrations are similarly amateurish, and detract from the quality of the book. No doubt the author drew them, too.Which is the same criticism I have of a layman trying to write a book on the medical arts. One must sympathize with his motivation, but not necessarily accept his conclusions.Having a disease is one way to learn a great deal about it, but having had an appendectomy, no matter how interested you are in the procedure, does not qualify you to remove another's appendix.And yet, despite all of the problems delineated above, it is a good book. It encourages people to think more about a great, heart-rending problem that destroys families, costs society billions of dollars, and ruins untold lives.Joseph H Pierre"},{"Title":"Mental Illness : Can it be cured? Prevented?","review":"The second edition of this little book, sent to me by the publisher as a result of my former review (below), does not seem significantly different than the first. It is still a good little book, with much valuable information.Unfortunately, as far as I am concerned, the faults remain pretty much the same, and are of an esthetic nature. Although the main type is very readable, for no discernable reason the type within the parentheses is of a smaller size--a disconcerting 'design' element--and there remain altogether too many parenthetical statements and too many instances of the use of bold face type for emphasis. Standard practice is to use italics.The only problem is that it makes the publisher look amateurish, and the book harder to concentrate on because of the deviation from standard practice. Yet, the book itself is a valuable contribution. It deals with subject matter that is of nearly universal interest--since most families are impacted by mental illness in some way--and the author writes about it convincingly, and from what appears to be a knowledgeable perspective.I have one reservation: the author is writing about abstruse scientific matters, and yet he admittedly lacks the formal education in those areas that would seem to be a necessity. In other words, how can you trust his conclusions? Does he have all of the facts? Is he capable of dealing with context when he makes an assessment?I do not wish him ill, but those are my qualms when I read the following statement, &quot;if serotonin inhibits the making of cerebrospinal fluid, a shortage of serotonin might be a causative factor in hydrocephalis--water on the brain.&quot;When I go to a doctor and ask a question like, &quot;When I have hay fever, and come into contact with a powerful allergen, is there a cumulative effect?&quot; It seems logical to me that there would be, but the doctor knows better, and says &quot;I doubt it.&quot; That is the kind of fine judgment that special medical education supplies.So, get the book, but--be careful about accepting all of the author's conclusions.

Most Korean dictionaries don't have terms or the proper phrases for such things as \\"maintain contact with the enemy\\", \\"POW Camp\\", or \\"Self Propelled Artillery\\". I've also heard this book was issued to U.S. Department of Defense Korean Linguists at the Defense Language Institute in Monterrey, California.The author is U.S. Army Captain Young C. Kim, who also authored 8 other books on Korea and Korean War history. The Forward is by General Bruce C. Clarke, who commanded the U.S. Army I Corps in the Korean War. He highly recommends this book as a means to joint understanding of terms between U.S. and Republic of Korea (ROK) forces.The book is divided into two sections. The first section is Korean-English in Hangul (Korean alphabet) alphabetical order. The second half of the book is in Engligh-Korean format. The edge is tabbed (like some other dictionaries) with darkened edges to make finding the right letter faster.

The main point is that the Bank (the book would definitely capitalize it) has been there for all of America's history and will continue to be so. The bank never did anything wrong. It weathered all the bank crises of the 19th century and the Great Depression. Whether this is true, I couldn't say, but it is put together in an easy-reading sort of package.The section on colonial New York is pretty evocative. That gives the best sense of place in the book. New York is seen as nearly the same as America itself, although events like the Civil War, in which NYC was sympathetic to the South due to the cotton trade, impinge upon it. There are some rather non-PC sections, like on the Spanish-American War. Still, as a short and easy read on the history of NYC, it's not bad. Also, the printing is nicely done on beautiful thick paper with copious illustrations. The aesthetic is definitely Mad Men."},{"Title":"My Loco Life","review":"I enjoyed the thuth and reality of this story. It talks about the foster system and what happens to kids as they grow up. I enjoyed Alicia's personality and drive to never give. I do wish the story was a little longer, it didn't seem to really touch on a lot of the issues that Brianna had. What were the reasons why she had such a hard life? I hope there is a story about her adventure in Madrid."},{"Title":"My Loco Life","review":"Teen Alicia Jimenez likes her latest foster parents and enjoys her new high school especially since the school offers her a design class. She hopes that her talent will enable her to win a scholarship to attend design school in Spain.However, Alicia accepts that besides having to win a competition, she has one minor problem. She has not spoken Spanish since her family abandoned her years ago. She turns to the hunk next door Hector Cardona to tutor her in speaking Spanish though she would not mind instruction in biology too. However, he is dating the school queen, her rival in the fashion design contest. Alicia sets her mind at winning the competition for the scholarship and for Hector.In her third \\"My Life\\" novel (see MY ALTERNATE LIFE and MY ABNORMAL LIFE), Lee McClain provides a warm insightful teen tale that young adults will enjoy because they will understand and commiserate with Alicia. While Hector is a caring hunk, Alicia owns the tale as she sets goals for herself that she strives to achieve. For a change, the foster parents are nice, kind people and not out of a psycho ward. This is a fine entry in a wonderful series.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"My Loco Life","review":"Alicia Jiminez is sick of people assuming that she's your regular, run-of-the-mill Latina, simply because she has olive colored skin, and dark eyes and hair. She's especially sick of her new classmates at Linden High speaking to her in Spanish. After all, she may be Latina, but she doesn't know a word of the language, but to save face must pretend to understand what people are saying to her - even though it sounds like nothing more than gibberish. But Alicia has more important things to worry about than a foreign language. Numero uno on her list? Designing a one-of-a-kind hot and sexy dress in an attempt to win a scholarship to the fashion institute of Madrid - a place that will help her escape the foster system that she has been a part of for years. Second on her to-do list? Track down her hot neighbor and enlist him to help Alicia learn the language of love - Spanish - with a little help from his sisters many issues of Spanish COSMO. And last, but not least, Alicia must avoid pushy parents - or, rather, foster parents - whiny girlfriends, and a ridiculous computer game, otherwise her dreams will be dashed forever, and she'll be stuck in the same place for the rest of eternity. It may sound like an easy idea, but for Alicia, it's sure to be difficult and tricky - all rolled into one.Lee McClain is, without a doubt, one of the new controversial writers for young adults on the market today, based on the fact that she touches on issues that many writers ignore - the foster system, adoption, and various other serious issues. MY LOCO LIFE is no exception to this trend. Alicia is a brazen, interesting character, who refuses to be pushed around, and plans on making her way to the top - no matter what she has to do to get there. Her quirky personality, accompanied by her to-die-for fashion sense make her an appealing character, and will leave teen readers clamoring for McClain's next novel.

The text is filled with photographs of submarine wreckage and rescue efforts, dramatic paintings of submarines at sea, and diagrams showing how sumarines work. Especially interesting is a detailed recreation of the CSS Hunley's pyrrhic victory against the hapless USS Housatonic during the American Civil War, together with some interesting speculation about why the Hunley sank after its successful attack.The book's main weakness is that it surveys a big field that has been thoroughly covered in other works. If you enjoy digging into the details, this book may disappoint you. But if you like your maritime narratives to be accompanied by dramatic and often moving photographs and paintings, &quot;Lost Subs&quot; will be a very enjoyable adventure.If you would like to explore the subject in more detail, try:Peter Hutchhausen, &quot;Hostile Waters&quot; (a near catstrophe when a Soviet boomer experiences a missile tube failure);Brayton Harris &quot;The Navy Times Book of Submarines: A Political, Social and Military History&quot; (everything you always wanted to know about the history of submarines, from the 1620s on)Edwin Gray, &quot;Few Survived: A History of Submarine Disasters&quot; (the title says it all)John Craven, &quot;The Silent War: The Cold War Battle Beneath the Sea&quot;Sontag &amp; Drew, &quot;Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage&quot; (hard to put down)Hicks &amp; Kropf, &quot;Raising the Hunley: The Remarkable History and Recovery of the Lost Confederate Submarine&quot;"},{"Title":"Lost Subs","review":"Lost Subs isn't heavy-duty history by anyone's standards. Skimming lightly over material covered more completely in scholarly books, Lost Subs allows its pictures to do the heavy lifting, and what a wise choice that is! Lavishly illustrated, Lost Subs covers wrecked boats of every era, and provides limited, but relevent background on each era along with discussion of the individual wrecks. Drawings, paintings, and photos bring to ghostly life boats both famous and obscure.To this former submariner, this book feels more like a tour of historic graveyards, complete with color commentary on the 'lives, times, and families' of the deceased boats, than it does academic 'History.' All submariners fear ending their lives on the bottom of the sea, though we don't discuss it much. This book shows another side to such an fate, in the remembrance of those who come after. These boats, these gravestones in the deep, punctuate and anchor that remembrance.If you want scholarly depth, or stirring stories of war, go elsewhere. If you want to remember the lost or reflect on the fate of the men who trusted their lives to the deep, then Lost Subs is the book for you."},{"Title":"Lost Subs","review":"This book commences with a foreword by Dr Bob Ballard and contains examples of the artwork by Ken Marschall found within some of Ballard's own books. With such credentials, I began reading the work with great expectations. Overall, it is a good read and some readers will probably learn something they did not previously know. The question is whether or not we can trust what is written!What is lacking is the correct detail of the subject in hand. In short, this author seeks to get away with a peripheral overview of some of the world's greatest submarine stories. It is only when the reader comes across a specific subject he knows well (in my case, the loss of HMS Royal Oak in 1939) that we find far too many errors. Prien never claimed to have sunk HMS Repulse. It is a well-established fact he never mentioned the Repulse at any time - not even in his log. During his first attack on the Royal Oak, Prien aimed one torpedo to pass in front of the Battleship's bows to strike another vessel moored in the far distance. That torpedo, however, struck the Royal Oak's anchor chains and exploded. When he mounted his second attack, therefore, Prien was genuinely under the impression he had sunk that distant vessel - which he had not identified.On his return to Germany, it was the Goebbels and the Nazi propaganda machine that put a name to that other ship and publicly announced Prien had sunk both the Royal Oak and the Repulse. This was because the Repulse had been photographed moored in Scapa Flow a few days before Prien's attack and was missing from the post-attack photographs. What the German high command did not know, however, was that HMS Repulse had sailed for Rosyth for a refit where she arrived at 0946 hrs on the day Prien entered Scapa Flow. That ship in the distance, incidentally, was HMS Pegasus.On the up side, the artwork, photographs and readability all score well. On the down side, my problem is that perennial complaint about accuracy of information. If the details pertaining to the attack on HMS Royal Oak are incorrect (and there are more errors!), then it is difficult to trust anything written elsewhere. Quite frankly, this book might just as well be categorised under \\"fiction.\\" Altogether, I was left with the indelible impression this author seeks to include the names of more established (and more reliable) authors alongside his own in a bid to give false credibility to his own work.NM"},{"Title":"Lost Subs","review":"From the Civil War submarine Hunley through the 2000 sinking of the Russian submarine Kursk, this 176-page medium format book has eight chapters about the loss and subsequent discovery or recovery of several famous American, Russian German, Japanese, British, Australian and Israeli submarines. By far the best feature of the book is the large quantity of well-reproduced paintings and photographs. There are terrific paintings depicting nighttime images of the CSS Hunley stalking the USS Housatonic in Charleston Harbor in 1864 and dramatic paintings of German U-Boats stalking their prey in the stormy WWI-WWII Atlantic. The most unique and haunting images are underwater photographs of sea growth-encrusted submarines taken on research and archeological expeditions around the world. There is a small bibliography, list of relevant websites and source for each reproduced painting or photo.I recommend this book. While not providing full details on any of these famous incidents (virtually all the submarines are the topic of at least one full book and numerous articles) this book is a good overview for anyone interested in naval and submarine history. It makes a photographic/painting supplement for the more demanding submarine researcher or buff."},{"Title":"Lost Subs","review":"I'm a fan of WWII Naval history, and I bought a copy of this book at a reduced price--about 10 bucks. I'm glad I paid no more than that. Some of the pictures are compelling, but overall, the book is a very cursory look at a pretty sizeable topic. It might make for a good coffee table book, but there aren't enough pictures. It's certainly not a detailed history--more information on any of the sinkings listed can easily be found on any of a dozen general websites. The war in the Pacific gets half as many pages as the sinking of the Kursk? There seems to be a lack of effort/research on the author's part toward anything comprehensive, or to really put together a definitive pictoral history. What you get is a smattering of both, which is, after reading this from cover to cover in less than an hour and a half, unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Lost Subs","review":"Being a former submariner I have enjoyed the pictures and stories of submarines and their crews.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hobbes, Locke, and Confusion's Masterpiece: An Examination of Seventeenth-Century Political Philosophy","review":"Harrison does a great job of putting Hobbes and Locke into comparative perspective.

The nine were quickly tried and found guilty. Before the death penalty could be administered, appeals were filed with the aid of the US Communist Party. Thence ensued a lengthy series of trials and appeals that lasted from 1931 until well into the forties. It was a legal battle between White and Black as well as North and South with the battlefield always under the control of the White Southerners. Today it is an incident lergely forgotten by succeeding generations. Yet it is an excellent example of the the state of race relations in the South (not that there are too many surprises there), the role of moderate judges in reconciling racial injustice, the influence of the Communist/Socialist Parties in the 1930's as well as a number of other splinter stories. Therein lies the excellence of this book.The author attempts to relate the story of the \\"Scottsboro Boys\\" through various perspectives without really indicating a particular bias. As the story goes on these perspectives seem to roll into one but even that one perspective takes a middle road approach to the story. For example, we are told of all the difficulties that the main characters suffer while imprisoned. Simultaneously we are made to understand that these same characters have serious flaws of their own.The book follows the story of all the principals from their entry into the story until their death. There were few successes to come out of this event and the author lets us see the failures of the \\"Scottsboro Boys\\" as they each eventually realized their freedom.This is an extremely readable work of non-fiction. It may seem occasionally that the story is stuck at one particular point but it generally moves along, giving the reader a rare insight into a very American event in history."},{"Title":"Stories of Scottsboro","review":"I started reading this book with very little knowledge about the Scottsboro incident.

This book is amazing. It chronicles the famous Scottsboro trial, from the initial incident all the way through to many years after the trial. The book is written very convincingly in that it tries to present the different perspectives of relevant parties/persons. This made me feel like Goodman wasn't trying to push his own agenda but was instead simply presenting as best he could an accurate historical account of the facts surrounding Scottsboro. The book itself is written like a story, but you can tell from its presentation that the &quot;story&quot; was very historically driven and all facts mentioned were well-documented. A fascinating account of Scottsboro. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about it. I'm not sure a better resource exists on this topic."},{"Title":"Stories of Scottsboro","review":"Jim Goodman makes a beautiful mosaic composed of the the many views on the Scottsboro trials. From the way it's written, you lose fact that it's a work of nonfiction. Truly makes you think about the strides we've made in justice over the past sixty or so years. Hopefully, society has reached the point were it can no longer legally lynch an individual."},{"Title":"Stories of Scottsboro","review":"I find it astonishing that so many (Whites) really believe this did not happen.It would be nice if this entire series of books could be republished."},{"Title":"Stories of Scottsboro","review":"James Goodman's detailed account of the Scottsboro case is magnificent. He begins with the 1931 charge of gang rape on a freight train in Alabama, then follows the different trials of the accused, adding more and more characters as he goes along: the chief white witness (Victoria Price), the second white witness who changes sides (Ruby Bates), a good judge (James Horton), a bad judge (William Callahan), a brilliant lawyer (Samuel Liebowitiz), a shady attorney general (Thomas Knight), a New York minister who plays peacemaker (Allen K. Chalmers), Communist organizers, NAACP officials, Alabama politicians, journalists, and the nine \\"boys\\" themselves (aged 12 to 19 when first accused). The nine slowly come into focus as three-dimensional characters. Goodman's reading of their prison letters is especially good and he makes their later lives very real, in particular Haywood Patterson and Clarence Norris.The tale goes all the way up to Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. It's part legal thriller, part epic social history, a fiendishly complicated story with endless trials and deals, yet Goodman expertly walks us through it, showing each side's point of view. Jean Renoir famously said that \\"All the world has its reasons, and that's its tragedy,\\" which is the case here. Among other things, the book provides a more nuanced and sympathetic portrait of the failure of Southern liberalism than I've encountered anywhere else, and a painfully real picture of pre-Civil Rights America. I can only imagine the research that went into this book, but what shows strongly is Goodman's remarkable gift for storytelling.This is a great book."},{"Title":"Stories of Scottsboro","review":"Having already read Dan T. Carter's masterful Scottsboro: A Tragedy of the American South, I already knew the story of the Scottsboro boys and the miscarriage of justice that happened to them. I hoped to get more insight with this book. Unfortunately, its unclear style got in the way. I would guess that someone who was unaware of this case might love this book--but if you are looking for more than narrative, get Carter's book instead."},{"Title":"The black canoe: Bill Reid and the spirit of Haida Gwaii","review":"Anyone who knows and loves the work of Haida artist, Bill Reid, will be fascinated by this behind-the-scenes account of the modelling and casting of 'Spirit of Haida Gwai'. Modelled first in clay, then cast in sections into bronze, the completed work is an enormous canoe full of figures from the mythology of the Haida Indians of the Northwest Coast of North America. The figures of the Eagle, the Raven, Bear Mother, Mouse Woman and Dogfish Woman are exquisitely carved in a style which is unmistakably that of the Northwest Coast, yet it also has a distinctly contemporary feel that reflects Reid's ability to draw upon his heritage while remaining creative and original in his work. The construction process is documented in detail with over eighty black and white photographs, while the text explores the symbolism and meaning of these tantalising figures from Haida mythology who share the canoe and a common cultural ancestry. The making of this wonderful sculpture must surely be one of the greatest achievements of Reid's long and successful career as a highly talented and original sculptor and jeweller. For those who know Reid's work this book is a must, providing a fascinating record of his working methods. For those who have not yet encountered Reid's work, this book provides a golden opportunity to meet some of the characters which dominate his work. All will marvel at Bill Reid's skill as a sculptor in producing this beautiful, immense, and impressive piece of work, a process which has been beautifully and sensitively recorded in the pages of this book. (Reviewed by M.Simpson"},{"Title":"The black canoe: Bill Reid and the spirit of Haida Gwaii","review":"The author occasionally lapses into overly academic prose - the sort of thing you have to read 3 times before you can glean any meaning from it. Having said that, the book is very informative and insightful and leaves the reader with much to think about. I appreciate that he didn't assign any specific meanings to the work; he provides the mythical and historical context which allows the reader to begin to think intelligently about the layers of meaning in the choice of characters and their placement in the canoe. I say \\"begin to think intelligently\\" because you can't absorb the full symbolic meaning, importance, and relevance of the applicable Haida myths, stories and history from one book. This book is a great place to begin the journey to a greater understanding though, and I know I'll have a much deeper appreciation of this amazing sculpture next time I visit its counterpart, the Jade Canoe, at YVR."},{"Title":"Feminist Political Theory: An Introduction, Second Edition","review":"This is an excellent summary of feminist political theory (surprise!). It gives concise, accurate, up-to-date, and very readable accounts. Its main purpose is to present an overall view, which it does very well, and not to offer deep criticisms. But there are critical comments. Certainly recommended as an intro, well achieving its goal."},{"Title":"The Wondrous Ways of Women","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I just had a baby and spend lots of time at home now. I picked up this book which was referred to me by a very good friend who is an avid reader. I starting reading the book and found it very intriguing. I actually finished it within days. I liked the fact that it was many different stories, so you can read as many as you want in a day. I bought The Wondrous Ways of Women for my sister and sent it to her in the mail and she too loved it! I think any woman with a strong mind and a good soul will really enjoy. so, in closing to the author, Shelly Morris, keep up the good work and write more so all us wondrous women can read more!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Wondrous Ways of Women","review":"The stories in The Wondrous Ways of Women are intriguing. I was impressed by the author's vivid imagination and her ability to think of so many different tales about women. This book is a compilation of heart-warming stories that make one feel good. They give us a brief and marvelous escape from reality, bringing about thoughts of reincarnation and, for me, reminders and wonder about my own deja vue experiences. All women should enjoy these stories with the extraordinary twists."},{"Title":"The Wondrous Ways of Women","review":"Each story is outstanding! They grabbed me from the first paragraph and wouldn't let go until the very end. The endings of each story brought out emotions that made me want to hurry to the next one. Excellent read."},{"Title":"The Wondrous Ways of Women","review":"Perhaps the most wondrous part of this book...is Shelly's magnificent grasp of the human condition and her ability to make the reader believe and connect with spirits from the beyond. Tales of Past, Current, and Future Lives was my absolute favorite part of this masterfully crafted piece of literature, and I felt as though I could see and hear the ghost of a Confederate soldier speaking to Jill in a story titled Family Emergency.This is a book for women to be sure, but it radiates an appeal to both sexes and to anyone from young adolescents to those late in their years. All I can say is...buy it. You'll be all the better for doing so."},{"Title":"The Wondrous Ways of Women","review":"A wonderful collection of unique short stories filled with love, and adventure. It warmed my heart and lifted my spirits into the new millennium!"},{"Title":"The Wondrous Ways of Women","review":"This book is a great collection of short stories pertaining to women, all about women, and for women. It's a book that is chock full of emotions, intriguing stories, and unusual twists that lure the reader to find out what happens at the end. This is a great book for car-pooling moms, or to take to dental or doctor appointments, because when you just have a few minutes to read something, you can quickly read one of Shelly Gail Morris's stories in a matter of minutes. It's also a good read for those moments in bed before drifting off into nighttime sleep."},{"Title":"Detroit (Downtown America Book)","review":"Who would think that Motown(detroit) would be interesting. Ms Zimmerman puts in consise and interesting ways the diverse cultures and history of the city.

You will laugh, you will cry and your heart will smile."},{"Title":"Rasta Dogs","review":"I'm not familiar with the author or her other works (though I will delve into her other titles over time) as this book was aquired because of the subject matter - a superb read and a book deserving of a place on any Puli owner's bookshelf, a great wee autobiography from Zoro the author's first Puli (we always suspected this breed was of superior intellegence) intrigued by the ending \\"END OF BOOK ONE\\" look forward to book 2 and beyond.Delightful artwork on the front and back cover capturing the puli spirit and a great quick read for older teens and adults."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"First, I'm shocked that this book got any negative reviews. Had I read those reviews before I picked up this book I probably wouldn't have read it, and that would have been quite a shame.This is a heart-wrenching tale of a family of adult children who are at war with each other. That war was brought on by tragedy. These were all good people who just couldn't seem to connect anymore. Hence the matriarch of the family, Annette Byrne, engineers a plan to bring all those family members together to help mend the giant divide that separates them.This book was well written, well plotted, told from each family member's point of view, and a very satisfying story. This book was definitely worth my time, and I assure you that it is worth yours."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"I have been an admirer of Belva Plain for many years - her novels are like watching a Sunday television movie on a snowy afternoon. However, her latest effort, &quot;Homecoming&quot; is a disappointment. The story is stereotypical and trite: A well-to-do matriarch gathers her troubled family together at her country estate for a homecoming in hopes all will resolve their family difficulties which include a troubled marriage and a rivalry between 2 brothers. A tragedy occurs at the home which brings everyone closer together and, like magic, by the end all have resolved their differences. It is all very neat and clean and, quite frankly, a bit of a disappointment. &quot;Homecoming&quot; is a small novel, almost a short story - still, I wish the characters were more developed and that their lives contained more than the usual &quot;baggage&quot; we all are used to reading about. The book is easy to read and can be finished in a few hours and, yes, it is enjoyable to read. I just wish this book would have been more interesting and not so contrived. I will continue to read Belva Plain and will await her next work which, hopefully, will be a more in-depth novel for, as I said before, I like to nest on a Sunday afternoon and sink myself in a comforting and soothing story."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"Is this the same author who wrote the literary gem &quot;Evergreen&quot;? If I wouldn't have seen Belva Plain's name on the cover flap, then I wouldn't have believed that the such an established author could produce such a trite, unimaginative, immature piece. Dare I call it literature. Quality is so much more important than quantity and I would suggest that instead of producing the &quot;annual-quota&quot; of fiction, Ms. Plain hibernate with her thoughts so as to present a better storyline. This was truly disappointing."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"Plain was not at her best with this novel. The events are predictable, and the sugary-sweet ending is less than realistic. Plain has many better books to choose from. This one is pure cotton candy. Fans of Plain will read it, but with some disappointment."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"I received this book in a compilation of four works in a book of the month type club. This is the ONLY reason I read this book. I mistook it for a short story initially. I've never read the author before, but this book is amateurish at best. Simplistic, short, disappointing. The concept may have been promising, had everything not turned out happily ever after. Way too many long-term, complex problems solved in a day to even be considered minutely believable."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"I have read all of Belva Plain's novels and she never dissappoints. Her indepth insight of family relationships is amazing and she keeps me up at night because I need to find out what happens!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"A lovely book. Homecoming is very well written. It grabbed my attention and held it thru the very last page. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"I've never read Belva Plain before but I recently heard she's a great author and I should try one of her books. I got halfway through this book and can't even stand to finish it. The characters were difficult to keep straight and the writing jumped from present to past, first person to third person. It was weird. Whatever you do, don't buy this book. It's not worth borrowing from the library. Hard to believe she got paid for this."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"This is the story of an 85-yr-old woman who feels that she must do something to bring the family back together. Like most of us, she is lonely with her two sons so far away and the devoted, loving husband now dead. It is a story of healing, love and forgiveness -- something my family needs badly.As she writes her invitations of the last Homecoming, she says to herself, \\"I don't feel different from the way I felt when I was twenty. I only look different.\\"As e-mail is the way to communicate these days, there is still nothing as satisfying as to send and receive a well-written letter. Annette Byrne did such that December as she looked out at all of the Christmas trees they had planted. She had a special place with loving care to maintain it over the years -- it was a showplace.Now, she has invited the brothers who had a falling out, embittered by a breach of ethics, honor, and trust. Those things happen in the best of families when a parent dies and the will favors one over the other. There are two grandchildren invited who are estranged from their families and the 'get-together' will do them good.It is a touching story, as so many of Belva Plain's novel have been over the years. I especially enjoyed THE CAROUSEL and EVERGREEN."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"I've read many of Plain's works, but I just found this one to be not well developed. Of course an incident always brings people together. That's just par for the course. This book read like one of Danielle Steels newer ones (The ones that have fallen in quality). You're better off reading another Plain book."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"This story is particularly meaningful if you have relatives that are at odds with one another - and who doesn't. The matriarch, Annette, finds a way to bring everyone together, but only a near tragedy can open communication and help form bonds. It is a very realistic description of a family and a story most people could relate to. This is a book you can read easily in one sitting. I got an autographed copy from my son for Christmas and I am very pleased - since I am a Belva Plain fan."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"This is definitely not one of Belva Plain's best books. Is itwrittenjust to make us feel good - to be in line with the festive season? I find the plot too predictable. I rushed to finish the book, not because it is good, but because I was bored and wanted to go on to another book. I do not object to the reunion of all the characters except for that of Cynthia's and Andrew's. No doubt both were at fault for the separation, but I feel that while how Cynthis behaved was understandable, what Andrew did was unforgivable."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"I really enjoyed Belva Plain's book, HOMECOMING. Especially with the holidays coming round the bend once again. The rural winter NY setting makes you happy to curl up and read this GET THE FAMILY BACK TOGETHER TALE. Anyone who enjoyed this story will love another book I just read, WHILE THE MOON LOOKED UP TO HEAVEN, by Terry Stellini.(This adventure takes you to a monastery(for ADVENT) on a hill just south of Rome. What lies at the bottom of the hill makes your heart melt...DELIGHTFUL!!! Mary Terra THis"},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"This was the first Belva Plain book I read and it was great. I loved the the entire plot. It was very true to life. All of the women in this book are very strong and to be admired. Annette was a very lovable character who brought her children together in a kind of sneaky way but for all the right reasons. I admired the daughter, Cynthia for the way she carried on after all of the tragedies in her life. This was a wonderful book and I would reccomend it to anyone as well of any of her other books."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"There is something this story is missing. Everyone in 85 year old Annette Byrne's family is at war with each other. She wants to gather her family together at home and have them all make peace even knowing the strong bitterness between them. Annette does just that, and they all have a big fight with one another until an incident happens to bring them together while meeting at Annette's home.I don't know-this story lacked something though. I think it was that she didn't develop the characters enough for the plot which was shallow somehow. I see where more could have been developed and elaborated on before the run-in with each other at the meeting took place.Belva Plain usually writes with more depth than this with each one of her characters in the past books I read of hers. This just wasn't really developed quite enough."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"Is this the same author who wrote the literary gem &quot;Evergreen&quot;?

It would be nice if things like this worked out in real life but, as a rule, they generally do not. However, I did enjoy reading this book and I will be reading more books by Belva Plain. We all can use alittle fantasy in our lives to relieve the stress and tentions of the day."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"This was the most trite, cliche, and predictable book I've had the displeasure to read in a long time. I stayed with it just to finish for my book club, but I'm mad to have spent $7 for a double-spaced silly, happily-ever-after soap opera. I will not be so foolish with her book(s) next time (if there is one for me!)."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"Remembering which characters were which made reading this book a bit tedious. The only characters that were remotely developed where Cynthia and Andrew and the tragedy of losing their twin children. My question after reading about the near drowning of Lucy is why didn't anyone go to the hospital? It was a disappointing fairy tale of a meddling wealthy grandmother, her piggish, stubborn children, and alas from these children we have their equally rediculous offspring."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"I wish I had read the reviews before buying this at the book store. After reading the Evergreen saga from Evergreen to Harvest, this book was very disappointing.. It lacked the depth of plot and characters I was expecting after reading the others. The excerpt of Legacy of Silence at the end was better than the whole Homecoming book. Don't waste money on this one. Rent it from the library for a weekend read. I am waiting for my copy of Legacy of Silence to arrive. I'll let you know how it compares."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"This is a book you read on a cross-country flight simply because there's nothing else. The plot is trite and predictable---you know, for example, the moment Annette's widowed friend is introduced that she will be paired in the end with Annette's widowed son. The characters are flat and one-dimensional, and the dialogue (and the characters' thoughts) follow a formula. Don't waste your time on this one---wait for the &quot;Movie of the Week&quot; to be made from it and then switch the channel to something else."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"It was a harmless story...very easy reading and very short. Save your money because you won't want to read it again...this is one to read with the library card."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"What happened to Belva Plain? I used to enjoy her novels - this one is TERRIBLE. First of all, no one would put up with Annette, the bumbling old fool of a woman who interferes with everyone's lives but then is portrayed as a sweet, tolerable, darling. UGH! Secondly, the syrup drips heavily when an extremely unlikely accident claims the lives of a pair of twins, and when another little girl falls in a frozen lake, you can not only see the ending clearly, everything from that point on is predictable and ridiculous. I can't figure out what the point of the whole story is. I began to feel bored when Annette's young friend condones her wishes to plan a surprise get - together of enemies, and I nearly fell asleep trying to keep this motley crew of characters straight. Don't waste your money on this one, in fact, don't even take it out of the library and waste your time."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"This is a story that has already been written many times, mostly by people like Barbara Taylor Bradford. Not only is it totally predictable, right down to the almost-drowning in the icy pond, but the characters are all flimsy, one-dimensional people and, mercifully, completely forgettable. To add insult to injury, the paperback is priced at around six dollars, even though the print is DOUBLE SPACED! What a rip-off. I have not read any of Plain's prior work and certainly won't be buying any of her books in the future."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"O.k., maybe a little predictable, but you still want to see if and how she pulls it off! An interesting story of a family having faced major, extremely life-altering situations along with petty indifferences and prejudices. Very moving at times and definitely a human story. A very good story of family dynamics."},{"Title":"Homecoming","review":"My Book Club read this book and we were generally disappointed. Although we liked that it was a good short read, we were not happy with the lack of depth in the story lines. The overall concept was good, but unbelievable in the way it was presented."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"I am a college student at Hollins University in Virginia, and back in the good ol' days of high school, my English teacher prompted me to send one of my stories into Sara Shandler. I did, and my story was consequently published in Ophelia Speaks. The publication of my true story was a cleansing experience, it helped my realize that although the sitution I wrote about meant everything to me at the time, life does go on. After reading the rest of the stories in the book, I can honestly say that teenage girls can benefit from these true-life accounts. To anyone who feels like the world is too much to handle, this book is great therapy. Even if all you want is more insight into the female adolescent point of view, this compilation will really help. And it makes a great gift! Thanks for reading!"},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"I am a girl of 13, soon to be 14, who found this book insightful, healing, and a book that should be read throughly and twice. I had heard about it and when I saw it at the library, I thought what the heck, so I checked it out and found it to be one of the most wonderful books that I've ever read. The girls write with full honesty which is all we're looking for these days. With heartfelt stories that range from race to heartbreak to death to pregnancy, this book is something that can heal, can help, and can reveal things that every adolsecent girl knows deep down."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"I really liked this book...mostly because it was REAL to me. I'm from small town america, I am 15 years old, and in some of these stories, I heard my own voice. The book dealt with some issues that I see in my life, and others around me's lives. I don't deal with all the issues in the books, but knowing that other people have similar problems reassured me. We are not all so different...people put too much stock in uniqueness. On the inside we all have similar wants and desires, we want the same things from life. We want to be better people than we are, I felt that was a basic theme of the book. As humans, or at least as teenage girls, we aren't satisfied with who we are. I thought _Ophelia Speaks_ gave an accurate picture of teenage emotions. Not all teenagers deal with these sort of problems, but I think that most do at some point, to some degree. It's not for everyone, I'm sure...the writing not professional, but it is brutally honest, and I find the honesty extremely admirable...sometimes more so than professionalism."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"A poignant collection of writings culled from more than 800 contributions directly from the hearts of girls with various cultural backgrounds, ranging from 12-18, offering a real view on issues public &amp; private, from body image to boys, politics to parents, school to sex.After reading Mary Pipher's Reviving Ophelia at age 16, Sara Shandler, so felt the absence of the voices of America's daughters she determined to find out &amp; with a book deal in hand, this teenager wrote letters to high school principals asking their assistance.Framing each chapter are the author's reflections, offering both the comfort of a trusted friend who shares her own story &amp; an honest perspective from within the eye of the storm of adolescence.Here are the voices of our Ophelias.

An amazing effort!Put it on your shopping list for every girl you know &amp; for anyone interested in who our daughters really are, out of their own mouths."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"Okay, I know there is a place for a book that is filled with girls' worries and sorrows and anguish. But for my money, it's more valuable to give a girl a book that does not just reflect her angst, but that offers solutions, tips, hope, and empowerment. The best book I know about for girls (preteen and teen) is GIRLTALK: All the Stuff Your Sister Never Told You which recently came out in a fourth edition. I read it as a teen back in 1985 and recently gave the fully updated book to my nieces--who loved it."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"This book goes deep into the soul of teenage girls facing so many tribulations and tragedies.I can completely relate to the girls,and love reading it!(Great job,Sara!)"},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"Please, I am begging you. If you're an adult buy this book forthe teen girl in your life. If you're a teen girl right now buy thisbook now! Don't pay any attention to the ... adults who gave this book low ratings. They just don't understand! Yea, so there are stories of girls who expierment with sex and drugs, who hurt themselves and are depressed, but there is at least one story in here that you will be able to relate to. For all the adults who gave this book low rating I am digusted, you cannot judge this book because you're not a teenage girl growing up right now. I'm not saying all girls are despressed, suicidal, etc etc, but you cannot find one girl on the face of the earth who has not at least considered some of things in this book. It was a relief for me to find girls writing the very same things I have thought, but never expressed to a living soul. I read lots of these type of books and this is one of the best. I recommend it for any girl ages 13-18."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"There appears to be a socioeconomic imbalance in the book. When Shandler collected writings, she included &quot;socioeconomic, cultural, and racial issues&quot; as a suggested topic. Indeed, near the back of the book, there is a section on &quot;Race, Identity, and Prejudice.&quot; In general, however, the bulk of the writings have a middle-to-upper-class feel to them. There are no writings about facing or overcoming poverty or lack of resources for college or other educational goals. In the section entitled &quot;No Safe Place,&quot; I expected to find at least one piece about street or school violence, but found none. Because a large part of Shandler's readership will be teenage girls themselves, she has a responsibility to provide some perspective and discussion of solutions. In some sections, she fails to do that. In the section entitled &quot;Self-Inflicted Wounds,&quot; for example, she admits to receiving only ten pieces (out of 815) on the subject, and includes four of them. Three of them are very dramatic, emotional poems. There is little &quot;why&quot; discussed and little hope expressed. Admittedly, in some circles of adolescent girls, self-mutilation is an alarmingly common problem. Still, such pieces do little to help the problem. I'm afraid such writings will only &quot;fan the flames&quot; for many young women. In this and other sections, it might have helped to have some writings from young women who are overcoming their problems, or from slightly older young women who have gained some perspective on their younger adolescent years. Such writings would perhaps challenge the adolescent reader a little more, and force her to think more deeply about her problems, rather than simply invite her to a pity party. On a more positive note, Shandler is not afraid to include very common, less dramatic issues such as academic pressure. &quot;The Academic Squeeze&quot; is an excellent section that explores the issue of school stress. This section acknowledges that worry over grades and college admissions, unhealthy habits (especially lack of sleep) caused by a difficult study schedule, and parental pressure can sometimes compound (or even cause) the more immediately alarming problems such as depression and suicide. Similarly, the section entitled &quot;Manipulated and Controlled&quot; addresses another problem that doesn't usually get much attention-that of adolescent girls' allowing themselves to be manipulated by boyfriends."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"Ophelia speaks is my favorite book because I feel as though I can identify with it. I've never read anything before that describes exactly how I feel. Any teenage girl growing up today could easily relate to most if not all of the stories in this well put together book."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"The stories in this book were so representative of my life, my fears, and that of my friends. It was inspirational, sad, and a good lesson. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"'Ophelia Speaks' is brimming with valid, powerful insights and experiences -- so much so that it overwhelms the reader a bit, dulling the effect that these sharp, heartfelt girls might be able to have had their pieces stood alone. Shandler is better suited as editor than author -- her ramblings on her own life become sophomoric and tedious. Still, to Shandler's credit, from the dark passages dealing with the most difficult aspects of female adolesence, to the honeyed, tounge-in-cheek prose of innocent desires, there is much to be relished and learned within 'Ophelia's' pages."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"When I find out about this book, I brough it inmediatley. It was a litle more intense than what I expected but every word was true. I could relate whith many of this stories, whowever I wouldn't recomend this book to anyone under 14 because of it's sometimes strong content."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"I find that this book is the greatest representation of teenage problems. Many books are written by adults that do research, but these stories are personally written of first hand experiences and of friends' experiences. A plus is that the author was a teenager when she first collected the stories to put this book together, and I am sure that she had some of the same reactions and experiences that these girls have had. All in all, i think that this was possibly the greatest book out right now."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"This book tells the bare truth. I read it in two days! It really helped me realize my problems and get help. It's a definate must read!!!"},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"&quot;Ophelia Speaks&quot; is frank, honest and at the same time entertaining.

Its definately a book not to be miss."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"I love this book! Sara Shandler did an amazing job! As a teenager myself I can totally relate to every girl in the book! I read Reviving Opelia when I was 12 and I already knew girls (ophelias) with the same situations as in the book, in my 7th grade class! I think every girl 12+ should read both Reviving Ophelia and Ophelia Speaks...This is also a must read for Parents of Adolescent girls! I suggest reading Reviving Ophelia first though, because you would then get a feeling of what Sara Schandler is talking about...Overall I would like to say, thanks to Sara Schandler, for letting me know, I am not the only one out there, with these problems!"},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"I am an eighteen year old from West Virginia. Life is pretty quiet here, so when I found out my short story, Cute Memory, was going to be published I was thrilled. I must confess that when I picked up Ophelia Speaks, it was more to see my story in print than read the book. But once I started to read I realized how truthful this book was. It addresses serious issues, but also includes the feelings of girls who don't suffer from eating disorders but do feel badly about their bodies. I think it is a wonderful book. Kudos to Sara Shandler for making it happen."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"I recenty purchased Ophelia Speaks, and once I opened it, I couldn't let it down. It's a collection of letters, poems, and stories from adolecents across the nation. These entries will make your heart, mind, and body stop because they're so exciting/sad."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"Ophelia Speaks is not only a voice for young women, but one for young people, and everyone connected to them as well. The desire to see what goes on in a teenager's mind has become increasingly popular, judging by the titles and headlines that line store shelves. This book actually gives us just that, word-for-word. This insightful and clear, honest writing allows us to open our hearts and our minds to those around us, so we may gain a better understanding of how we live, and who we are. Ophelia Speaks handed me a laugh, it gave me teary cheeks, and it spoke of a world I did not fully recognize before-hand."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"It's about time! Why is it that men and women who grew up in a different era think they know what's going on with us today? The problems of thirty years ago are not the same problems of today. We teenage girls face a lot more serious issues than we used to. I am so very proud of those girls for telling the truth and enlightening all of us. I've grown up with a very sheltered lifestyle, but even I can relate and learn from what these girls are telling everyone. This book is full of true stories involving abuse, eating disorders, dating, rape and many more things a teenage girl must face. This might just be me, but whenever I see people trying to analize the female population to see what makes them tick and to try and figure out why we do what we do, I just want to throw up. No one has the right to decide what we are feeling unless they themselves have gone through it. If you wish to know why we're so messed up, ask us."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"Today's society has made us feel that our children must exceed in everything they do from grades to appearance(The need to be accepted into college is an added pressure).

This book which my daughter and I read together made me understand her feelings so much better(It was a terrific way to broach subjects that we parents may feel strange talking to our children about.Thanks Sara!"},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"Why is it that women who grew up in a different generation, a different time period actually, think they know how we teens of today function? The trials of yesterday are not the same trials we go through today. I am so happy that teens has finally spoken up and decided to explain why we do the things we do and what is actually going on inside our heads. This book was written by teenage girls, for the purpose of explaining what the media, peer pressure, family, and everyone's expectations have done to us. The stories are real and so never again can anyone say we have lead a sheltered life and that we don't know what goes on in the real world.I don't think I have the right words to explain what I feel and what I am trying to get across. Suffice it to say that women and men three times our age trying to explain to the world why we females are exploited and trying to explain how we feel about what happens to us is totally unacceptable. The only way to understand what troubles us, is to ask us."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"My counsler just started a group for girls to express thier feelings about school, boys, or anything. She has read us alot of the stories some of us cried. I would rate this book even more stars if I could. I would definetly reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"Wow! I read this book as a follow up to Mary Pipher's Reviving Ophelia. Reviving Ophelia deals with issues from a professional side. It too was a great read, but Ophelia Speaks was incredible. Every thought I had as a teenage girl and even now as a 25 year old was covered. It dealt with everything from relationships to eating disorders to death.Now I find the book even more helpful as a first year teacher. I teach mostly freshman. It reminds me that there are a million different things these kids are dealing with on a daily basis.I recommend this book to anyone. It's great for girls to see that they aren't alone. It's great for Mom's cause they've been there too. And it is even great for men, to see exactly what is going on in our minds!Get it. Read it. And share it with a girl you love!"},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"this book is amazing! i enjoyed it so much! it's my favorite book. a teen usually doesn't have the chance to read about the lives, struggles and triumphs of other teens across the country. it's so authentic and realistic. it's great to be able to relate to other teens and know that you are not alone, and also be able to look at the experiences of others, and just enjoy stepping into their lives. This book is a marvel. A must for every teenage girl. AND it's definitley WAY better than &quot;Chicken Soup.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"when i first bought this book i started at the beginning and i couldnt put it down. the book is seperated into subjects and there were some sad stories but some were inspiring. sometimes when you think that your life is bad its good to be able to read about others lives who are actually bad and it really puts your thoughts into perspective. this book was really great. i recommend it to all teen girls."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"Let me just tell you right off the bat, if you haven't picked up Ophelia Speaks stop typing and go to your local book store! This book was filled with everything! I ..I can't put it into words it was great! It's not a novel or a sad love story, it's LIFE! This book is filled with diffrent aspects on life and the cause and effect on dealing with real life. I loved every story! You may not relate to every story, but it makes you look at yourself diffrently. For example the story about the young lady that was a lesbain, but no one knew it, not even her boyfriend. I can't relate to being gay and hiding it, but I can relate to her on a diffrent level. We all hide something in our lives and walk around like it's nothing and I believe that was the focus or point of choosing that short story and all the short stories. They all have a place for everyone and it shines right through in this book! I recommend it to adults and teenagers. Why is it for all age group? Well because even though it may stick to one age group, even adults can find or remember being young and fighting the everyday battle of life. Get this book..it truly will capture your soul!"},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"I absoloutely loved this book. I loved it's frankness and honesty. The section on media-fed images and eating disorders touched me so deeply. It's great to feel my silent observations so realistically and truthfully told as I never could! Thank you Sara, for this remarkable book"},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"The book provided great insight to this mother of a 7-month old daughter trying to understand and anticipate. Still, I did wonder, when the first chapter is about body image, why the cover displays girls who are clearly the pretty girls at school. Doesn't this lessen the author's and contributors' hope that girls should not be judged by their looks? Also, I would suggest that the topics are slightly skewed from the average teen experience if only because we tend to write more about difficulties than less challenging topics. Still, these difficult topics are important to understand."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"After reading some of the negative reviews on this book, I just have to say, do you people KNOW any upper middle class teen girls? When you're reading a book on the struggles of adolescent girls, it's usually a given that they're going to be some of the more affluent, educated ones. And as for whether or not their contributions were eloquent or articulate, this is the way we write! Yes, some of the entries were a bit trite, but that is why there were more than one for each section! All in all, this was a very decent follow up to Reviving Ophelia, especially considering the age of the young woman who compiled it. Worth the money, but only if you've already read &quot;Reviving Ophelia&quot;"},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"This book is a definite eye opener. Most teenage girls never even think about or maybe even know about some of the subjects mentioned in the book. I think this book somehow takes away some of the naivetes everyone is born with, but it's a good thing since the world isn't black and white.If you like books with happy endings all the time this book is definitely not for you. This book is for the people who live the grey."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"Ophelia Speaks presents a poignant, and at times painful, window into the lives of teenage girls. As an adult and a teacher I found this book to be an eye-opening insight into the current experience of adolescence. Sara Shandler's honest and forthright introductions to each chapter were riveting. Her writing style is fresh and self-revelatory. By presenting her own vivid and personal experiences she prepares the reader for each topic. She impressed me as being sensitive and respectful in the handling of the material. Thanks, Sara, for a job well done!"},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"'Ophelia Speaks : Adolescent Girls Write About Their Search for Self' is an essential addition to the vital library focused on teenage personal development. I gave Sara Shandler's book to my daughter and suggested that while she was searching for self, she might also look for her homework sheets, the four overdue library books I've been ordered to pay for, the banana skin I'd seen in her closet two months ago, the family cat last heard meowing under a mountain of crumpled jeans on her floor and her best friend, Marsha Pippens, missing, presumed piled, since last Saturday's sleepover."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"Having read both &quot;Reviving Ophelia&quot; and &quot;Ophelia Speaks,&quot; I am dismayed that mothers are frequently discussed but never given the opportunity to speak directly.

It's not made to represent all girls, it's made to tell the world what girls really think. It's a great book and I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"Ophelia Speaks by Sara Shandler, is a book filled with heart warming stories from adolescents everywhere. Although this novel discusses mature content I feel that girls everywhere should read this novel. Ophelia Speaks discusses these issues in a mature and open minded fashion. In our English class we're learning how women are objectified in today's society. Ophelia Speaks discusses everything from rape and drugs to pregnancy and abuse. I feel that it's important for girls to have knowledge in what is happening in the world, regardless of age. I enjoyed reading Ophelia Speaks because the novel was based on true stories. Since these stories are true they give the reader an opportunity to connect with them on a personal level. I consistently found myself reading this book outside of school, which is rare. I recommend this book to people, especially women, of all ages. On a personal note I would suggest bringing a box of Kleenex while you read this book. I feel that it is just as important for men to acknowledge these issues especially since they have an active part in most of these issues. It is important for people to acknowledge and learn from experiences, both traumatic and remarkable. And especially since we are the future it's necessary that we learn from the past to prepare for life. This book conveys the message that you're not alone in life no matter what the circumstances are. It is important to know that rape is not your fault as well acknowledging that you're not alone."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"It was a great collection of REAL teens experiences. Some of the things can be learned from and it's a big look into reality."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"I felt like the book related to me and how Ive gone through life as of thus far. Also it opened my eyes up to understanding the life of other girls my age. It showed me a window that I never knew existed."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"I felt like other teenage girls and I could relate to the book easily. I think the main weakness of the book is that the girls didn't write very well. I don't think this should really be surprising, though, considering none of them have been formally taught. Reviving Ophelia was more interesting to me because it felt much more unrestricted."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"When I first saw this book I thought that, as a fifteen year old girl, surely I would be able to relate to some of the girls stories. I found it hard to relate to any of them. I think that this book makes it seem as if all girls have problems such as the ones the girls in the book have. I'm happy to say that the overwhelming majority of girls that I know do not have eating disorders or problems with depression and suicide."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"If you are looking for a book that will empower you as a young woman, try Eve Ensler's The Vagina Monologues. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it made me proud to be a woman. I recommend this book to any woman who is sexual, wants to be sexual, or is just tired of getting crap for having a vagina."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"'Ophelia Speaks' by Shandler is a poor attemp at writing on Shandler's part. I had to read this book for my SOC 204 class, but otherwise I would have never picked this book up to read. I found the book to be only a collection of letters, stories and poems that Shandler had collected from adolescent girls. Most of these entries did not capture the true life of adolescent girls but instead glamourized the stereotypes that society has about female adolescents. The author, at the time of collecting these reading, was only 17 and it seems as if she was just putting this book together to make a few extra bucks. As well, I believe that since she sent out a letter asking for submissions for the book, I feel that the girls that wrote the entries, were meerly looking for some sort of fame by having their entries in this book. I also cannot stand how the author's experiences never reflect the experiences of the writings; this further indicates that the writings are not accurate. The author also never comes to any conclusion after a chapter. She could have given some psychological/sociolgical/physiological reasoning behind some of the girls experiences.I would not refer anyone to read this book. It was a waste of time and money.Save your money and spend it on better things."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"I've read chicken soup for the teeanage soul, but it's nothing compared to this!

This book relates to everything from the loss of a friend/family memeber to teenage pregnacy! Everything related to my problems too. The only thing I would watch for is that some of the book contains laungauge not acceptable for eveyone. So if you're looking for a REALLY good book I would have to say this is the one. I hope everybody will read this book."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"This book touches on most of the issues that affect teens today, but it could have done so without Shandler's commentary. Wonderful descriptions, and honest views on everything from crushes to suicide."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"Ophelia Speaks is the most honest and revealing book I've ever read about being a teenage girl-- and I am one. Anyone calling this book &quot;trite&quot; is out of touch with our reality. In Ophelia Speaks teen girls disclose their personal stories with courage and insight; and compiled by a teen herself! What more could you ask for?"},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"When I first laid eyes on &quot;Ophelia Speaks&quot; I knew it was going to be a purchase for me. Reading it put me in a trance of not being alone and seemed to give more validation to all of my own experiences as an adolescent girl. Now at 18, I feel confident that the voices in that book are only voices to me now, but satisfied that they have not been forgotten. I strongly urge any girl to read this book, it will change something in your life. My personal favorite story was written in the &quot;Intoxication&quot; chapter by a young girl named Corrie I think, her title is in Dutch anyway and it is such a well told and heart gripping story. Sara Shandler has done an amazing thing in being so determined to get this book done, my only wish is that I could have somehow been a part of it. At any rate it's a beautiful book, and a well done work for Sara!"},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"I've never seen a larger waste of literary effort than I did in Ophelia Speaks by Sara Shandler. I am (...)old and, as the targeted audience, I found nothing redeeming hidden among Shandler's shameful pages. Perhaps if Shandler had advertised a different prospect, I would not be so mortified for her hideous compilation. However, considering that she wished to voice the confusion found among adolescents, I must say, I think she failed miserably. The submissions are threaded with poorly written pieces and the polar extremes of teenage horror. Death, rape, abusive boyfriends, bulimia, cutting- you name a traumatic experience, and I'll bet you it's in there. It seems odd to me that the book was supposed to advocate an \\"adolescent's search for self,\\" because, with all due respect, this was a terrifically depressing collection. Seriously. Play hide and go seek all you want with the optimistic stories, but you'll be searching for quite some time. One of the sorry pieces that truly ticked me off was \\"The Body Under Assault\\", a testament to the bleak and destructive attitudes of teenage drama queens. How is this person's horrific disorder EVER going to help me \\"find myself\\" or obtain a positive outlook? Also, not one piece reflected my own opinion. Shandler managed to pluck the most polarized stories so that she failed to represent the opinions of your average adolescent altogether. Instead of optimistic, soulsearching entries, I found myself lost amongst rabid quests of nightmarish ex-friends, forests of self-pitying tales of trauma, and barren plains of the problems that fester in nuclear families. How is a regular teen supposed to find any sort of guidance through such morbid tales? Not to mention that Shandler seems to pride herself with the belief that she's this determined, successful, understanding undergraduate. Think again...and again, and again, and again. Shandler's little tidbits of insight preceding each chapter left me craving to meet her only so I could quiet her self-righteous nuggets of wisdom. Save your money and forget the book!"},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"This book is a good resource for young girls and for adults, especially when dealing with the complexity of being a teenager and a young woman. However, I found this book somewhat disturbing in that many of these young girls are going through ALOT! It is a good read for all teenage girls, in that it hits issues that they can relate to/identify with, or at the very least learn from. I believe as parents and community members we can do a lot more!"},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"I am a teenage girl, but I felt I could relate to few of the stories. I identified with the ones about self image and friendship, but that was about it. I'll be the first to tell you that it isn't easy to be a teenager, but this book dwells only on the negative parts of the teenage years and fails to identify anything positive. However, there were some cute stories and well written poems, but all in all I was somewhat disappointed."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"A most disappointing book. A self absorbed litany of over-privileged adolescents bemoaning their lot. The style and depth of this book is so deeply lacking it is hard to focus on the bleak contents. Clearly some entries were no more that journal reiterations from a bad Monday! Unfortunately devoid of depth or clarity, this book has no redeeming qualities and was not worth the investment, either financial or in time."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"What else is there to say, this is a pretentious book, which says even less than possible. It would be more suitable to appear in a teen magazine, or even Cosmopolitan magazine. I give Ophelia Speaks a minus 2 on a scale of 1 to 10."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"Ophelia Speaks is a literary response to Mary Pipher's bestselling and sometimes controversial work Reviving Ophelia which was published in 1994. In this book psychologist Pipher, who works closely with adolescent girls, documented what she thought were the key issues and struggles for teenage females growing up in America. She did this through cases studies and careful analysis. Author Sara Shandler, a high school student at the time, took it upon herself to recruit girls from all over the United States to write about all aspects of being young and female. She was not opposed to Mary Pipher's work. In fact, it spoke to her positively in many ways. She just thought it would be a good idea for girls to speak for themselves. The result is Ophelia Speaks, a collection of essays on a variety of topics that girls chose to write about...family, friends, diseases, sexuality, death, depression, religion and others. The book is excellent in two regards. First, the stories often take you deep into the heart and mind of adolescent girls. You are struck by how insightful and analytical theses girls are, then thrown back by how fragile and complex their feelings are. The stories, picked by Sara Shandler, are well-written and sincere although a few of them were written in the abstract and therefore lacked the clarity to fully understand the issue at hand. The second part of the book I found to be outstanding were the introductions to each topic. These were written by Sara Shandler herself. They gave perspective on the topic in question and introduced each contribution by giving the reader a taste of what was in store. She also adds a little of her own experience so you get to know her a bit. My life revolves around coaching teenage girls in basketball. I also coach young girls in basketball. A book like this adds to my understanding of teenage girls and therefore helps me work with them more effectively. One of the things Shandler says in the introduction is that teenage &quot; girls are incredibly complicated. &quot; When you read the stories and begin to understand this, I believe it lends itself to patience and understanding. But the book's greatest value probably lies in the support adolescent girls can feel from reading these stories. These girls do not hold anything back and many of their reactions to life's experiences are probably universally felt by a lot of teenage girls. Any teenage girl who is feeling isolated or finding life to be difficult would probably benefit from reading this book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"I picked this book off a list for a college class on Women's studies. I dreaded the fact that I had to finish an 300 page book in less than a week for an assignment. But once I began reading this book, I couldn't stop. I could identify with each and every chapter..if not from my own experience, then from experiences of my peers and friends. I read reviews from people that said it was awful because it shows only the dark side to teenage life. Well, that is the point of this book..to help teenage girls deal with the dark side, and to help them realize they are not alone in their problems. If this book had stories about girls with perfect teenage lives, it just would not have been the same. I would recommend that every parent buy this for their teenage girl...and that every teenage girl buys this for their parents. It is a book that will provide a better understanding between parents and children, because parents will realize that girls today have just as many problems as they probably had when they were our age, and that their children are not alone."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"When I read some of these reviews they really upset me, especially when I saw most of them were by adults. When adults give such a horrible reviews to such a wonderful book, it only backs up the saying from Will Smith's song: Parents Just DON'T Understand! Any teenager who has expierenced the pressures of high school whether it be tempted to have sex or do drugs, or just the pressures of trying to have a social life and still keep up your grades.I got this book for my 14th birthday and left it in the bag for a few days, but then on a boring summer day when I had nothing else to do I picked up the book and started reading. I couldn't put it down! I fell in love with this book. It was such a relief to know there are girls out there going through the same things I am, things that other people might not even know about. Things only teenage girls will understand.After reading the book and gave it to my friends to read. My best friend called me after reading it, in tears, because the book was so real to her. There are parts in there that are hard to read, especialy if you haven't expierenced it, but you should read it anyway, to try to understand fellow girls.Ophelia Speaks is such a wonderful book, a great gift for any teenage girl. When I see the 1 star reviews of the book, I feel hurt because you're saying that they thoughts and feelings of these girls aren't real, but they're very real to me and all my friends. And probably to every teenage girl across the country. So even if you're a parent, try to understand and buy this book for the teenage girl you love. They will thank you."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"Sara Shandler was in high school when she read Dr. Pipher's book, Reviving Ophelia. She found the book a link between her self and her sisters, other teen girls. It was a message to let her know that she wasn't alone. Sara felt, however, that Dr. Pipher's book was still too clinical, too adult and removed from the actual struggles of modern life for young women. At a young age, she decided to write, or at least edit, another book, allowing girls to speak for themselves.What Ms. Shandler created was a collection of essays, submitted by middle school, high school and college age girls all over the country, from all areas, races, and social strata. The essays range over such subjects as physical appearance, eating disorders, parents, rape and molestation, sexuality, friends, feminism, school, and religion.Though the voices Ms. Shandler presents here are candid and outspoken, Ophelia Speaks, nonetheless, manages to present a more hopeful outlook on the lives and futures of young females in America today. The problems are real, but the hearts and minds are strong, not fragile or weak. The hardships are mostly spoken of matter-of-factly, from the pens of the girls who have all ready adapted to difficult circumstances. Rather than promoting change in society, Sara Shandler sends her book out as a letter to all adolescent girls, simply to let them know they are not alone. The only thing that this book asks for in return is that the reader listen without judgement, to the young females in America who simply want to be heard and understood."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"I asked for Opehila Speaks for Christmas. When I started reading the introduction that day I felt that I could relate myself to the editor Sara Shandler. As a teenage girl of 15 I've expereinced some of the things the other girls have. There are times in my life where I've felt lonely and scared and at the same time I've had those innocent crushes on the boy you sit behind in history class. I cried during a few of the stories wanting to tell those girls that I had felt those very same emotions. In my eyes they were speaking for me when I didn't have the voice to speak. For all those people that looked at this book negatively it was becasue they saw it for what it didn't have not what it did have. They may have had the perfect childhood and couldn't understand the worst parts of life. I think that most teenage girls will read it and understand it, which is why I recommend this for every girl/woman for eleven up."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"I read this book on a suggestion from a friend, before I read \\"Reviving Ophelia\\", because she wanted to see if I would be as dissapointed with it as she was. I was more so. While there are some outstanding essays in this collection, the bias of the editor clearly stands out. There is no one for the outcasts to relate to. There was no musician, nor was there anyone that dealt with an alternative religion. There were no essays from people who had a different relationship with their parents than she had. The sections are poorly named and divided. All in all, it is an unworthy book to be associated with the original. Some girls it may \\"make feel less alone\\", but for me it only accentuated the differences. Definately take out from the library before you buy it."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"The book Ophelia Speaks by Sara Shandler is one of the best books I have ever read. The insight it gives to adolescent girls is one of a kind.The book, written in small essays and poems, is a collection of the experiences and memories of adolescent girls. The topics they have written about vary wildly, from rape to crushes to believing in yourself.It's refreshing to be able to open the book and relate to all the stories-with anything you are going through, this book lets you know that you are not alone in your struggles. You see not only yourself in the story, but all of the women you know as well. As I was reading it, I found myself saying, \\"Yeah, I know how that feels. I've been through that.\\"It's cool because the author has framed each section with her own thoughts and experiences, so she becomes like a friend to you throughout the whole book. This is definitely a book every girl has got to read."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"Before I read this book I was convinced that no one else in the world felt like I did, which was unhappy and afraid. However after hearing the stories of girls whose lives were much more horrible than mine,I began to realize that things were not so bad and started to heal. Every mother or grandmother should give this book to her daughter."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"As one of those few whose written work was included in the book, I am honored to be apart of it. It's honest and truthful and hopefully has been able to open the eyes of its readers. Every girl who wrote a peice for it shared a little bit of their soul with millions of strangers who should be blessed by reading it. I hope more and more young women who read it become hopeful in their lives and see that you can make it through."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"I haven't read Reviving Ophelia, so I can't compare the two, but I found Shandler's book, although disturbing at times, an excellent collection of memoirs written by the soon-to-be women of our society. I agree that at times the author's commentary could be distracting, but the stories stand and speak for themselves.I don't know any girl or woman that couldn't relate to at least one of the poignant essays. These girls poured their hearts out about topics ranging from death to poor self image to abuse to discovering their sexuality. One shouldn't be surprised to discovered that our children are often confused, angry, abused, sad and frightened after reading some of the scenarios some of these young girls have lived through.I'm 30 years old, and was raised in a middle class, suburban environment with two wonderful parents and a relatively happy childhood and I could relate to many of the stories told in this book."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"I loved this book becuase I felt that it really captured what it is like to grow up female in America. I laughed and cried as I read these powerful essays written by young and talented writers. As a mother it really made me reflect on how I can best guide my pre-adolescent daughter as she grows into a woman. I would not recommend that girls in their early teens read this as many of the material is not appropriate, especially the chapter on eating disorders."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"Last June my English teacher flagged me down in the hallway, waving a piece of paper. After reassuring me that it wasn't a failed Final Exam she sat me down and and handed me a copy of a call for submissions she had found in her mailbox that morning. It was for a book to be titled Ophelia Speaks and asked teenage girls to share their stories and experiences. My teacher suggested I submit a poem I had written earlier that year for English class. Doubtful that anything would come of it, I placed my poem in an envelope and sent it to Sara Shandler. Two months later I got a letter informing me that it had been selected for publication. When Ophelia Speaks finally came out in stores, I was first in line to get a copy. Four hours, a box of tissues and two Hagan Daz bars later, I had finished the entire book. It was such an incredible feeling to find so many other girls with whom I shared similar feelings and experiences-- especially after feeling completely alone for so many years. This book is one which I would recommend to anyone who has ever felt alone, unsure or simply confused."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"This book is excellent ! If you are a teenage girl who feels alone in the world with all the crazy emotions and situations you go through...you HAVE to read this book. I am an 18yr. old high school senior and I saw a part myself in almost every one of the girls' writings throughout this book. No emotion or situation is left unexpressed or unexamined in this book. It is a wonderful read for teenage girls everywhere and it will make you realize, way beyond doubt, that you most certainly ARE NOT alone...."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"I find this book one of the best of its time. For once women talk and they relate their &quot;Growing Pains&quot; to anyone who cares to listen. I recommend it to all ages, and I promise you will not want to put it down!!!"},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"In reading this book, I found it to be exactly like the life of a teenage girl. Anyone could read this book and get something out of it. In idea, it reminds me of the Chicken Soup series, but I enjoyed how it only focused on teenage girls and the struggles that they face. Excellent Read! Get it today!"},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"Ophelia Speaks is a very interesting book. It is a collection of stories from different girls of different cultures, religion and from different areas in the country. These are articles written from the hearts of many girls who have written about issues in their lives. Good or bad, they've been able to let out what's inside them that they feel others should know about. This book has been divided into five parts, \\"The Body Under Assault\\", \\"Family Matters\\", \\"The Best and the Worst of Friends\\", \\"Touched by Desire\\", \\"Overcoming Obstacles and Coming into Our Own\\". The first part discusses issues on \\"media-fed images\\", which is when girls want to look like models on or in magazines or even actresses on T.V and in movies. It also discusses eating disorders and how girls have struggled through anorexia and bulimia. Another discussion is \\"self-inflicted wounds\\", which talks about razor cuts and girls trying to commit suicide. Then there is a section called \\"intoxication\\", which talks about drinking and drugs and finally, rape and sexual abuse, which is a plain self-explanatory title. The second part discusses what girls feel about their mothers and fathers. It also talks about the relationships and rivalries girls share with their sisters and brothers. It talks about disintegrating foundations, which is divorce and separation. \\"No Safe place\\" talks about the insecurity girls feel at home with their families. Finally, \\"death in the family\\" talks about how girls are able to cope with the death of a relative. The third part discusses how girls are able to go through tough situations and everyday situations with the support of their friends. It also discusses what friendships some girls once had but have now lost. Finally, this part discusses how some girls are able to cope with the death of their friends. The fourth part discusses \\"innocent attractions\\", which is when girls have crushes on someone. \\"Seduced by sex\\", discusses when girls regret why they had sex and wondering why they didn't wait for a more perfect time. In this section they discuss what they think. Diverse sexualities discusses girls trying to discover their sexuality. They also talk about being manipulated and controlled by boys and men. Finally, the part about broken-hearted independence talks about parental involvement in their daughters' break-ups. Finally, the fifth part discusses academic conflicts, depression and therapy. It also discusses problems that some girls have had with their race, identity and prejudice. Some girls are confused about their religion and that's why they question their faith. Finally the last section in this book is feminist pride which I think is a good way to finish off a book about adolescent girls. This section discusses what some girls think about feminism. In general terms, this book would be good for someone in search of oneself or for someone try to find out what some of the problems are that adolescent girls face. This book is also good for pleasure reading. I found it very interesting because the girls in here were honest and were just telling the truth about their life experiences."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"I read &quot;Reviving Ophelia&quot; about a year ago. I was intrigued when I saw &quot;Ophelia Speaks&quot; at Borders and knew I had to read it. I loved it. I only wish I didn't see myself on many of its pages. My two favorite contributions had to be the poem &quot;Catalogues,&quot; the opening poem in the Media-Fed Images chapter and &quot;Fight Girl Power&quot; in the Feminist Pride chapter. I found it interesting to note that Shandler said Ophelia was drowned by the weight of her skirts and neglected to mention another theory, one that truly encompasses the meaning of &quot;Ophelia Speaks.&quot; Another theory is that Ophelia commited suicide because she was pregnant with Hamlet's baby. Mentioning this theory would have given the book more meaning. While it is true that girls face many hardships as teenagers, these are a part of growing up. These problems are part of everyday life. For example, like millions of teenage girls, I have suffered from depression and was in therapy. I tried several different antidepressants before finding the right one. I have experienced the death of grandparents. I have been ridiculed by cliques and rejected by friends. I have questioned my religion. My point is, our culture does not necessarily &quot;girl-poison.&quot; Rather, we live life. I also don't like the fact that all this negativity is placed on teenage girls in particular. With already shaky self-esteem, the last thing we need is others saying we are &quot;poisoned&quot; by society and our futures are doomed. Why aren't there books about the fall of teenage boys? They are the more violent ones of society. After the school shootings that took place in Colorado, why aren't psychologists writing books about them? I think someone should write a book called &quot;Reviving Hamlet&quot; or something. Overall, &quot;Ophelia Speaks&quot; was an awesome book. I think Shandler should write a sequel. As a nineteen-year- old teenage girl, I would definately contribute something."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"I found the book very useful. It protrays the terrible problems many teenagers face today in a compassionate manner. If you are having a diffiuclt time with adolescence these stories will show you that you are not alone. The book does not pretend to represent a balance segment of the population but shows mostly people who are going through difficult situations. This is the kind of reading many teenagers are looking for in an effort to understand the world they are living in. Gripping read."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"This book is not just some teen push aside book. This book has had the power to change my life by making me think about other people's situations besides my own."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"this book is amazing! i enjoyed it so much! it's my favorite book. a teen usually doesn't have the chance to read about the lives, struggles and triumphs of other teens across the country. it's so authentic and realistic. it's great to be able to relate to other teens and know that you are not alone, and also be able to look at the experiences of others, and just enjoy stepping into their lives. This book is a marvel. A must for every teenage girl. AND it's definitley WAY better than &quot;Chicken Soup.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"While I commend the editor for putting together this project, and respect the girls whose stories are included, I feel that the book is unbalanced. Almost all the girls included seem to be going through some pretty extreme experiences. An adolescent-psychologist told me that 1/3 of teenagers have major problems, 1/3 have minor problems and 1/3 navigate adolescence fairly smoothly. This book seemed to focus on teens in the first two groups. Perhaps they are the ones who responded to the editor's request for articles on eating disorders, drug abuse, suicide attempts, etc, and on down the list til her last and only strongly positve category, Why I am proud to be female. Perhaps girls who are enjoying life and involved in more positive activities aren't as inclined to sit down and write about it. Was the editor's aim to show that teenage girls are ill-fated, in line with the thesis of Reviving Ophelia? Also, some of the writing in these responses is poor and not really worth reading whatever the content."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"I couldn't even finish Ophelia Speaks. I was disappointed because I wanted a reponse to the Pipher book but this wasn't it. I teach teen age girls who live turbulent lives. Most of them are poor and I don't think many of them would tell the stories that were in this book. There are many resilent young women out here and I wish their stories would be told. A balance of voices would have made this a better book.

The point of this book was not to give a bland, statistical overview of teenage girls today.The point of &quot;Ophelia Speaks&quot; is to allow teenage girls to speak about themselves.

One thing I didn't like was the section on body image, because even though i understand how some people think they're overweight when they're not, that they're just themselves. (which is a good thing) but there's also the fact that some people aren't overweight...in fact, they're really skinny, and therefore people automatically think that they're anorexic. that's just as bad as people thinking overweight people are ugly and that they've got an eating problem. besides that, the book in general was pretty good."},{"Title":"Ophelia Speaks","review":"A now-classic book, Mary Pipher's _Reviving Ophelia_ strived to convey the struggles of adolescent girls who were coming of age in \\"a girl-poisoning culture.\\" However, 17-year-old Sara Shandler realized the best way to do this would be allow the girls to speak for themselves. Passionately engaged in her mission, Sara collected over 800 contributions from adolescent girls on a variety of topics including depression, eating disorders, substance use, self-harm, sexuality, relationships, religion, and death. Selecting the most poignant of these writings, Sara allowed the original voices of the Ophelias to finally be heard:\\"_Ophelia Speaks_ is intended to represent both side of our adolescence--our often austere reality as well as our self-affirming laughter. Adolescence has robbed us of some of our youthful giggles, but happiness still remains. Despite our struggles, we have faith in our future...I am hopeful that _Ophelia Speaks_ will raise a consciousness of adolescent girls' struggles.\\" (p. 280)Although the book was published in 1999, it still speaks quite loudly and continues to raise that consciousness.

When you open this book and begin reading, you are immediately exposed to the heartaches, hardships, joys, fears, smiles, and tears of hundreds of teenage girls from across North America. REAL teenage girls. Each and every story, poem, and experience shared in this book is honest, compassionate, moving, intimate, and most of all - REAL. There are so many feelings and emotions poured out onto this book's pages that I can relate to and share with the writers. Some of the things I read in this book...I thought no one else felt but me. It made me feel like I am not alone in my fears, self-judgments, wants, needs, and emotional ordeals. I recommend this book to every single teenage girl out there, and every single mother of a teenage girl. Thank you, Sara Shandler, for compiling such a masterpiece, and a shoulder to cry on.

Yes, there were some valid essays that enlightened me, but some of them would have been better left in thier private journals where they can fantasize about all the pain and suffering they are enduring. Most of these girls need to learn about what it's really like being a woman-- a strong, independant woman."},{"Title":"Ruse","review":"Enter the Detective (the collection of the first six issues of the &quot;Ruse&quot; series) sucked me in, and so I had to continue the adventure in this volume. Again, the setting is very similar to gaslight Victorian England and the book opens with super-genius detective Simon Archard and his assistant/partner Emma on a train, bound for the countryside. The first two chapters follow them as they try and track down Simon's archnemesis by finding some tribe of gypsies. This takes them to a strange town that is uninhabited by day, full of townspeople at night, and seething with evil. The mystery here is quite a good one, creepy and effective.The third chapter is a murder mystery which puts Archard fully on the trail of his archnemesis. The final three chapters play out their subterranean mano-a-mano battle amidst fantastically elaborate clockwork constructions, with Emma making the occaisional valuable contribution. Their struggle is interspersed with flashbacks explaining their history together, and how they came to be enemies. It's a titanic struggle that ends up unresolved, with further adventures to follow which tie back into the evil magical baroness of Enter the Detective . The story is laced with humor and plenty of witty banter between Simon and Emma.As in the first volume, the artwork is unbelievably rich and detailed, every panel is excellent, and many times unusual perspectives are given to the most mundane scene to make it interesting. The panel flow can be a bit confusing at times (a couple times I had to break stride to figure out if I was supposed to read across the both pages, or continue down the left-hand page), but it's a small price to pay for the inventive paneling. The level of detail on clothing, architecture, and interiors is just amazing, and the colors work perfectly in conjunction. Great artwork with a compelling storyline that hearkens back to the adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Moriarity."},{"Title":"Ruse","review":"Those jonesing for some cool out of left field comic books can't go much wrong with RUSE, the only negative being that RUSE is now a defunct series, a casualty of its publisher CrossGen Comics's capsizing. But, for 26 issues, RUSE gave its readers something different and smart and fun. If you're the sort who relishes Victorian era detective mysteries - and, in particular, Sherlock Holmes mysteries - and if you don't mind a whiff of the supernatural, then go and dig up this old bone.The fantasticRuse: Enter the Detective (Ruse Traveler)introduced the central characters and also recurring sorcerous villainess, the Baroness Miranda Cross. The six issues collected in that TPB are must-reads as writer Mark Waid sets up his world-building and begins to work in key themes and ongoing plot points. One such arc, Archard's discovery that an old enemy yet lives, leads directly into this second volume THE SILENT PARTNER (collecting issues #7-12).Pressing on with the Sherlock Holmes motif, the predominant push of this stretch of issues is peerless (but oh so insolent) consulting detective Simon Archard's hunt for his demented archnemesis and once mentor/partner Malcolm Lightbourne (think Prof. Moriarty). Lightbourne had long ago been driven mad by the influence of and his pursuit of the Enigmatic Prism, an ancient artifact rumored to corrupt whosoever claims it. Lightbourne had long been working behind the scenes to wreak vengeance on Archard and to obtain the Prism, which he believes is safeguarded by Archard.Archard and his lovely, spirited associate Emma Bishop depart the bustling city of Partington for a train trip halfway across the continent in pursuit of a lead to Lightbourne's whereabouts, even though Emma is tremendously irked that Archard is keeping things close to the vest with concern to their quarry. After surviving attempts on their lives by agents of the Consortium of Aggrieved Man Servants, Archard and Emma end up in a foreboding secluded village where, mysteriously, the residents emerge only at night. A band of harried gypsies get involved, a great wrong is righted, and interesting facts are unearthed regarding Malcolm Lightbourne. So it was a good trip.Archard and Emma return to Partington and bump into a murder mystery and the possibility that mercenary daughters may have killed off their father. We also meet a feisty bearded dwarf lady from the circus who ends up lending a hand in the investigation. From there, Archard at last chases down Lightbourne, who by this time is so far gone that his latest devilish scheme revolves around the devastation of the city of Partington from below. It's a harrowing subterranean showdown which also offers moments of respite as Lightbourne falls prey to cliched super-villain talky-talk. This allows us revealing flashbacks which chronicle how Lightbourne came to recruit a young and stammering (yet already brilliant) Simon Archard to his detective enterprise. We then learn of Lightbourne's gradual descent to obsession and madness as the Enigmatic Prism enters the picture, and of the resulting falling out between the partners.CrossGen Comics has a way of drawing out the best from its staff. Not only did the CrossGen artists turn in some of their best work in their careers, but ditto the writers. So I guess CrossGen's system of having all its staff collaborating under one roof had merit (although, from what I understand, Mark Waid was permitted to work offsite). But Waid knows how to turn in complex plotting and he's always had a handle on characterization. There's so much to like here, from the intriguing lead characters to the recurring cast which pops in and out. Emma Bishop is beautiful and engaging and the story is chronicled from her first-person perspective. On the other hand, Simon Archard isn't very likeable, the benefits of his formidable intellect somewhat stymied by his aloofness and a sheer arrogance which threatens to surpass that of Sherlock Holmes'. But dude's certainly compelling.I'm very curious about Archard's network of operatives and also about the bumbling Consortium of Aggrieved Man Servants, which are butlers bent on killing Archard only to persistently botch it up. For whatever reason Archard seems to be oblivious to these attempts, but it's good for some laughs. The witty, caustic banter between the two leads continues to be a strength of the series, and I don't know that at times Emma isn't as withering in her comments as Archard.The moody Victorian era is well realized, thanks to strong attention to detail given over to 19th Century decorum, the architecture, and costumes, and there's also a hint of steampunk sensibilities. I dig that Partington exudes a sense of otherworldliness, brought about by virtue of the gargoyles, common as pigeons, habitually darkening Partington's skies. And, again, magic occasionally rears its head, in which case Simon Archard merely factors it into his calculations. Not to mention, as we learned from the first volume ENTER THE DETECTIVE, Emma Bishop herself has the ability to momentarily freeze time, even though she's restricted from using it and Archard is ignorant of this particular talent of hers. The cases which Archard and Emma get into are elaborate enough, although I wish Waid had laid out more clues along the way so that the readers can take a crack at solving the mysteries.Butch Guice's artwork is so very important to RUSE. I've checked his stuff out before in X-FACTOR and in ACTION COMICS, and honestly he's never been as masterful as in RUSE. His semi-photorealistic style here perfectly suits the series. For example, realistically rendering the folds and wrinkles of a character's wardrobe may not be big whoop, but I happen to think it's one of those key ingredients which determine how grounded the artwork and, therefore, the story is. Guice can draw folds and wrinkles, as well as architecture relevant to the period. And you'll rapidly notice that he's pretty damn impressive with drawing de gorgeous ladies. And, not to leave out Mike Perkins, who provides the complementary inks, and Laura Depuy, who does big things with the color palette.And, yes, as a word to the wise, Guice's panels tend to roam straight across the pages, so that you have to read the thing all the way across instead of one page at a time. You get used to it.Interestingly RUSE is one of the few titles in the CrossGen company which isn't tied directly into the Sigilverse. Having said that, the odds are that Emma Bishop is either a First, most likely a Sigil-Bearer's guide, or herself a Sigil-Bearer (most of the CrossGen comics feature a sigil, a mark of power branded on a key character and granting that person an extraordinary power). And it's easy to miss, but note that Archard's cravat pin is shaped like the sigil logo. For whatever that means. And that's what's sorry about this series, thru no fault of its own. CrossGen's financial collapse cut off RUSE's run at 26 issues and left its readers hanging. So we never do find out if Archard is actually a Sigil-Bearer, or how RUSE fits into CrossGen's larger picture. Another fallout is that the third planned collection trade RUSE Vol. 3: CRIMINAL INTENT never made it into publication. CRIMINAL INTENT would've featured the debut of Scott Beatty, who takes over writing the series with issue #13 (although he'd already been providing the script since issue #10). Mark Waid, by the way, left the series after issue #12, he and the CrossGen muckamucks mutually citing creative differences. So, well. Still, even if this is all we get of this terrific comic book, then my philosophy is that some of RUSE is better than none of RUSE. It's that good.By the way, if you dig RUSE's vibe and if you're salivating (which is gross) for more sleuths plying their trade in magical environments, you may want to look up Lin Carter's Dr. Anton Zarnak stories, Randall Garrett's Lord Darcy, and Seabury Quinn's Jules de Grandin. See ya!"},{"Title":"Ruse","review":"This is a close approximation to Sherlock Holmes in comic form. As well as being a fan of Sherlock Holmes I am a big fan of comics so was pleased to have two of my favorites rolled into one.In Ruse Simon Archer is the worlds greatest detective, with his assistant Emma Bishop. The only comparison to Holmes is the character personalities. Otherwise this is a separate world with it's own secrets and comic wonders. The mysteries are well written and I attribute that the the profound writing of Mark Waid who has written some of the best Graphic novels which include Kingdom Come. The feel of the stories is similar to Conan Doyle's own style of writing an engaging mystery. The art work if very well done as well so not only was this a joy to read but also quite impressive in the visual sense.In my opinion the character of Simon Archer feels almost like a combination of Sherlock Holmes and Batman. He relies heavily on building gadgets to pass time and has created his own base of operations from a converted chapel. So it is not an apartment on 221 Baker Street, or a secluded cave, but it seems to mesh the two characters very well into one. Archer's assistant is not a doctor or really has any vocation other than trying to keep up with Archer. In the first issue of this graphic novel we are lead to believe she has an underlying mission which keeps her with Archer but that fails to develop so don't hang on that little bit of information for now. Enjoy the mysteries as they happen. She also is hiding a bit of a secret from Archer, she has super powers. Where these powers come from and exactly what she is capable of are still a mystery to the reader after finishing Vol 1, so I hope a little more light is shed in volume two.The only thing, for me, that kept this from being a 5 star review is the supernatural aspect of the story and lack of resolution or development for Miss Bishops powers. I felt that the mystery would be just fine without pulling in to play these secret powers that she is troubled with keeping from her partner Archer. After doing much research on this project I found that Mark Waid didn't want to write a supernatural aspect to the story but was pressured into it by the publishing company. That is clearly evident as the powers of Miss Bishop seemed to disappear three issues in. The company also went Bankrupt after the series had wrapped and only had published 2 of the potential 4 volumes this series will encompass. I fear I will never know the true secrets Miss Bishop his hiding from Archer and us the reader. I'll just have to read on."},{"Title":"That I May Be His Own: An Overview of Luther's Catechisms","review":"Dr. Arand's basic premise is that Lutherans desperately need to return to Luther's Small Catechism so the reformer's understanding of Scripture (what I would argue as the correct understanding) doesn't get lost in the midst of pop American evangelicalism (not bashing them, but their understanding of God is like low fat ice cream ... you get the idea but it lacks the richness).However, before this can be done, we need to rediscover the catechism, the purpose behind it's structure, and how it shapes the Christian's worldview. This leads to catechesis that is far superior to the standard overview of the different segments and memorization of Luther's meanings. While no section of the book disappoints, chapter 5 alone is worth double the book's price as it identifies how the chief parts interrelate and flow together to create a complete and unified worldview.If pastors, DCE's, and teachers used Arand's book to train themselves in how to teach the catechism, there would be no desire for \\"The Purpose Driven Life\\" in Lutheran circles because people would have a far superior \\"Catechism Driven Life.\\""},{"Title":"That I May Be His Own: An Overview of Luther's Catechisms","review":"To this day, Lutherans often view Luther's Small Catechism as a means to an end: confirmation. Therefore, we see the catechism as a book for children, not for all Christians, as if it were like most other schoolbooks: something to tolerate until graduation and then discard as refuse. To this Arand writes a scholarly, refuting tour de force. Instead, Arand shows us through his well-researched book that we should see the catechism as an \\"owner's manual,\\" for it contains more than information on what to know, but how to live.In chapter two, Arand shows that not until the 16th century did the term \\"catechism\\" become linked with only a formal instruction in the faith for confirmation. Throughout the history of the Church, catechetical instruction has taken place in sermons, confessional manuals, prayer books--besides formal instruction. Even preaching incorporated the catechism, for sermons and the catechism both go to the heart of the Christian faith.In chapter three, Arand really shines. There he shows that Luther wrote his catechisms to be with the Christian from baptismal font to grave. That the Small Catechism remain with a Christian, Luther designed that it be internalized at three levels. First, Luther wanted the catechism to be learned. For this to happen, he specified three tiers where children would be taught: Parents took the primary role, with pastors and government taking on auxiliary functions. Luther wrote the catechism for memorization (in the German) for a largely illiterate culture; thus, he used alliteration, assonance, repetition, strong verbs, and concrete nouns. Second, Luther wanted the Catechism to be understood. To aid this level of knowledge, he employed a series of questions and explanations, the most common being, \\"What is this?\\" Third, Luther wanted the Catechism to take root in a person through meditation and continual relearning of the Catechism. Such a third level of learning would keep the Christian centered amid the travails of life.In Chapter four, we learn that even the arrangement of Luther's Small Catechism carries meaning! The Small Catechism's order has a dynamic that is theologically significant, because each chief part of the Catechism must be read and interpreted in light of the whole. Luther's ordering of the Catechism is the Law-Gospel rhythm of Christian life--and part of catechesis itself. The Catechism's shape is the shape of the Christian life. First, we are brought to repentance by knowing our inadequacy to meet God's demands (Ten Commandments). Yet, through the life-creating Word (the Creed), faith is worked. Next is our response to God: Prayer (the Our Father). The Catechism presents the doctrine of the Gospel in its fullness with its chief article--justification--at its center. The life of the Christian shaped by the Catechism is one that uplifts God's gifts, not human works. In the structure of the Catechism, we see Law and Gospel correctly ordered and treated, and the response of faith, prayer, taught is a way that is rooted in God's word. By learning the shape of the Catechism, we learn the shape of the Christian life: one of continual repentance and yearning for God's life-giving Word and Sacraments.Finally, Arand brings to light how Luther's Small Catechism can help Christians live the life of faith. For faith is no mere adjunct of Christian living; it touches and influences every aspect of life. Luther's Small Catechism concentrates our attention on faith and then shapes our living with a worldview flowing from faith. The first section (the Ten Commandments, the Creed, and the Lord's Prayer) shows a Christian life as it is lived out in faith. Only by relying on God can one use his possessions properly; thus, the Creed and the Our Father help the Christian keep the Ten Commandments! The second section (baptism, absolution, and the Lord's Supper) hones in on three foci of worship and how they nourish faith-life. For the Word of God works through various forms and effects what it says--it is not mere information. The final section (Daily Prayers and Table of Callings) establishes how Christians live out their faith in their daily lives, for the doctrine of faith centers the Christian on God's gifts in every sphere of life.When we see the catechism as an \\"owners manual,\\" it helps shape and inform our lives--also making us a better \\"second text\\" from which to interpret all aspects of faith-life: how to interpret the written Word, how to serve our neighbor out of faith. The Catechism's brevity makes it easily meditated over, helping open an entire world where faith informs and shapes all that we do.I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"That I May Be His Own: An Overview of Luther's Catechisms","review":"If you want to go deeper in your understanding of Luther's catechisms, of how they came about or what each section means then this is the book for you. It is easy to understand and edifies the teaching treasures of Martin Luther. The Lutheran church can only benefit from recovering the depth of meaning in the Small Catechism and passing it on to confirmation students and adults alike."},{"Title":"Know It All! Grades 9-12 Reading (K-12 Study Aids)","review":"I teach in an urban, diverse school teaching both ends of the spectrum, lower/non readers and advanced English students. All of them struggle with the standardized tests. I was looking for more guidance, lists of grade level vocabulary, etc. This book seems to be more of the same, maybe helpful to new teachers. Veterans should already know most of what is in this book.The chapters are short and easy to read and can be used as quick lessons/review. It will be interesting to see if test scores improve after using this book. If so, I will revise my review...until then...luke warm."},{"Title":"One Bright Star (Katiah)","review":"I can't decide if I liked this book or not...The concept is interesting (even if it doesn't remotely match the cover synopsis!), but the actual story was so eerie and disturbing, I never developed a connection to the heroine, Brehan. I was left with the very unsatisfying feeling that the hero Erth deserves someone far better than Brehan. She just seems too emotionally damaged to ever love him the way he loves her. That said, the story did intrigue me, and I'll probably read the sequels if they are ever published. My motivation won't be to revisit beloved characters, though...instead I'll be hoping Brehan will fight off her &quot;evil side&quot; and turn into a character I can root for...Be forewarned, this is NOT a typical futuristic or fantasy romance. Perhaps if the cover had actually reflected the real story, I would have been better prepared for what I found inside."},{"Title":"One Bright Star (Katiah)","review":"This book should not be categorized as a romance. There are romantic elements in it, but it does not have the required happy ending of a romance. The story is also not finished in any sense of the meaning. It feels like half a book, so it is very very frustrating at the end. On page two the evil intelligence inside of the heroine is talking to her, on the last page that evil intelligence is still there inside her, and she is still pretty oblivious to it and nobody has done anything about it. I also found Brehan's actions to be really obnoxious, to the degree that I would have to classify her as Too Stupid To Live. Erth was an interesting character but I found it pretty hard to believe that he would love Brehan since she always behaved so badly to him."},{"Title":"One Bright Star (Katiah)","review":"The concept of this book is intreeging (sorry for the incorrect spelling!). Little known, little loved women kidnapped to become the mothers of a new race. &quot;What would I have done in that situation?&quot; is a question that begs to be asked, but most of us probably would not have reacted like the female supporting characters did. Sure, abused idealists might (no offense intended to anyone who reads this), but a lot of us would react more akin to how Brehan did. Throw in the mysterious, protective Di'me, and the plot grows richer. What with her ambition to take control over the universe from Erth's family, and then destroy humankind (assuming that is what the exerpt at the front of the book meant), things become that much more exciting. What becomes so strange about this extra spiritual (in every sense of the word) baggage, is that so many people know that there is something strange in the way Brehan looks and acts when she is angry or scared, and the info never gets to Erth! What I mean is, first, Brehan's friends keep insisting that her eyes change color. If they are so sure, why not present the information to someone who might know something about it, like a doctor. Secondly, these color-changes keep coinciding with Brehan's blackouts, and Di'me's risings. If I were Brehan, I would be worried enough about the blackouts, and to know that my eyes appear to change color each time I do, would be enough for me to seek help if I had not already done so. Plus, toward the end, when the medic found the two spirits inside Brehan, he didn't tell his subject, when it was pretty clear she didn't know about it herself, the way she spoke about a noisy conscience. More later if I can get back to it."},{"Title":"One Bright Star (Katiah)","review":"The book did not end just left you hanging so if you want to know what happens you have to buy the next book.

Should be titled one dim bulb. The story idea is great. The execution is dismal. Mickee only fully develops a single character, her heroine, the dual entity Brehan Tucker, who has a fiery spirit, a horrific past and impressive powers when under the influence of her co-being. She doesn't supply enough information for the reader to care about any of the other characters, except possibly Brehan's alien love god. The story jumps from one unconnected scene to another making it incredibly difficult for the reader to get involved."},{"Title":"One Bright Star (Katiah)","review":"I enjoyed the book and the concept.

Besides that, its hard for me to empathize with the character when I don't know if she's a split personality, has an alien being within her, or what. I know this will probably come out in the sequel/s, but for now I'm just confused. Otherwise, I like the unique plot and the way Brehan doesn't just give in when she feels lust in her bones."},{"Title":"One Bright Star (Katiah)","review":"I loved the book and can't wait until the sequal comes out. My biggest problem was that the synopsis on the back didn't match the book content. In the copy I have, there is no mention of a boyfriend and the job that was vaguely mentioned was that of a singer. Am I missing a chapter? I feel like the front part of the book was chopped and I missed a lot. Maybe some background on the orphanage and her friends, Joy and Lisa and the evil Mrs. Pitts would help (or is that explained more in the sequals?)

Susan Futterman has written a well balanced book that incorporates the best of all you need - symptoms, guidelines and most of all - validity for what you may be suffering at the hands of the bully at work. Very well written and I highly recommend it for a person who is or has experienced bullying or is involved with a person who is going through bullying. If you are involved with a person who is being bullied - please support them. Its really hard to emphasize because of the toxic nature of the workplace bully. But the one being bullied needs support from friends and family. My recommendation for anyone being bullied - GET OUT as soon as you can!!!!!"},{"Title":"When You Work for a Bully: Assessing Your Options and Taking Action","review":"I am in the process of doing a workshop and needed material. I reviewed the book and found that it had the information I needed. I know that this workshop will be a help to our participants."},{"Title":"When You Work for a Bully: Assessing Your Options and Taking Action","review":"I found this book very helpful - empowering, informative and compassionate. It is a comprehensive plan of action packed with ample practical advice, extensive listings of resources and bibliography. In her book, Susan Futterman points out and discusses multiple options and solutions (how to maintain healthcare coverage, how to plan and reallocate financial resources, how to apply for disability if need arises, how to pursue legal remedies, how to fight attempts of blacklisting etc) which can be easily overlooked by someone distressed by workplace bullying.This book enables workers to remain in proactive control of their careers and lives, to overcome emotional, financial and professional damage caused by workplace bullying/mobbing and to successfully move on after such devastating experience. What a huge amount of time and effort it must've taken for the author to research all this information and to put it together. Thank you.I wholeheartedly recommend this \\"anti-bullying guide\\" not only to those who already found themselves in a hostile workplace situation, but also to any employed individuals (workplace bullying remains widespread; often it's a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time - and it never hurts to be prepared) as well as to those in a position to assist people targeted by bullying - therapists, counselors, legal specialists, employment agents, arbitrators, HR professionals, and others supposed to handle such situations and to facilitate the process of \\"moving on\\" for their clients.

From financial concerns to preserving job integrity and seeking government assistance, WHEN YOU WORK FOR A BULLY juxtaposes case history examples with practical tips. Very highly recommended: it provides specifics rather than theory."},{"Title":"When You Work for a Bully: Assessing Your Options and Taking Action","review":"I can see why some people love this book. It talks about how awful bullies are how much they can destroy your life, and it goes into great detail about how to quit, how to manage your finances after you quit, how to pursue legal action to get revenge on the bully, and how to get a new job.However, this book is supposed to be about \\"assessing your option\\" - indicating it might actually help you WORK with the bully. In reality, the author, Susan Futterman, pretty much tells you up fron that it is completely hopeless to work with a bully and exhorts you to sue them instead. Entire chapters are dedicated to your legal options. In fact in one section she talks about how most wise career coaches would tell you to leave the company with grace, since it is your own career and life that you are maintaining. She says this is balderdash, that it's much more rewarding to get emotional satisfaction for yourself and burn those bridges.Reading the bio material, it appears that Susan was herself bullied by a boss, she parted ways with that boss, and the experience caused her to write the book. So one gets the sense that in her case it was futile to find a solution with the bully and now she wants to coach everyone else in the situation to go through that transition using what she learned about getting COBRA insurance, getting on food stamps, and so on. Yes, I appreciate that for people who take her specific path, this book is very helpful. But - again - what about the many people who are looking for tips to COPE and SURVIVE with a bully? She gives up on them very quickly.So, let's start at the beginning. Susan does briefly cover how to differentiate between a regular manager and a bully. A regular manager will try to phrase criticism so it is at least reasonably constructive. You did well on the report, but need to focus more on catching typos. A bully will constantly criticize, and even the very rare compliments will have a criticism in them. Bullying isn't about one act. It's about a continual, constant stream of criticisms. You could look at one specific instance and think it wasn't that bad if it was a one time thing, but because it happens constantly with no let-up it becomes bullying.If your boss has a legitimate concern - for example you agreed that your sales quota for March was $X and you made nowhere near $X - then your boss has a correct reason to bring this up and press you to do better. Bullying would be if you never set a quota, you followed his instructions and did everything he asked and he started yelling at you for not doing well enough. Some managers are simply clumsy. They have legitimate complaints with your work and simply do not express their frustration well. With those managers you can learn how to \\"manage your manager\\", gently guide them towards a more productive feedback cycle so you can indeed meet the goals. However, with a bully, you never have goals. You don't get useful feedback, you don't get any constructive direction on how to achieve what they want. You just get abuse, yelling, criticisms and demeaning comments.Bullies usually don't see themselves as bullies! They think they are great, powerful managers. They think they are brutally honest and feel that's a good trait. They feel that they're incredibly thorough, and do not see it as micro-managing or nit-picking. They do not realize their reactions are completely lacking in productive value. They think their yelling should be enough to get the job done.This information was all *wonderful* and I was incredibly psyched after reading all of this to get into the meat of the matter. After all this was only the first part of the book! We were exploring the nature of bullies, a bit about what made them tick, and how to make sure we weren't calling a \\"people-challenged\\" manager a bully just because they were on the gruff side. There was hope to turn the situation around.Unfortunately, right there is where the helpful information for me ended. The book goes right into \\"prepare to leave immediately - and here is how\\". It was a real surprise to me. It is like getting a book on \\"how to work out things with your grumpy husband\\" and having the book say \\"OK this is why husbands can be grumpy. X, Y, Z. Here is what you do - get divorced! Get a great lawyer, sue the guy for all he's worth, and rant to your friends for years afterward about the waste of time he was.\\"I'm not too far off here. Susan pushes hard for everyone to leave their boss. Journal in detail every thing you do while you're leaving, because you might be able to sue him for millions. Only do what is required of you at the job. Be calm and professional, to bolster your legal case, and document every request and copy every request back to him. Put it all in your legal files. Have witnesses around for any interactions, and get them to sign legal documents.Then she goes into all the \\"aftermath\\". She talks in great detail about finance issues, how to clean up your budget, how to use Canadian pharmacies to save cash? She goes in detail about how someone goes about quitting, and how to negotiate for a nice package on the way out. She talks about the ins and outs of job searching. And, of course, she has a very dense area on legal options and how to get back at your bully boss.I can see if the book was titled \\"Bully Boss - How to Quit, Sue, and Seek Revenge\\". That would be the perfect title for this book. Again, she explicitly tells people that instead of leaving quietly, that it is far more satisfying to leave in a way that lets you exorcise your demons against your bully boss and get you the satisfaction you've craved. She says this even while acknowledging that career coaches would warn you this is the worst thing for your future career. She exhorts you to rant and rave to friends for months afterward, to cleanse your system. Every book I've read on healing focuses on filling yourself with calm, rewarding, encouraging thoughts - not with evil, revenge-fantasy harm-someone diatribes.If you are working with a bully and are ALREADY thinking about quitting - and really need help landing on your feet - then I'd recommend this book. It does have a lot of detail about the steps you take in order to quit and make that transition. But if your issue is that you think your boss is a bully and want to get ideas for how to cope, this is NOT the book for you. Since that was - to me - what it was presenting itself to be, I would give this 3/5 stars."},{"Title":"When You Work for a Bully: Assessing Your Options and Taking Action","review":"Many, maybe most people identify themselves by their profession or the company that they work for. Many times it is a happy, fulfilling part of their life, but if is isn't, there is a good chance someone at your workplace is making you miserable.If that person is your boss, who constantly undermines your work to the point you question your very self, and when works becomes a source of stress, causing physical ailments, this book will help you decide the path you need to take.Bullying is unfortunately very real in the workplace and, at least in the US, a legal (though unethical) way to manage employees.

Great book...loved it!!!!!"},{"Title":"Straight Talk Volumes I & II","review":"First of all, I have to say that it's refreshing to hear a man talk about how to physically please a woman in such detail, as a woman's sexuality is indeed complex on so many levels. It is obvious that the author took the time to know what he was talking about. I was impressed with the attention the author gives to a woman's emotional and spiritual needs as well. This book was definitely an easy read. I read both volumes in about 4 hours. My only question is, Does the key to a sucessful relationship really live in these books? I think this is just a piece of the puzzle. The author tailors the language for men with layers of sports analogies and \\"game time\\" advice which gets the point across but a little tiring at times. Especially when most women automatically assume that a man is running game and therefore insincere. In volume II, he offers pretty much anything you need to know about making your sex life as exciting as it can be...Now, that's what I'm talking about. Something is missing, though. As we evolve as couples and individuals, there are many factors that come into play which definitely affect our intimate relationships. For example: careers, physical changes (especially women), children, ambition...you see where I'm going. I don't think men really understand the changes women experience throughout life and how profound they are. Take a woman in her 30s. A high percentage are career professionals, mothers, etc. Myself included in this category. We aren't supposed to be freaky and hot but here's a newsflash. We are freakier and hotter that ever! There are a lot of men that don't take advantage of it. Take note gentlemen, there is nothing like a woman in her thirties! All in all, you can see that Straight Talk has definitely been thought provoking for me. It's just another piece to the puzzle of continued growth. Thank you for your perspective Mr. Wright."},{"Title":"Straight Talk Volumes I & II","review":"&quot;Straight Talk&quot; is a must read! The author, Gerry Wright, has not only touched on the success &quot;rules&quot; of how to please a woman physically, but with his observations, he has hit how to win a woman's heart emotionally. What surprised me was that the author happens to be a man! Men often believe that they know what it is that makes a woman tick, but really they haven't got a clue. &quot;Straight talk&quot; provides a step by step formation from preparing yourself correctly, the &quot;dos and don'ts,&quot; what is important in a relationship, both physically and mentally, and how to keep it strong. You will not find another book like this. What is unique, is that it is not some boring, hard to read material that often are seen in books. You will find an easy reading, humorous, and straight forward dialogue that you will not be able to put down! I really enjoyed the books, and would highly recommend them to every man. Even if you think you may know everything about what a woman wants, check these books out... you may learn something new!"},{"Title":"Straight Talk Volumes I & II","review":"As a 33 year old married man, who thought he knew a lot about pleasuring a woman. I realized the the naivete of those primitive he-male thoughts. I feel extremely fortunate to have found this book. Finally somebody is telling it like it is and holding his head up high in the process. Every woman should be purchasing a copy of this for the man in their lives. For the fellas, remember nobody is above a few pointers. In my humble opinion Mr. Wright eloquently and factually I might add, cuts as closely to the bone as I have ever read. BRAVO...."},{"Title":"Straight Talk Volumes I & II","review":"Straight Talk is solidly in my top five picks for book of the year. Though the author is not yet a polished writer, his raw style and incredibly keen insight is right on target.This book deserves more than 5 stars. This book is unlike any other relationship book you will ever read. Extremely funny, informative, bold and unpredictable, Straight Talk takes men on a wild journey of self-discovery. What begins as a light hearted look at the things that females find attractive in men, ends with the author explaining to men that women won't equate their enthusiasm during love making to be an expression of their love. Later he very clearly explains that men must learn to express their love in a way that women can interpret it.It's too bad that this book is not used in universities and colleges to help men better understand women and &quot;get their game together&quot; before beginning a relationship. Many couples would be spared the heart ache and pain that accompanies so many relationships.One of the best things in life is having a woman you love and having that woman love you back. This book provides all the necessary instructions for every man to have this in his life."},{"Title":"Straight Talk Volumes I & II","review":"Fellas, get your game together, the &quot;love game&quot; that is! This message definitely comes across loud and clear from former European pro basketball star Gerry Wright. In 2-sizzling hot volumes titled, Straight Talk: Playing For Keeps and Papa's Got a Brand New Bag, Wright gives raw tutorials on winning a woman's love and affection.The book flows easily with an urban humor that brings to mind the comic styles of Richard Pryor and Chris Rock. However, the sharp humor and comic riffs are only used as accents to lighten his tell-it-like-it-is, straight-no-chaser delivery which goes right to the heart of serious man/woman communication, relationship and sexual issues. His mixture of tenderness, humor and hard-edged advice is masterful. He wittingly coaches men, and up-lifts women. This a must read for anyone, man or woman interested in improving their lovelife and relationship."},{"Title":"Straight Talk Volumes I & II","review":"G. Wright is 'right on' with his descriptions of how a man should behave, smell, and present themselves if they want to catch the woman of their dreams. Being a mother of 3 boys and married twice, I can guarantee all of you men out there, that G. Wright is correct in his instructions in how to win your woman over. I have been teaching my boys to 'clean their ears, brush their teeth, apply cologne, open the doors, keep a clean room', as I know that a great woman is out there for them and they need these basic traits to win her over. So, gentlemen, from a true MLIF, pay attention to Gerry's instructions. He is on the mark and will make your life a living joy. And for those of you that love sex as much as I do, his second book is a must read. Techniques to please your woman from now until the end of time are detailed. I would bet that your woman wouldn't even mind if you had the book right there to get the technique right. You'll send her over the top and asking for more every single day. Definately the finest books on how to love a woman...emotionally, physically and spiritually. Just what every woman wants."},{"Title":"Prayer: Asking and Receiving","review":"This book was like a breath of fresh air to me. At a time when I was hurting emotionally and wondered at God's hand in my circumstances, this book opened my eyes to God's gracious, loving, care for His own. Since that time I have reread it many times and always find fresh insigts on God's character, that He desires (and commands)us to pray, and that it is His very nature to hear AND ANSWER prayer. So often we hear &quot;God always answers prayer, either yes, no or maybe&quot;, yet Dr. Rice challenges this thinking, by using scripture to show that all true asking, if it's done according to the biblical guidelines, will receive the answer - exactly what was petitioned. He does make it clear that it is not always God's will to heal, and there is a chapter devoted to praying according to His will, and what that means, as well as two chapters devoted to hindered prayer. But he used many scriptures that challenged me to see that when I am not receiving answers to my prayers, that I need to examine and find out why. Dr. Rice is well-known and respected in Christian circles and is very sound theologically, basing everything on scripture. He also gives many examples of answered prayer from his own life and from other Christians. On a personal note - this book helped my prayer life to go from merely &quot;talking&quot; to God, to knowing how to &quot;petition&quot; Him with my requests, and I can personally testify to many answered prayers, that if I had not had the boldness to ask, I am sure I would not have been blessed by seeing God work out the answers in such ways that I knew it was Him alone that could answer so wonderfully. I have also seen Him answer specific requests for opportunities to share Christ with loved ones, and I can say without a doubt that my God is a &quot;Prayer-Hearing&quot; God. I am confident that Dr. Rice's teaching on the Bible verses about prayer will offer new insight and challenges to all who read it."},{"Title":"Prayer: Asking and Receiving","review":"Dr. John R Rice is a true man of God. Anyone who knew him or read his material knew that he was a man yeilded to God. He knew how to get a hold of God in a real way. He exposes the sin of hypocricy while in prayer and exhorts believers to ask great things from God. This is just an excellent book on the topic of prayer. Just about any John Rice literature is a blessing and a good read."},{"Title":"Prayer: Asking and Receiving","review":"This book is a welcome antidote to the empty, formalistic prayers we often pray and hear prayed in church today. Rice's faith in God is overwhelming. The introduction alone is enough to drive you to your knees in faith-filled prayer! I gave it 5 stars, but it deserves 6."},{"Title":"Prayer: Asking and Receiving","review":"This book differs from more recent books on this subject in a number of ways. For instance, Rice sees prayer as asking things from God. Other forms of verbal and nonverbal communication (e. g. worship) with God should not be considered prayer.Recent books tend to see unanswered prayer as primarily the result of the request being not in God's will or, more often, not being of God's timing. While not discounting these facts, Rice emphasizes sin as the primary cause of unanswered prayer. Rice is not sympathetic with the notion of God answering prayer in a different way from that asked by the one praying. In fact, he compares such a notion to asking an attendant to fill the car tank with gasoline and seeing it filled with something else instead.Lest his emphasis on sin cause discouragement, Rice also rejects the \\"unless you meet every single condition, you cannot get anything from God\\" mentality. He points out that the very fact of praying often leads a sinful believer to confession. Moroever, he points out that, if a person lacks sufficient faith for an immediate answered prayer, he may still qualify for an answered prayer through persistent praying."},{"Title":"Prayer: Asking and Receiving","review":"I am really loving to read this book, which leads me a good way to pray.And it gave me a lot of thinking about what the real prayer was and has been. I'd like to recommend this book who did not find what the real prayer meant during their parying lives.I'm sure this book will help you understand and it really means when you are in doubt for the prayer."},{"Title":"Prayer: Asking and Receiving","review":"This book is terrific. I have come to understand prayer much better. John R Rice points out many verses about prayer throughout the Bible and he also points out many prayers of biblical people in the Bible. He also gives testimony of his own answered prayers that was very encouraging. This book also helps understand how our prayers can be hindered by our lifestyle. Great book!"},{"Title":"Prayer: Asking and Receiving","review":"One of the best kept secrets to powerful Christian living is prayer. Unfortunately, Christianity in our time has been reduced to a moral code. We are led to believe that Christians are measured by how good they are and not necessarily by the presence of the supernatural in their life. Prayer is the way to invite God in tangible ways into your day-to-day experiences.If you are like many Christians and know you should pray more but need some encouragement or insights into effective praying, I would heartily recommend \\"Prayer: Asking and Receiving.\\" It is definitely one of the top two books on prayer that I've ever read (the other one is \\"How to Pray\\" by R.A. Torrey). I first purchased it as a paperback when I was in college for about a dollar. A preacher friend was getting rid of some books. I had no idea what a prized possession I bought that day until I began to read it for the first time.Rice's book is saturated with Scripture and biblical principles that will show you how to pray effectively and get the things you pray for. Each chapter is also peppered with stories from the life of the author. He regularly recounts his own experiences of receiving from God precisely what he asked for in prayer. These stories give the author credibility and allow the reader to be encouraged to renew their passion and practice of prayer.This book was written in 1942 and so the writing style and some of the illustrations are definitely not contemporary. However, what this book has to offer is worth the effort to go outside of your comfort zone.Matt EllisBrooksville, Florida"},{"Title":"Great Expectations/Hard Times","review":"My review here is not of the novel, but rather of the Nonesuch edition of Dickens' classic. The book itself is a facsimile edition of the 1937 Nonesuch Dickens, and is published by Barnes and Noble. The book itself is in quality hardback. The \\"Great Expectations and Hard Times\\" Nonesuch edition has the spine bound in leather and the rest of the cover is cloth-bound [the color is blue-grey].The dust jacket is clear quality plastic. The paper quality is of good stock and is cream in color.The text is set in Martin's Type and the illustrations are from the original Nonesuch editions [8 illustrations in \\"Great Expectations\\", and 5 illustrations in \\"Hard Times\\"]. This is a beautiful and affordable classic and the Nonesuch Dickens Classics will enhance any collector's library."},{"Title":"Great Expectations/Hard Times","review":"These commonly available replications of printer Frances Meynell's famous 1937 Nonesuch printing of Dickens Works should not be taken too seriously. While nicely done they are light years away from the de luxe originals. Those were printed on specially selected handmade paper, paper that managed the pretty - and quite expensive - feat of being both thin and solidly opague. Quality was the watchword throughout, and having seen a complete set years ago, I certainly would never in a million mistake one of these volumes for the 1937 edition. Taken from the 1867 Chapman and Hall edition, the last edition Dickens proofed, the 1937 Nonesuch edition of 24 volumes was as you might expect extremely expensive and very limited, selling during the depths of the Depression for fifty-six guineas, conservatively updated to be roughly $5,000 dollars in todays money. (Actually, they would sell for much, much more!)So what then is the series listed here? Basically it's a large print hardback edition of Dickens - though currently only six volumes seem to exist. The quality is above average, with cloth boards and a spine that might - MIGHT - be leather. The books have weight - always a nice sign - and certainly are a considerable cut above the usual hardbound editions of classics proliferating bookstore shelves! Each comes with a glassine cover and a partial paper wrapper describing the Nonesuch edition. The sewn pages lie flat nicely enough - a distinct plus, and the text is not too badly printed, though by no means comes a country mile to the crisp printing of the original editions. Inside the books - I have two, this one and Bleak House - the illustrations chosen by Dickens are well done.This is presented as a facsimile edition, but there are facsimiles and there are facsimiles. This makes a generous stab at offering a most affordable version of a printing legend, but to be honest it's not quite what it claims.It is important, too, to note that two editions of this facsimile series seem to exist. The covers of mine are different, with an embossed image of the Nonesuch bear on a cheap Thailand Barnes and Noble edition printed by arrangement with Overlook Press, dated 2005. (The example above.) There is now a later Overlook edition from 2008. I cannot say whether it's more refined and better made than this earlier Barnes and Noble, which, by the way, did not sell well, as my copy of \\"Great Expectations/Hard Times\\" was discounted down to $6.99.Hopefully someone will offer some additonal insights on these two versions so Amazon readers can better chose.As it stands, these are nice hardbound versions, though they do suffer from pages that are not opague enough to hide the printing of the second side.Happy Birthday - Charles Dickens!"},{"Title":"ESV Bible: New Testament","review":"I definitely must concur with the first reviewer---Marquis Laughlin delivers the single finest New Testament narration I have ever beheld! Everything about it is simply splendid....NO, MARVELOUS. Why the 5-star review?First off, Marquis Laughlin. His slow, thoughtful, and emotionally expressive narration makes you feel like you're ACTUALLY THERE, experiencing the story of Jesus. Anyone who cannot follow along with Laughlin's narration is either asleep or brain-dead. Plus, Laughlin is the first narrator I have ever heard who doesn't sound like he's READING the Bible, but producing it from memory. He expresses emotion when necessary, and doesn't over-dramatize. His narration is so.....sublimely extraordinary.Second, NO BACKGROUND MUSIC. Not that I mind it that much, but the fact there is none makes it that much easier to follow along with. I can concentrate on Marquis, NOT the music. Besides, with a voice like his, why would music be necessary?Third, I LOVE the English Standard Version very much, and to hear the New Testament from someone like Laughlin adds so much to the story. I look forward to getting his New Testament narration of the New Revised Standard Version, due out next year.Excellent, excellent Bible narration.

They were by far the most enjoyable classes I have ever taken. His book reads much like his Reformation lectures, his humor and enthusiasm for the subject enhances the experience and makes it easy for one to understand the material. Professor Sunshine gives one an insight into the lives of such influential people like Luther and Calvin and how they shaped the Reformation.I highly reccomend this book for anyone with an interest in history or for one who is intersted in understanding the Christian Church and the problems that continue to plague it to this day.If you ever take his class, ask about the \\"Lasagna\\" story, its awesome ;p"},{"Title":"The Reformation for Armchair Theologians","review":"This is the third book in the \\"Armchair Theologian\\" series which I have read, and it won't be the last. The series seeks to give an accessible, readable rendition of the theology of major figures in Christian history. Other books include Luther, Calvin, Wesley, Augustine, and Aquinas. This is the only book which deals, not with an individual, but with a movement.Sunshine begins by setting the stage for the Reformation, then gives a sketch of Luther's career. Popular humorists have God changing the course of events by tossing lightning bolts around, but apparently the course of history was changed by a lightning bolt. Luther, a law student, got knocked off his horse by a lightning bolt and got back on it determined to become a monk. From that point forward, Luther's pathway to the founding of a new religion was an exercise in Murphy's Law. His 95 theses weren't a declaration of religious independence, they were simply a modest call for debate. When his challenge was answered, his able opponent maneuvered him into admitting that he held views that had gotten another theologian, Jan Hus, burned at the stake. Next came his famous declaration (which he really would rather not have had to make) at the Diet of Worms, and the rest is history.Sunshine next looks at Zwingli, probably the only Reformation theologian who died in battle and in armor, and then turns his attention to Calvin. Calvin comes across as a much more sympathetic figure than the rigid, dictatorial killjoy of popular legend. Calvin was another lawyer who, much against his will, got coerced into founding a church in Geneva. Calvin wanted to go to Strasbourg and pursue a career as a writer, but events compelled him to go to Geneva and oversee the birth pangs of Calvinism.Geneva wasn't a theocratic totalitarianism. Calvin actually promoted a (for that day and age) radical separation of church and state. He did, however, insist that in matters of religion it was \\"my way or the highway.\\" The darkest blot on Calvin's record is the execution of Severetus, whose ideas about the Trinity were somewhat odd. Although Calvin gave evidence against Severetus, he heartily disapproved of the punishment meted out and refused to become involved in the execution. (He preferred beheading to burning at the stake. If I had been Severetus, I would have endorsed Calvin's viewpoint).From Calvin, Sunshine goes to the Counter-Reformation, Phillip II, Elizabeth I, the Invincible Armada, Henry VIII, the Thirty Years War, and the interminable bloodshed that closed out the Reformation. The book closes with the Treaty of Westphalia.The awful paradox of the Reformation is this: When an oppressed religious minority gained ascendancy, instead of eschewing oppression, it almost invariably became an oppressor itself, persecuting not only its former persecutor, but also its fellow persecuted religions. It seems to me that a group which has just fought so hard to win religious freedom should treasure it to this extent: that they should allow it to other religious minorities. Rodney Stark explains this phenomenon in \\"One True God,\\" but even understanding the rationale for such behavior doesn't make it any more palatable. As the cartoon character Pogo once said, \\"We have met the enemy, and he is us.\\""},{"Title":"The Reformation for Armchair Theologians","review":"This book is quite a page-turner when it comes to history of the Reformation. I was hooked right from page one. Various historical characters come into play with the main performers being Luther and Calvin.When it comes to the theological ideas of the times the book misses its mark. I do understand that the text is meant for \\"armchair theologians\\", but even \\"armchair guys\\" need some meat in the soup. There is nary a one Bible reference to corroborate or demolish any of the theological ideas introduced. This was a disappointment.It would be more appropriate to title this text as \\"The Reformation for Armchair Historians\\"."},{"Title":"The Reformation for Armchair Theologians","review":"Glenn Sunshine writes exceptionally well for the \\"Armchair\\" series, combining scholarly discussions with simple language and doses of wit. This book will serve as an introduction to the Reformation or a refresher and another perspective for those more familiar with it. I have no doubt all readers will take away new insights. I think Sunshine devouts adequate space to the politics, theology, institutions and influential people of the Reformation.Readers will come away having a good grasp of the nuances of Roman Catholic beliefs and the Protestant beliefs of Luther, Calvin, Zwingli and Arminius, as well as some other lesser known religious leaders. I would have liked to see more on Thomas Cranmer and the theology of the English Reformation, but that reveals my own bias, too. Sunshine adroitly summarizes some core commonalities among the above and some of their sharp differences that led to conflicts. He follows their influences and relationships to various states and rulers.As much as this is a book about theology, it is also about the history of the states and their internal and external conflicts. Religion of the Reformation era was closely tied to the politics and, as this book shows, an historical author really cannot focus on one at the exclusion of the other. A few times the book gets bogged down in the political history, especially in the discussion of the Thirty-years war, but I think that is a hazard of the subject and not a fault of the writer.Sunshine does a thorough job of being precise about the beliefs of the theologians as opposed to what theology was later developed by their followers. He does not gloss over negative actions of folks like Luther or Calvin either. He shows these heroes of the Reformation in their sinfulness and saintliness.I was very impressed with Sunshine's ability to write simply and eloquently about complex subjects. He also seems to have a talent for pruning out the excess material to focus on key elements, something crucial to a book like this one."},{"Title":"The Reformation for Armchair Theologians","review":"I read this book all in one night, the night I bought it. It provides an excellent introduction into Reformation history and some Reformation theology. The book is helpful for an introduction to the Reformation and is quite humorous with its cartoons and puns. I would give this book a five, but I thought the book delved to much into exquisite details about the history of the Reformation and there should have been more theology. It is true though, that there was much political agendas set with the onset of the Reformation, but in some chapters, the book presented mainly history and not enough theology. A good buy!"},{"Title":"The Reformation for Armchair Theologians","review":"Glenn Sunshine's book covers both religious and historical content, and does so in a readable, yet thorough manner.One its strengths is its placement of the religious upheaval into historical (political and geographic) context. For example, an entire chapter is devoted to Spain and the Dutch Revolt. Before you think that a book giving a whole chapter to such a topic is beyond you, think again! Sunshine explains the relevance of the revolt to the Reformation and vice versa (Protestant capitalist Dutch threw off Catholic absolutist Habsburg rulers, initiating patterns of international relations) in a few pages; most scholarly treatments of the subject, in contrast, fill gigantic tomes of writing with not much more insight to the casual reader or even the educated reader, while most textbooks or surveys fail to mention key players and events that make understanding the Reformation so interesting and engaging. Sunshine's book finds a perfect middle ground.The book goes into just enough detail, but it is also comprehensive. Consider its various historical chapters: Eve of the Reformation, Spain and the Dutch Revolt, the Reformation in England and Scotland, the Reformation in France, and the Thirty Years' War. In addition, its religious or doctrine-focused chapters cover not only Luther, but Zwinglianism and Calvinism. It even poses one of the essential questions regarding Catholicism: \\"Catholic Reform or Counter-Reform?\\"At the end of each chapter, the author includes a series of open-ended questions for discussion.In sum, it's short and sweet, and somehow packs the details that you'd have to take a university course to find. It would be great reading for a high school student studying for AP exams, a college student in any number of religion or history classes, for a casual reader curious as to the nature and history of the Reformation, or for a teacher or professor interested in seeing all the pieces fit together in one place.(Plus, any book with a chapter entitled \\"The Empire Strikes Back,\\" must have something good going for it!)"},{"Title":"The Reformation for Armchair Theologians","review":"This book is one of, if not the most, disappointing books in the Armchair series. Many reviewers have looked past a very basic problem with this book and is actually glaring and misleads readers, namely, it is not a theological text, but a historical one. One cannot doubt Sunshine's wonderful and easily-read presentation of Reformation history, but the series is about theology and because Sunshine has focused so much on the history, we get no information on Arminus, the synod of Dort, or the Arminian confessions of 1621. This is disturbing, as Arminus has influenced too much of the historical and theological landscape to leave his thought out of a book on the Reformation.In the end, I cannot recommend this book because it does not fulfill the requirement of the series, namely to introduce readers PRIMARILY to Reformation theology. HOWEVER, if Westminster John Knox starts a series entitled: Armchair Historians, I will give the book more stars."},{"Title":"The Reformation for Armchair Theologians","review":"This book does an admirable job of clearing away what could be a muddy morass of people, ideas, regions and dates.Everything is laid out in a logical progression and whenever an idea or person needs to be noted but will be explained further on in the text, it is laid out and the current thread continues.The author does a wonderful job of giving us basic biographical data, but more importantly religious doctrines, including the arguments they sprang from, the counter-arguments against and the rebuttals. The author also does an excellent job of giving everyone the benefit of the doubt without being heavy handed in anyone's favor.This does not mean that the despicable, violent, and often underhanded actions of historical figures are not represented, but that their potential motivations are touched upon.I would gladly recommend this to anyone with an interest in the period or the ideas that sprang from it."},{"Title":"The Reformation for Armchair Theologians","review":"Are there any easy resources out there that explain the Great Reformation in easy-to-understand language that doesn't insult the average persons intelligence? Oftentimes, the easy-to-read-and-understand genre are either insulting to the reader by making things oversimplified or still too complicated. In his book, The Reformation for Armchair Theologians, Dr. Glenn S. Sunshine (occonpied by cartoonist and illustrator Ron Hill) seek to offer the reader a thorough history of the Reformation surveying all of the major events, persons, and ideas in an easy-to-read format.This is not a \\"Reformation for Dummies\\" type of text. Instead, the author, along with the humorist sketches, seeks to tell the story of the Reformation without insulting the reader. My concern when opening this book was that it would be too simple and missing much of the Reformation tale, but it does none of that. This is a great resource for college students, seminarians, and anyone interesting in knowing more about the Reformation and for those new to the Reformation.Sunshine makes a great effort trying to slowly explain some of the difficult aspects of the Reformation. I have always struggled with keeping all of the Kings and Queens straight. Who are they, when did they live, who were their heirs, what happened to them, who did they marry, how did they die, what role did they play in the Reformation, etc. And though I am still mixed up on some of that, Sunshine takes the time to explain it all to the reader.This book tells the whole story and for that I am grateful. I have taken entire classes on the Reformation and still the professor overlooked important aspects of it. The author begins with the pre-Reformation era and why the Reformation was needed. He includes the German, Genevan, Swiss, Dutch, Scottish, Catholic, and English Reformations.My main critique of the book would be the overemphasis on the political players over some of the more theological players. Sunshine does not ignore the theologians (like Martin Luther, John Calvin, John Knox, and others) or their theology (he dedicates an entire chapter on the controversy regarding the Lord's Supper and explains clearly what everyone believed and why it mattered), but reading the book made one thing that the Reformation was more political than theological. Certainly you cannot discuss the Reformation without discussing both. You cannot separate Knox from Mary, Luther from Charles, Cranmer from Henry, etc. But as the book progressed, the author found himself tracing the political scene more than the theological scene more than I prefer.Overall, however, this is a great resource and if the other books in the Armchair Theologian series are like this one, I might be making a few purchases.This book was provided by the Westminister John Knox Press for the purpose of this review."},{"Title":"The Reformation for Armchair Theologians","review":"As a student at Central Connecticut State University I have had the good fortune of taking several courseds with Dr. Sunshine. I stumbled across this book in our library stacks while researching the political motivations of Luther's reformation: a paper for Dr. Sunshine's Reformation course.The book reads very much like one of Dr. Sunshine's lectures. It is entertaining and educational. It can be understood by the average person but is detailed enough to keep the attention of someone pursuing a degree. I originally read it for researching my paper but now I read it for pleasure. This is a must have for anyone interested in history, Christianity, or just good reading."},{"Title":"The Reformation for Armchair Theologians","review":"Easy to understand.

I would reccomend it to drama teachers who are looking for a play with a lot of parts, or who are trying to give a strong message against alchohol.

I cannot explain the value of this book in word. I was surprised that there are few reviews on this book. Must have for preacher!"},{"Title":"Preacher and Prayer","review":"This is a great book for preachers, but also for anyone who needs to appreciate the place of prayer in ministry.

This is certainly an old book that should be more widely read today. It is outstanding."},{"Title":"Preacher and Prayer","review":"a book any preacher wanting to really do a work for GOD, must have. prayer involves GOD in ministry.

After reading Preacher and Prayer I was not only convicted that I did not pray enough, but what prayers I said were mostly--in Bounds' words--heartless. I highly recommend the book for preachers--and teachers, for \\"It is impossible for the preacher to keep his spirit in harmony with the divine nature of his high calling without much prayer\\" (p.27). Not only is this edition of the book just the right size to place in your pocket for reading while you wait somewhere, it is reformatted which makes it much easier to read than others.

Excellent job Dan."},{"Title":"Transformations","review":"I have Anne Sexton's complete works, and this book rises above the rest. The fairy tale framework compels more structure and discipline from a poet accustomed to rambling (but often brilliant) confessional observation. It is, in my estimation, her finest work.Her take on \\"Snow White\\" refuses to establish heroines or villains. The girl is a lovely virgin, \\"cheeks as fragile as cigarette paper...lips like Vin du Rhone.\\" The jealous queen, still beautiful at middle age but fearing that time isn't on her side and informed by her mirror she's no longer \\"the fairest of them all,\\" tries to kill her. For this, she is punished by torture. The twist here is that Sexton makes it clear that some day the virgin girl will meet the queen's fate: \\"Meanwhile Snow White held court,/ rolling her china-blue eyes open and shut/ and sometimes referring to her mirror/ as women do.\\"The lesbian implications of \\"Rapunzel\\" are brought to the fore, and the transvestite deception of \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" is remarked on. Sexton crashes the dreamy romance of Cinderella with the mundane reality of marriage. \\"Happily ever after\\" is contrasted with \\"diapers...arguing...getting a middle-aged spread.\\" The Freudian power of mother is accented in the poet's take on \\"Hansel and Gretel\\"; Sexton brings out dark implications of child murder and pedophilia that the original tale merely glosses.Twenty years before Robert Bly tackled the \\"Iron John\\" fairy tale, Sexton put her spin on it, stressing the main character's cannibalism and outcast status. She compares the hairy wild man to a string of deeply troubled characters from her imagination. It is here where her poetry reaches the peak of its intensity: \\"A lunatic wearing that strait jacket/ like a sleeveless sweater, singing to the wall like Muzak.../ And if they stripped him bare/ he would fasten his hands around your throat/ After that he would take your corpse/ and deposit his sperm in three orifices./ You know, I know,/ you'd run away.\\"Sexton's deep-delving into childhood stories, unearthing the very real and plausible taboos they skirt, is refreshing. Her anachronistic use of modern language (Muzak, for instance) is artful and effective. The best thing about this book, however, is that so much madness and sadness is surmised from such timeless and appealing stories. Happy endings are left intact but with a shadow cast over them. Sexton is a poet of the dark--with no one to save her \\"from the awful babble of that calling.\\""},{"Title":"Transformations","review":"In all my readings of fairy tale variations, this has to be one of the best. Anne Sexton takes a grim and twisted approach to the already grim and twisted versions of the Grimm Brothers.Of course, these poems are simply an extension of Anne Sexton's already established confessional form, but poetry is, first and foremost, an expression of society. These poems fail to remain part of Sexton's inner turmoil. Rather, they mock society and the roles that women are traditionally placed within fairy tales. Anne Sexton, in an example here, uses anachronisms to reach her audience, making references to popular culture.The Queen Cried two pails of sea water. She was as persistent as a Jehovah's Witness.Anne Sexton, &quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot;Although Sexton's poems are not suitable for an audience of children, they do serve as interesting, even necessary reading, once a child has matured and read beyond the traditional fairy tales that are \`suitable' for kids."},{"Title":"Transformations","review":"In this remarkable collection of poems, Anne Sexton offers readers seventeen transformations of classic Brothers Grimm fairy tales. As she makes clear in the first poem \\"The Gold Key\\", Sexton assumes the persona of the storyteller for this collection, calling herself a \\"middle-aged witch\\" with \\"my face in a book and my mouth wide, ready to tell you a story or two.\\" This device allows her to write about intensely personal topics, such as a sexually abusive father, through the detached voice of a storyteller. The use of fairy tales also provides Sexton with a shared cultural framework that enables her to communicate her own experiences and perspectives in a universal language that readers already understand intimately.Fairytales have a power few of us realize. The stories shape many of our fantasies as children; they also condition us to accept traditional gender roles as we grow up. I believe that Anne Sexton understood their power and influence. She brilliantly tapped into that power and transformed the tales in a way that forces the reader to look at them with fresh eyes. Before launching into the tales themselves, Sexton set the themes of the stories in a modern or personal context. These connections, along with the interlacing of 20th century details (like soda pop and jockstraps) and her use of modern syntax in the fairy tales made their subversive commentary on the burdens and fears of women in a society shaped by male dominance startlingly clear.In her transformed tales, Sexton examines the female archetypes they depict: the docile virgin, the wicked stepmother, the aging witch. She also sheds an illuminating, feminist light on the themes of female competition and the idea of happily ever after which pop up often in fairytales. It is significant that Sexton uses the gritty Grimm versions of the tales, instead of the child-friendly Disney versions we grew up with. Their original form reveals the subversive nature and insightful symbolism of the fairy tales, many of which were crafted by women.While this collection is a departure from Sexton's typical confessional style, the poems of \\"Transformations\\" are unabashedly naked and intimately introspective--a wondrous achievement by one of our greatest poets."},{"Title":"Transformations","review":"I teach Anne Sexton in my freshman College English class and I work specifically from this text because the stories are at once familiar shared traditions and disturbing alterations of those traditions. The 18 year olds I teach, who only know fairy tales from the white-washed Disney versions, are intrigued by these dark and psychological interpretations. For the fairy tale afficianado these poems are a must read."},{"Title":"Transformations","review":"To be a great poet, one must possess the soul of a poet as a prerequisite, and the honesty of a human being who is unafraid of revealing their soul to its essential bareness. Anne Sexton does that with natural and admirable ease.Perhaps exactly because she possessed those necessary qualities, she was well aware that it takes more than just the beautiful aspects of life, to create poetry that touches forgotten strings in our hearts. Strings that each on their own may produce sounds we would rather close our ears to, but used in the inspired and ingenious way as she does, and as a compilation, sound off with a flare, expressing the opus of Anne's life and resonating within our own hearts and lives. Great poetry turns on \\"lights\\" in our minds and awakens dormant feelings in our hearts.Anne artfully proves that the ugly and the frightful, the ridiculous and the humorous, and not just the beautiful, all find their perfect place in poetry. The creativity and wit of her poems, like facets of a gem, reflect life's elements of joy and anguish, and clearly demonstrate that soul's journey inevitably passes through the muck of life, yet, in the end, and deep in its core, it remains unchanged, in its purity and reflection of the Devine.In two words:Great poetry! Anne Sexton, you ARE loved!Anna Leda"},{"Title":"Transformations","review":"I love this book. Ann Sexton's version of Grimm's Tales is somewhat sick and twisted but it's wonderful. The person that owned this book before me made wonderful notes. Very informative and thought provoking."},{"Title":"Transformations","review":"It probably sounds almost like a cliche, but I still must say it--Anne Sexton takes a new spun perspective on the classic Grimm fairy tales. She has a \\"theme\\" which she feels is appropriate for each story. Then, she fills in the blank of what elements and details seem to be missing in the fairy tales. The flat and static characters such as Mother Gothel now become a more complex character. In this cynical and dense poems, Sexton makes it seem as if her stories are the untold truth of the fairy tales."},{"Title":"Transformations","review":"Anne Sexton is my favorite poet. This book contains many of the Grimm Brothers tales (virtually all of them), and she rewrote them to say something to us, the readers. For example, &quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot;, my favorite, has a message, which is the fact that many people can be two-faced; seem ugly and cruel and turn out to be beautiful and heart-warming.

I appreciate the compact, easy to handle size, and the clean design, yet wish for larger reproductions.(Which explains the 4-star rating.) I was delighted to see many watercolors for the first time. If you are disapointed by the lack of text, get Virginia Mecklenburgs' book on Hopper watercolors...it's as &quot;easy&quot; and wonderful to read as this book is to look at. I look forward to owning the companion, The Complete Paintings of Edward Hopper."},{"Title":"The Complete Watercolors of Edward Hopper","review":"Levin has split her Catalogue Raisonne of Hopper's work into two books with this one containing all the watercolors. I must disagree with other reviewers here regarding their complaints about the size of the images. In my opinion, it's unrealistic to make the images larger without changing the size/format of the book - which matches the companion of Hopper's oil paintings. Besides, this is a complete catalog of all his watercolors and I think it works very well. Don't assume that the images are \\"tiny\\"; they fit the pages and hence, I won't downgrade my assessment to match theirs.Levin has done an outstanding job and I think all Hopper fans will appreciate this book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Complete Watercolors of Edward Hopper","review":"This would be a 5 star book if the reproductions were just a bit larger, but it's a small complaint. If you like Hopper you will enjoy discovering works you've never seen before. If you're a painter too, you'll like the format: 1 page of introductory text and nothing but reproductions after that! Lots of people are familiar with Hopper's quote &quot;All I ever wanted to paint was sunlight on the side of a house.&quot; This is the book that makes you understand what he meant: his mostly on-sight watercolors have a sun drenched quality that his oils didn't catch as often, good as they are.

In the early 1990s, the book arm of Virgin started a range of novels featuring the seventh Doctor called 'The New Adventures' which was eventually followed by books featuring past Doctors called 'The Missing Adventures'. When the TV Movie starring Paul McGann was announced, the BBC took over the book licence and commenced publishing two series of books referred to by fans as the EDAs (Eighth Doctor Adventures) and PDAs (Past Doctor Adventures).This book is the first volume of Lars Pearsons guide to these spin-off stories, and his reviews are detailed and opinionated. Best of all, they are written in an entertaining style that makes for easy reading. My only quibbles (and minor ones at that) are the inclusion of illustrations (very well done, I might add) that have little relevance to the text (understandable in a way as Lars obviously didn't want to upset the BBC by using trademarked images) plus a number of typos. As I stated, not much to get worked up about, and fortunately the writing is good enough to make you forget about such things.Essential reading for fans of original Doctor Who fiction."},{"Title":"I, Who: The Unauthorized Guide to Doctor Who Novels","review":"This book is a must for Who fans who haven't been able to keep up since the tv series ending.

This book was copyrighted in 1954, and I picked up the second edition in 1960. In terms of science, certainly a long time ago. It remains a fascinating read, and reasonably easy. There is nary an equation for the \\"mathphobes.\\"Ley describes nine possible massive engineering projects. It was long before the Environmental Protection Agency, or, even some real thought about the unintended consequences of massive construction projects. We've learned a bit in the intervening half century about the downside to projects such as the Aswan High Dam, as well as the many other dams that dot the American West. There are potential downsides to most activity, certainly construction work, and that is what is totally devoid from this work. Nonetheless, that should not mean that we do nothing. The tradeoffs to the activities should be carefully weighed, and a rationale decision made along the lines of \\"the greatest good for the greatest number.\\"One of the nine projects has been fully completed, for more than a decade and a half. At least two others are being very actively pursued. Others are still potentially viable, and a few, I think mercifully, have hit the proverbial \\"dustbin\\" of science. Ley proposed a tunnel between England and France, an idea that has been around since Napoleon's time (which might have been one of the reasons for the delay in completion!) Ley expounds a solid engineering basis for its completion, with numerous instructive drawings. As we know, what is popularly called the \\"Chunnel\\" was completed in 1994, and it is a vast improvement in cross-Channel transport, and has had virtually no negative environmental impact. Bravo for that one.Energy, particularly renewable energy, is a concern that has become ascendant. Ley was a \\"visionary\\" or sorts to be addressing these issues in the \`50's, when gas was 29 cents a gallon. There are chapters on two that are actively being pursued today: \\"power from the sun,\\" and \\"harnessing the winds.\\" In my latest drive across Texas I was impressed and amazed at the number of windmills in operation. Ley's drawings did not envision the slender rotating blades of today, but he helped put the issue \\"on the agenda.\\" There are two other chapters that could be pursued with more vigor: one involves harnessing the power of volcanos; the other involves obtaining energy from the sea, both in terms of the power of waves, and the equally valid, but less appreciated power between the temperature differentials at various levels in the sea.The three that hit the \\"dustbin\\", and I would welcome any comments that they should not have, involved a massive transfer of water from the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea, with power plants along the way (in this chapter he proposed a similar scheme for Libya, and the Qattara Depression); another involved damning (oh, wasn't that the solution to everything?) the Straits of Gibraltar, and lowering the Mediterranean by 330 ft! Don't let the Real Estate agents know about this one... there sure would be a lot more to sell, including almost the entire present Adriatic Sea; and the third was wilder still, and involved the creation of massive lakes in the present-day Congo and Chad that would be a couple magnitudes larger than the ones there now, say Lake Victoria. Nary a thought about where the current inhabitants would go.And there was one that science itself made obsolete: the building of artificial islands in the Atlantic to facilitate air transport. The long range jet obviated the need for that.Ley was a visionary, with numerous constructive proposals to improve our lives. Although he did not stress the \\"unintended consequences\\" of his proposals, I won't hold that against him. 5-stars."},{"Title":"ENGINEER'S DREAMS","review":"This particular book by Willy Ley, originally published in 1955, would have been irresistible to librarians in Junior Highs and High Schools, and indeed my copy is already a third printing, just a few months after publication. This is the type of book which inevitably becomes obsolete within a very short time, and there was a revised and updated edition issued about 10 years later, which I have not seen. Indeed, although I was in high school in 1955, I have never seen either edition of the book at all until now. Ley is a good writer, and rarely boring, but I did find parts of this book quite boring, particularly a seemingly interminable discussion of the prospects for geothermal power in Tuscany of all places!The book is a strange mix of exceedingly grandiose schemes (create huge inland seas in Central Africa, and drastically lower the Mediterranean Sea, for instance) cheek-by-jowl with very small-scale efforts. The illustrations by an an artist whose reputation is quite unknown to me, Isami Kashiwagi, are in a delicate \\"oriental\\" style which is generally completely inappropriate to the subject-matter.I can't think offhand of anyone other than Willy Ley who could have written a book like this one, and where the book becomes a bit tedious, it is the fault of the nature of the material, rather than a fault of the author."},{"Title":"ENGINEER'S DREAMS","review":"I read this book over 45 years ago. It triggered a life long interest and vocation in applied engineering. It was written in a time when engineers knew a little about a lot of things and were not afraid to think big. Many of the proposed projects have been built and others are just beginning to be realized. A few were even horrible boondoggles. This book is easy to read, inspiring and is still one of my all time favorites."},{"Title":"ENGINEER'S DREAMS","review":"This book was first written when the channel tunnel \\"chunnel\\" was still just an engineering concept on paper. As you know, the chunnel has been very successfully operated for years. Some of the other projects have yet to materialize, but the book is a testiment to the inventiveness of our species. Perhaps in time more of the projects will be completed, and others altered to reflect changing technologies and needs of mankind. For example, the floating airports once envisioned to make transatlantic flights economically viable, have morphed into the artificial island that provided HongKong with a new airport where land was not readily available on the scale required for a modern facility."},{"Title":"ENGINEER'S DREAMS","review":"Ley, Willy 1954: *Engineers' Dreams,* The Viking Press, New York. Numerous massive projects, such as placing a dam across the straits of Gibraltar, converting the Sahara into an irrigated plain, a Jordan Valley project, all undone, plus some that have become reality, such as the Channel Tunnel. Some were brought to semi-reality such as using icebergs for landing fields during WW-II. Others not mentioned by Ley are: an undersea pipeline to bring water from Alaska to California (Press-Telegram, Long Beach Saturday, May 26, 1990, p. A13 [a governor Wally Hickel proposal]; Los Angeles Times, Monday, March 25, 1991, pp. A1, A17; an overland channel from Alaska down a central part of the Rocky Mountains to irrigate the upper Canadian and U.S. midwest, the U.S. western plains, with a continuation to the Mexican Sonora Desert (Press-Telegram, Long Beach, Friday, February 4, 1977, p.

Lin International Engineering Bulletin, v. 15, no. 2, Dec. 1986. These examples, some done, some undone are as illustrations of the point that our incentive systems produce too many small innovations, and too few large ones, presented in Stoneman 1987 p. 117. Stoneman 1987 has a detailed analysis of the real problems in financing innovation, with several citations to research results and to theoretical analyses. The basic problem is that innovation is risky, and in most cases, the social value of innovations cannot be captured by the innovator. Only government can do so. Others face severe limitations in financing projects and in capturing the social value. In addition, innovation upsets the status quo, and can be opposed on that basis by politically powerful groups.For example, spreading the human habitat over the ocean surface would be opposed by land interests in any nation. Land owners are used to capturing all benefits due to otherwise good government or from local resources, good climate, etc., and don't want to have this diluted. See also F&ouml;lster 1988 for ways to try to correct this.

Reviewed in Whole Earth, Summer 1998, p. 47. A good bird's-eye view of projects, looking backwards, mostly. The forward look has nothing remotely resembling Ley's depth, but has many interesting, large projects. The descriptions are brief, and say little about feasibility, e.g., page 78: *With the development of lighter and stronger materials and more efficient propulsion mechanisms, the age of human - powered flight will begin.* The ten dollar a page price for FAXed descriptions is off-putting to me. So is the $22 price for printed matter that fills 30 sheets of two sided 8-1/2 x 11 paper, well-done though it is. The idea of putting a mirror in space to reflect sunlight to the northern latitudes appears in the Los Angeles Times, Saturday, October 31, 1998, p. A2. A Russian proposes this: Vladimir Syromyatnikov. It will be deployed in February 1998; it is 82 feet in diameter; the shaft of sunlight will be about 1.5 miles wide.See also Flyvbjerg et al 2003 for more megaprojects that HAVE been done, though nothing on the scale of the Bering Bridge or connecting the Danube to the Baltic."},{"Title":"Biology and society: The evolution of man and his technology","review":"Really interesting discussion about how biology affects technology and technology affects biology.

It is a must read and an excellent addition to the library as well."},{"Title":"A Tail of Two Murders","review":"I loved this book. It blended enough plot with interesting characters, omitted a plethora of violence and gore and even tossed in a heroic family pet. Jake is great."},{"Title":"A Tail of Two Murders","review":"I can only hope that this series gets better. In this first installment, the actual crimesolving process is completely taken over by the introduction of aging, yawn inducing, hoity-toity artsy literary genius university professor types that I can't for the life of me indentify with.Although Jackie Walsh seems to be the only one that has her feet planted firmly on the ground, her character lacks some serious depth. Same goes for Lieutenant McGowan, who is supposed to be falling for her to give the story a romantic spin. It's just not happening.Jake, the &quot;crime solving&quot; dog, is smart and lovable, but doesn't solve any crimes. He's nothing more than a sideline player until the very end of the book. He is described as a dog of &quot;advanced age&quot;, although his actual age is never mentioned. This makes me wonder how the author is going to pull off the numerous sequels of the book, considering that large breed dogs don't normally live to be 15. I define an older dog to be somewhere around 9 or 10 years of age, but I'm willing to cut some slack here because Jake is a retired police dog and - correct me if I'm wrong - the police force usually retires their canines at an early age. I'm really wondering how much Melissa Cleary actually knows about dogs.The ending is too sudden and ill refined, like falling off a cliff after a long, tedious climb.Furthermore, the title &quot;A Tail of Two Murders&quot; is slightly misleading, since the story really evolves around three murders.I already bought the second title in the series when I bought this one, so I'm going to read it and hope that things will get better and more entertaining from here on out."},{"Title":"A Tail of Two Murders","review":"NICE EASY READ FOR A LAZY AFTERNOON"},{"Title":"A Tail of Two Murders","review":"Its not that the dog is so smart,its that the people are so dense!"},{"Title":"Bonaparte's Horsemen (Alain Lausard Adventures)","review":"Fans of military fiction will find Bonaparte's Horsemen an involving account of 1807 Poland, where Napoleon is facing a dangerous battle and Sergeant Lausard his most decisive battle. Add historical insights to a fast-paced plot of military fiction and you have a story which just doesn't quit."},{"Title":"Bonaparte's Horsemen (Alain Lausard Adventures)","review":"This book tells the story of how Bonaparte finally took his continental dominion to its highest point of power. In that sense, this was the pinnacle of French power in Europe and probably the height of their influence in the world in general.Of course, the context of the telling of the story is a focus on the adventures of Alain Lausard. However, I do want at the outset to explain that I think this book needs to be read for historical context as well as entertainment.While it is most common for historians to comment on this period as a costly period where Napoleon did not win as magically as before, it is essential to recognize that, after the Treaty of Tilsit in the Neiman, Napoleon and the French had defeated all the armies of Europe in detail and were therefore able to force everyone, including the inscrutable Mother Russia, to contradict their essential vital interests by a boycott of English trade.While the incremental costs were rising to Napoleon and his incremental benefits were declining, at Tilsit the powers of the French Empire were maximized and would never again be so high, or its reverberations in history so complete.In ultimate truth, the greatest strategic error of Napoleon Bonaparte was not military. It was economic. Had Bonaparte used the Treaty of Tilsit to create a way to profit from British trade with Europe, rather than institute a boycott that could never work, he would have ruled as Emperor of Europe for all his days and France would have become the center of a fully integrated Europe by the mid to late 19th century. Boycotts do not create power. There has been no power in the world or in the history of civilization greater than gains to trade. If Bonaparte had garnered a small and reasonable fraction of the overall gains to trade of the day he would have harnessed the loyalty of all Europe. All he had to do was promote the trade and not threaten the lives or lifestyle of the inept and ruling Bourbons. Trade would have secured his power. Food and wine and art would have secured the Bourbons. England alone could have never defeated the French. Napoleon gave the Germans, Russians and Austrians incentive to fight him as a coalition because he wanted to impose a system on them no less economically harmful than the way the Germans were punished again in the 20th century by the ill-fated Treaty of Versailles.This book is not convincing evidence of the diplomatic and economic background of the story, nor is it intended to be. However, this creates a compelling reason to read the book and get interested in the accomplishments and travails of the interlude. The book tells of the struggle and the cost in the most human and personal terms. In that sense, I rate this book a 5 because it makes the reading of the broader history far more rich than it would otherwise be.History must put it all together in a lesson for the future. With that, I will now provide a brief summary of the scope of the book and note any important differences in the plot or character development than differentiates this book from the previous five volumes. You should read the books in sequence and in the broader context with some other historical aids. I give it two thumbs up on all fronts and I hope Mr. Howard will be able somehow to complete his stories. I would like to see Lausard as Marechal of France in fiction. I think such Gingrich-esque speculative history is very acceptable, even to Napoleonic purists.More to follow..."},{"Title":"Trailin'!","review":"Richard Etulain, a history professor at University of New Mexico and editor of this 1994 University of Nebraska Press edition of Trailin' (1920), rightly cautions that not all readers will find Brand's pulp westerns entirely satisfactory. He does argue, however, that Trailin' - one of Brand's early westerns - warrants reading (and I agree) as it vividly illustrates Brand's almost magical, archetypal western that was so popular in the years before World War II.The setting in Trailin' is vague and uncertain, and apparently this is typical of Max Brand's stories. We only know that it occurs somewhere in Brand's mythical west. (Contrastingly, Louis L'Amour's geography and landmarks were carefully researched.)Brand's characters are nearly as mythical as his geography. The hero in Trailin', Anthony Bard, overcomes all obstacles to track the killer of his father across the open plains and mountains of the wild west. Bard's success is especially remarkable as he had no prior wilderness experience, having been raised in a wealthy setting in New York.His cold, calculating adversary, Steve Nash, is a classic villain, one who even resorts to killing Bard's horse. The action-packed plot had some unexpected twists, but ultimately the ending seem contrived, revealing a secret that could have been disclosed much earlier.Max Brand was one of the many pseudonyms of Frederick Schiller Faust, creator of more than 350 westerns in the 1920s and 1930s.Today, classics like Shane, The Big Sky, The Virginian, Lonesome Dove, The Ox-Bow Incident, and Monte Walsh as well as L'Amour's popular fiction largely overshadow Brand's novels. Nonetheless, despite a notable lack of verisimilitude, Max Brand's action tales offer enjoyable, light reading for fans of westerns."},{"Title":"Trailin'!","review":"A well written story that holds your interest from beginning to end.

Marc Parent's work here parallels many of the lessons I've learned even though his children are both older than my son for most of the book. Anybody who has children can appreciate the worry that goes into those first months and also the amount of lessons you as a parent learn while trying to teach your child lessons. \\"Believing It All\\" captures many of the thoughts and feelings that parents (at least myself) find so hard to verbalize. I recommend it to anyone who has children."},{"Title":"Believing It All","review":"This book is a delightful look at the lessons our children teach us, even though we might think WE are teaching THEM.

I was attracted to this book not because it preaches parental duties, rather, I was intrigued by what a child could teach me about life- the title of the edition that I have does not mention trout fishing nor jelly toast. Before I commenced reading this book, I already have preconceived ideas about what these teachings are. Got some of these correct while missing some. One that struck me intensely was the depiction of the elder child wanting to kick a dead squirrel. How real and how many times we want to do the same but never cos' it is not the honorable thing to do, so we think. But kids are more intuitive and unpolluted by the adult notion of what's right and what's wrong. They just do what come to their mind.

His words come from the heart, based on his experience as a social worker and, in particular, as a stay-at-home Dad. As a counsellor, I have met with many a stay-at-home Dads; it is among the norm these days and on the rise. With many women returning to complete their education, joining the workforce and taking management jobs, the parenting roles have in many cases been reversed. While it has been the traditional role of mothers to provide daily care for their children, I have seen fathers who do an excellent job, and in some cases, a much better job than those moms who view motherhood as a &quot;tied down, unfulfilling, low-paying job.&quot; Fortunately, they are among the minority, but they do exist and we have probably all met one or two who fall into that category.Parent is a unique man and a gifted writer. His touch of humor adds a special charm to the book and once read, you will be tempted to hug your child for no special reason other, than you love him/her. The author pragmatically brings to our attention, the honesty, beauty, innocense and wonder of a child, and how a look of sheer love and trust can bring tears to your eyes and conquer your soul. &quot;Believing It All&quot; is a five star plus and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Believing It All","review":"This book touches me on so many levels that I can't even begin to cover it all.

And silently pleading for five quiet minutes to write one more paragraph...one more page...daddy will be right there. Although the work at home option is idealized in current society, \\"Believing It All: What my Children Taught Me About Trout Fishing, Jelly Toast, and Life\\" provides an accurate yet optimistic viewpoint, observing children with their uncomplicated lives, simple pleasures exchanged all too soon, and the commitment needed to juggle work/family in the same location. A memoir more interested in the everyday nothing that constitutes a life of something, it's surprisingly worth a read for the 20-something childless as well as the harried soccer Mom (or Dad) who can relate entirely too well. Stroller walks, afternoon naps, and tying shoes. The novelty of all the small things which so quickly pass away, yielding to yellow school buses and the Nintendo blur.

The Food of France reflects this belief and is similarly divided into three main sections, each chapter within a section dealing with the geographical/culinary regions within each domain. Within this structure, each chapter explores the food of a specific culinary region, and highlights the dishes distinct to that region.Underpinning Mr Root's overarching theory is the premise that food and how it is cooked is intimately related to and is influenced by the geography, history, and culture (agri- and otherwise) of its region. As a result, each region develops a food and cooking style unique to itself. He proceeds to illustrate this with erudition, verve, wit and style. Drawing on his knowledge of French geography, history, and culture, as well as what seems to be his vast gastronomic experiences across France, he makes a fine case for how each have been an ingredient in shaping and influencing the development of the food of each region. The Food of France will not only tell you what goes into an omelette provencale, it will tell you why this is different from an omelette a la nomande or an omelette a la nicoise, as well as consider different theories as to how the omelette got its name.The book comes with a general index, as well as an index of food and dishes. Dishes are described with sufficient particularity that a good cook could reproduce the dish. I should note that as the book was written in 1958, some of his information is a little outdated (his recommendations for good years of wine) or a little late (his urgings to visit Provence before it becomes too touristed). Notwithstanding this, The Food of France is an excellent resource and wonderful read: perhaps there can be no better recommendation than to admit that I enjoyed it so much that I have gone to buy The Food of Italy, also written by Root.My Personal Rating Scale:5 stars: Engaging, well-written, highly entertaining or informative, thought provoking, pushes the envelope in one or more ways, a classic.4 stars: Engaging, well-written, highly entertaining or informative. Book that delivers well in terms of its specific genre or type, but does not do more than that.3 stars: Competent. Does what it sets out to do competently, either on its own terms on within the genre, but is nothing special. May be clich&eacute;d but is still entertaining.2 stars: Fails to deliver in various respects. Significantly clich&eacute;d. Writing is poor or pedestrian. Failed to hold my attention.1 star: Abysmal. Fails in all respects."},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"Now finishing my second reading of this tremendous book, all the while suspecting that Waverly Root was really a well-disguised poseur and not really the erudite man-of-the-world he appears to have been, I have to finally admit that, in addition to being one hell of a fine writer, he must also have been one of the most broadly-informed gourmands ever. True, occassional anecdotes and opinions of his betray the fact that the book was originally published 50 years ago, but the scope and intimacy of his knowledge with pretty much every provincial outpost, grand boulevard, and Basque backwater in France is astounding. I suspect he read and took to heart the 1950s edition of the Larousse Gastronomique, since many of the culinary practices he describes hardly deviate from what the Great Book says, but he provides so many examples of eating experiences that could be nothing but first-hand that I have to conclude that he actually DID spend his 30+ years in France doing little but travelling, eating, and drinking. These culinary expeditions are a treasure now: many of the regions he sampled so amply have been globalized to oblivion. His enthusiastic, almost childlike [but, nonetheless, world-wise] forays into the Haut Pyrenees, for example, record a local tradition of farmhouse cooking that is no more. But he was no mere chronicler of foods: his essays are leavened with witty, insightful, broadly-informed and fascinating anecdotes and contextual notes geographical, historical, literary, and agricultural. In this sense, I believe he was one of the pioneers of the broad, anectdotal form of journalism that remains perhaps the most effective means of presenting the world to an armchair audience. I have to forgive his peculiarities. Even his apparent contempt for Champagne seems inconsequential when I read his descriptions of travelling into darkest Corsica, sampling the wild, unrefined local wines, and immediately perceiving their perfect suitability to the food of the region. I am not aware of any other food and wine writer from that era who so heartily insisted on describing food and wine as a marriage. He wrote 20 years before Richard Olney brought his own sophistications to the table, and, understood in this context, his predilections must have been radical at the time.I urge you to read this book with a willingness to forgive the occassional signs of age. They are few and forgivable. Please savor the writing, with its erudition, lovely sense of timing and flow, gentle humor and enthusiasm. Please also consider it as the eloquent indictment of globalization that it is. To read a book written in the uncritical heyday of postwar American optimism and to find in it laments that the old world was slipping away, a victim of commerce and centralized policymaking, is a poignant experience indeed. This book is an education like few others."},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"The Food of France, written in 1958, is a wonderfully erudite and relaxed look into French cuisine. Root, who has evidently spent many years in France eating his way through its various provinces, has written a travelogue and a paen to French cuisine.Root divides France into various gastronomic regions, and looks at the foods typical to each of these regions. His theory, that these gastronomic regions can be collated under three different regions - the domains of fat, butter and olive oil - forms the overarching structure of the book. In each region, he describes both its social and cultural history, as well as its geography and agriculture, in order to better explain why the food of that region developed in the way that it has. His riffs move from the origin of the name &quot;Languedoc&quot; (the language where &quot;yes&quot; was &quot;oc&quot; and not &quot;oui&quot;) and &quot;Carcassonne&quot; to the reason for large roofs in the Jura region. While some of this information may undoubtedly be out of date (his urgent plea to visit Provence before it becomes too touristetd is definitely 20 years too late by now as are his recommedations of good years for particular wines), most of the information is still pertinent and interesting.Among all of this, he manages to describe with luscious wit and warmth the food of the region. He will tell you with authority how snails are cooked, which cities have the best type of pastries, and what goes into the preparation of cote de porc a la vosgienne. If you've ever wondered about the difference between an omelette a la savoyarde (and he tells an amusing and fascinating story of how the omelette came to be so named) and an omelette a la lyonnaise, what a pamplemousse is or what goes into a cassoulet (depends on which region the cassoulet is made in), this is the book for you.It comes with an excellent general index, as well as an index of food and dishes. Cooks out there might be interested to know that he frequently describes dishes with sufficient particularity that a good cook could reproduce some of the dishes so described, even though details as to proportions and cooking techiques are not provided.I enjoyed this so much that I went off to buy The Food of Italy also by Root and am anticipating reading that with equal relish. There can really be no better recommendation than that."},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"Without a doubt one of the very best written journeys through French cuisine via the country and the way it cooks food. Wonderful introduction to the best of French wines, just the right touch of history per region or dish - all vital to the appreciation of the food. It inspires the desire to take a slow 3 or 4 month tour with your appetite and this book as your guide."},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"This is a classic - I believe it is one of the first books for foodies. An accomplished American journalist in France after WWII provides a thorough discussion of what the three types of French cuisine are, where they are, how the foods and wines are linked to the terrain, and how, in terms of society development, French cuisine arrived at the point it was at the time of publication. I found it fascinating, and every time I go to travel in France, I review the section covering the region I will visit."},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"The topic, broadly, is the relationship of cuisine to its Terroir. the text is incredibly engrossing and informative. This author's place in history and time -- an American, writing in the 1950's about knowledge acquired between WWI and WWII, combined with his writing talents, make this book indispensable to both the traveler and the chef. What an insight into what makes the French so... well, French. Root famously divides France into three geogra-culinary categories: those who cook with lard, those who cook with oil, and those who cook with butter. Helpful Maps, good index make it an excellent guidebook.I am so proud to have a good used hardcover of this book in my Library."},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"This is by far the best book I have ever read on France and what makes it such a unique and beautiful country. Yes, it was written a good time ago, but unlike America history is something to cherish and is very present in France. Mr. Root captures the pure essence of France through it's food. I would strongly encourage anyone traveling to France or returning from a trip to read The Food of France. As a food writer from a day when writers told stories Mr. Root takes you into each of the regions of France provides you with tidbits of unknown and known history and the food that was shaped by it. Mr. Root knew his food very well and enjoyed it in a way that many would only hope to, a true pleasure in gastronomic reading."},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"This book is an irresistible read for anyone with a love of food an an interest in the history, geography and culture of regional France and its food products and cuisine. Root writes beautifully and it's impossible not to become as enthusiastic as the author as he shares his vast knowledge of each region of France and its culinary traditions. A book to return to again and again."},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"I moved to Europe in the late 70s when Waverly Root still wrote on food, culture and life-in-general for the International Herald Tribune. At that time he was already advanced in age and had in fact invested much of the 20th century learning what makes the French who they are. This book represents a bit of the old way of perceiving France as the leading culinary and viticultural thought-leader of its time (a vision which persisted into the Kennedy years, but not far beyond). A lot of water has flowed under the bridge since then, and nouvelle cuisine and nouveau monde wines have changed the way sophisticated people think about food and drink.Nonetheless, the book -- the details, the imagery, the culinary analysis, the richness of the language, the enthusiasm -- remains an extraordinary vital resource on French cuisine. Whether you are an expert on France, or merely curious, Root gives you the lowdown on what grows where, how it is transformed into food, and what local people might drink with it. All within the rich context of French history and geography.Breathtakingly clear, Root divides Gaul into three parts: those that cook with butter, those that cook with olive oil, and those who cook with lard and goose fat. It is a simple and coherent framework which allows the reader to immediately comprehend the inherent differences in regional cuisines.In short, even if you know French food well, you will certainly find something insightful and amusing in this book."},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"This is one of my favorite books about French cuisine. In fact, it is one of my favorite books period. Root's prose is elegant and charming, and the information is highly interesting. The book has no plot or story (it simply goes from one region of France to the next, explaining the characteristic foods, wines, and preparations of that area), and it has no pictures, and none of the \\"recipes\\" are written as such--they are merely descriptions of how the dish is prepared. But even so the book is incredibly compelling, beautifully written, and very fun to read. For a companion volume (with pictures and recipes), I would recommend Samuel Chamberlain's \\"Bouquet de France: An Epicurean Tour of the French Provinces.\\""},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"I received this if decent condition but about 30 pages were cut off at the top and connected together. I requested a new book in better condition but they were unable to do that so they refunded my purchase."},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"&quot;The Food of France&quot; is a delicious, exhausting account of the cuisine of France - definitely not reading for those watching their cholesterol level. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Muzzy -- A Video Spanish Course","review":"This is one of the best language tools for everyone. I have used this to help in learning Spanish. A friend of mine is using it to teach her children Spanish. It is a FUN learning tool. I used the English version to teach 8 Vietnamese students English. Anyone interested in learning a language would be more than pleased with this video."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Microsoft Excel 2000","review":"I was given this book at work to help me teach myself to use Excel. I was originally put off by the sheer thickness of the book, but I've found that it's a great reference for any level of user. My assistant borrows it all the time, and she's a new to both Excel and to spreadsheets. We may never even read some of the chapters, but it's a great book to have around for clear explanations and relevant examples of spreadsheet construction and general use. Don't think you have to be a math geek to read it!!"},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Microsoft Excel 2000","review":"Even the Technical Review by the highly qualified Robert Rosenberg cannot save this book.I was wooed by the size of the publisher, Que, into buying this virtually useless book. At 1063 pages, there MUST be some useful information here, right?In a nutshell, this book is essentially a less-eloquent, less-accurate, puffier rehash of the Excel Help file, written in a confusing manner with paragraphs that editorially fight with one another. The layout of the book is difficult to understand and the typeface does not enable easy &quot;digestion&quot; of the overworded sentences. AND it is printed on very heavy stock. AND there are way too many screenshots!The first bullet point on the reverse side of the book says : &quot;Manage employee costs with VLOOKUP...&quot;Ok, let's start with an analysis of VLOOKUP, which is Que's number 1 selling point:VLOOKUP: Pages 297 to 299 go into detail of the function. About 1/4 of page 619 and 1/3 of page 620 discuss more.The writer of this section begins with an example for creating a Lookup Table for test scores, stating: \\"The table needs to be set up so that the values you are looking up (in this example, the test averages) are in the leftmost column (as shown in Figure 11.19) and sorted in ascending order.\\"Anybody who has experience with VLOOKUP knows that the first column of the Table_Array *only* has to be &quot;sorted in ascending order&quot; *if* the last argument of the function is TRUE, and it does not have to be sorted if the argument is FALSE.Who do the authors consult with while writing function descriptions out? Most worksheetfunction writers want exact matches, and therefore prefer the logical value of the Range_Lookup argument to be FALSE. Why, then, did the authors start their discussion with a convoluted example of what a small percentage of worksheetfunction writers would utilize?Is that it for VLOOKUP, Que? What about using wildcards? Wildcard characters, which can dramatically enhance most worksheetfunctions, is not discussed in any of the worksheetfunctions sections, but is only mentioned in passing as a &quot;tip&quot; on page 518 in the AutoFilter section.One of the biggest VLOOKUP stumbling blocks is a #N/A - value not found - error message. Again, Que lacks on detail because most worksheetfunction writers depend on methods to suppress these error messages. Que does not supply an adequate way to do this, devoting a single sentence to the ISERROR function on page 989, with NO EXAMPLE. And again, the user is forced to rely on Excel's Help file for more information.Shouldn't there be at least one non-trivial examples of how to use such an important worksheetfunction in a 1063 page book that says it is &quot;A Must-Have Reference for Microsoft Excel 2000!&quot;?The above synopsis is a cross-section of my overall experience with this book. My numerous inquiries of the functionality of Excel have either not been covered, or been lightly glossed over by this book. I don't recall a single question I have had that has been answered by this book.Que claims that this book is for User Level Intermediate to Advanced. I don't think so. It is clearly for the beginner who doesn't want to use the Help File. The book costs $40, and is a huge waste of money."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Microsoft Excel 2000","review":"This is one of the most disorganized and unhelpful books I have ever read. Let's say you want to construct a formula. Ghapter 10 is called \\"Constructing Excel Formulas.\\" Great! But wait: no where in chapter 10 is there a section on actually constructing the formulas. After telling us how to see a sum, it jumps into editing. We haven't even constructed anything to edit! Or let's say you want to hide a column. Look in the index under \\"hiding\\" and it tells you to go to page 583. On 583 it says \\"[y]ou can hide information by using the drilldown technique on PivotTables.\\" How helpful can you be! Actually, on page 582 it gives some more hints: \\"You can hide [in italics] (page 470) rows or columns that you don't want to show....\\" And so the reader goes to page 470 to find out how to do this. On page 470 it says \\"You can maintain a chart's integrity [?] even if you hide [in italics] (page 521) the data.... Ok, the little bugger is on page 521 now, eh. And, indeed, on page 521, we are led full circle: \\"Of course, because Excel users learn quickly how to hide [in italics] (page 470 [also in italics!]) and unhide (page 583 [?]) cells, hiding provides very little real protection.\\" Fortunately, if Excel users use this book, hiding cells will afford great protection. No one would ever be able to \\"unhide\\" them."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Microsoft Excel 2000","review":"With the help of this book and the accompanying CD (worth gold) I have learnt and created tools in Excel that I could not in my entire career earlier.It is clear, easy, up-to-day and a great way to learn and refer to for any Excel work.If you just need one book for Excel from Beginner to Advanced -- this is it!Love this book.

The only room for improvement is need for more information on VBA."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Microsoft Excel 2000","review":"This book has been a real disappointment. It has two main problems. The first problem is that it's very difficult to locate relevant information--the index is very poorly constructed, and even obvious and common tasks can be hard to track down. For example, I needed to know how to make a data point on a dot plot be hollow. This isn't an unusual task, and it's quite easy, *once you know how.* Good luck finding out how from this book, though.The second problem is that the information provided is often quite sketchy--an unexpected feature in a book that is over 1000 pages long. In the worst case, I found that for a whole class of features that I needed documentation on (Excel's built-in statistical tests), it actually referred me to Excel's help feature. Obviously, if that were adequate, I wouldn't have bought the book!The fact that this book hasn't caused me any actual damage saves it from a one-star review; however, if you need either a tutorial or a comprehensive reference on Excel 2000, this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Microsoft Excel 2000","review":"I'm a small business owner in Southern California.

It is actually a joy to read its 1000+ pages.I was probably a low-end intermediate user of Excel when I purchased the book. I started at the beginning of the book to refresh and upgrade my understanding from Excel 97 to Excel 2000. I constantly found myself amazed at what I was learning and there were several times when I actually felt drawn in to reading 20 or 40 more pages than I had originally intended to read at one sitting because I wanted to see what came next. Within the first couple of days of owning this book, I was committed to reading the book cover-to-cover and moving up to becoming a power user of Excel.I have been raving about the quality of Blattner's book to clients, associates and friends and highly recommend it to Excel users of any skill level. For the first time I actually look forward to reading future books by a specific author of books on computing. Patrick Blattner is that caliber of a writer. I also look forward to what he and Que put on their respective book websites to expand my Excel learning experienceThe CD is a gold mine of Excel Workbooks from the book, and contains many additional resources worth at least the cost of the book. My only disparaging remark is that Que choose to include a .PDF copy of the book on the CD with the copy, past and print functions disabled. A fully functioning .HTML version would have been so much more valuable. I got spoiled reading the .HTML chapters of the book at the mcp.com BetaBooks site before it was published. I used those chapters like I use the hard copy of the book by highlighting text and inserting comments, etc. and I miss capability with the .PDF and will therefore only use it when I am on the road without my hard copy. I am sure Que choose to do what they did out of concern for intellectual property protection but I think their logic is faulty and encourage them to switch formats in the future."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Microsoft Excel 2000","review":"This is by far the most uselful book I've bought this year. I consider myself an above-average user when it comes to Excel, and wanted to get a head start on this new release before my office upgrades. When I purchase a computer book I want something that reads easily, and explains the workings of the software in a coherent way. I'd bought Laurie Ulrich's books in the past and stuck with her for just these reasons. Blattner's chapters read almost as well, and I guess that's why the publishers teamed them up: they know what they're talking about, and know how to explain it. The best thing about this book is you don't need to be a rocket scientist to get something out of it. My wife, who's not a computer person, has been using the book too and feels it's one of the few books that doesn't make her feel inadequate because she's not a &quot;power-user&quot;. What more can I say? I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Microsoft Excel 2000","review":"This Special Edition Using Excel is the exception to my personal rule that Really Big Computer Books are boring and hard to use. This book is accessible and clear, but doesn't baby you. Having taught myself to use Excel, I had a lot of holes in my own knowledge base, and this book helped me master basic things (like setting up a worksheet, editing my data) and the more advanced stuff I need to do (like setting up pivottables, building macros, and adding Excel objects to other applications). If you have other needs, you'll find them covered in this book.Now about that training ---- I am a big fan of training, and have taken a lot of computer classes, both live and online. I never got around to taking an Excel class, though, but after using this book, I feel like I did take a class. This is probably due to fact that one of the writers (Ulrich) is a trainer. The book starts with basic concepts, to make sure everyone has the foundation topics down and then moves through an impressive spectrum of Excel features, covering most of them thoroughly but not cryptically. I work with technical people and find that they like to impress you with what they know, but don't really care if you &quot;get it&quot; when they show you how to do something. Trainers on the other hand, want to make sure you understand before moving on. You get that feeling from most of the chapters in this book, and in the chapters that assumed more previous experience than I have, the foundation built in the earlier chapters saw me through.I recommend this book to users of all levels, even &quot;newbies&quot; even though these NYC-Phonebook-thick computer books aren't meant for new users. The patient, friendly style is easy to read, but the book won't disappoint even the most powerful of power users."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Microsoft Excel 2000","review":"Special Edition Using Excel 2000 is a must have for any serious Excel user. The authors' employment of over 1000 screen captures attests to the rich \\"visualness\\" of this book. \\"How to\\" steps for achieving some tasks are simply not laid out numerically; the reader is gently interrupted after some steps, and given a picture of what his/her screen should look like.In addition to the visual illustrations, the authors follow up most tasks with practical everyday examples of where one might utilize a particular skill to expedite Excel usage. As an instructor of Microsoft software, I am always searching for additional instances for applying a particular skill out in the workplace; their examples are invaluable.Many of the book's examples are contained on the accompanying CD, which means they become interactive for the reader. Load these examples onto your computer, and practice the steps outlined in the book.....experiment with other scenarios and check that your outcome mimics that shown in the book.Speaking of the CD, it contains not only the entire book which makes searching electronically very quick and easy, but it also has in essence......another entire book! One of the authors - Patrick Blattner - has included a 388 PowerPoint slide presentation, which takes Excel's chart building capabilities beyond the obvious. All the tricks to massaging a chart into a finished polished product are included in this step by step presentation.I have carefully examined many competitive books covering Excel 2000 and found this edition to be far superior. With its over 1000 pages of instruction, over 1000 figures, tables, and drawings, and extensive use of cross references to lead the reader to previous illustrations or further areas of study......this is the book I take to the classroom and recommend for anyone eager to use Excel to it fullest!Rebecca Marsh - Catapult Instructor"},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Microsoft Excel 2000","review":"Using Excel 2000 by Patrick Blattner is probably the most useful book for Excel users.Although this book covers everything from formatting cells to VBA it is especially practical for those who are looking for ideas and guidelines on how to make use of the numerous charting functionalities of Excel. The author introduces methods that combine Excel's interactive elements with graphical functions. Particularly one example about dynamically creating charts was an enormous help. In addition it is shown how to create 3D and even 4D Matrizes by bringing together advanced layout possibilities and Excels mathematical power.Another topic that this book covers is the use of Excel as a planning tool. Patrick Blattner shows how Excel can be used to create GANTT charts that usually can only be created with Software like MS Project.Needless to say that every example mentioned in the book is on CD-Rom as well. 5 Stars for a book that is definitely worth it's money."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Microsoft Excel 2000","review":"I really wish I'd had this book last year when I set up the spreadsheets for our organization.

I see from her Amazon interview that one of the authors (Ulrich) is a trainer, and that's quite obvious in the book because the steps in the instructions are really very clear, and the descriptions of how to use the button or the feature or whatever it might be are really simple to understand without sacrificing detail. I found the coverage of taking Excel data to the web to be especially useful.

There are parts of Excel I don't use, but they're covered in this book, too, and I know I can rely on this book to help me if I ever decide to use those parts. In my job I support seven CPA's at a large firm, and whenever they don't know how to do something in Excel, they ask me.

The authors provide overviews of only the most common functions, and even then they lack good examples for most of them. Also, when they get into the Macro/VBA section, they provide only a brief overview without much detail. Also, one of the authors spends an inordinate amount of time showing how to create Gantt charts; This may or may not be what you want.Overall, a good book if you are new to Excel, but you'll need more if you use a lot of functions or macros."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Microsoft Excel 2000","review":"I bought this because I had previously found the 'Using Excel 1997' guide very useful--it seemed that 90% of the time I could actually find exactly what I wanted via the index!

When I started using Office/Excel 2000 I wanted to improve my knowledge of some areas--particularly the Pivot Table/Charting enhancements.

Much of the selection is good, the illustrations are good and often helpful, and the introductions to each period and to individual plays are often very good. Of course, some of them are predictable: it would be nice to see some exciting Strindberg for a change; Miss Julie is really getting weary. However, it is when when we reach the second half of the Twentieth century that the quality breaks down. We find the same tired list of plays chosen for their political correctness: something on race, something for feminists, etc, etc, with very litte convincing attention paid to what has actually happened in the theatre, viewed either from the point of view of box officee appeal (which was a good enough criterion for Shakespeare), or what is likely to be historically influential. A major exception is Mamet's OLEANNA, guaranteed to stir disagreement and excitement in the classroom as it does in the theatre. Each reader will find other exceptions, but the predictability and tedium of the modern selection is disappointing. This text is widely used in classrooms, incuding my own, because there is no satisfactory alternative, but as a text for modern theatre it's a failure, and it's VERY expensive for a student's budget."},{"Title":"The Bedford Introduction to Drama (Third Edition)","review":"I don't know how much this book goes for anymore but while in college I've shelled out up to $150 for a book i used once.

Here's why I like: it has more or less all of the must-read plays of the past milennia. Since I'm not a student of drama or theatre, I'm grateful Lee A. Jacobus took the time to select and collect these for me, so I can be assured of reading quality stuff. The bonus-essays add depth and are thought-provoking.I agree with one of the other reviewers that the plays of the final half of the 20th century seem to be selected for political correctness. I'll probably skip those, but given that they only take up only about 150 pages of a total of over 1100 pages, I'm more then happy with the book as a whole.So: ideal reading for the casual reader.

I purchased Amazing Mazes for Kids for him and he really enjoys using it as part of his devotions. The two books go nicely together. What I like about this book is that there are some very cleverly designed mazes (made of musical instruments scattered about, bricks layed out for drying, wheat stalks, Samson's hair, waves on the sea, scales of a fish, herds of sheep, and so on...) as well as the standard lined labyrinths. There are even a few word searches and puzzles. There's a very nice mix in the difficulty range. The mazes/puzzles are all printed in black, preceded by a brief account of the story that the maze applies to. One thing that would have improved the book would have been the inclusion of one maze or puzzle for each book of the Bible. Beyond that, I feel this was a worthy purchase."},{"Title":"SO NEAR THE HEART","review":"This is an easy read about a college-age girl named Miranda and her aspirations to make a career on stage in the 1940-1950's. The majority of the action centers around the Shakespeare Festival that she is acting in, and follows her, her friends (and enemies), and in particular, male friends (one of whom is directing the play)during a summer. It is quite innocent by today's standards. I felt the book was a bit shallow, although considerable energy is spent on describing the girl's deep angst she experiences as she moves toward stardom. There is passing mention of her family, but not much emphasis is put on them. Hard work and discipline are seen as good qualities, and necessary for excellence in the craft. If one was particularly interested in acting and the goings on of stage life in this time period, they might enjoy this story a bit more than I did. :)"},{"Title":"Student Workbook for Essentials of Anatomy and Physiology, 4e","review":"Very little writing and the book cover and pages were in excellent condition.

Unlike the majority of the other books in the series, we really get a glimpse at Qwill's rather humorous problems with women. A great mystery, though a little iffy on the motives, and a definite must-read!"},{"Title":"The Cat Who Wasn't There","review":"Some regular readers of this series find the Moose County setting to be somewhat dull while others love the eccentric people and odd places that make up Moose County. I tend to fall into the second category but this book contains both home and away settings so everybody should be pleased.Jim Qwilleran has just rushed home from his summer retreat in the Potato Mountains because a prowler has accosted his lady friend Polly Duncan. He has hardly settled back into life in Pickax City when Polly informs him that a group of Moose County residents are planning a trip to Scotland. Since Polly is going and since, as he informs everyone he sees, his mother was a Mackintosh, Qwilleran decides to sign up for the trip himself.Once the group arrives in Scotland everything is a blur as Irma Hasselrich takes them through the Highlands and Western Isles at a breakneck speed. That is until one of their number has an apparent heart attack and dies. To make things even worse, their bus driver mysteriously disappears with some of their luggage. This odd coincidence and the fact that the deceased had been closely associated with the bus driver sets Qwilleran's mustache to tingling. Even more odd, when the ace reporter calls home to check on the cats he finds out that Koko had let out a blood curdling yowl at the exact moment that the member of the touring party had died.When they arrive back in Moose County Qwilleran starts to sniff around and begins to formulate a theory. Unfortunately, the cats do not agree with his theory and both of them start to leave all of the clues that they can think of. Koko even makes a series of mad dashes that end with him plowing into Qwilleran like a mad bull in an apparent attempt to push the amateur sleuth in another direction. In the end of course, Qwilleran and his feline friends solve the mystery but not before Yum Yum ends up in a very dangerous situation.This is one of the more engaging books in this series and the mystery plays a larger part in this plot that it does in some of the other books. The descriptions of Scotland are marvelous and the sometimes rather odd Scottish diet is well described. The reader is also introduced to some more residents of Moose County like the Chisholm sisters who have a huge collection of teddy bears and also the new director of the Community Theater, Dwight Somers. I suppose that Mrs. Braun had to introduce some new residents of Moose County since she keeps killing off the old ones. The Community Theater by the way is producing \\"Macbeth\\", which is in part responsible for the group's trip to Scotland.I just love Moose County and I also love Scotland so there isn't much about this book that I didn't like, although I was mighty worried about Yum Yum for a little while. Along with the new characters, several old friends make appearances and this book is just really an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Wasn't There","review":"This is one of my favorite &quot;Cat Who&quot; mysteries. The descriptions of Scotland and its landscape make this one worth it. Koko and Yum Yum work well together. This is one of Braun's best for showing feelings. When Yum Yum was catnapped, I felt a lot of the same feelings that Qwill probably felt. It might be better, however, if Yum Yum were allowed to help Qwill and Koko solve the mystery, instead of being a cute little female."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Wasn't There","review":"Polly is being stalked. Qwill is worried that someone is trying to kidnap her. He is very protective of her for a time. They decide to join a tour of Scotland.The tour turns tragic. One resident of Moose County does not return home from the tour alive. Qwill and Koko try to figure out what is going on in Pickax. Strange things are going on about town and a mysterious stranger is spotted all over the county.I liked this installment of, \\"The Cat Who..\\" series. It was a little dark and sad, but nevertheless excellently written."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Wasn't There","review":"Jim Qwilleran, millionaire bachelor and resident of Moose county (400 miles north of everywhere) has dashed back home to protect his lady friend, Polly the liberian, from a stalker. Qwill is convinced that she is being targeted to be used as a way to blackmail him. When he finds that a tour of the Scottish Highlands (insipired by the local production of MacBeth) is being organized and that Polly is planning to go he decides to go along. Tragedy strikes the tour, a member dies of natural causes or were they so natural? Qwill and Polly return home where he, aided as always by his Siamese cats, Koko and YumYum uncover the true motives and culprits to, of course, save the day.The mystery is, as always is the case in this series, secondary to the 'cozy' element of Moose County background but in this book is a bit more complex. We are treated to visits by many of the Moose County crowd including a return by Dr. Melinda Goodwinter, Qwill's first lady friend in Moose County (The Cat Who Played Brahms)."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Wasn't There","review":"In this, the 14th Qwilleran/Koko/Yum Yum mystery, Koko helps solve a case that began in Scotland while he was at home! I really enjoyed this. In some of these books you can figure out what happened earlier, but in this one I was almost at the end when I realized who was doing what. The characters seemed deeper in this one too, and having a Scottish locale for part of the book added interest. A good read."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Wasn't There","review":"she obviously has not read the &quot;Cat Who...&quot; series...I have read 18 of the series and have thoroughly enjoyed everyone single one of them.

I cannot believe that I have become such a dedicated fan of these books; it is somewhat embarrassing. However, I have a very beautiful Siamese and I think I am in love with George Guidal's voice. I am in my car a lot (alone, this is a secret vice) and I feel oddly comforted by the antics of KoKo and YumYum and Qwillerin. I live in a small town seemingly 400 miles SOUTH of everywhere, so I can somewhat relate to the venue of PickAx. I just wish my town was as much fun, that I had someone ridiculously wealthy like Qwill to take me out to dinner, buy me odd gifts and not care that I wore a size 16! Obviously, a major fantasy! Oh, and even though my cat is extremely intelligent, she has not yet solved a mystery. The Cat Who Wasn't There is good because it has all the essential elements of a quintessential Cat Who... book plus a neat trip to Scotland!

This is one of the more dramatic works in the long series providing as it does action in Scotland and in Pick-Axe, and multiple crimes for our heroes, man and cat, to figure out. As usual, Guidall gives us fine voice production for all characters, while avoiding any tendency to bore the listener with the extended passages of internal monologue by the human hero.All in all, a treat for regular listeners as well as first time visitors."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Wasn't There","review":"A great listen to CD in a car.

This tantalizing whodunit has something for lovers of cats, mysteries, and (in this one book) Scotland. This is mystery at it's best. Viva Braun! Viva Koko! Viva Qwilleran! Viva Frobnitz!"},{"Title":"The Cat Who Wasn't There","review":"If you read more than a few Cat Who's you will find them becoming comfortable, like another \\"Lake Woebegon.\\" There's not much suspense, mystery, thrill, or romance left by now, but increasing numbers of \\"tall tales\\" of Moose County (now collected in a new book) and amusing characters who all seem to have \\"hearts of gold\\" whatever their pseudo-rough veneer (except of course for the murderer, almost incidentally). While Qwill, our cozy billionaire journalist and lead character, carefully never says ill of another, there's just enough acerbic comment on somebody's part to keep these stories from terminal cuteness. Besides cat-lovers (especially SIAMESE cat-lovers), these stories will please admirers of the Far North, Arts and Crafts, and things Scottish. Indeed, The Cat Who Wasn't There takes place most entirely in Scotland, which is why it's one of the better ones, since it forces Qwill into new surroundings. The Cat Who Moved a Mountain is one of my favorites for the same reason, besides providing an intriguing other rural alternative to Moose County.Although there is a comfortable and appealing continuity of characters and back stories from book to book, they might become soporific if you read them one right after another. They are bonbons for the mind, best not overdosed. The series is one you can let kids of any age discover and enjoy, too. The whole family can read them, and perhaps the allusions to historical people, music, styles, and places may excite some additional interest among your young ones!"},{"Title":"The Cat Who Wasn't There","review":"Lilian Jackson Braun has the talent of bringing a wholly and undoubtedly fictional scenario (I mean there can be no place on earth like Pickax!) to life with warmth, yet some sharpness. The characters and their doings, throughout this series, are more important than the crime and its final solution by Qwill and/or the cats. A lovely, heart-warming read always."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Wasn't There","review":"Hi!!

He and Yum Yum are back in Pickax being coddled by a catsitter. However, Koko won't sit still once Qwill has returned, minus one member from the party. Koko is behaving oddly and while he may have been miles away from the murder scene, he's just a whisker away from cracking the case."},{"Title":"Documentary in the Digital Age","review":"Really cool book - goes into detail about a ton of artists and their works - def what I was looking for. Buy it."},{"Title":"Pinky","review":"I laughed I cried and unlike Vince, I nodded my head in understanding.This is one of the best things I've read in years. I hope it's not the authour's final work. Maybe because I can relate to the story or maybe that it's a familliar story well told. I didn't grow up anywhere near California, but I was there through every word of this book, from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Pinky","review":"Is there anything quite so magical as first love? That initial meeting of the eyes and the hands, the exhilaration felt every time you glimpse your beloved, agonizing over every word uttered by either of you, and the unforgettable thrill of that first kiss. When you read &quot;Pinky,&quot; you experience it all through the eyes of 16-year-old Vincent Bezdek, a hero as endearing as any to ever capture my heart.A transplanted Nebraskan farm boy, Vince quickly becomes enamored with Ventura, California, and almost as quickly falls in love with the beautiful girl next door who appears to be too busy with painting and ballet to even notice him--or so he thinks. He focuses his attention on his other love: hot rods--specifically, the 1940 Ford coupe he plans to customize, but when the summer ends, Vince discovers he must never assume anything about this girl called Pinky. The morning of the first day of school, she gets into Vince's coupe as if he should have known all along she would do so, and so begins the natural progression of their relationship and the role the little '40 coupe plays in it all.Vince and Pinky's love is sweet and innocent, but it's also deep and complex. Because he is so much in awe of Pinky's talent and unpredictable nature, Vince doesn't seem to realize how special he is himself and how much Pinky loves him in return. Pinky is not only talented and smart, she is also fearless and passionate and does her best to help Vince believe they are meant to be. They have their share of misunderstandings and hardships, but their mutual respect and depth of character carries them over the hurdles with only a few stumbles--until high school ends and the adult world rears its demanding head to make them both make the hardest decisions of their lives.This coming-of-age story made me laugh out loud and shed tears of heartbreak and joy, and I came to think of the characters as members of my own family. The book is 536 pages and I was still sorry to reach the end, because the story is told in the author's engaging voice that reads like a conversation with a close friend. Although I didn't understand some of the technical details about building a hot rod, they were woven into the story so naturally they seemed only more proof of Vince's love for Pinky, because anyone who knows cars so intimately and would still give them up in a heartbeat for a girl has most surely found true love.&quot;Pinky&quot; is a book that will leave you feeling you've just taken a drive along the Ventura coastline, shared the beauty of an ocean sunset with someone special, and fallen in love for the first time. You'll finish it feeling wistful over the story's end, but you'll also feel as if you've gained some new friends you'll never forget."},{"Title":"Pinky","review":"If you like sugar heaped on your ice cream, this is the novel for you. It is saccharin-sweet to the point of being cloy. Joyce Sterling Scarborough's uncritical review provides a masterful summary of the plot (not surprisingly, since she's almost a full time reviewer, judging by her about me).Those who pick up Pinky for the romance will be disappointed. There is no conflict between the protagonists to heighten the drama until three-quarters the way through. Those who read the novel for the hotrod elements Jay Carnine is famous for will be equally let down. For much of the book the girl gets in the way.The heroine and hero are mature beyond their years. Everyone - except the school bullies, that is - are so ordered, so well-adjusted. Pinky is the literary equivalent of a rose-tinted Robert Kincade painting. Little disturbs the idealized 1950s California picture. No one builds a fallout shelter in their backyard, no boy worries about being drafted. The bank president lives in total harmony next to the worker from the nearby orange groves. Parents and kids get along in perfect harmony. Few sexual stirrings trouble these teenagers.Like many novels from POD publishers, Pinky suffers from an obvious lack of a firm editorial hand. Inside this 535-page book is an interesting 200-page novel trying to get out."},{"Title":"Dumpy the Dumptruck","review":"As the story begins, everyone is hard at work on Merryhill Farm...Bee-Bee the Backhoe, Trundle the Tractor. Everyone, that is except Dumpy. He's old, rusty and broken and stuck in the tall grass behind the barn. There are birds and mice living in the stuffing of his leather seats and it looks like his work days at Merryhill Farm are over. Farmer Barnes is planning on having him towed away to make room for a new and bigger barn and this makes his son, Charlie sad. &quot;It's so sad to get rid of something you love just to make room for something new.&quot; His grandfather, Pop-Up agrees and they hatch a plan to save Dumpy.

And in no time, Dumpy's better than ever, looking good and back to work, helping to raise the new barn..... Julie Andrews and her daughter, Emma Hamilton have written a charming, endearing story about love, teamwork and purpose that will delight youngsters aged 3-7. Their gentle text, full of imagery and sound effects, is complimented by Tony Walton's colorful and expressive artwork and together, they have authored a story with the subtle message that big and new isn't always better.

They fill out the story, provide maps and walkthroughs, catalogs of items, and explain the complicated bits if there are any. Many, like this guide come out pre-production of the US version of the game. Which means that small errors and differences are inevitable.So what irritated me about this particular 'Strategy Guide'. Actually, it was several things, but the most glaring omission is any attempt at a weapons list. That doesn't sound like much, but this game has weapons galore, and they are often vital to solving a particular confrontation. When a guide tells you to select a weapon with good fire spells, and you have to paw through an entire collection of twin blades, it can get on your nerves.This isn't what I would call a necessary guide - .hack//OUTBREAK is not a difficult game from the viewpoint of plot or monster slayage. If you play the game straight, you may miss some of the cooler weapons and armors and never get to beat the goblins, but you will win the game without anything unfathomable happening. In these circumstances a guide should amplify the experience, be something of a souvenir, and NOT forget to tell you some important things.This guide falls a bit short. Not fatally, but just enough to be an irritant. Think twice before imbibing."},{"Title":".hack(tm) Part 3: Outbreak Official Strategy Guide (Official Strategy Guides (Bradygames)) (Pt. 3)","review":"Sure, they added stuff like all the dvd keyword areas, and this time they got almost everything...but they still didn't add a weapons list again."},{"Title":".hack(tm) Part 3: Outbreak Official Strategy Guide (Official Strategy Guides (Bradygames)) (Pt. 3)","review":"A very useful and decent guide for the .Hack (dotHack) Outbreak (Part 3) game in the series.

I started reading it over supper one evening this summer after arriving home from work late, and didn't put it down -- *couldn't* put it down -- until after midnight when I finished it in tears. I was totally caught up in the lives of these people, totally engrossed in their interwoven, tragic lives and the larger context in which they lived.It took my breath away. It is a beautifully written book, very poetic, profoundly moving, and such an important novel for the end of this century. I haven't read such a powerful novel since Poisonwood Bible, which I also read in galley a year earlier. (And I read (and listen to) a *lot* of books.) Like Poisonwood, it is at once a detailed study of the intimate lives of people you come to care about very much, and also a profound statement about power and imperialism. It offers spiritual and political lessons as well as its poetry.I hope this isn't a spoiler... but when I finished the book, aside from wiping away my tears, the only other thing I could think to do that seemed appropriate was to give my (teen-ager) son a long, warm hug.I hope that many, many, many people will discover this gem of a book and love it as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Mark Of An Angel: Library Edition","review":"What beautiful and unique writing! Nancy Huston is a great French-Canadian writer whose work I will be looking forward to reading in the future. The Mark of the Angel is a stunning novel set in Paris during the 1950's. The historic feel of the novel -- after World War 2, during the Algerian war -- is extremely accurate! The story of a daughter of a Nazi having an affair with a Jewish Communist is thought provoking and intense. There are various political views illustrated in this novel.Huston's writing style makes this beautiful work of art seem like silk. The narrative style is very unique. A tale of adultery, this novel sort of reminds me of The Scarlet Letter, but with strong political views and great historical feel. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Mark Of An Angel: Library Edition","review":"The structure and style of this novel are engaging and effective. The interjections of the narrator force the reader to focus not only on Saffie's story, but to pull back from this narrow focus and absorb the author's bigger message. Her message is a grim one - that history teaches us little, and that human beings will continue to abuse and murder one another with the belief that their cause is right and justifiable. I think the reader could have understood the message with a little less input from the narrator whose voice was, at times, intrusive and tended to state the obvious. This is a novel that delivers a disturbing assessment of mankind, but it is beautifully written and gives the reader much food for thought. I will forever think of the philtrum (that funny little dent between your nose and your upper lip) as &quot;the mark of the angel&quot; now, and remember Ms. Huston's powerful book and message as I do."},{"Title":"The Mark Of An Angel: Library Edition","review":"This was a book that kept me interested from the very beginning. Perhaps it has something to do with the author's style which shares a remarkable similarity with Milan Kundera's, who happens to be one of my favorite writers. Or, maybe it has to do with the Rue de Seine, in which much of the book takes place, and, where I have spent a lot of time over the years. Huston's way of telling this story about a young German woman's life in the aftermath of WWII is highly unusual and also reminds us of the terrible consequences of a cataclysm of this magnitude. Very few works deal with the absolute terror and madness that war inflicts on its survivors. The particular way the author works out the story of Saffie is truly a work of profound intelligence that should get its rightful recognition amongst late 20th century fiction. Congratulations, Nancy Huston. Not only are you lovely to look at, you are a very good writer."},{"Title":"The Mark Of An Angel: Library Edition","review":"A story of forbidden love in post-war Paris between two people damaged in different ways by the Holocaust--you've read it before. But Huston's book is a cut above--beautifully written from multiple perspectives, Huston describes Paris, love, music and above all, anger and shock over infidelity discovered, so strongly and vividly--this one has stayed in my mind for awhile. And the conclusion was a brutal shock! Of particular interest to me was the backdrop of the French--Algerian issues--as England had India, France had Algeria--a painful, shameful episode in the history of a Western democracy that has permanently marred France's conception of itself."},{"Title":"The Mark Of An Angel: Library Edition","review":"Huston manages to create a mural of the failure and pain of being human in the arc of human history. Her exquisite juxtaposition of the Algerian War and the love story of damaged survivors of WWII set in bas relief the eternal story of love and war throught time. In addition, Huston defies the common notion that the study of history teaches humanity to prevent its relapse. In both the devestation of memory and the torture of forgetting, she points out danger lines the road. Interjecting the ironic voice of the narrator into this tale of Saffie, Andras and Raphael, Huston leads us through the repetitive labyrinth - politics, anger, hate, dismemberment, torture, death - &quot;old, old, old story called 'news.'&quot; Her characters shine like iconic figures caught in klieglights through the very last word. The reader is snared, captured and devastated as Huston unfolds a tale of doomed love and doomed lives in the Parisian streets of the late 50's. Surely a most gifted writer, Huston forces us to ponder the meaning of being &quot;human&quot;."},{"Title":"The Mark Of An Angel: Library Edition","review":"I liked this book very much. It explores surviving WWII from a different perspective than I've read before. The reader empathizes with both the German and the Holocaust survivor. Rather than dwell on the horrors of their experiences, the book describes their emotional adaptation. I found the writing style awkward at times, especially the author's presence, however, it provides an easy way to incorporate a modern viewpoint and historic context. It is a fairly quick read and very captivating. I don't think the book has received the attention it deserves. It was interesting to read The Mark of the Angel immediately after finishing After Long Silence (Fremont) and Homestead (Lippi). After Long Silence is about people who have buried their experiences during the Holocaust completely -- after passing as Catholic for many years, their daughters force the truth (that they are Jewish) into the open. The book goes into detail about the parents' stories and the emotional effects of exposing the truth. War plays more of a background role in Homestead, which tells the story of multiple generations of women living in rural Austria, but the effects of war clearly mark the characters. Homestead was definitely my favorite of the three books -- it is incredibly beautifully crafted. Some of the stories told and pictures of the landscape will stay with me for a long time."},{"Title":"The Mark Of An Angel: Library Edition","review":"I force fed all my friends copies of Fugitve Pieces by Anne Michaels, another Canadian writing on a similar theme. One of them came back with The Mark of the Angel saying she preferred it.She may be right. I burned through this book. I stayed in on a picture perfect Sydney day to read it while images of the degeneration in Israel/Palestine flash on the TV screen. A theme of the book is that all the tragedies and happinesses have happened to someone before and that they will happen again is at once liberating and depressing. The book succeeds on 2 fronts. Love and political conflict.It captures the dynamics of the hopes and expectations we bring to new loves and relationships with some candour but not too cynically.And, it describes with surgical precision how political conflicts escalate and polarise. How the victims carry emotional baggage. How we fight the last war over and over.Wonderful imagery without pretension or self indulgence. The ending built up so that I was tense as I flew through the later pages.I also learned more about recent French history than I knew before. Kind of useful in understanding how the world works."},{"Title":"The Mark Of An Angel: Library Edition","review":"The story is very good and the characters feel real, but what sets this book apart is the style in which it is written.The narrator's voice weaves expertly between story-teller and omniscent observer.There is one moment in particular - I will not spoil it by saying which - where this is done absolutely perfectly.It has been a long time since I've read a book where I noticed, and yet didn't find abrasive, the author's voice. Just the opposite, in fact."},{"Title":"The Mark Of An Angel: Library Edition","review":"Like so many other things one associates with the ultra-romantic French national character, this book, too, betrays both an extravagance of emotion and the desire here to dramatize (and incorporate in the book) every possible personal and political trauma of the last half-century. Saffie, the main character, is almost literally a ghost, so traumatized as a German Aryan &quot;victim&quot; of the Nazi horror that she cannot function at all as a human. Her husband Raphael, a flutist, is so busy making beautiful music that he never has a clue about his wife's 5-year affair. Their child, unlike any kid I've ever known (!), never, ever blabs a word about Andras, the other man in his mother's life, to his father, though he sees Andras every time his mother does--very frequently--and refers to him as Apu. Andras, a Jewish Hungarian Holocaust victim, is also intimately involved in the Algerian fight for independence from France. Added to this whole sticky pie are the additional heart-tuggers--the desire of Andras to educate Saffie about minorities and about German history, her inability to experience maternal feelings for her child, her rejection by her mother-in-law, her perfect housekeeping and gourmet cooking, and a completely unrealistic breakdown by Raphael at a critical moment. A real melodrama that tries too hard to be &quot;significant&quot; by pushing every emotional button known to man, with the result that it is sentimental, over-the-top melodrama."},{"Title":"The Mark Of An Angel: Library Edition","review":"I read this book with great interest, and was quite moved and captivated. The book starts and ends grimly, but there is no other hope for Saffie, as we learn of her past. I was entranced by the beauty of the middle part of the book, and it made a mark on me. There is a fresh perspective on the holocaust, as seen through a child's innocent eye, and there is an epic love affair that is forbidden. I thought the writing was excellent at times, but was taken aback somewhat when the author had personal &quot;asides&quot; to the reader. The Mark of the Angel was riveting and I would be interested in following this author in her next book."},{"Title":"The Mark Of An Angel: Library Edition","review":"This author is from France. The book was such a bestseller there that it was translated for the States. Need I say more? While I was in New York City in August 2000 I read in the NY Times Book Review about this book. It primarily appealed to me because of the review written by Arthur Golden, author of MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA. I had just finished his book. Arthur Golden wrote that this book was &quot;Compelling and highly original...You many never read a novel crafted with more wonder and mystery.&quot; I would agree with that except for Arthur Goldens' book MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA which deserves the same review. Anyway, that was all it took for me to jot down the title and buy the book at the nearest bookstore. (Normally, I'd have bought it at amazon.com...but I was anxious.) The Mark of the Angel is simply a love story that takes place during the late 1950s, early 1960s in Paris France. There's an unexpected tragedy at the end. There are underlying historic tragic events written in between. Here are a few of my favorites lines: Excited to find himself alone in his own house with a young green-eyed foreigner who says practically nothing.------ Every person's suffering is the most important, isn't it?------ Contrary to what you'd believed during the first hours, the first days, at most the first months of enchantment, the person you love hasn't radically transformed you.------ The body serves a purpose, it can change the course of history.------ &quot;music is my way of taking part in the struggle, making the world a better place to live...&quot;"},{"Title":"The Mark Of An Angel: Library Edition","review":"A wonderfully told tale of a young German immigrant to France.

I have not had enough tragedy in my life. After reading a book like this I dwell on how soft my life has been and how guilty I feel about it.The story line here is quite simple. Woman marries man for wrong reasons. Woman then meets man who fulfills inner needs and falls in love. Woman has child with husband but remains in love with the man she has met. Man finds out. Man kills child and everyones life is ruined.But that is not what this book is really about. It is about the incredible inner struggles that these characters go through, the unspeakable horrors of the wars in Europe and the unexplainable things that humans do to each other.Main character Saffie acts a bit strange at first. But we understand why when we learn what she has experienced. Same for her lover Andras. I personally struggled with what these people had seen. I became introsepctive and self critical as I pondered on the lives of those who lived through the Holocaust and Algerian cleansing periods.Well written and fast moving, Huston has done a great job in displaying emotion and courage. Read this book to learn a little about these characters and a lot about yourself."},{"Title":"The Mark Of An Angel: Library Edition","review":"Ughhh. This was a book club pick. The whole thing is bleak. When there is finally a glimmer of happiness for Saffie, it's based on lies and secrecy, thus affecting her son and husband.

I kept waiting for the main chararcter, Saffie, to find happiness or atleast some contentment with her life. When she finally did find it I felt she was so dishonest and living such a lie that I could not be happy. Then to top it all of she teaches her son to live a dishonest life and that does not even touch on the ending, how tragic! It ended abruptly and with such heartbreak that I still feel down and I finished early today. The only reason I give it 2 stars is due to the historical content."},{"Title":"The Mark Of An Angel: Library Edition","review":"I hadn't intended to read this book, even though it kept popping up on my recommendations list. A coworker brought it to me, however, with lots of praise, and I wasn't disappointed. Huston's prose is easy and engaging, if unconventional. Her characters really lived for me, too, despite my distance from place (Paris), time (late 1950s-early 1960s), and situation (war, adultery). I wasn't satisfied with the end, however, which seemed too abrupt. There was little to no falling action after the unlooked-for climax, and I felt a little cheated by that. Over all, it's worthy reading material, even for those not interested in &quot;end of the millenium&quot; fiction (I don't know where the reviewer got that, in all honesty; I was expecting some sort of futuristic apocolypse), and it made me look at current events such as Kosovo and Belgrade in a whole new light."},{"Title":"The Mark Of An Angel: Library Edition","review":"I guess my main problem with this novel was the main character, Saffie. She was too psychotic to appreciate. By the time Huston started revealing information about Saffie's past I had already formed a picture of a heartless nutcase and I found it hard to sympathize with Saffie. Furthermore, I thought that Andras was a down to earth, sensible, young buck and I found it hard to believe that he would ever fall for a weirdo like Saffie. There was also this whole notion of love at first sight - gimme a break. When Andras and Saffie met I felt like I was reading a category romance from the grocery store. The only reason that I would give this book two stars instead of one was because there were many instances were Huston showed her ability as a good writer. I really liked the little passages from the narrator and the explanation of the title. I probably would've enjoyed the book more if Saffie hadn't been such a head case. She could've been mildly weird but her bizarre behavior was too extreme and made her seem completely weak and heartless."},{"Title":"The Mark Of An Angel: Library Edition","review":"If you are someone who enjoys inteligent, interesting, believable naratives... If you are a fan of Alice Hoffman, Ursula Hegi, Jane Hamilton, Rebecca Wells... If these are the kinds of authors and books that you enjoy, this is not a book for you.

There is no good reason to spend your time and money on this book, as I regretfully did."},{"Title":"The Mark Of An Angel: Library Edition","review":"Huston's voice and writing style are okay, but the storyline and conclusion are so unsatisfying and miserable, that I found myself wondering why I'd wasted time with The Mark of An Angel.

It's moderately informative and its only failing is its age, as while the airplanes haven't changed the market for them has and so have regulations, user preferences, and market values. Airworthiness Directives are issued, fixes are designed, and new STC's are available for discretionary mods which alter the things you want to check for in some cases if you want to buy one.Since they were made in quantity and all parts are available from PMA vendors, prospective buyers need to check with experienced mechanics and owners first before even considering buying one. However, for do-it-yourself oriented people, they are often a better choice of airplane than the Cherokees that followed them."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics)","review":"How can you pack an entire introductory course in linear algebra into under 200 pages AND make it enjoyable to read? Janich knows how. There is virtually zero fluff here. This is both good and bad, however. Janich teaches you what you need to know, and doesn't waste time explaining the same thing 10 different ways. The down side is that if you don't get a concept straight away, you'll feel lost.There is a distinct lack of examples and exercises, and the exercises that are given have no solutions provided. This means that it is very hard to rectify any misunderstandings you may pick up.This book makes for an excellent companion text, and serves admirably for review purposes. But if you need to learn how to apply the abstract concepts, you will want a second text that contains plenty of examples and exercises. As a lecturer once told me: Mathematics is not a spectator sport. You have to do it, not just read about it."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics)","review":"This book presents in a very simple and lucid way the terminology and concepts of linear algebra as they would be used by any mathematician, but presents it in such a way that it is extremely accessable to the undergraduate first course in linear algebra. I used this along with the &quot;required&quot; text for my linear algebra course and found this far superior. It doesn't waste any time on useless details i.e. solving systems of equations, &quot;finding&quot; the inverse, determinant or any form of rote calculations or the ridiculous identity &quot;proofs&quot;etc... which about 50% of every other undergrad linear algebra texts I've seen or used do (he does touch on GE a little). If you're planning of studying math seriously, or are interested in math then this book is definitely a keeper. Another thing I liked about this book is that it doesn't act like a textbook, one can easily sit down and just &quot;read&quot; it, owing again to Janich's unique style."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics)","review":"This book covers most of what you need but it is poorly written and a real struggle to learn from. It is more suited to someone who already knows it all and has a \\"Oh I've forgotten about this or that property of vector fields. I'll just look it up.

If you're an undergraduate and want to learn linear algebra try \\"linear algebra\\" by Anton."},{"Title":"Linear Algebra (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics)","review":"The book sets out to be an introduction to linear algebra, starting out on the premise of sets and maps and going up in complexity to vectors spaces, matrices, systems of equations, and eigenvalues. For an introductory text though, I think the book does not cater to a wide enough audience in that it dwells too much on the pure maths aspects and does not give enough numerical explanations or \\"real world\\" examples. If you are a not a pure mathematician but would like to learn more about linear algebra because of its potential applications, then this would not be the right book for you.

The also form many of the highest mountains we know-Olympus Mons on Mars, Mauna Kea, Popocatepetl, Kilimanjaro and many others on Earth. In spite of this, the average person has only an imprecise idea of what volcanos are and how they work. Duffield's fine book comes to the rescue.The book addresses specifically volcanoes to be found in northern Arizona, so includes many pages of road logs intended for the resident or visitor to the area, pleasant excursions whose purpose is to illustrate a wealth of volcanic features. The rest of the book, however, is invaluable to anyone interested in learning more about volcanoes anywhere. Even though Duffield is a professional volcanologist of considerable repute, he uses clear language pleasantly free of technical jargon and aimed at the non-specialist. The many illustrations are lucid and well done, and the wonderful photographs by Michael Collier are a splendid asset.The person interested in learning about volcanoes won't go wrong with this fine book."},{"Title":"Volcanoes of Northern Arizona: Sleeping Giants of the Grand Canyon Region (Grand Canyon Association)","review":"This book covers it all.

Her first novel was published in 1934, her last in 2005. Her unusual, detailed world-building skills will be sorely missed. In \\"Perilous Dreams\\" she builds worlds within worlds, spinning through dreams that might or might not represent real events.All four stories take place in a future where humanity had long ago reached the stars and scattered itself across thousands of planets. In the city of Ty-Kry, slender sky towers pierce the clouds, the homes of the very rich. In the same city is the Hive of dreamers, whose occupants have the talent of sharing dreams with their clients.The first story, \\"Toys of Tamisan\\" also appears in Norton's \\"High Sorcery\\" (1970). The heroine, Tamisan is a 'true action dreamer to the tenth power' and she can share her dreams (for a certain fee) with others. Lord Starrex is a former space voyager who now lies crippled in the midst of luxury. He can afford the very best Tamisan has to offer and she wants to create a unique fantasy world for him because she senses that he has been everywhere, seen everything, and will not be satisfied with her usual fare. She hits upon the idea of creating an alternate history of their world, where certain key events can be altered by Tamisan to yield a different present.Unfortunately, once Tamisan and Lord Starrex are plunged into her dream of an alternate history, Tamisan discovers she has lost her ability to manipulate events in her fantasy world.Furthermore, she seems to have misplaced her client.Magic is alive and well in Tamisan's alternate history, and she, herself is one of its practitioners!The adventures of Tamisan and Lord Starrex are continued in the second story, \\"Ship of Mist.\\" The two find themselves at yet another turning point in the history of their planet. Lord Starrex inhabits the body of the Lord of a Sea Hold. Tamisan is his wife and also a Tide-Singer--in other words a sorceress, although she only uses her talent to stay in telepathic contact with her husband, while he sails off to investigate a haunted ship. Sailors that stay aboard the haunted ship in order to salvage her inevitably disappear without a trace. When Tamisan loses contact with her husband, she calls upon the sea and two dolphin-like creatures to help her find him.The third story, \\"Get Out of My Dream\\" takes place in the Hive of Dreamers, but with a new character, a no-nonsense Per-Search agent (private detective) named Itlothis Sb Nath. She has been sent to wake a powerful clan chief out of his dream and get him on a starship bound for Benold, where all hell is going to break loose if he doesn't return. The only way Itlothis is allowed to do this is to actually enter Oslan Sb Atto's dream and persuade him to wake up to the 'real' world.As you might guess from the title of this story, Itlothis Sb Nath has her work cut out for her.\\"Nightmare\\" is the fourth and final story, and involves special government agents who infiltrate the Hive of Dreamers to discover why so many clients never wake from their dreams. Burr Neklass is the bait, disguised as a wealthy rou&eacute;, who wants to sample the delights of the Hive. Esper, Ludia Tanguly has penetrated the Hive, disguised as an action dreamer. She and Burr soon enter a dream, controlled not by Ludia, but by someone who wants to destroy them!"},{"Title":"Perilous Dreams","review":"Each of the 4 stories in this volume are set against a common background: the city of Ty-Kry, in a world whose culture and economy are bound up in dreams - Ty-Kry's primary tourist attraction for those who travel between the stars. The Hive produces professional dreamers - women who create fantasy worlds so powerful and detailed that they can be shared with a client, hooked up to the proper machinery. Dreamers may be A dreamers (who produce action/adventure dreams) or E dreamers (who produce erotic dreams). Since dreamers care for nothing except dreams and the research needed to develop them, the Hive is always run by a non-dreamer, the Foostmam, who handles the financial side of the dream business.The setting of Ty-Kry and its dream-based economy is not drawn out in detail; these stories are all centered around the dreamworlds woven by the dreamers. In three of the four stories, dreams are found to be a key to crosstime (a.k.a. paratime) travel, providing acces!s to alternate histories. In the Tamisan stories, Tamisan and her client are trapped in a dream, but in 'Get Out of My Dream', the client is deliberately attempting to change history, to prevent a disaster that cannot be stopped in the present.The only quibble I have with these stories of the dreams of Ty-Kry is that I'd like more :). We don't see much of the Sea-Kings' culture, for instance; on the other hand, the protagonists have their hands full just trying to survive their dreams! (Notice, incidentally, that this book was written long before virtual reality or immersive video games came on the scene; here the creators of fantasyworlds connect directly to their clients' minds.)If you enjoy these, you should try \\"Long Live Lord Kor!\\" in _The Book of Andre Norton_, where an organization sends agents' minds back in time on many worlds to prevent atomic wars and other disasters. Or if crosstime travel appeals to you outside this context, try Norton's _Crossroads of Time_ and _Quest Crosstime_, or H. Beam Piper's _Paratime_. If you'd like elaborate dream-like scenarios without time travel, try Larry Niven and Steven Barnes' _Dream Park_ for a different spin.\\"Toys of Tamisan\\" - Tamisan, daughter of a space-traveller and a woman of Ty-Kry, is unique among dreamers - a dreamer who is fully aware of the waking world, and aware that she is virtually a slave, who must conceal her differences if she is ever to have a chance to be free. After being sold to Lord Starrex, whose adventurous life has been curtailed by a crippling injury, Tamisan begins to experiment with creating dream scenarios in which history took a different path, and finds unexpected results.\\"Ship of Mist\\" - A continuation of \\"Toys of Tamisan.\\" Tamisan and Starrex have exchanged one dreamworld for another - this time to become Tam-Sin and Kilwar, in a timeline where the seafolk on Ty-Kry's world were not wiped out.\\"Get Out of My Dream\\" - Itlothis, a PerSearch agent, has come to the Hive to recall Oslan to his homeworld upon the unexpected death of his Clan Chief, only to find that she must follow him into a dream.\\"Nightmare\\" - Five wealthy offworld men have died mysteriously while dreaming in the Hive, but no traces of foul play could be found. Now one Organization agent has been infiltrated into the Hive as an A dreamer, while another has been given a false identity to tempt the Hive into attempting to make him the 6th victim."},{"Title":"Perilous Dreams","review":"I ran into the first story in this interconnected series, Toys of Tamisan, in a 1969 issue of IF magazine. It was one of Norton's few short stories, therefore, to be highly prized. Later it appeared in a DAW collection called the Many Worlds of Andre Norton (1974). Here (1976) it appears with a sequel that ties up the loose ends left at the end of Toys.The remaining stories appear here for the first time and are all worth reading. This isn't the best Norton has done, but even mediocre Norton is very good indeed."},{"Title":"Perilous Dreams","review":"The first Andre Norton book that I read many years ago, and re-reading it again with this new purchase, has made me realise that she was a pioneer in her field. An excellent book. My personal favourite is the first two stories. The same characters are used, but in two different worlds, one for each story. The imagination displayed in the creation of the settings for the storyline, the development of the characters, and the evolution of the tale is excellent. Norton is able to draw the reader into the stories, to the extent that you are angry when it ends.

Many recipes include a \\"tip\\" section, that either allows you to substitute ingredients in the recipe and customize the flavors to your tastes, or gives you advice to make the recipe a no-brainer. I also love the stories that accompany the recipes. I can't commend Lemlin enough for her thoughtful cookbook! (The only negative comments I have are that there are no pictures in this book and some of the recipes are higher in fat than I'd like to consume.) I can't wait for her next cookbook!"},{"Title":"Vegetarian Classics : 300 Essential Recipes for Every Course and Every Meal","review":"I became a vegitarian five years ago, and since that time have been searching for an adaquate cook book to vary my diet more than cold cereal and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Until coming across Lemin's book I had thought my search was in vain. The other books I looked at were full of ingredients I had never heard of, and could hardly pronounce, but Lemin has written recipes that are satisfying and practical. The items I have made from this book have even been a hit with my non-vegitarian family. All in all I would say this is the best cookbook ever written."},{"Title":"Vegetarian Classics : 300 Essential Recipes for Every Course and Every Meal","review":"I am the author of VEGETARIAN CLASSICS and want to share my thoughts with you. Innovative cooking with lots of fresh vegetables and chic ingredients can be exciting and satisfying. But do you also crave old-time classics that have withstood the test of time and continue to give great pleasure and comfort? I do. A steaming bowl of garlicky lentil soup, a vegetable-filled lasagne, a perfectly balanced vegetable curry, and baked macaroni and smoked cheese with a crispy bread crumb crust are just a few examples of dishes I always want as part of my repertoire, no matter what the current food trend. These tried and true classics, along with some delightful variations on these favorite dishes, make up this essential book. I provide &quot;tips&quot; after each recipe to ensure you'll have success with each dish, and there is a comprehensice Glossary of Ingredients to answer any of your shopping questions. VEGETARIAN CLASSICS is the ideal cookbook for the novice who is learning about the world of meatless cooking, as well as the sophisticated cook who expects full-flavored, fresh food made with the best ingredients. Whether you're a vegetarian, semi-vegetarian, or dedicated meat eater who likes to eat meatless meals a few times a week, this book will provide you with the best of vegetarian cooking, the beloved classics. In essence, this is a book about real food for real people."},{"Title":"Vegetarian Classics : 300 Essential Recipes for Every Course and Every Meal","review":"I am an avid fan of Jeanne Lemlin's and own all of her cookbooks. I learned to cook from her first book which is falling apart from so much use. Her latest book, Vegetarian Classics, is one you should own regardless of whether or not you are a vegetarian. It is just wicked good food. I made the Thai noodle salad and it was as good as any from my Oriental cookbooks, with no hard-to-find ingredients. Jeanne makes certain her clear and easy recipes work, letting her family and friends be her judges. Hurry and order this book so you won't eat another meal of bland, boring food."},{"Title":"Vegetarian Classics : 300 Essential Recipes for Every Course and Every Meal","review":"If you don't own all five of Jeanne Lemlin's cookbooks like I do, this is a magnificent place to start. Here, Lemlin offers an incredible array of vegetarian dishes that will please everyone from the died-in-the-wool vegan to the meat lover. The secret behind this wonderful collection of recipes is, like it's predecessors, Lemlin's staunch commitment to GREAT TASTING vegetarian cooking. And &quot;Vegetarian Classics&quot; goes even a step beyond her previous offerings by giving us everything we need in one comprehensive book. From her mouth-watering renditions of the classics to out-of-this-world soups, salads, pastas and much more...this book is, simply put, an instant classic. It is the best and most versatile cookbook I have ever owned."},{"Title":"Vegetarian Classics : 300 Essential Recipes for Every Course and Every Meal","review":"I was looking for a vegetarian cookbook that would help me to incorporate some meatless meals into my diet, and I bought this new offering by Lemlin. Not only have I found countless recipes to jazz up my stalled repertoire of menus, but they are all relatively easy and most importantly taste great. I love the chapter on &quot;the basics&quot; which includes recipes for pesto and salsa (two of my summer favorites), and marvel at the soup chapter which is amazingly inventive and extensive. Actually, one of the best features of this book is that it has 300+ recipes, but is very user friendly. You can find almost anything you are looking for in this book. It's also perfect as a gift for just about anyone (fathers, newlyweds, new homeowners etc.) Vegetarian Classics is a book I am sure I will use for years to come. I give it a 5 Star rating!"},{"Title":"Vegetarian Classics : 300 Essential Recipes for Every Course and Every Meal","review":"I have all of her cookbooks. I like them because they taste good and are simple. These are taste that grown-ups enjoy. As well as children. With all of her cookbooks I think she has made and worked on all of the receipes. Some cookbooks I know they couldn't made the receipes just from the taste. This book is the one I gave for Holiday Gifts and Weddings. The soups are wonderful in this book. I have made them all and everyone loves them. If I had to grab one cookbook and the house was on fire this is it."},{"Title":"Vegetarian Classics : 300 Essential Recipes for Every Course and Every Meal","review":"I cannot say enough good things about this cookbook. I think it would be safe to say that I have close to 30 vegetarian cookbooks, and this is the only one I've been satisfied with. I've made close to 20 recipes out of this cookbook so far, and EVERY single one has been a hit---not only with me but with my non-vegetarian husband. It is SO hard to find a vegetarian cookbook that actually has tasty recipes made from ingredients that are easily accessible, and this book offers just that.The best thing about this book is that I am now willing to make recipes out of it that wouldn't otherwise sound appealing to me, since I have no doubt that they will be delicious nonetheless. I would not hesitate to try a new recipe from this cookbook while serving guests, either, which I can't say about any of my other books.My only complaint, if I had to make one, would be that there aren't any recipes that use seitan, which is one of my favorite vegetarian staples. I don't know if any of Lemlin's other cookbooks (which I now plan to purchase) make up for that, but it's only a minor complaint, since all the recipes are so good anyway.In sum, if you are a vegetarian, or even if you aren't, buy this cookbook NOW! I'm so glad that I happened upon it---it has really energized my cooking."},{"Title":"Vegetarian Classics : 300 Essential Recipes for Every Course and Every Meal","review":"'Vegetarian Classics' was my first cookbook by Jeanne Lemlin, author of 'Quick Vegetarian Pleasures.' This is one of the best vegetarian cookbooks I've bought. I use 'Vegetarian Classics' along side my 'Better Homes &amp; Gardens Cookbook.' There's 300 great recipes for every course and meal. I find this differs from other cookbooks which has interesting introduction and history of vegeterian origins. Did you know that St. Franics of Assisi, Leonardo da Vinci, Percy B. Shelley and George Bernard Shaw were all vegetarians? There's an alphabetical list of food ingredients used in the recipes from barley to wheat berries. It explains what each food is and it's use.The book is easy to follow as every food is put in it's own category starting with the basics and appetizers to everything from soups, salads, breads, side dishes, all types of pies, pastas, stovetop cooking and desserts. In the back there is a handy menu layout to give you ideas for casual, elegant, summer and holiday meals. In each section Lemlin has side notes and colored blocks of additional information and tips like for perfect brown rice, about olives with an excellent recipe for marinated olives, frittatas, cooking beans, choosing &amp; preparing potatoes, successful puff pastry tarts, cookies and polenta are just a few of the items you'll find in the book. Most of the recipes are simple and easy to follow instructions. I love the guide to light breads, flaky scones and tender muffins. The masala chai is heavenly and the mixed berry smoothie yummy. Even if you're a semi-vegetarian or not, and just looking for new ways to cook your veggies this book is excellent!"},{"Title":"Vegetarian Classics : 300 Essential Recipes for Every Course and Every Meal","review":"My husband and I fell in love over Lemlin's book when we were dating and continue to use her book each week. What we both found great is that the recipes are very well explained as well as relatively simple and yet delicious. The book is indeed a great solution for everyday solid good food. It includes food that you can cook after a long day of work. Also, we so routinely get compliments on dishes we have made and asked about some of our favorite Lemlin recipes that we started buying extra copies of the her book Vegetarian Classics for friends for Christmas. Now people bring her food back to us (i.e. cranberry muffins to brunch). Lemlin is somehow contagious in a good way! She makes you feel at home with cooking as everything is really well explained even for a beginning cook, yet you never get tired of it because the food is healthy and makes you feel good in addition to its great flavor. Some of my favorite recipes include: Pea soup, sweet potato tian, tofu hoisin dish, classic lasagna, mushroom barley soup, mediterranean sandwiches, raspberry white chocolate cheesecake, and many more! I only wish I could find more books like this one! I decided to write a review today because I am ordering my second copy (a hardcopy this time)."},{"Title":"Vegetarian Classics : 300 Essential Recipes for Every Course and Every Meal","review":"This is hands-down the best back-to-basics vegetarian cookbook I have owned. I have many cookbooks, but I always come back to this one for its easy and delicious recipes! The author also gives excellent sidebar tips to help save time and money."},{"Title":"Vegetarian Classics : 300 Essential Recipes for Every Course and Every Meal","review":"I received this cookbook as a gift a couple of years ago and it turned out to be one of the best gifts I have ever received. This cookbook is amazing. Mine is so worn from using it constantly! Every single recipe is amazing with so much flavor. You won't even notice there is no meat. I love this book so much that I have bought it as a gift multiple times."},{"Title":"Standard Lesson Commentary (Standard Lesson Commentary: NIV)","review":"Good price and speedy delivery on the Standard KJV International Sunday School Lessons Commentary 2006-2007.

Do yourself and your golf game a favor and buy this book."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"McTeigue's brilliance is clearly revealed in this book. He has the great ability to help the struggling, mediocre golfer with clear, easy to understand, easy to perform instructions about a typically complicated subject--the effective golf swing. Buy it, read it, you'll see!"},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"If you are a beginner or intermediate golfer (or a frustrated one) save yourself a lot of money and time. Read this book!! I have spent a fortune in golf lessons, videos and gadgets to try to achieve a repeatable golf swing with very disappointing result. Then I read \\"The Keys to the EFFORTLESS GOLF SWING.\\" The simple keys posed by Mr. McTeigue will have you hitting longer and straighter in no time. I took me two hours at the driving range to see dramatic results. But the best thing you'll get from the book is a clear understanding of the golf swing. Forget the pro, you'll know what you \`re doing wrong."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"Don't fall into the trap of thinking that the best golf instruction books are necessarily written by touring pros. As is the case with many things in life, teaching something like the golf swing often takes a unique set of skills. And the great thing about McTeigue's book is that he knows how to take what most of us perceive as a &quot;complicated&quot; swing and reduce it to a few basic steps. By following these (and not having to try to remember a dozen little things during the swing), it's easy to commit the golf swing to &quot;muscle memory&quot; and start having fun. And after all, isn't that the reason we're playing this game?"},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"\\"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing\\" is a MUST READ for anyone who is interested in golf. This well-written, short, easy-to-read book provides a step-by-step guide to the golf swing beyond the necessary but insufficient description of mechanics. The \\"seven lessons\\" are an understandable, concise road map to developing the pleasure and joy of golf--competently and effortlessly creating a golf swing with results. Each lesson builds on the last and illuminates a fundamental aspect of the golf swing--balance, momentum, maintaining a steady swing center, relaxed arms, rhythm, etc.--aspects of the golf swing that are missed in the reductionistic approach of many \\"how to\\" golf books. This book is about learning the feel of a proficient golf swing. For the basic mechanics of golf, read Ben Hogan's \\"Five Lessons.\\" For the next level, McTeigue's book, if you are interested in improving your game, your golf scores, and perhaps even more importantly, your experience of golf, this book will not disappoint."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"For 13 years, I struggled with every \\"swing thought\\" imaginable. Finally I had this book recommended to me as a very simple way to train your swing. More importantly, it was one you could practice without having to hit balls initially. Its critical points have helped ease tension and facilitates a smooth weight shift and now I am swinging through the ball rather than hitting at the ball. Golf is more enjoyable and I only wish I had this book 12 years ago."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"I started playing golf at the age of 40. I played football, basketball and lacrosse in college but nothing prepared me for the frustration of this game. I have some lingering back and knee problems so over the last 20 years I tried it all. Lessons at the club, lessons at the Ledbetter Academy, stack and tilt, natural golf for five years, and all the famous books were part of my efforts. I got to an 11 handicap, but that was due primarily to short game. I was never much of a ball striker with 210-220 yard drives and an 130 yard seven iron.Well, my youngest finally took up the game last year at Navy flight school and decided to go self-taught. At Christmas he came home after playing for 5 months and he was hitting well shaped 160 yard seven irons (he only weighs 147) and 260 yard drives and shot an 84! That is real-- no mulligans or rolling his ball or picking up putts etc.I asked how he got good so fast. He told me of this book and bought me a copy for my 59th on January 21st. It was an epiphany! Arms and grip relaxed, do the light-house turn in the mirror. Your legs must touch (or be very close) on your follow through etc. and most of all avoid the impulse to hit the ball! Just swing the club. Bottom line... in 6 weeks i have added 30 yards to my drives and I hit 18% more greens in reg. My index is a 5.4 and I have not shot over 79 in five rounds. Heck I'm a JD/MBA from Harvard about to get a PHD in psychology and this is the best and clearest instructional book I have ever read. All my friends are buying it and are even teaching their wives to play (nothing is totally good).Buy it, read it and do it. If you don't you are going to waste a lot of time, money and thrown clubs. Thanks, McTeigue the book is about 15 bucks but hitting 250 yard drives at my age and shooting par---Priceless."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"I purchased this book shortly after publication and it quickly became a personal favorite. It provides the simplest, clearest method to learn the full golf swing that I've ever read. Mike's exercises are simple enough for an absolute beginner (as demonstrated in the VHS companion video; more about that below) and useful to an experienced golfer. Mike's approach to learning the fundamentals of the golf swing is the least technical, least mechanical that I know of and his drills serve as an excellent review of those fundamentals when my swing starts to fall apart. I only wish that I had turned to this book more quickly and more often during the many times that I've struggled with my game. I've recently started using Mike's keys as swing thoughts while playing golf (\\"relaxed arms and shoulders\\", \\"lighthouse turn\\", etc.) and they have helped banish some of the negative, tension inducing thoughts that tend to creep into my game. I've also found Mike's swing keys helpful in my short game, especially the relaxed arms and shoulders.I mentioned Mike's companion VHS video which is no longer available for sale. I sincerely hope that he will bring this video back to market as a DVD or as a digital download. It is the simplest video of golf instruction that I've ever seen and is more than a simple retelling of the contents of the book on which it is based. In the video, we get to witness him teaching the full swing to a young woman who has clearly not previously swung a club. Her progress is rapid, persuasive and, frankly, inspirational (\\"If she can learn to swing like that ...\\"). Watching Mike demonstrate his key movements and watching his student learn them complement the clear explanations in the book very well. If this video is ever again for sale, it will automatically receive my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"I've been trying to learn to play golf for some years now and found some very good help in various places. Swinging too hard and just trying to hit the ball have been my constant downfall. Tis book is finally helping me to understand and execute a smoother more fluid golf swing. FHurray.Not only that: this book has helped me understand a number of concepts that I have been constantly encouraged to do and never understood.I wish that I had found it years ago.Gary"},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"Like others, I've purchased other instructional books, silly gadgets, and lessons from the local golf pro. I've also read the magazines, and searched the internet for that one magic tip that will make my golf shots longer, straighter, and more consistent.Nothing really worked until I read Effortless Golf by Mike McTeigue. I now fully understand the golf swing, and why the fundamentals are some important. My golf shots are now looking and feeling much, much, better.I found this book so effective because it simply explains what to do and what not to do during the golf swing. Furthermore, the book offers numerous drills that will help you learn the fundamentals neccessary for a solid, repeatable golf swing.Overall, the book is an easy enjoyable read that will definitely improve your game."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"I have been golfing for 50 years. On a very good day I can break 80. I am a 100% arms hitter. I have had numerous lessons, some from well known teachers. None of them taught the passive arms approach which to me makes swinging the golf club a lot easier.Most of the golf instruction I have read or seen describes the golf swing in a large number of complex coordindinated movements of hands, arms and body. Mike McTeigue does a great job of describing the passive arms method which instantly had me hitting the ball with better timing and less effort than my active arms approach. It seems counter intuitive that passive arms could work so well. The advantages of this method is you will learn a correct and well coordinated golf swing by mastering just a couple of movements.I purchased the digital downloads of the book and the video. I strongly recommend the video, which although made in 1986, does a great job of describing in detail how to master the passive arms swing. I now realize I spent 50 years trying to master the wrong way to hit a golf ball."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"I love this book.Some background: I took up golf a year ago. I'm a self-taught golfer, 0 lessons, and I learned my swing from a few books. For full disclosure, the ones I referred to most often wereGolf My Way: The Instructional Classic, Revised and Updated,Practical Golf, and this one.Well, all credit to where credit is due for Mr. Nicklaus, and I think Practical Golf is a very good book as well. They're both classics in the golf instruction world, along withBen Hogan's Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf. But I found out that this is what I needed, and is the only book I refer to now for the full swing.I shot an 80 from the back tees two months ago, a feat I directly attribute to the long game improvement I gained from this book. I'm a 14 handicap and dropping. I gave it to my dad for Christmas; he's been golfing for 20 years, and he hits the ball farther than he ever has at almost 60 years old. Now he's consistently shooting in the 70s for the first time in his life.This book is not about gimmicks, and it's not a \\"new\\" swing (such as Stack and Tilt). Rather, it provides a clear and excellent explanatory model to help you develop the feeling of a professional caliber conventional swing, and get the sort of easy rhythm you see from guys like Fred Couples. Using the lighthouse turn drill, which is literally the ONLY drill I use for swing practice, you develop the easy, flowing, coordinated turn required to hit crisp golf shots.Learning the swing this way helps you get rid of all of those obnoxious (frequently negative) swing thoughts about your knees, your head, your elbows, your hips, etc., and just focuses you on turning freely. You don't think about your knee flex and your elbow angle when you shoot a free throw; you just trust your shot to take the ball to the target. This book will help you play golf that way. Good luck, and swing easy."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"Easy to read and very practical advice. After reading the first three chapters, I played and my driving was immediately improved. Straighter and more controlled flights. Good stuff!"},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"I have read tons of golf books and this one is the most simple yet effective one I've read. I'm hitting the ball much further with much less effort and my body loves it too. If you're an arm swinger this method will take some getting used too since the arms are almost totally passive in this method, but if you trust it you will be rewarded big time."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"I've read a number of golf instruction books and this is by far the most effective! The prose is clear and concise and the illustrations very helpful.I found the concepts easy to understand and put into practice. I'm no longer bothered by a checklist of things to think about and I'm much more relaxed over the ball now. I'm swinging easier yet getting more distance on my shots.My accuracy is much improved, too! I recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"This book is outstanding. It gets down to the real feel and the actual motions that you must perform to be successful. The part about the lighthouse turn and the shifting of weight is priceless. I've been trying to shift weight and rotate my hips for years with pretty awful shots alot of the time but M. Mcteigue actual tells you the real movements you must perform and what you must feel. It's all about the knees and how you move them. You will seriously be amazed at how you compress the ball once you get the hang of it. The main thing is just keep working on it and eventually you will figure it out. What actually happens in the golf swing is much different than what i thought it was for a long time."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"As a beginning player, I've struggled with getting a good swing. This book really helped break down the swing into ways I could easily understand and with it I was able to understand what I was doing wrong. My swing has really improved in just one week, thanks to this author. Truly an excellent book worth every penny!"},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"The overwhelming positive reviews prompted me to purchase this, and I have to say that I agree with them. It was a fabulous book to learn and get a feel for the basic swing motion. The book is written in an easy-to-read format and his visualization examples really helped.After this, I have bought other instruction materials, and I've used those to further tweak my swing, which is still a work in progress. But if there's one book I would start with for those beginning golf or those frustrated with their swing, I think this would be a fine choice."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"This is a wonderful little book - chock full of the type of simple and well explained lessons that can benefit all golfers.

I don't know how many times I'd read about how a good swing should &quot;feel,&quot; but only McTeigue's brilliant clarity actually showed me how to achieve it. Without saying much I had not heard before, McTeigue puts it together in a way that enabled me to equal my personal best score the first time out after reading it, and I look forward to further improvement. If you struggle to break 90, this book could have you realistically setting your sights on breaking 80. I wish I had read this book years ago."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"I read this book and followed the instructions as suggested e.g. \\"now put this book down and practice the arc swing\\" etc. I then practiced the swing for over a week at regular intervals. Then began trying the effortless swing to start playing again. I've never been a good player, but now I can't play at all. I've now had to go and pay for lessons to \\"unlearn\\" what this book has said. It all sounds good in the book, but if you're not a good player.... it may not help at all, and it can really stuff your game right up! I'll never buy another book like this one!"},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"It seems to rehash previous stuff- MEN hit LADIES swing.

This book will also help you develop the perfect golf swing."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"I have bought both the book and video. Based on the other reviews I was expecting this book was going to be the best golf swing resource ever. I really felt this book would be different based on the other reviews and could not wait until the video was available. I assumed I needed that as well because I didn't comprehend something correctly from the book alone. Well, I was disappointing to to say the least. After spending over a month practicing the lighthouse drill, I kinda believe the author is writing reviews of his own book and video to sell copies. I think the basic concept of using the hips and thighs with relaxed arms is the way to go for most golfers. This book is not going to take you to the next level, at least it did not for me. After reading this book and video, practicing it for over a month I did not see improvement and did not really understand the concept. I have purchased many other videos and books over the years. You name it source, Purepoint, Leadbetter, Harmon, Haney and many others. The best video or resource that has had an impact on my game is one of the Purepoint instructors, Doug Weaver. Doug's full swing video covers the concept of this book, however, I was able to understand the actual method of using the large muscles to swing the club and staying relaxed as you swing. I like the approach and was able to use his teaching to get to the swing that has really started to help me consistently hit fairways and greens 60 to 80% of the time. As for the Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing. If you are like me, you will buy it and be disappointed in the hype. Two stars because I agree with the concept, however, the book and video did not help me incorporate the method into my swing for improved results."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"I was a little disappointed in the quality of this book. Paperback, looks like cheap paper, very basic illustrations.

The Hogan &quot;Five Lessons&quot; book, a classic on the subject, sells for less than ten dollars. This sells for more than twenty dollars. It is about ninety pages long with large print and few words per page. Drawings are minimally helpful. The author of this book tells you right up front that much of the content was derived from other sources (including books by Jack Nicklaus, Al Geiberger, and Jimmy Ballard). This is another way to say that there is nothing even remotely original here. Bottom line is that this is the most simplistic of books and the content can easily be acquired elsewhere. I'll tell you what. Here is what you will &quot;learn&quot; from this book. Power comes from your legs, don't pull from the top with your arms but rather push the right knee towards the ball, and focus on tempo. Oh, and don't sway (the Nicklaus model of keeping the head still). There, I just saved you twenty-plus dollars. Now, go buy Hogan or a good Hank Haney or David Leadbetter book. Or you could buy books by Nicklaus, Geiberger and Ballard and you will then have the same material in greater detail than this author regurgitated here."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"after careful reading of the tactics set forth in the book, i believe the ideas are good only if followed but can become confusing since more words are used than necessary in my opinion. overall i do recommend this book with the above observation."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"My review title is strong, but I believe it 100%. I have read many of the great golf books written by famous players and teachers. This simple book cuts to the heart of the matter and gives you a few keys to make solid contact effortlessly. What is most amazing is that the book shows you to learn a powerful and repeatable swing quickly, without cluttering your mind with the 1000's of swing issues that you may face ie cupped vs. flat wrist, hitting a draw vs. a fade, etc.. After one read of this book (in less than a few hours), I was drilling balls at the range with no effort. Now I understand how pros like Ernie Els and Fred Couples make it look so effortless, yet generate so much power.

The book is so short, it's hard to believe it smokes other much larger, golf instruction books. It's hard to believe that all too rarely do we hear about this &quot;connection&quot; of the arms to the body and how essential it is to the reproduction of distance and accuracy.

The information is very well explained and the author clearly worked hard to make it understandable for any golfer. I found the analogy of the lighthouse turn to help to stay centered over the ball and also the takaway-from the shoulders in an up and down motion-exceptional. I thank the author for his philopophy-I have taken many lessons-and finally I understand that turning my shoulder around myself will never be a consistent way to play this game.

It changed my game in a very short period of time. It made my swing into a simple and natural movement and eliminated the need to pay attention to a lot of junk I had learned that turned out to be irrelevant to a good shot outcome. If I had to throw out all golf books I have accumulated over the years, save one, McTeigue's book would be the one I kept. I reread it from time to time to remind me of the basics.

I don't know how many times I'd read about how a good swing should &quot;feel,&quot; but only McTeigue's brilliant clarity actually showed me how to achieve it. Without saying much I had not heard before, McTeigue puts it together in a way that enabled me to equal my personal best score the first time out after reading it, and I look forward to further improvement. If you struggle to break 90, this book could have you realistically setting your sights on breaking 80.

As a beginner this book helped me immensely! Don't expect to just read through it and improve though. I would suggest holding off on the driving range while you dedicate yourself to doing the exercises he suggests over & over again until you know exactly what you should be \\"feeling\\" during the exercises (weight transfer, are your elbows where they are supposed to be etc....) This book suggests that you should not be trying to hit the ball but rather teaching your body to swing the club the exact same way every time which obviously builds consistency (something we could all use more of) It is a very quick read but don't read it too fast. Let the concepts sink in by reading important points several times."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"I have read a lot of books on the golf swing.

I've taken several lessons over the years and they never did me much good. But this video has done more for my golf game than anything I've ever tried. Once a week for about a month, I'd fire the video up with a club in my living room. Then I'd head to the practice range afterwards if possible. I used to shoot about 120, but have been able to cut that score down drastically and I'm still progressing and have no doubt that I'll eventually be able to get that score under 90. The video really teaches you the body motion of a good swing. I have not read the book, but am considering buying it if it is as good as the video. Mike's teaching style is very intuitive and easy to follow and the fundamentals that he teaches are incredibly solid.Great video, I still watch it from time to time when my swing needs a tune-up."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"I started golfing about 1.5 years ago, but with 2 kids in college I preferred spending discretionary money on playing golf vs taking lessons. So I endeavored to learn the game on my own via you tube, DVD's and reading books, but there were so many different thoughts I would get confused at times. This book was exactly what I needed. A step by step method that allowed me to get rid of my \\"hit impulse\\" and develop a pretty good swing thats very respectable and mostly repeatable. Thanks to his book, my iron game, including my long irons, is ROCK SOLID. My driver, although vastly improved, is still not as consistent and long as I know it can/will be but I'm told its pretty decent for how long I've been playing. Michael's book taught me the fundamentals of the swing in a very easy to understand step by step method. The key is to master each step before moving to the next. When I would fall into old habits and my swing was off, I simply re-read the book or sections of it, and voila !! I regained a good effortless swing. The only thing lacking in this book is a good chapter on the the most important fundamental... a good golf grip. He references Ben Hogans \\"Five Lessons\\" as a good book that covers the grip and that was actually the first book I read, and I agree, it has a great chapter on the grip. I've kept Hogan's grip, but I've not adopted all of Ben's lessons as some didnt work for me. But everything in this book did. Other references that have helped me are Tom Watson's \\"Lessons of a liftime\\" DVD series, Phil Mckelson's \\"Secret of the short game\\" DVD series, and Dave Pelz's short game Bible. For me, this book is by far the best resource for developing a good golf swing. I've gone from shooting in the high 120's to consitently shooting in the low 90s (good round) to the low 100s (bad round). Thanks to this book my weakness is not my long game. Now i'm focusing more on my short game, which should get me into the 80s fairly soon I hope. I've since learned that perhaps the best way to learn golf is from the green out... putting, chipping, pitching, full swing. I wish I had known that earlier. Even so, this book helped me develop a confident swing... satisfying my first goal which was not being a \\"total embarassment\\" when playing on a course. I'm sure all your beginners ou there can relate, and seasoned golfers, if they think back long and hard enough, can relate as well. If I dont get into the 80's soon, I'll bite the bullet and take some lessons, but i'd love to get into the 80s on my own. I never ask for directions either (thank God for GPS's).

From the firt par 4 tee I was hitting them long. Straight was an issue at first because I was so accustomed to adjusting for hooks. Once I figured that out I was hitting them straight.On one par 4 that dog legs right, I have never driven into the dog leg. I always ended up a little short of it. Today I drove through the dog leg.

I've been trying to piece together a decent swing based mostly on reading books, websites, watching online videos, etc. I have not yet taken a lesson. Up until now, Ben Hogan's book was the most helpful. I felt like I was making progress but there was always something missing. Tiger Wood's book talks about taking divots with correct iron shots, for example, which I never seemed to do, even when I hit what I considered to be a decent shot. Was I doing something wrong?I got this book, read it in one night, and the next day at the driving range put it into practice. I was immediately taking correct divots with my irons, appropriately after solid impact. I was hitting about 10-15 yards farther with my irons than I was used to. I was able to hit my hybrid off the turf consistently, something I could not do well before. And the best part, everything just felt \\"right\\". My swing was no longer uncomfortable, I could tell I was swinging it right.It wasn't an instant cure. I need to repeat the motions enough so that they get ingrained in muscle memory (something McTeigue talks about). But that next day at the range I hit quality shots on 80-90% of my swings. That afternoon on the course it all fell apart, but I'm convinced that was all mental. I had reverted to my old swing when I got stressed out.I can't recommend this book more. Best $15 I ever spent.

There are also some flaws in this teaching technique that most YouTube pros will tell you \\"not\\" to do (hip turn on the back swing should be less than 50 degrees, not a full turn).I have learned to swing via YouTube, and refined my swing through GolfTec instruction, and I tell you that there is not a book in the world that will help you more than lessons from a PGA Professional will.

The book is that good! It took me some time to really process the fact that McTeigue is not trying to reinvent the swing or bring anything new or profound to our attention but simply to lay out a simple, yet effective method for achieving what so many other teachers have been trying to convey in all those &#34;other&#34; books of golf instruction. He does a great job. I have diligently practiced the step by step approach he teaches to build a better swing and after about three weeks of practicing the &#34;lighthouse turn&#34; and the &#34;basic arc&#34; I went out and actually hit some balls at the range, first with just the basic arc and then a few using the 3/4 swing. The results were a dramatic improvement in both the ease of the swing and ball striking.Now the only thing I believe I have to do is remained disciplined in my practice and continue to build the muscle memory that he talks about and I will be on my way to the best season of golf in my life.I've been golfing for thirty years and this is by far the best and simplest instruction I've ever received."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"You know, I never thought these how-to-golf books would help.

Then start your swing.&quot; Amazingly, this made a huge difference to Draak's swing. He was giving each person a different tip. I asked where to get more of these tips and he pointed me to the book.

The beauty of McTeigue's \\"Keys to an Effortless Golf Swing\\" is that IT TAUGHT ME TO GET OUT OF MY OWN WAY. By incorporating the \\"Keys\\" I was finally able to \\"play golf\\" instead of \\"play golf swing.\\" The \\"Keys\\" enabled me to free my mind of swing \\"dos and don'ts\\" and execute an effortless golf swing with very little thought. McTeigue's core ideas are not necessarily new but his presentation of them is more simple than I have found in any instruction book or DVD (and I have read/seen them all). That simplicity enabled me to understand them and incorporate them very quickly -- far quicker than I have been able to achieve in 30 years of effort from other sources.

Instead, the real value of this book is the way in which the material is presented and actually teaches you to incorporate it into your swing, all in a concise and easy-to-read package.I have been a student of the game for years and have read a lot of books and articles on the intricacies of the full swing. I have long understood and favored the theory and type of swing that McTeigue teaches, but no matter how hard I tried I could not seem to execute it. And certainly not with any consistency. This book has literally changed everything for me. I no longer think about all those tips and gimmicks and sound bytes, but instead, I focus on my new, much simpler swing. Golf is so much more fun now!I firmly believe that golfers of all abilities will benefit immensely from this book, as I have. And what have you got to lose?

I love the game and have read many, many books on the subject, from Hogan's Modern Fundamentals to the Jim McLean series on the Slot Swing, to Bobby Clampett's Impact Zone, and many others. I definitely put this book in the league of the very fine books that explain the golf swing. The concept of the \\"lighthouse swing\\" is clearly explained and easy to follow. The concept of using centrifugal force and allowing swing speed to build through the follow through is consistent with most fine golf instruction, but presented in a different way that has been easier for me to implement on the course. I like this in particular because I am 65 now and I want to play for another 20 years at least. Using these concepts has allowed me to build distance without stressing the body. Also, I like competitive golf. This swing works better for me when the pressure is on. A part of the teaching relates to keeping the arms reasonably relaxed and not tightening up and to using the larger muscles in tempo, not in a forced way. That really works (when you remember to use it) when you need it. If you buy this book, which I highly recommend, then I suggest you also buy the video that explains the same concepts, but in video format.

A solid companion book to this, one that focuses entirely on the mental aspect of the golf game, is Quantum Golf, also available via Amazon."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"I have been trying to play golf for 25 years, managed to join a club for a couple of years and played every week.I always had one major problem that really took the fun out of the game - I would often top or fluff the ball, even when my game was going relatively well. At the start of this year I hit a 117, I was so embarrassed, it was either give up or make a change, I bought this book.I have had numerous lessons and not one of them spotted that I was starting my downswing with my arms - a fatal flaw.I managed to get down to a 24 handicap before reading this book, but in the last few months I have been amazing my golf friends, hit my first eagle on a par 4, shot 6 pars in one round, scored my first sub-90 total (par 71) and am hitting the ball 10-15 yards longer (shot a 7 iron 160 yards!).Cannot recommend the book highly enough. I bought a practice mat and net because I still play only about once per week, and spent 10-15 minutes each day with the drills in the book for about two months. What a difference. For me golf is a new game and much more fun."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"The very first time I played golf I got a hole-in-one.It's been downhill ever since.I was 15 years old and 35 years later I was still struggling to break 80. I'd hit the ball OK some days, but usually I always put too much pressure on my short game to score. I read all the books, took all the lessons and beat balls on the range until my hands bled. Mechanically everything always looked copasetic, but yet I was never consistent in ball striking. Thin, fat, toe, hook, push, etc.I knew it was important to be in a relaxed and \\"athletic position\\" at address. My inherent problem was with excess tension THROUGHOUT the swing. I mistook power for the \\"coiling of the spring\\", (bad metaphor!). At the top of my backswing my arms, shoulders and torso were tied in one big connected KNOT. Like most men I thought muscle strength was the key to distance and I would try to over power everything without knowing it. Think Vijay Singh, Fred Couples, Ernie Els. Swing easy, hit hard.So I took to the range after reading this book with yet another tip to experiment on like I've been doing on and off almost all my life; low and behold, once I relaxed my arms and shoulders throughout the swing and hit the ball in a much more free flowing fashion, I swear to God I felt like the incarnation of Ben Hogan. Solid, straight shots like never before. Feeling the ball compress against the face of the club each time was sublime. Working it right and left at will.I'm now regularly shooting in the seventies from the pro tees and focusing more on the short game to start beating old man par. I may even start competing in some amateur events next year. The key is ZERO TENSION in all muscles throught the swing. Tension destroys the golf swing. Let the club swing itself. As Sam Snead said, \\"Feel oily\\".The reason a good teaching pro could never help me is because they could not \\"feel\\" what I was feeling at the top of my swing. Thanks Michael McT. You saved a once putrid golfers soul.

I had so many swing keys and &quot;positive&quot; thoughts swimming around my head that I'd lost my passion for the game. I felt like a poster child for the frustrated golfer. Well, that's all changed after reading this book.If you're sick and tired of trying to micro-manage your full swing: right elbow here, left forearm there, head over here, etc., this is a book you must read.In my case, I literally stopped golfing while I read, understood, and practiced the keys outlined in the book. I would highly recommend that approach.This is the first golf book I've read that shows you how to develop a full swing with rhythm and timing. Now I swing the club at 75% of my previous effort level and hit the ball 5~10 yards further per club with more accuracy than I can remember. Moreover, I believe that I can &quot;feel&quot; my swing better than I ever have. Oh, and by the way, my handicap is down 8 strokes from a 22 to 14.Now, just try to wipe the stupid grin off my face as I stand over the ball on a 200 yard Par-3 over water!"},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"This instructional golf book foucuses on developing the fundamentals of the full swing in 7 easy steps.

There is no question in my mind that the better you can play this game the more enjoyable it is. Those players who say it doesn't matter are simply not being honest with themselves. Sure I love being on the course especially with good company, but what is supposed to be a pleasurable hobby can be far from it when you are playing poorly. Lets face it; all of us have been there, and all of us want to improve. Unfortunately golf is not like many things we do in that practice doesn't neccessarily make perfect. If what we are working on (based on information we are given) is even slightly flawed, improvement is not likely to occurr despite our best efforts. Since golf is one area where there's no shortage of instructional material, our success will largely be determined by the effort we put in and information we use. Fortunately the author of this book, Michael McTeigue, has presented in his words \\"everything you need to know.\\" I could not agree with him more. As a dedicated student of the game who wanted to improve, I went from book to book and theory to theory until I came across this little book. The book gave me a systematic method by which I have enjoyed considerable improvement in only a few months. If you're tired of hours of unproductive practice, I highly recommend you work with the ideas in this book."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"After struggling with inconsistency for years -- on any given day I could shoot anywhere from 85 to 100 -- I was amazed to find this little book which exactly addresses my big problem -- The DREADED HIT IMPULSE! After just one read, and two buckets of balls at the practice range, I have a much-improved swing. I completely understand what I need to do to hit it better consistently. I can't believe how much better and more athletic this \\"effortless swing\\" feels. The most bizarre thing is that it feels so easy, and yet my shot are going a lot *farther*. I read a lot of other golf books over the past 12 years, but I wish I had this book when I started this frustrating game. I also wish the author had a book on the short game which was just as clear and consise."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"Michael McTeigue's &quot;The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons&quot; is a marvelous book. I found that Mcteigue did a terrific job in taking the myriad complexities which seem to make the golf swing so difficult to understand, and distilled them to down a small handful of points and concepts which are easy to grasp. The exposition and organization of the ideas is clear and easy to follow. There's an elegant simplicity to having the keys presented be so straightforward -&quot;balance&quot;, &quot;momentum&quot;, &quot;rythm&quot;, etc. In particular, the notion of the &quot;lighthouse turn&quot; has helped my game enormously, and gives me a concept I can turn to (no pun intended . . .) when on the course and starting to encounter difficulties. Everyone who plays golf is striving for a powerful, efficient, repeatable swing. It's an elusive goal (as even Tiger has seen lately). This book will help golfers of all levels in their quest to attain such a swing."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"This book is beautifully constructed, concise, gracefully written, and should be of immense help to most golfers.

It describes how weight shift and body rotation with passive arms and hands leads to a less complicated and more repeatable golf swing. This is a good book and deserves any golfer's consideration, however, I more highly recommend &quot;The Natural Golf Swing&quot; by George Knudson. Knudson's book covers that same concepts as McTeigues book, but I think it provides a bit more background and detail. I think that either of these books would benefit golfers looking to improves their games."},{"Title":"The Keys to the Effortless Golf Swing: Curing Your Hit Impulse in Seven Simple Lessons","review":"While the advice is this book is solid, it appears to come almost directly from Jimmy Ballard theories i.e. weight shift, keeping the triangle, connection, etc. The &quot;lighthouse&quot; concept is covered in a drill in George Knudson's book on Natural Golf. After contemplating the many conflicting theories of grip, setup, mental pictures, and contrasting those theories with the widely varying mechanics of top tour stars, I think golf is a combination of reasonable fundamentals, lots of practice and focus, the makeup of your body, and just plain talent. I recommend the golf instruction books by George Knudson, John Redmon, and a difficult to find book by &quot;Wild&quot; Bill Melhorn (a tour player that Ben Hogan called the best ball striker he ever saw).

There was a point at which I was concerned that Norah's book might mostly consist of whining about enduring the same things we all had to go through to reach the pinnacle of our profession. Pilots, though blessed with the best job in the world, tend to like to whine about all that is wrong with it and particularly about how hard it was to get there. But Norah, to my relief, did an excellent job of portraying the difficulties without whimpering too much. And she did a superb job of showing how those difficulties might often be magnified for the simple, silly reason that she is female. In this respect, her story could even be called eye-opening for an old, chauvinistic, insensitive, line pilot like me. Norah is to be commended for her bravery in not only overcoming the many obstacles but also for being willing to openly share her private thoughts on the matter.Flying Tigress is exceptionally well written, thought provoking, and certainly worth the read.This is Your Captain Speaking: A Common Sense Manual for Keeping Your Wings Level"},{"Title":"Flying Tigress: A Memoir","review":"Norah, you have been responsible for keeping me up at night when I really needed the sleep - I simply could not put your book down! You've let me get a glimpse into your world of jumbo jets and airline protocol and that has been an education in itself. But more importantly, I sincerely thank you for sharing your journey with such honesty, courage and humour!As a woman of my generation, I thank you for blazing the trail for me and for so many other women by proving that there are no limits - you are a shining example of how one woman can change the world. The significance of that moves me deeply.

But you don't have to be a female pilot or a pilot at all to appreciate the extraordinary breadth and depth of this ground-breaking (another pun!) woman's story. She was the legendary Flying Tigers' first female pilot and didn't know what to expect any more than their male pilots did. It is at once inspiring, heartbreaking, funny and frustrating to fly along with Norah at a time when guys really, really had no clue how to act around a woman in the cockpit. The ending of the book is especially wrenching and I recommend \\"Flying Tigress\\" to anyone who wants a great story with a surprising, true-to-life beautiful heroine with long flaming red hair who had to drive those guys absolutely nuts."},{"Title":"Flying Tigress: A Memoir","review":"From a reader's point of view, it is well written, a real page-turner and a worthwhile read.

My own mother was a single mother who recieved her Licensed Practicing Accountant license during WWII because the males had gone to war.

Many of her experiences have mirrored my own and I am proud to see that she did not let them stop her from her dreams or stop her from using all her knowledge and talents. This book shows what a remarkable woman she is and that she helped clear the way for the rest of us regardless of our professions.

Well written and highly entertaining, as well as thought provoking.As well as her experiences flying at the time when few women were pilots, she also showed a very personal and at times heart wrenching face. People forget what it was like back in the 70's and 80's - the shocking attitude of men and what we had to battle all the time. She also shows the very human and real side of being a pilot. Fantastic stories, her experiences are really intersting and well written. I once met one of the first woman Captain for Aloha and I thought at the time - my god, you must have been tough. What a hard career to take back then but thankfully women have persevered.We forget that in WWII there were many woman pilots. The american woman that came to fly with that ATA in Britain. Ferrying aircraft all over the place. Often in bad conditions, no radar, no radio. And they weren't flying trainers and small aircraft either. They flew the big bombers and really every kind of aircraft that was flying at the time.Anyway, this was a fantastic book. I thoroughly recommend it.

Excellent book."},{"Title":"PRIDE OF CHANUR","review":"The Pride of Chanur is crewed by members of a felinoid race that were latecomers to space travel, interacting with about six other races *not* including humans for the most part.Cherryh's aliens are *very* alien. Some are barely comprehensible to others. Some simply lack concepts that others are heavy with: for example, the main 'bad guy' race in the book, the Kif, neither comprehends nor harbours racial bigotry (which cannot be said for the felinoid Hani). What this all means to the reader is a refreshing need to abandon one's human assumptions while getting to know these cultures and races. Watching them all interact is fascinating.The book, again typical of Cherryh, does not waste words. Two are not used where one will do. Therefore, scan-reading types like myself can miss a great deal by not taking their time, because the book is thicker than it looks. As such it is a better bargain than its size suggests. And since there is always a lot going on, this is a strength rather than a drawback.There is not a lot of emphasis on TSFBS; Cherryh apparently figures that her energy is better spent creating interesting characters, plots and interactions than trying to wow one with the futuristic-sounding devices she can come up with, and I believe she's right. There is enough, but not too much, and it is never forced. Emphasis is on beings rather than gadgets.The matriarchal (at least in reality rather than in name) Hani are a great alien race to follow. They are loud, brassy, and gutsy. Many of them hate other Hani clans much worse than they hate other races, and this is ingrained in their culture. Absent is the mindless assumption that all members of one race are likely to have common interests. In the case of three of the races, it's not even easy to figure out what their interests might be.The entire Chanur series, of which this is the start, ranks with the Morgaine, Cyteen and Faded Sun series as superb reading of the rich type that few authors can give you. Recommended without reservation to new or experienced SF readers."},{"Title":"PRIDE OF CHANUR","review":"If you ask her, how it's all began, she will answer - because of the pride. She, the red-mane, lioness-like hani, the captain of a hani ship, a ship belonging to noble hani clan - Chanur. And all this began because of the pride - her &quot;Pride&quot;. The Compact space is a little space is the big galaxy, in which six species live in delicate balance. Kif, living for cruelty and piracy; Mahendo'sat, full their curiosity and always involved in strange experiments; Stsho, with their xenophobic minds. T'ca-Chi - two symbiotic species, acting like one organism, their brains made like matrix. K'nnn, who no one can talk to, except T'ca. And Hani, whit their clans pride, and the female presence in the space because no hani male can travel on a spaceship - being too aggressive and out of control. Six completely different species, six completely different minds - had so far lived in a little place, in delicate balance. And this balance was about to explode, and with it - the whole Compact, when a seventh specie arrived, from the other side of the galaxy. A kif battle-ship intercepted and captured unknown ship with its crew, but when it docked at the Meetpoint Station, the biggest trade center it whole Compact, the last survivor of the crew escaped. The pink-skin, no-mane creature has appeared at the dock of a hani trader ship - &quot;Pride of Chanur&quot;. The strange creature called himself &quot;human&quot;. And when a kiff prince came at the dock of &quot;The Pride&quot;, with all arrogance of his demands, it was only the pride of the honest captain, that Pianfar Chanur, that stops her from returning the &quot;human&quot; to the kif. But where the pride can lead Pianfar to? What can a small hani trader ship make against the full-armed kif battle-ships? Who she can count on? Her own specie, who turned away from her, after all the troubles she have brought them? Mahendo'sat, who doublecrossed her? The mad Stsho whose station was blown down because of her? Or methane breathers, with their weird logic? Who? Who will help her, rescue her from the deadly situation, which her own pride have brought? And what would happen when she arrives home, with a whole kif battle-fleet on her tail?"},{"Title":"PRIDE OF CHANUR","review":"For me the most amazing aspect of this book was the view of previously unencountered humans through alien eyes and mindsets. Not only are her aliens believable (and not simply exaggerated humans), but her humans are entirely incomprehensible, at least as first encountered. The author strives to present the familiar from a different perspective, and she suceeds admirably.Gradually as the book progresses the main character pieces together the puzzle presented by a sole human castaway, not only learning about his motivation and personality, but about the species as a whole. Think of it as Shogun from the Japanese perspective - who is this barbaic creature, what does he want, how does he think, can we learn anything from him? In the larger context, Chanur not only has to figure out the human Tully, but place him within a larger, shadowy power struggle between several other species. Cherryh's predilection for labyrinthine, partially visible wrangling and maneuvering is in full force.An astonishing job of creating a truly different species and getting inside their skin - and without the device of using a human interpreter."},{"Title":"PRIDE OF CHANUR","review":"Hani,Kif,Stsho,Mahe,(Knnn)?

Written in the standard Cherryh \\"from the gut\\" manner, it grabs on to your emotions and yanks them hither and yon from the first couple of pages all the way to the end. It's one of those books where you try to read faster and faster so that you can find out what's going to happen (even after having read it several times before). The best part of the book is the fact that it's stand-alone: it finishes what it starts. The remainder of the series requires this book. But, this book doesn't require the remainder of the series (though you'll definitely want to read that). Excellent book."},{"Title":"PRIDE OF CHANUR","review":"Being a talented sci-fi writer with a great imagination, C.J. Cherryh introduces you to a very alien, faroff reign of the whole universe where humans barely touch, let alone survive. So here the great space epic unfolds when Tully, a lone survivor was fleeing the bloodthirsty long-snouted Kifs and thus ran into the captain of a very noble lion-like race, the red-golden Hani. Pyanfar, an arrogant but proud leader decides to spare the human's life - and as a result, she and her loyal crew began to run into even more trouble, worst than the last as they desperately fly from star to star in a determined search for help. But despite the constant betrayal, the poor treatment, and the cold brush-off from the other aliens, the ever-gallant creatures grimly dug into their claws and held on fast until they could at least see to the lone human's safety.This is a whole new galaxy far more complex than you can ever imagine, with so many languages, behavior, norms, etc. interacting with each other - a very realistic vision of what would it be like to live in the very hub of an intergalactic enterprise. One would wonder how Ms. Cherryh came up with such alien-sounding names and all. And what is more, the whole world is quite different from what we are already familiar with. For instance, the Chanur crew are very muscular, sport mustaches and breads, and wear only trousers below their bare-chested torsos, but they are actually FEMALES! And what's more, humans are very scarce in this part of the boundless outer space. So prepare yourself for the great oydessy into the unkown!"},{"Title":"PRIDE OF CHANUR","review":"After reading and enjoying Ms. Cherryh'sCyteenI started searching for more of her novels and decided to begin reading Chanur's Saga. \\"The Pride of Chanur\\" is its first volume.Ms. Cherryh creates, once more, an astounding backdrop Cosmos full of intricacies, depicting the other end of the universe shown in \\"Cyteen\\".Here she elaborates The Compact's Media where many alien races compete, trade and fight. There are oxygen breathers and methane breathers; big cat-like people and gray somber entities; aggressive races and peaceful ones; some species are deceitful and others are straight forward.Just to make things more complex a Human show up demanding asylum from the Hani (Chanur's kind) and giving way to a feud between Hani & Kif (the bad guys of the story).One astounding feature of the book is that the main character is Captain Pyanfar Chanur and her ethnocentric point of view is THE point of perception. All other races (including human) are strange and requires all her imagination to figure up what kind of entities they are. Are they friendly? Stable? Trustworthy? All these and many more questions she has to answer in order to survive.The other bewildering aspect is that Hani kind is conducted by their females. Ladies are in charge of commerce, space travel, politics and any other significant activity (even war). Males are the Lords, pampered by females, sporting and hunting. Only one by Clan, he may be defied by other males (his own exiled sons are suitable) to singular combat and the winner takes all.The novel has the typical Space Opera structure, enriched by new elements as character's depth and culture's coherence.It is a very good sci-fi novel that will be enjoyed by fans & general public too!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"PRIDE OF CHANUR","review":"I first came across this book about 8 years ago. A friend of mine at University said &quot;Read this. It's good&quot;.

You can almost hear the clunk of the loaders working. Feel the cold of deck plates beneath your feet. Smell the ammonia of the Kif. Dream your way between the stars. And makes you never want to put the book down.All of the races described have their own agendas and their own mentality, yet each one is highly believeable. The politics and intrigue are more complex than you could imagine, yet Cherryh's way with words makes the whole situation easy to follow. Cherryh also makes excellant use of &quot;real&quot; technology rather than the instant communication/instant travel that many other authors use. In this case the immense distances between the star! s and the time-lag of communications plays an important aspect.When you've finished this one, you'll have to start on the rest of the sequence: Chanur's Venture, The Kif Strike Back, Chanur's Homecoming, and Chanur's Legacy.Space travel will never be the same again."},{"Title":"PRIDE OF CHANUR","review":"After reading and enjoying Ms. Cherryh's \\"Cyteen\\" I started searching for more of her novels and decided to begin reading Chanur's Saga. \\"The Pride of Chanur\\" is its first volume.Ms. Cherryh creates, once more, an astounding backdrop Cosmos full of intricacies, depicting the other end of the universe shown in \\"Cyteen\\".Here she elaborates The Compact's Media where many alien races compete, trade and fight. There are oxygen breathers and methane breathers; big cat-like people and gray somber entities; aggressive races and peaceful ones; some species are deceitful and others are straight forward.Just to make things more complex a Human show up demanding asylum from the Hani (Chanur's kind) and giving way to a feud between Hani & Kif (the bad guys of the story).One astounding feature of the book is that the main character is Captain Pyanfar Chanur and her ethnocentric point of view is THE point of perception. All other races (including human) are strange and requires all her imagination to figure up what kind of entities they are. Are they friendly? Stable? Trustworthy? All these and many more questions she has to answer in order to survive.The other bewildering aspect is that Hani kind is conducted by their females. Ladies are in charge of commerce, space travel, politics and any other significant activity (even war). Males are the Lords, pampered by females, sporting and hunting. Only one by Clan, he may be defied by other males (his own exiled sons are suitable) to singular combat and the winner takes all.The novel has the typical Space Opera structure, enriched by new elements as character's depth and culture's coherence.It is a very good sci-fi novel that will be enjoyed by fans & general public!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"PRIDE OF CHANUR","review":"Yeah, this book was pretty cool. It's not quite as dense or sprawling as I've come to expect Cherryh books to be (not that that's a bad thing!), but that doesn't detract from it one bit. And this book moves, moves, moves. It's probably one of the most engrossing books I've ever read.This is another one of Cherryh's first-contact type novels, and I think it's the thing she does best, really. It involves a lone human somehow lost in alien space who manages to sneak abord a Hani merchant ship, and how his presence upsets the delicate balance of power there. It's serious without being too oppressive, and it is without question the best of the series. I've read the other three, and really you can take those or leave them--the book is complete enough in itself. (With the others, I kind of feel myself playing the Star Trek 5/Aliens 3 game--if I didn't like it, it didn't happen. Trek 5? Nope. Went from 4 straight to 6....)I highly reccommend this book. It's typical Cherryh, in that you'll have to wait for your gratification until the very very end--but then, it's always worth it."},{"Title":"PRIDE OF CHANUR","review":"I've been reading CJ Cherryh since her first book was published in the mid-70s. This is one of her best and the book I recommend for people who have yet to discover her. Her strength is juggling cultures at a point of crisis. In Pride, Hani Captain Pyanfar's discovery of a human stowaway changes forever the delicate balance of the known races, some of whom can barely communicate with each other. Pyanfar is at the center of the storm as she tries to save her stowaway, her ship and her world, while being chased by just about everyone. The first book in a series, Pride stands alone and has a quite satisfactory ending. But I recommend you read them all!"},{"Title":"PRIDE OF CHANUR","review":"Whether hurtling through an asteroid belt at near lightspeed or fleeing vicious alien marauders, Pyanfar Chanur and her valiant crew are sure to keep you riveted with their adventures to the very last page. Having retrieved an unusual cargo at Meetpoint Station -- a human fugitive -- the Pride of Chanur is now number one on the hit list of every warship this side of Mars. From Chanur's flight from the smoking ruins of Meetpoint to a no-holds-barred, winner-takes-all showdown in the skies above their homeworld, The Pride of Chanur is an engaging and exciting read"},{"Title":"PRIDE OF CHANUR","review":"I've heard a lot about C.J. Cherryh, and was really excited to finally read one of her books. The Pride of Chanur is the first book in the Chanur series, about Pyanfar Chanur, a member of a feline species called the hani. She is a ship captain that commands The Pride of Chanur, a ship owned by the Chanur family.The Pride of Chanur is docked at Meetpoint Station when they find a stowaway on their ship. He's small, blunt fingered and has no fur, and he calls himself a human. No one has seen the likes of him before, but he's on the run from hostile aliens, so they give him shelter, not realising that this would put their whole world in jeopardy.This book definitely felt a bit dated, probably because of the cat-like and bear-like aliens. That doesn't stop it from being really fun and really good, though!The Pride of Chanur is written entirely from Pyanfar's point of view. Tully, the human, isn't really a huge character, he's alien to them and they don't know his language in the beginning. He's more of a catalyst for the story - the discovery of a whole new race. I found this pretty refreshing, I've never read a story with a wholly alien protagonist. I really enjoyed a look at humans through the eyes of other species - we would be quite strange to aliens.Hani society is interesting too, it's completely female dominated. I enjoyed the little intersection of family trouble into the intragalactic trouble.The only complaint I have about this book is that there was a bit too much action for me - it almost felt more like a movie than a book. I would've appreciated a bit more plot or backstory or worldbuilding. But then again, it's an old book.I'm definitely looking forward toChanur's Venture."},{"Title":"PRIDE OF CHANUR","review":"I saw this word in one of the other reviews, and you could not find a better description of one major facet of C.J. Cherryh's writing style. It takes about four paragraphs in any of her books for me to get the feeling that I have stepped off an unexpected one foot drop onto a steep slope, and from then on I am running, trying to get my balance again. I generally never find it until the book ends. And then I want the next. This entire series is great.And I would suggest a look at earlier works, like Paladin, Cuckoo's Nest, and the Morgaine series. I have never read a writer that constructs such totally believable alien societies, and individuals within them."},{"Title":"PRIDE OF CHANUR","review":"The Chanur series of books is a favorite of mine, and this one is no exception. I only wish that there were more of them. This series qualifies for re-reading. The characters are so \\"real\\" that you almost believe that they exist and that you know them, and the wry humour of the characters makes me smile and laugh out loud."},{"Title":"PRIDE OF CHANUR","review":"In a far-distant future, seven nonhuman races interact by way of a trade pact called the Compact, trading generally at artificial space stations, especially the centrally-located Meetpoint. Three of these species are methane breathers--the knnn, the chi, and the snakelike tc'a; the others are warm-blooded oxy-breathers: the tall, ambling, anthropoidal mahendo'sat; the xenophobic, cowardly, and very formal stsho; the sinister gray-skinned kif; and the bluff felinoid hani, whose society is set up in such a way that while males rule the various estates and enclaves (and routinely have several wives), it's the females who go to space and engage in commerce. At Meetpoint, Pyanfar Chanur, captain of her clan's premiere tradeship The Pride of Chanur, unexpectedly finds herself faced with a fugitive--a naked-skinned escapee from kif captivity who can't speak any known language but manages to convince Pyanfar and her crew that he's sapient. His name is Tully, and his species is human.Thus begins a headlong adventure that will ultimately involve all seven of the Compact's partner-races and turn hani society inside out. Cherryh is an absolute master of the very difficult task of thinking like a nonhuman: she succeeds not only in making her alien races intriguing and real, but in making Tully seem like the alien he is to them. Pyanfar and her five crewwomen (including her brother's daughter, Hilfy, who is heir-presumptive to The Pride) must face stsho corruption and obstructionism and deal with kifish threats and convoluted mahendo'sat politics as well as the unpredictable and incomprehensible methane-breathers and threats to both Py's husband's and Hilfy's father's control over their estates. Though there's a fair amount of tech in this hard-sf adventure, it still turns ultimately on intelligent beings--their cultural prejudices and expectations, their character and capacities, and the decisions they make. It was the author's twelfth book and remains one of the best of nearly 100. It's definitely one of my favorites in an sf collection that exceeds 2000 at last count, and anyone who enjoys alien races and fast-paced, suspenseful adventure should find it right up their alley."},{"Title":"PRIDE OF CHANUR","review":"After reading and enjoying Ms. Cherryh's \\"Cyteen\\" I started searching for more of her novels and decided to begin reading Chanur's Saga. \\"The Pride of Chanur\\" is its first volume.Ms. Cherryh creates, once more, an astounding backdrop Cosmos full of intricacies, depicting the other end of the universe shown in \\"Cyteen\\".Here she elaborates The Compact's Media where many alien races compete, trade and fight.

The four-book Chanur series is one of the greatest SF epics of all time. (The fifth, Chanur's Legacy, is a fun afterthought but not as deep as the original chunk.) This first volume is a satisfying stand-alone read, but trust me, you'll want to read the rest. I always warn people not to start this series unless you have a large chunk of time set aside--even though I've reread it countless times, once I get started I still find its momentum impossible to put down.Pride of Chanur starts with an unforgettable image--a mostly naked fugitive human writing numbers on a spaceship deck in his own blood to prove his sentience to the startled alien who has just slashed him with her claws in self-defense. From there it rolls along into an intelligent, funny, and utterly satisfying adventure. Cherryh achieves an amazing feat in telling the story entirely through alien eyes, yet still giving us completely satisfying, believable, and likable protagonists. She vividly depicts four entirely distinct and fully realized oxy-breathing species, each complete with distinct patterns of thought, traditions, and psychology, plus several other more mysterious methane-breathing species, in all their complex and troublesome interactions, plus humans (well, mostly just one) thrown precipitously into the mix. The human is the alien in this story, and we hear his perspective only through the often garbled and always incomplete computer translator, an approach which is unusually realistic (unlike so much SF where translation always works perfectly, instantly) and always leaves you curious to know more. The reversal of perspective is so convincing and complete that you'll find yourself looking at your own species' psychology as the strange one.Plus there's the fascinating reverse-sexism of the hani, the main alien culture, which essentially follows the structure of a sentient lion pride: men are considered too volatile and unstable for everyday business, thus are kept secluded except during dynastic battles; the sensible, pragmatic females take care of commerce, law, alliances, and space-faring. (In the sequels, these beliefs get confronted and deconstructed in interesting ways.) The quintessentially feline temperament and mannerisms of the hani--vain, swaggering, hot-tempered, affectionate, physical, fierce, loyal--are convincing and irresistible, especially if you're a cat person anyway! And be warned, the pidgin and idiom the characters use for inter-species communication will completely infect your brain.Dive right into this satisfying yarn, and know that in the next three books a far, far wilder, bigger, and more complex story will unfold...nail-biting action intertwined flawlessly with deep psychological and cultural insight, tangled intrigue, agonizing moral dilemmas, and extraordinary character transformations. Enjoy the ride!"},{"Title":"PRIDE OF CHANUR","review":"Not many writers can do aliens as well as Cherryh -- bilateral, oxygen-breathing, most of them, but with minds and emotions and evolved biologies that are very, very different indeed from human. Pyanfar Chanur is the successful, wealthy captain of a Hani trading ship, a powerful figure in the powerful Chanur family, leading a crew composed all of family members, like all Hani ships. And then she's suddenly saddled with Tully, a refugee human escaped from the Kif, an opportunistically piratical race that evolved by blood feud. Humans are newly arrived on the edge of the space occupied by the member races of the Compact and trading rights with them will be worth a lot, but Pyanfar will have to risk everything. And the profoundly untrustworthy Kif aren't going to make things easier. Cherryh does a terrific job of gradually introducing the reader to the intricacies of the vaguely lion-like Hani society, in which females do the work and tend to the psychologically unstable, world-bound males, who are lords of the estates -- until they're challenged by younger males and finally lose. You'll come to know Pyanfar and her crew as individuals, too. The plot gallops, the characterizations are intriguing, and the dialogue is snappy. Yet the book is much denser than it appears. What more could you want -- except the three following volumes in this saga?"},{"Title":"PRIDE OF CHANUR","review":"This book is one of the best science-fiction books I've ever read. I read Anne McCaffery, and she is good, but when it comes to pure sci-fi, C.J. Cherryh in absolutely wonderful!! Words cannot describe my pleasure at this wonderful saga. Pyanfar is a nice character, very beautiful, but she has no feelings, she is very cold, even to her relatives, even to her husband. I think Hilfy is a little better, she's nice, pretty, and energetic, but how does she end up liking Tully?But, even past these bad points, it is wonderful book. C.J Cherryh is a fabulous author, and should write more concerning this Saga. And, as a little pointer, is a shocking resemblence to the Kilrathi of Wing Commander."},{"Title":"The Total Shiba","review":"This book is EXCELLENT for the Shiba breeder. I have found it extremely helpful in pedigree research, genetics of the breed, and the detailed explanation of the standard is fabulous. However, I usually do not recommend it to first time Shiba owners. Most of this book is geared to breeders. For my pet owners, I always suggest the Complete Shiba Inu by Atkinson. If you can buy both, GREAT! If you need to choose one, think about what you need and get the book that covers that area."},{"Title":"The Total Shiba","review":"This is my favorite Shiba book. I have been involved in the breed since 1987 and this book (to me) is a culmination of the years of knowledge and experience I had to glean by hanging out with the best. It has almost everything that a person would want to know about the Shiba Inu. The authors are highly knowlegeable and have been involved in the breed since before 1986. Fred Lanting, world renowned judge and Shiba Breeder, gives this book a glowing review...he calls it; concise, constructive,accurate, and comprehensive.In the back of the book are over 100 photos of the Shibas that were the foundation of the Shibas in America today. Many of the Shibas in Shibumi Shiba Inu's pedigrees are pictured there. I wish this book had been available in 1987."},{"Title":"The Total Shiba","review":"This book was interesting, historically, and if you are thiking about showing a Shiba. But if you just bought a Shiba, it gives you little details. I would recommend it for a coffee table book, but not if you are looking for details on your puppy and training advice unique to Shibas."},{"Title":"The Total Shiba","review":"I think that this is a great Shiba book. I also own another called The Complete Shiba Inu, and feel that both books are excellent. This book has tips on how to care for your Shiba, pictures, and training suggestions."},{"Title":"The Total Shiba","review":"Of all of the breed-specific books I've read that discuss Shiba Inus, this book is my hands-down favorite. It gives a thorough history of the breed, a detailed explanation of the breed's standard, a good chapter of advice on choosing and raising a Shiba puppy, and one of the most helpful and informative chapters I've read on breeding anywhere.That said, I have to agree with those who wrote that it's not the book for everyone. The Total Shiba is geared more toward breeders than toward prospective buyers and enthusiasts. The content is breeding-focused and it lacks color photographs. Enthusiasts would enjoy the Complete Owner's Guide or the Kennel Club book more, as both are filled with beautiful pictures and content more geared toward their interests."},{"Title":"The Total Shiba","review":"We knew very little about our shiba before we got her. From history to types, coloration, how they think and training this book does a great job for the new owner."},{"Title":"The Total Shiba","review":"This book was recommended to me by another Shiba owner and I'm glad she did. More breed specific information than any other Shiba book I've seen. Also, there is a section regarding breeding. This is a book for serious Shiba Inu fans and anyone who is contemplating showing or breeding."},{"Title":"The Total Shiba","review":"This book has a large amount of information geared towards breeders and people interested in competitive showing of their Shibas. However, there is a great deal of history included in the book that most other Shiba-specific books just don't have. It covers everything from the regional origin of the Shiba, to the breed's near-destruction during and post World War 2, to the extensive rehabilitation of the breed and why the breeders chose the methods they used in order to revive and conserve the Shiba population.In addition to the breed history, \\"The Total Shiba\\" also gives an accurate portrayal of the Shiba's characteristics. The book lists both the breed standards of the Japanese and United States clubs as well as descriptions in layman's terms. I have several Shiba books and this one best describes what a Shiba is in plain English. It also covers some special health concerns that other books have not listed, including allergies to some routine puppy vaccinations.To be honest, I would consider this to be a companion book toShiba Inu (Comprehensive Owner's Guide). The \\"Shiba Inu (Comprehensive Owner's Guide)\\" by Andrew de Prisco covers a great deal of information for new Shiba owners, including basic care, first aid information, what to look for in a breeder, supplies to purchase before and after adoption of a Shiba, etc. It's surprisingly in-depth when it comes to a pet owner's needs and even covers a small portion of training techniques. Where \\"Shiba Inu (Comprehensive Owner's Guide)\\" gives you the how-to's and important information as a pet owner, \\"The Total Shiba\\" is an excellent book for Shiba enthusiasts to learn more about their breed's background and the details behind their breeding and showing in the ring.I would recommend \\"The Total Shiba\\" to anyone who is truly interested in learning all they can about the Shiba breed, but also suggest that other books be read as well. From what I've read so far, each Shiba Inu book out there has some helpful information that the other books may either lack or only briefly touch on."},{"Title":"The Total Shiba","review":"I highly recommend this book for anyone who is definitely planning to get a Shiba Inu. Many of the websites you find actually quote (without credit) this book. This book puts together all of the information from the various websites in one place.

Shiba Inu was accepted as an official AKC breed in 1992. This book was published in 1997, so there is only 5 years of AKC based information. Moreover, since it was published in 97; and it is now 2013, the information is 16 years old! I found much of the content to be word for word from the National Shiba Inu Club of America website. ALL pictures are BLACK & WHITE; even the ones that discuss color variations and faults as well as the chart for color genetics in breeding.There is information regarding breed standards, along with pictures, charts and diagrams. Many of the diagrams have lines, letters, and/or numbers on them as if to discuss the standards, but the dialog doesn't even refer to them or if it does, it is very vague and not understandable. For example, a discussion about the ear size states that the ear must be in proportion with the head; it mustn't be too big or too small. However, it does not define that proportion, so there is no way to know what too big or too small is. There is another discussion about the shape of the ear with several illustrations of incorrect ears with the head facing you straight on, yet the illustration of the correct ear is a side view of the dog, so impossible to tell the actual shape and size or to see it with respect to the incorrect ones.There is one breeder whose dogs' pictures dominate this book, which is not a fair representation of the breed at all. There are a few bloodlines that come from different areas in Japan. The main breeder from this book buys from the same Japanese breeder, making the information about pedigrees and ancestry as well as the look of the dogs very specific and limited; not a true representation of the breed or the Japanese imports as promised by the title The Total Shiba.The chapter 'The Foundation of the modern Shiba' is completely irrelevant and outdated. Along with the Breed Gallery chapter. The Breed Gallery is about 30 pages with about 100 dogs \\"to help new and old shiba fanciers with pedigree studies. Most of the Shibas selected for the Breed Gallery are japanese imports. Using your pedigree from your Shiba's breeder and the pedigree in the Breed Gallery, we hope you will be able to trace your shiba back to it's Japanese roots ...\\". This chapter is a waste. There are thousands and thousands of Shiba's in Japan. The 100 dogs listed are not the founding fathers of the current dogs in Japan let alone the Shiba Inus that reside in the US. It would be a miracle if your Shiba's ancestors showed up in that Gallery.Those are just a small sample of the poorly written and poorly edited book. Save your $25 and surf the internet. Look at the information on AKC as well as the National Shiba Inu Club. There you can find accurate information with color pictures which is not biased to one breeder.I'm sending my book back. I hope they will refund my money."},{"Title":"The Total Shiba","review":"I purchased this book expecting general information and training help. This book is largely made for show purposes. It has no useful information except if you want to breed and show the dog.

The best pieces made the collection well worth it for me.Algren is one of the most lyrical writers that I've read. Few have written prose that gives me the sense of rhythm and melody in the English language that I get from Algren's best stuff (Toni Morrison comes to mind). My favorite passage in this book, from EVERYTHING INSIDE'S A PENNY -- &quot;My father was a fixer of tools, a fixer of machinery; a fixer of tables gone wobbly and windows that had stuck....Other men wished secretly to be forever drunken. He wished to be forever fixing.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Last Carousel (signed)","review":"Parts of this review were used in a review of Algren's classic Man With The Golden Arm and of the collection of short stories in The Neon Wilderness. These short stories in the Last Carousel reflect the same milieu that Algren worked in that novel although he has taken some of the stories out of Chicago and some of them are from a later period in the 1960's and 1970's. In a strange sense Algren throughout his literary career was working that same small vein- but what a mother lode he produced.Growing up in a post World War II built housing project this reviewer knew first hand the so-called \`romance' of drugs, the gun and the ne'er do well hustler. And also the mechanisms one needed to develop to survive at that place where the urban working poor meet and mix with the lumpen proletariat- the con men, dopesters, grifters drifters and gamblers who feed on the downtrodden. This is definitely not the mix that Damon Runyon celebrated in his Guys and Dolls-type stories. Far from it.Nelson Algren has gotten, through hanging around Chicago police stations and the sheer ability to observe, that sense of foreboding, despair and of the abyss of America's mean streets down pat in a number of works, including this collection of his better stories. Along the way we meet an array of stoolies, cranks, crackpots and nasty brutish people who are more than willing to put obstacles in the way of anyone who gets in their way. But to what end? They lose in the end, and drag others down with them.We, of late, have become rather inured to lumpen stories either of the death and destruction type or of the rehabilitative kind but at the time that these stories were put together in the late 1940's and early 1950's this was something of an eye-opener for those who were not familiar with the seamy side of urban life. The dead end jobs, the constant run-ins with the \`authorities' in the person of the police, many times corrupt as well. The dread of going to work, the dread of not going to work, the fear of being victimized and the glee of victimizing. The whole jumbled mix of people with few prospects and fewer dreams.Algren has put it down in writing for all that care to read. These are not pretty stories. And he has centered his stories on the trials and tribulations of gimps, prostitutes and other hustlers. Damn, as much as I knew about the kind of things that Algren was describing these are still gripping stories. And, if the truth were told, you know as well as I do that unfortunately these stories could still be written today. Read Algren if you want to walk on the wild side."},{"Title":"Simplified solution of piping offsets","review":"I found this book quite helpful when I worked in the tube bending industry, designing tools & dies, and I'm sure it's useful in other industries as well."},{"Title":"Wood-Block Printing: A Description of the Craft of Woodcutting and Colour Printing Based on the Japanese Practice","review":"Don't buy this book.

P. Hartley, Gerald Kersh, John Collier, A. E. Sendling, Anthony Vercoe, E. Everett Evans, and Fielden Hughes.This collection is ambitiously but inaccurately named. While it may come as little surprise that not all the stories are great (most, in fact, are not), a goodly number of them aren't even horror. There's some straight fantasy here, and some historical fiction, and about the only thing these entries share with actual horror stories is some small measure of suspense.On the whole, the quality of the stories here is average. \\"The Oblong Box\\" is hardly Poe's finest work, and all the horror stories are more or less by the numbers. The non-horror tales here, some of which are more ill-fitting than others, are of similar quality to these.The highlights of 11 Stories are Lovecraft's \\"The Dunwich Horror\\" and Stoker's \\"The Judge's House\\" - you can easily find both of these classics in other, superior volumes, and there's really not much else to get excited about."},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"Carol Sveilich's new book, Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic illness and Pain is a gift to those who suffer chronic health conditions as well as to their support networks. Her book is unique in that her skilled photography shows the \\"normalcy\\" on the faces of her subjects while her (and their) words reveal the underlying medical conditions which make daily living a challenge. Often these challenges are made all the more frustrating because the individual looks \\"just fine\\" to the outside observer. Her subjects own words are a heartfelt testimony to the frustrations, coping mechanisms and positivity which make up the fabric of their daily lives allowing them to survive and thrive.It is a book of hope, comfort and wisdom and an invaluable contribution not only to the medical community, but to anyone who suffers (or knows someone who suffers) on a daily basis.

Finally, some people I can relate to. I felt very validated after reading this wonderful book. I will insist my husband read it too!"},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"I found JUST FINE: Unmasking Chronic Illness and Pain to be a marvelous resource. I am personally dealing with several debilitating conditions that are not externally evident. The interviews in the second half of the book told my story. Here were people openly discussing thing I thought only I had experienced. The first half of the book is full of a vast amount of very useful information. The book reads well and is very moving an inspiring. Highly recommended to anyone dealing with chronic illness and/or pain AND family members, friends and coworkers. I think the medical profession could make great use of this book as a resource to improve the doctor patient relationship. I've not seen a book like this \\"out there\\". For those of us dealing with these difficult conditions and our families, this is a breath of fresh air. It is guaranteed to start much benefical dialog. I for one am very thankful that this book is available."},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"For the first time since my diagnosis, I finally feel UNDERSTOOD! What a gift! I can't recommend it highly enough. \\"Just Fine\\" offers much comfort and great resources. This is a book that hits home with me. It's so insightful about what it is really like to live with a chronic disorder that is invisible, yet effects you every day. This book TELLS IT LIKE IT IS, but also offers great suggestions on how to adjust and live with constant symptoms and pain. For instance, it talks about how to pace yourself, obstacles in the workplace, diet challenges, how illness impacts relationships and how it plays with mood and sleep patterns.I loved the alternative healthcare options as well as conventional medicine. I personally think both are so useful!I want my doctors, family and friends to read this book so they will understand me. I really enjoyed the many personal accounts of living with ongoing symptoms, and the candid observations of the special challenges of looking well, but feeling otherwise. What a unique and valuable work!"},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"I ordered a copy direct from Carol, who so kindly did a personal autograph on the inside of the book. It is a great book for ANYONE who is dealing with chronic pain, not just with the conditions listed, because invisible illnesses are very similiar in a lot of ways in that society doesn't know how to handle them. It is like reading stories about your personal situation--you can pick things out of each story as if Carol was writing about you. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness And Pain brings together a wealth of individual anecdotes concerning ways to deal and live with chronic pain and ill conditions, including Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, colitis, and much more. Black-and-white photographs are sprinkled throughout the plain-terms tales that offer hope, healing, and testimony to the resilience of the human spirit. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"I purchased this along with \\"You Don't Look Sick\\" for my adult daughter who has a chronic illness. She loved both books and found them very helpful and validating."},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"I feel a special kinship with the author and find this book well written, quite readable and relevant to my life condition at this time.Sveilich's first description of her slow discovery of an unusual medical condition and its impact on a well-organized life was eye opening. It was so understandable and the words flowed with solid impact. Those words make the reader feel a part of that experience from the outset. The many interviews give the reader context for their condition and help identify with a broader world.While clearly, not a medical advice book, Just Fine has a human touch that encourages the reader to look into their medical condition and learn from others who are traveling a similar path.The author makes it abundantly clear that we do not walk along this path alone. It's always nice to know about the support that is out there.Sveilich's book lets the reader know that there is dignity for all who suffer chronic illness and pain. This book was like finding a small treasure."},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"We usually think of an illness or disability as something that can be seen. This book shares several personal stories about those who live with invisible illnesses and disabilities. It is an important book for patients, caretakers, friends and family of those who live with the challenges of an invisible illness. If you are one of these people, I recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"Just Fine:Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain is just what the doctor ordered for people diagnosed with an invisible illness, such as diabetes, epilepsy, asthma, multiple sclerosis, to name a few. Invisible in this context means the sufferer may not have observable symptoms, which makes dealing with it all the harder since the ill person must often suffer alone without the help that society offers to those with more noticeable symptoms. This book is more about the personal experience of illness and what insights the sufferers have gained, rather than a medical treatise. This book interviews a number of people who suffer from a wide range of ailments. They are experts at coping, and they share their journey from diagnosis to the daily decisions they make. It describes how the subjects deal with accepting diagnosis; how they decide whether to disclose the illness to friends, employers, or workers. It discusses alternative treatments that the interviewees in this book try and how effective they are. They have a lot to say to those who have just been diagnosed with or daily struggle with a concealed illness."},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"This book is a comprehensive review of what it's like to live with a chronic illness, especially those maladies with a strong pain component. The first half of the book not only provides examples of typical situations faced by people with these diseases, it also includes explanations for the underlying feelings of distress that often accompany their problem. The second half of the book describes the life of several individuals with the chronic illnesses talked about early on. It is obvious that the author has done extensive research on the topic, both as an academic and as one with experience. While the material presented is generally universal to chronic disease patients, it has little to say about living with chronic back pain....a problem likely faced by as many people as the total number of the others the author describes. This book is not a \\"how to\\" about living with chronic illness, but it does give great insight into dealing with the misery that these diseases and often those around the patient, cause. As a chronic pain patient, I found this book well worth reading and sharing with others!"},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness And PainIf you have any doubts about purchasing this book, let me alleviate them now. The book not only explains these illnesses, but takes the reader on a journey through the eyes of those who suffer from these illnesses and how they cope on a day-to-day basis. Being a concealed chronic illness sufferer myself, I didn't realize how many people felt as I do. I'm going to buy more books for my doctors and family members. Feel free to do the same. This should be required reading for doctors, families, employers, etc. Well written and so very heartfelt."},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"This book is like two books in one! It contains personal stories and photographs of concealed illness, that are touching and inspiring. Also, the book offers insight into the professions that the patient interfaces with, and those philosphies of treatment.As a therapist I have already been able to use this book in both ways, to recommend treatment options, and to help clients understand their own feelings mirrored in these many testimonials.In a age where there is so much suffering from pain or illness, combined with longevity of life and medical procedures, more and more of the population is faced with these kind of issues or struggles. We can learn from each other, gain support from one another, and face the challenges of the medical community together. This author has given us the vehicle to share and to care, to learn and give hope. As a professional it has opened up my eyes and caused me to be more caring, via the understanding I have received."},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"Carol Sveilich has written what will now become the definitive work for people who are living with these \\"invisible\\" but debilitating conditions. She has mastered the understanding from both sides of the issue: from the patient's side and from the medical community's side. Finally, our voices can be heard and just because we look \\"just fine\\" doesn't mean we are. Her writing is clear and concise and her research offers many other options that some people may not have considered in their treatments. I particularly enjoyed the \\"testimonials\\" from others who offered their individual coping skills and methods to keep on living their lives despite their medical handicaps and despite the intolerance of a society at large who assumes that because they look \\"just fine\\" they are. I believe this book will be of incredible help to those who are newly diagnosed and I urge medical doctors to \\"prescribe\\" it to their patients."},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"In all my literature searches since my diagnosis of Fibromyalgia/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, I have never found a book that has captured the experience of those with invisible illnesses with such compassion, clarity, and helpful information.Just Fine is how most of us look on the outside, and this unique book shows the world visually the truth of our experiences with concealed illnesses. Viewing the pictures of the subjects who look like any average person, and reading their stories of their challenges and treatment options really makes it graphically clear how the world can perceive us without really knowing what our life is actually like. It also provides those of us with illnesses great compassion, support, and a plethera of helpful ideas on treatments and coping ideas, many of them new to me even after 12 years of this challenging condition.Just Fine is an amazing, well written work for not only the invisibly health challenged, but also their families and medical teams. I hope it will find its' way into every doctor's waiting room table and every household where someone looks just fine, but isn't. It can help so many people.Thank you for offering this unique resource; it will broaden the world's understanding of hidden chronic illness,which will lead to better experiences for everyone."},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"This book is long overdue. Finally, a book that gives people hope and offers them some great coping tools and avenues to explore. The author also allows the reader to see for themselves how other people cope. I related to so many of their stories, experiences and emotions, as I too live with two concealed illness. This book also addresses depression and the stages of acceptance of any ongoing health challenge. It was so useful for me to read how other people have coped with their circumstances. I related to nearly all of them! The photographs help the reader realize that you never know what's going on behind the facade or a smiling face. I guess everyone is coping with some type of challenge, be it physical or mental. The book really addresses the issue of looking one way and feeling another in a unique way that I've not run across before. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"This book is for anyone that has a \\"hidden\\" disease or condition. Anyone that looks just fine on the outside but may be in pain or dealing with major physical complaints will find this book to be helpful. There are others out there going through the same type of problems you are and you will find support and encouragement from them."},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"This book is fantastic. It is a book with a lot of heart. The author is wonderfully understanding and compassionate and the stories are touching and amazing. I live with chronic illness and found that this book contained a lot of helpful information and wonderful insights. I learned a lot about myself reading it. In addition to it being a wonderful book to savor, I also learned tools for taking better care of myself and my body. Many of my friends and family have also read it and said that they now have a dramatically new understanding of what it is like for me to live with a chronic illness. I would heartily recommend this book to anyone living with a chronic illness, anyone who has a family member or friend living with a chronic illness, or anyone in the medical or mental health field... even if you already think, as I did, that you know all about it!"},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"I wish I had read this book about 10 years ago when I was first diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. It addresses so many of the issues I've had to deal with over the years and gives me some tools and reasonable ways of looking at the cards I've been dealt. I found a lot of understanding and comfort here. As I said, I could have used this book when I was trying to adjust to a new way of life and learning how to manage my pain and other symptoms. This is an awesome resource. Thanks to the author for writing it. I will be recommending it to a friend who lives with diabetes, and another with lupus. We all look \\"just fine\\" to others!"},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"This book is a book that is so comforting to read; because others are ill too, which I can relate to but also because I don't feel alone in this world in my pain anymore. I read people's storie's of their illness' and it is sad that we have to go through so much pain. Excruciating pain. The point too is that you cannot tell that we are sick. We look normal on the outside but so sick on the inside. I think people need to be more careful when they make comments to people who are suffering\\"You don't look sick\\" or \\" I don't believe you\\".What gives people the right??? They are ignorant and you should just ignore such shoddy. bold comments.You are stronger for your suffering!!!An excellent read for chronic sufferer's!"},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"Just Fine is one of the best books I had read on helping to deal with invisible illness.

I have recomended it to several people. Very good!!!"},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"Everybody has a story. As editor of a newsletter, it's not unusual for me to receive an e-mail or letter requesting that I review a book for possible inclusion in our publication. After all, we target a market specifically for those with chronic pain. Most of the time, I'm happy to at least look but I do so with optimistic skepticism. Our readers have a lot to deal with already. If I can't endorse a book, in my editorial opinion, I opt out of giving it published space. My first criteria is that a book should \\"do no harm\\" in its effort to do good. I also prefer to give the space to books, which warrant attention. Just Fine deserves both space and attention.In her own words, the author states the uniqueness of her book: \\"There is an absence of resources that examines an individual's outward appearance and how it runs contrary to their pain, symptoms, and inner world.\\" While the 336 page book is divided approximately in half, the theme of dealing with appearing \\"normal\\" despite how you feel runs consistently from beginning to end. In the first half, the author's revelation of what it is like to uncover and ultimately accept a diagnosis and the limitations, changes and medical challenges that come with that diagnosis - despite looking fine - is unlike any other book I've read. The author's own black and white photographs of people she's interviewed and whose stories are included will greet you in the second half. Stop and look at the faces. The fact that you cannot \\"see\\" what disorder they have is what Just Fine is all about.In Chapter One, \\"why seeing is not always believing\\", the author explains, \\"Human nature, for the most part, is visually oriented. We believe what we see and often make character judgments based solely on visual perceptions. But, what happens when the person who appears healthy, energetic, and just fine to family, friends, and coworkers, is quietly suffering from chronic pain or the challenges of an ongoing illness?\\" This point continues to be painstakingly revealed in the personal stories collected and shared by the author from others who live and deal daily with these chronic illnesses. The idea that someone can look fine and not feel as good as they appear seems an unlikely paradox. Often the first exchange between two people is, \\"Hi, how are you?\\" followed by, \\"You look great!\\" Should a person admit their \\"secret\\" suffering and/or pain and risk that too familiar look of skepticism?The author strikes further to the core of the matter: many struggle to live as \\"normal\\" as they look and rationalize the consequences when they cannot. She says it simply, \\"One may recover from the shock of an illness but not from the illness itself. This is where it is essential to develop and utilize new skills\\". The more disabling the disorder, no matter how invisible, the more your life will change. How will it change and what can you do about it? The author's two decades of counseling experience shines through, especially in the stories. While many offer hope and inspiration, she also includes those stories that don't have it all figured out yet --because with a chronic condition, the story doesn't always have a nice, neat ending.Just Fine is an amazing book that will touch the reader on many different levels, especially emotionally. This is not, however, a coping book as much as it is a \\"comfort\\" book. The author goes beyond the personal and offers the practical as well in dealing with subjects as family, work, friends, depression and medical therapies, including alternative options. It is indeed a resource for those with a \\"concealed illness\\" whose story is finally well told -- as well as anyone else -- family, doctors, support group leaders who wants to truly \\"see\\" them, too."},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"This is a well-written, well-researched book that exposes many of the difficulties experienced by people who have illnesses with no readily visible symptoms. The book is light on descriptions of specific conditions, which works to its advantage since it is less about any particular illness than about the experiences people have in common when their illnesses are masked by an outward appearance of health. This book is not only a resource for individuals with concealed chronic illnesses or pain, but also for their loved ones, for health professionals, and for mental health professionals. What Sveilich unmasks in this book is not only the hidden face of chronic illness, but also the harm caused by our appearance-obsessed culture."},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"Like others have written, JUST FINE is a gift to all those impacted by chronic, invisible illnesses and pain.Chronic Fatigue (CFIDS) has been my challenge and teacher since my symptoms began more than 30 years ago. JUST FINE, written beautifully by a therapist surviving her own chronic illnesses, says everything I needed to know THEN when little was known and we were told it was a \\"psychological problem\\". The book reassures me - even NOW when we recently found out there are at least 5 genetic markers (see the CDC website) - that I am and have been doing MORE than \\"Just Fine\\" with the \\"luck of the draw\\" biologically & with the life circumstances that may have contributed to triggering my illness.The photos and narratives of \\"people with...\\" function like a \\"support group in a book\\" and I KNOW that many readers may not have a group available or be able to reach one because of the limits often imposed by the illnesses themselves. I appreciate the participants' courage in speaking about often stigmatized experiences, while also knowing many of us are longing to be asked by someone who is truly willing to hear us. We continually search for language that can describe our often fluctuating experience: Carol Sveilich and her interviewees have done just that!I have given this book to clients, friends and family. I look forward to any more writing Sveilich will do in the future, as she clearly has more to say that would be worthwhile to read - to \\"listen with your eyes\\"."},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"I'm not easily impressed. This book impressed me.I have read just about every book available on the topic of coping with chronic illness and pain. None of them come close to this one by Sveilich. She seems to know the subject quite well and presents unique resources from experts and professionals in the field.Of course, the best experts are the people who actually live with chronic health disorders and they are respresented throughout this book. The profiles are amazing. I saw my story in just about all of the 55 profiles included. I also found some great coping tools to apply to my own life.Good insights and coping tips were offered by psychologists as well as physicians. The author also discusses mind-body medicine and complementary approaches as well as traditional medicine. From Zen to Zoloft and everything in-between... this book has it all.My only remaining question is, why isn't JUST FINE on the New York Bestseller list?It should be."},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"Just when I thought no one truly understood what I was going through comes this phenomenal book that not only tells it like it is, but SHOWS it like it is. The use of photographs to show the reader how deceiving looks can be is a wise move on the part of the author. Not only does JUST FINE contain cutting edge coping tips, unique resources in both traditional Western Medicine and Alternative healthcare, and helpful hints from people who live with a variety of chronic health challenges, but the book offers hope and practical advice for those who appear one way but feel very differently. I can't recommend JUST FINE highly enough. I live with several chronic conditions including ARTHRITIS and chronic fatigue syndrome. I also experience frequent migraine headaches. This book is a must-read for every person living with chronic symptoms of any kind, including DEPRESSION. It is also a great book to hand to physicians, nurses, family members, and complementary healthcare professionals. I can't say enough about it. Get this book! You'll be glad you did.

For example, I ask myself how I can be in such horrible pain at work and no one around me even notices. Truly frustrated with this dilemma, I picked up a copy of Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain by Carol Sveilich to see if I could find some answers.The book discusses hidden health disorders in a unique way because the author not only offers insights and coping tips offered from physicians and psychologists, including traditional medicine and mind-body medicine. She also has included profiles of people living with a hidden health disorder and she lets them tell their story in their own words, along with their photographs.What I really liked about the book was being educated about other types of concealed illnesses, and at the same time, how I saw myself in many of the stories. There were common threads of emotions from these people living double lives.Some of the topics from the book included how to deal with canceling plans, learning how to answer people when they ask how you are, being envious of other people in good health, sacrificing personal goals, making adjustments, and how to respond to people when they question the severity of your symptoms.I was surprised and relieved to see the author even dealt with the subject of sex with a chronic illness, which I never saw explored before in a book.This book definitely made me feel not so alone with my double life. It was very comforting and it taught me how to look at people differently, because someone who is smiling in the office might be living with a hidden health disorder like me."},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"Carol has hit the nail on the head. So many of my patients come in to me with the same complaint; \\"I look fine, but I feel horrable and my doctors don't believe me\\".This is great resource and support for my patients with chronic pain and illness.

There is hope for these patients and \\"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain\\" is a very valuable resource.Dr. Steven Ross"},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"This is a great book for anyone to read who has a relative, friend, patient, or client who is living with a chronic pain condition. Such conditions are usually invisible and difficult for both the sufferer and the spouse, children and other in close contact to live with and understand. The lack of understanding or recognition by those close to the sufferer just compounds the pain and stress of daily living. This book will enlighten your awareness, understanding, and ability to exercise compassion and be effective. It actually is a must-read for those who live with and/or treat individuals living with chronic pain. The author is very knowledgeable and thorough. This is an excellent introduction to the topic and the only user-friendly book about the real thing that I have come across thus far. And, I live with someone who has a chronic pain condition."},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"We all want to project a healthy visage to the world, but a very strange thing happens when chronic hidden pain wears down our insides without necessarily manifesting itself on the outside. Some of us pretend to be our outsides, and often that leads to despair. Some of us may feel we have to justify our illness, our appearance, our emotional balance and that can lead to bitterness. Carol Sveilich has given our insides a voice and a face, mediums of expressions we may have suppressed. She has, therefore, given us hope."},{"Title":"Just Fine: Unmasking Concealed Chronic Illness and Pain","review":"I enjoyed this book because of the suggestions for chronically ill people and also the many people in the book who wrote a personal page or 2 about their experience with chronic illness.

I would suggest this book for anyone who has to deal with a chronic illness."},{"Title":"High Court Case Summaries on Property (Keyed to Cribbet Casebook, Eighth Edition)","review":"In my property class, I have used this study aid extensively. It is great at whittling down the cases into easy-to-understand briefs. However, this does *not* replace actual briefing that every law student should do. Important facts, rules, explanations, and public policy arguments are often missing from the HCCS briefs. In addition, sometimes they miss what professors are really seeking in the arguments and sometimes miss the issue entirely. However, if you are looking for a good resource to supplement your own briefing and cut through a lot of the SCOTUS and Circuit Court garble, this is a great purchase.

There aren't enough good books about goblins in this world."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"I looked for this book over three or four years, since my mom bought a copy of the out of print, green-inked version for her sister. (I'm not old enough to have read it in the 1960s of 70s; I kind of wasn't there.) I had a chance to read it, and I looked for it at every booksale I could get to until just two weeks ago when I bought a similar old copy at a used sale. I was not happy with myself for waiting until I already had it to check out Amazon. Still, I'm glad that other people have a chance to read Marian Cockrell's fantasy masterpiece about Mika and Lucy and the goblins. I used to annoy everyone in my house. When someone asked for the butter, I of course would always imitate the burned goblin as I passed it. Thank you for being just about the only place in the world that carries this book! I am sorry I could not give this book a fifteen or sixteen; I would have liked to. If you are looking at this, I urge you: please, please, PLEASE read this book!"},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"I have never been as surprised as when I saw how many people have read Shadow Castle. I have been searching for this book for years. I was beginning to think the book had been in my imagination, even though I knew the story by heart. Finally, I began to use the internet to search for it. Several book companies found old editions for me, but the book was always sold before I had a chance to purchase it. Last summer (1997) I did secure an old edition - the same edition I had read as a child. As soon as I saw the book it felt so familiar - like an old friend!"},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"Shadow Castle was my favorite book for years. I bought my copy from the Scholastic Book Club in 4th or 5th grade, about 38 years ago, and read it over and over until it fell apart. I was captivated by the story of Mica and Gloria, and a love that could last for longer than I could even imagine. Somehow, the book vanished along the way, probably during a family move about 30 years ago. I was crushed by its loss and tried to find another copy, but no one seemed to be able to find it. Meanwhile, I kept finding other writings that reminded me of it: from Plato's &quot;Allegory of the Cave&quot; to &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; to &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;.When I had a daughter 19 years ago, I started trying to find it again, but no library had a copy and every bookstore told me it was out of print. Over the years, I have read &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, and the &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; to her several times. But still I wished I could share &quot;Shadow Castle&quot; with her, as I knew she would love it as I had.Tonight, I logged on to Amazon.com to search for another book, but typed in &quot;Shadow Castle&quot; on a whim. I almost fell off my chair when I realized the book was truly available and that I was not alone in my search. After reading all of the reviews to my (now 19-year-old) daughter, I realized this book has a mysterious quality of disappearing once someone becomes attached to it. So I have ordered two copies, one for me and one for my daughter. Hopefully, at least one of them will still be found when she has children of her own to pass the story on to. I look forward to that, and am grateful to Amazon for reprinting this wonderful book, and allowing Mica, Gloria, Lucy, Bluebell, and all the rest to live again."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"One Christmas when I was 8 or 9,Santa brought me a wonderful book---Shadow Castle. I am sure through the years I must have read it 100 times. Today I am 60 years old. Like so many others who have reviewed this book, my copy disappeared, and I have searched and searched for a replacement. Just on a chance, I typed in the name on amazon.com,and there it was. Those who have tried to find this book know the feeling that I had after all those years of serious searching.And the book is just as imaginative and romantic as it was when I was a little girl. The first thing I looked for was the picture of Robin and Bluebell. It is just as I remember it. The wonderful ending where the shadows move around is still so excititng. To think that a thousand years and seven days have gone by. What a love story! I shall read it 100 times more, and those times shall be even better because there are grandchildren to read it to."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"I had a dream about &quot;Shadow Castle&quot; yesterday night. This was my most absolute favorite/treasured childhood book but tragically, I lost it. For years, I thought about this book and I missed it so much. I had forgotten the title of the book. Prompted by my dream, I went on-line yesterday to amazon.com and I first typed &quot;Enchanted Castle&quot;. After briefly reading some of the reviews, I knew this wasn't the book. I was a bit disappointed but undaunted. My next guess was to type &quot;Shadow Castle&quot;. I was sure this would be the wrong title as well. To my shock and amazement, I started reading some of the reviews and saw names like, &quot;Bluebell&quot;, &quot;Robin&quot; and &quot;Gloria&quot;. It all came back to me--flooding my memory not only with the details of the book, but the feelings I felt as a 12 year old girl when I read this wonderful magical enchanting book! It had the PERFECT elements of romance, fantasy, hope and excitement. The characters were SOOOO real--I know I'm gushing but it's because I'm so excited about finding this treasure of a book. Read it and you'll know what I'm talking about! I want to thank the reviewers who mentioned some of the details of the book as well as the characters' names--I wouldn't have known this was the book without the information!"},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"I am so happy to see this back in print. Like many, I have the Scholastic editiion with the gorgeous cover picture of Gloria in pink and Mica under a tree. Even the description of the book in the Scholastic Books catalogs was memorable! I read and read this book so many times that finally a teacher gave it to me. I too had a ring with a little green stone, and a &quot;cave&quot; (really just a funny growing bush) in the backyard. But the stories lose nothing with age-- there is subtle, quaint humor and truth of human behavior throughout. As I approach my mid thirties I often think of Gloria looking in the mirror... and the story of Bluebell and the goblins really sticks with me. How Robin said that that goblin hadn't looked one little bit like his Bluebell! All the choices made throughout are as rich as those in the Harry Potter books-- characters are tested for loyalty, must choose whether or not to be mortal-- and the &quot;framing story&quot; is as good as the individual tales. This is my all-time number one favorite."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"In 1968, my mother bought me a copy of this book---a slender paperback printed and illustrated in green ink. I loved the book, and thirty years later, read the story to my little girl, who LOVED it. Unfortunately, my original copy is yellowed and brittle, and I was reluctant to let my daughter handle its fragile pages as often as she wished.Imagine my delight when this wonderful book was reprinted. The new version has all the old illustrations, but the ink is black, not the original green. The color illustration from the jacket of the paperback is reprinted inside the new version, but in black and white. Despite these minor changes, I am thrilled to have this old favorite back again.A bit of the plot: a young girl named Lucy meets a kind, but rather mysterious young man named Michael, who tells her the story of Mika, a fairy Prince who falls in love with a mortal woman. This book contains all of the usual elements in a traditional fairytale---a princess abducted by an unpleasant suitor, goblins, a dragon, enchantments, battles between the forces of good and evil---but it is very different from the impersonal stories in typical fairytale books. Marian Cockrell's characters are vivid and unforgettable, and her story is magical, entertaining, and even humorous in parts.Give a copy to an eight year old that you love. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"I first read Shadow Castle when I was just a little girl around 8 or 9 years old. I checked it out of the school library time and time again. Once I kept it out a very long time and was very tempted to keep it, but I felt guilty. It would just be too selfish to keep such a wonderful book to myself. This book has all the classic elements of fantasy literature, but it is much more than just a fairy tale. I was drawn into the story from the moment the little dog, Flumpdoria, appeared until the sweet, romanic ending. Shadow Castle made me a fan of the fantasy genre, and I have been ever since; but I don't think I have ever encountered a book that was any better. After becoming an adult, I remembered my love for this book and tried to find it, but there was no trace of it. I even scoured used book stores, in the hopes of finding it there, but all in vain. Imagine my surprise when 30 years later, I typed it into Amazon.com and there it was - just like magic. Thanks to Amazon.com I now have this wonderful book again. I even bought multiple copies to give to children of friends and relatives. It is truly a book to inspire imagination in the hearts of all children (and adults) who read it."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"I have been looking for this book for a long time now,and I wasso happy to see that it was back in print.I got my very well-loved copy at a book fair when I was in grade school,and it hasbeen my favorite book(aside from \\"the last unicorn\\")I ordered it just recently from amazon,and I started reading itright away....it was like finding a long-lost childhood friend.I would have given this book 10 stars if I could have."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"When I was a child my parents used to go to Auctions. They picked up this book there as a used book. I must have read that book at least 50 times after they purchased it. I even took it to college. When I first started teaching, I read it aloud to my class. The book was stolen. Fortunately, my librarian found another copy. I read it to my next class and it too was stolen. Now, 21 years later I found it and have read it to two more classes, but now I lock it up so it can't be stolen. Both of my daughters love it too. What a great tribute to a beautifully written and absorbing story. I think it is the book which made me a fantasy reader today. Thank you Marian Cockrell!"},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"I also bought my copy from the Scholastic Book Club in 5th grade, about 38 years ago, and read it over and over until I lost it or it just disapeared. I was so captivated by the story of Mica. The book vanished about 30 years ago. I was heart broken by its loss and tried to find another copy, but no one ever seemed to be have it. When I finally got a computer and went on the internet I searched every so often to find it again, but no library had a copy and no one ever heard of it.Finally, I logged on to Amazon.com and typed in \\"Shadow Castle\\" on a whim.

Well imagine my surprise when I opened this enchanting tale from my past. My mom had found it and I was able to read the adventure and romance again, just like when I was little. I love it.

I am thrilled to find it available again. Though I still have my well-worn original copy, I am buying copies for children I know who would love this book. Don't miss out on the adventure. Share it with your children."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"My older sister received Shadow Castle for Christmas about thirty yeears ago. She was a real book-worm and she, as so many other reviews have mentioned, read it over and over again, until it fell apart. I read it, as well, when I got old enough, but by then it had no cover and the pages were falling out of the binding. The wonder of discovering a cave that led to a previously unknown world, the mystery of the shadows of absent loved ones flickering on the walls, the captured goblins who had to serve as door-knobs, the silent mis-treated servant of the astonishing princess, and the goblin dust concealed in the prince's ring... these were the things that enchanted my sister and so many others. But, I was never as devoted to reading as my sister and even though I greatly enjoyed the book, I did not love it as she did. Then, when she got married and moved away, she never thought to take any of her old books with her. A few years ago, she started looking for Shadow Castle again, for her daughters. No one in my family could remember the last time it had been seen and she began searching used book-stores and libraries, but to no avail. Again, like so many others have mentioned doing. Recently, my husband has been searching for computer books on the internet, and as a kind of test of the comprehensiveness of the cataloguing system, I typed in Shadow Castle. I was so surprised to find it. I had to order it right then and send it to my sister's address. I can't wait to hear from her. (I ordered a copy for myself, also.) As I read the reviews that others have written, I had to cry, because their love of this book is so like my sister's.

Imagine finding out that two of your favorite authors are the same person! Anyway, I was so thrilled to finally own it but didn't want to keep it to myself that I began reading it to my 10-year-old son as a ritual before bedtime. A ritual that didn't last long, I must say.

In one of our many moves my copy was lost and I was devastated. My next encounter with it was when my daughters were in the first and third grade. We were at the Marin county library and there it was. They too fell in love with all the wonderful characters. They begged me to copy the beautiful drawings onto their bedroom walls. So we wound up with fairies and castles on the walls for the next five years until we moved. Since the book was from the library we were not able to keep it but we made a photocopy and read it until it was so worn you couldn't make it out. I then spent 30 years looking for another copy and was so delighted to find it on your website. Now my granddaughters each own a copy and it is becoming a favorite with yet another generation. The drawings now adorn several other little girls' bedrooms and are favorites with everyone who sees them. The story is so beautiful and the characters so believable.

Like other reviewers have noted, it was an instant favorite which I read again and again. It had everything: love, gentleness, and integrity, as well as suspense, revenge, and human stupidity and preconceptions. When I had a child of my own, I started searching for this book to share both the story and a piece of my own childhood. It was as if the book had vanished like the Shadows on a rainy day! For 25 years, I checked in every used bookstore, every children's library section, to no avail. Then, just before Christmas, I typed in the name and found it was back in print! I included a copy with my Christmas order, and I sat down and read it cover to cover the afternoon it arrived. The magic is still there, right along side the goblin dust. Now it will wait patiently in my bookcase until I have a grandchild to share it with. And I am thinking about re-naming the dog Flumpdoria."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"I was so happy to see that this booked touched so many other reviewers lives the way it did mine when I was just a little child. Just as the castle in the story, this book simply vanished for awhile with only the shadows of my dearest memories recalling the magical events of the classic tale. Then one day I inquired about the title and magically it appeared again. I read the story to my wife and must say it has not lost any of it's child like fascination. Also there were a few of the stories lines that whether intentional or not had me laughing so hard I had tears streaming down my face.

This summer vacation I plan to share this wonderful story with my two daughters (ages 11 and 14) as we will read aloud together the enchanted pages, made even more magical by the pages having been darkened by time.

I've kept my well-used copy to read to my children when I have them. I liked the story-telling of adventure and romanmce without gore. And how it incorporated several stories that were connected. And I remember when it ended that I wanted to read more. If you come across it get it. Its worth keeping."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"As I read some of the reviews, I was struck by the many descriptions of a beloved, taped-up copy that disappeared. My copy of this wonderful book is a beloved, taped-up copy that mysteriously appeared in the attic when I was a child. It's enough to make me check the doorknobs for goblin faces.Simply put, this book is a magical fairy tale. Like many readers I first read it as a child and loved it, but I still read it occasionally at the ripe old age of 25. Reminiscent of many great children's books, it is nonetheless unique. I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone, regardless of age. I am thrilled to see it back in print and I don't doubt that it'll be in a few Christmas stockings this year."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"I also read this book years ago over and over again. Thought I would go online tonight to see if would be listed. Thought I would search the library of congress, but guess what? After reading the reviews I know that this wonderful book is still available. It is a wonderful sad, but beautiful book for any girl getting ready to go through puberty and loves a sappy romance."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"I read this book when I was 8 and was so greatly impacted by it that I decided then and there, at that tender age, that my first daughter would be named Gloria in honor of the main character of the book. It is a fabulous story, extremely original, well written, mesmerizing. I loved it and still do."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"Like everyone else, I've searched for years, including amazon.

It's a magical world after all!If you haven't read it, give yourself a present you will treasure the rest of your life."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"Like so many other reviewers of this book, I too read it when I was 10 and have never forgotten its magic. To my deep regret, I somehow lost my well-read Scholastic Book Club edition. But Shadow Castle left such an indelible impression on me that I continued to look for it anywhere and everywhere I thought I might find it, even going so far as to research Scholastic Books at the library, all in vain. Then when I'd lost all hope of ever finding it again, a miracle happened - my sister Patty discovered it at a garage sale and bought it for me for a quarter! (I think that's what I paid more than 30 years ago but I swear I'd have paid a hundred dollars just to have it in my personal collection again to savor anew.) It was one of the nicest presents I ever received (thanks, Tricia!) And now I can keep my treasured copy safe while purchasing reprints for friends (young and old) who I know will love this Brigadoonesque story of fairies and and eternal love as much as I do. Thanks, Amazon.com!"},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"I like many of the other reviewers here loved Shadow Castle as a child. I started reading it when I was about 7...and read it again and again. I loved the enchantment, the romance. The characters seemed so alive-- like they could walk right out of the book. I would completely lose myself in the book whenever I opened it. I don't know when or how I lost it, but I have been looking for it for years. Several months ago, I was reminiscing with a friend over lunch and mentioned my all time favorite book \\"Shadow Castle.\\" I told him that I did not remember any of the plot and only remembered the name. At that point, I was not even sure that I had the name right because it seemed that no one had ever heard of it. He suggested that I check the Internet and I told him that I had over and over as well as looking for it in every antique and rare book store I came upon. I almost cried when I came home that night and typed Shadow Castle into this site and found that it had been reprinted (and with extra chapters no less).I loved the original book (mine was in green type print also) so I am probably somewhat prejudiced, but I have to say that I was disappointed in the extra chapters in the new copy. I found the Flame story to be gory and somewhat disturbing. I think that it might scare small children. I also found that some things had to be written or explained twice-- once in the added chapter and once where it had originally been in the book.Don't get me wrong. When I found a used copy and reread it, I was so moved that I cried. I love this book. I love the illustrations. I cannot wait to share it with my children (my friend from lunch is reading it now). But if you have the opportunity to hold out for the older version, I as a person who has been cherishing and looking for this book for decades would suggest doing it. No matter what the version you can get, do not pass up an opportunity to read this timeless and beautiful book."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"I was 9years old when I discovered this book at my schools library in Seattle. I read and reread and rechecked this book out so many times that I think that I ended up having the book the entire time I attended that school.This book was my escape from a really bad homelife and made me believe that anything can happen.Years past and though I always remembered the basic plot of the story I forgot the title. I spent many a day at many town libraries trying to find this book but never suceeding.I then discovered a book readers message board on ebay and thought \\"why not maybe someone can give me some help on how to find this book\\"Today I browsed the board after not being there for a few weeks and lo and behold someone not only found the title but had a digital scan of the cover. I cried, yes I actually cried. This book had haunted me for so many years.So I ordered a copy from Amazon.com and I'm furiously going to save money to acquire a first edition hardbook copy to pass on to my sons children.This book is a timeless fairy tale that from reading over reviews has touched so many lives. My personal thanks to you Mrs. Cockrell for helping a severely sad child find some brightness in her day.!!!"},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"My elder sister first introduced me to Shadow Castle when I was about 5 or 6 years old. Both of us enjoyed reading it to our younger sister, also. All of us have been enchanted ever since we first read it, nearly 35 years ago! I have been searching since a teenager for a copy, since ours was lost during one move or another, and have been disappointed until now! Thank you, Amazon, for finding this book and making it available to introduce to a new generation of fantasy readers! This book has inspired my sisters and I to a lifelong love of fantasy--the wonderful tale of mysterious castles, goblins, dragons, and royalty will certainly encourage and delight new readers everywhere! Now I know I can &quot;die happy&quot; since I have a new copy of Shadow Castle!"},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"What a pleasure to see this charming children's chapter book back in print. It was a favorite of mine when I was grade-school age, and an old, taped-up and battered copy still sits on on my bookshelf. In this tale, the lives and adventures of a family of fairies and half-fairies are paraded before the eyes of Lucy, a little human girl who has wandered into the borderlands of their world. A mysterious young man named Michael takes Lucy to a deserted castle where the shadows of past inhabitants can be seen on the walls of a tower room. As Lucy watches the shadows move about, Michael identifies each figure, and recounts their adventures of long, long ago.The stories of the fairy princes and princesses, and their human and non-human relatives and associates, are told a simple but descriptive prose that young readers should find appealing. For children still a little bit young for the vocabulary of Harry Potter, but too old for Dr. Seuss, this is a perfect read. The illustrations are delightful as well--how I loved the pictures of beautiful Princess Meira and her friend, the dragon Branstookah!"},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"The expanded edition of &quot;Shadow Castle&quot; is a must-read for any fan of the book. This edition includes several never-before-published chapters about Robin's kidnapping by the Goblins and about Princess Flame who meets Mika five hundred years into the Enchantment. It's a pity that these chapters were edited out of the original book because they help to round out the book by showing the more adventurous side of Mika and by filling in some missing years. This edition won't disappoint old and new fans."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"This compelling fantasy is back in print after many years, and would make a great gift to any 7-11 year old. It was my mother's favorite growing up, then mine, and I have this expanded edition to my 8 year old niece who says it is better than Harry Potter!"},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"I read this book when I was about 10 and then it disappeared. Since I couldn't remember the name of the title it took me about 3 weeks of typing in every key word I could think of and had just about given up when I found it again. I think this is one of the best children's books ever with great characters and plot and just seems timeless! I know my niece will enjoy it as much as I did and still do and I'm so glad it's back in print."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"I have loved this book since my parents bought it used when I was a young child. I have always loved to read and I have read this book SO many times, yet it never gets old. I am so very excited to see this book back in print since my parents sold my copy in a yard sale when I was away at college (without asking me first!). I can hardly wait to share it with my children. I know they will love it just as much as I do!"},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"I have been looking for this book on and off for close to 35 years. At times I wondered whether I had only been dreaming about Mika and Gloria and Robin and the shadows. The book seemed to never have existed. Yesterday a friend was mentioning that she had recently ordered a long out-of-print book from Amazon.com, so I decided to type in the name to see what would happen. I am so happy I could cry! I can't wait to read it again, and to share it with all of the children in my life as well as some adult friends of mine who have never even heard of it. This is truly a prayer answered; a miracle come true."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"Thirty years ago I read a wonderful paperback called Shadow Castle-over and over and over again. It was everything a good fairy tale was supposed to be: funny, suspenseful, fanciful, and with the forces of good and evil battling it out in true storybook fashion. I remember that the heroines were much more resourceful than in many of the old fairy tales I had read; none of that standing about and screaming for them when the dragon came. No, they often were the ones who came up with innovative solutions. I loved it! When I gave the book away in a fit of childish largesse, I almost instantly regretted it. But short of resorting to bully tactics, I wasn't getting it back. So, for thirty years, I have been looking for this treasure and am beyond excited to find it in hardback! It will go proudly next to all of my Harry Potter books, and I think it can hold its own."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"When I was 10 (26 years ago) I came across Shadow Castle in the school library and ended up falling in love with it and reading it over and over again. It was wonderful! Then one day the school library had a book sale. I saw Shadow Castle in the pile but didn't have enough money to buy it. The regular librarian was gone - she would have held it for me. How I regretted that day! As the years have passed the memory of the story line has faded, but I remember that it was my all time favorite book and I would ALWAYS keep searching for it. In fact, for the past 26 years I have been searching for Shadow Castle. You have no idea how wonderful it is to finally have found it!

Thank you for bringing it back for all us to share with others."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"I read this book 31 years ago (at age 10) and was so moved by it that I wrote Marian Cockrell to request a sequel, unbeknownst to my family. What a great tale this is of a magical land, filled with fantasy, adventure, romance, and suspense. It is well written and deeply engrossing, grabbing even the attention of the most casual reader.

It's characters were so vivid to me I consider them true childhood friends. When my sister admitted to owning the only copy in our family and to being unwilling to part with it since it is one of her all-time favorites as well, we set out on a mission to find a copy for me. We used every resource we could think of, including used bookstores, antiquarian dealers, estate sales, libraries of all sizes and shapes: all to no avail.About 3 years ago, in desperation, she photocopied hers for me at a local copy shop (violating all sorts of copyright laws, I'm sure!) so I could share the story with my children. The final chapter to this saga was written about ten minutes ago when my husband said &quot;honey, I just found the coolest site...&quot; and we put in its title &quot;just for grins and chuckles&quot; -- I began crying when it popped up as a 1997 republication, and laughing when I began reading all the other reviews: I am not alone, and I never was! We have all shared a timeless book, and many of us have endured frustration and crazy looks from those who have not been lucky enough to read it for themselves, when we have tried to obtain an elusive copy for ourselves.I am overjoyed and humbled by this morning's events!

Now, at 20, I've had 6 copies of it; every time I lose one, I stumble across another. The story is magical, filled with fairies, princesses, and dragons. The characters are gifted with a subtle humor, and just a touch of reality that draws you in. And the very idea that this might one day happen to you, just like it did to Lucy, makes it even more beloved a tale. I keep reading it in hopes that one day I really will look like Bluebell!

There is no lettering or picture on the cover, and my book had small dents all along the edges of the cover.

The illustrations in this edition look like they are scanned, or photocopied.

We both ordered copies, and an extra one for our niece, to continue the tradition as have many of the people who've reviewed this book. It has all the elements needed for a true fairy tale: fairies, dragons, goblins, and magic. But it also has an amazing sense of sanity often missing in children's stories. Fighting is a last resort, patience will win through, never judge things too quickly... A bored fairy prince explores the world and rescues a human princess who cannot go to fairyland for a thousand years. Living in a castle built to bridge both worlds, they have children who go through adventures of their own.

I was immediately captivated by the story and also the lovely heroine Gloria. I vowed that my first daughter would be named after that character.I lent the book to a friend who subsequently lost it. I was heartbroken. I was truly lost without that book. It was my favorite and I re-read it constantly. Eventually I gave up my search, only to resume when I gave birth to my first daughter, Gloria. I wanted her to see the book from which I took her name. It took me years to find another copy, and I only did so with the assistance of some kind gentleman who worked for the Philadelphia Inquirer.I immediately shared it with my Gloria, who was also nine, just as I was when I first read the book. Now -that- copy is lovingly worn, as we had read it many times over. It was my intention to give Gloria the new copy of the book, but I have yet to part with it. I feel the book really belongs to her, but I don't want to lose it! So I was so thrilled to see that Amazon offers this book.

What a great love story and story of the passing generations! I was online looking for the Steven R. Boyett book ARIEL and decided to check one more time to see if I could find SHADOW CASTLE and lo and behold.... I couldnt be happier!"},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"Plot: Some basic information: this was my favorite, favorite book when I was a child. I would read it at least once a year, sometimes more. I never knew anyone else who had even heard of the book or the author. As an adult, I've found that there's a small group of us who love this book--apparently enough to produce a reissue, with two additional stories. So, the review is mostly about the two new stories, since it's a given that the rest of the book is 5*.Characters: One of the new stories is about Robin and Mika when Robin was a toddler. It gives a little more backstory to Robin's interest in goblins, as he is abducted by them, and Mika has to go to the rescue. The second new story is about a descendant of Meira and Julian, Princess Flame, and her recalcitrant genie, and a fire fairy we meet in the Robin/Mika story. The first story is mostly action; the second is mostly romance, although the second story does introduce witches and genies, who have been absent from the book until now.Writing style: There are some phrases in this book that are so familiar to me that when I read them, they just echo, because I'm repeating them as I read them. The new writing is similar, but of course, it's new and not so well-known, so doesn't have that same reverberation. Nonetheless, the new segments aren't a let-down.Audience: Me. Other than me, girls from the age of five on up (though the younger ones might have to have some help with the reading. If they can sound out Flumpdoria, they're good). My son liked the book as well when he was a preteen, though he would never admit it.Wrap-up: I think one reason I loved the book as a youngster was the beautiful illustrations. They are still there in this edition, for which I'm grateful. The pictures of Mika and Gloria at their wedding and Robin and Bluebell alone are worth the price of the book. I still have my old copy; now the new one sits next to it. 5/5*"},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"I read this when I was 9 or 10.

It was a school book, so I never owned a copy and had, indeed, forgotten the title, though not Prince Mika, Gloria, Flumpdoria, Bluebell, Robin and Meira. When the image of the book came up in suggested titles, though, I immediately remembered it. It is one of those books that completely creates its enchanted world--the stories are touching, surprising and funny all at once. For girls who love stories with magic in them, the book hits just the right notes over and over again. While it can be enjoyed by younger children, I'd peg it for 8 and up as I think older readers will enjoy the comedy and romance more.Anyway, I ordered it and gave it to my 10-year-old daughter for Christmas. With all the wonderful princess novels now out there, I wondered if the book would weave the same spell on my daughter as it had on me. She was promptly ensorcelled.

I'm a softy, true, but it made me cry. I came to the Internet hoping Marian Cockrell had written another children's book, perhaps (I dearly hoped) a sequel. Maybe I'll buy the expanded version instead.This treasure of a book is perfect for your grade-schooler who loves fairies, princesses, or magic. It's also perfect for the wide-eyed adult who's still a child at heart and loves those things as well."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"I read this book as a child and searched for years for a copy to give my daughter. It is a wonderful fairy tale, with very good moral values. Share this with your kids!"},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"First loved this story 53 years ago and have been looking for it ever since. So glad that it was reprinted. I enjoyed the expanded, but the first one was not and loved it anyway."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"i'm thrilled that this book is back in print..my sister and i have fought over our copy for years...our kids have loved it also...they need to write more books like this"},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"Imagine my surprise when I decided to once again try to locate this book and found that Amazon was now carrying it. Just over a year ago, when I discovered Amazon, I was told that it was out of print. I thought all was lost...but once again I will own the book the was my all-time favorite.My tale is very similar to the reviews listed on-line. A friend shared the book with me in 1968. I borrowed the book so often, that she told me to keep it. I read the book hundreds of time. When I went off to college, my parents sold the book in a yard-sale. Imagine my dismay when I found out what they had done (and they sold my collectible record albums too). Since that time I have searched off and on over the years, to no avail. When I have mentioned the book to others, no one has heard of the book. Now I will buy it for myself and share it with friends and love ones. I can't wait for the book to arrive.For those of you who are considering purchasing the book, you will also experience an unforgettable story that will enthrall the young reader."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"I originally got this book in elementary school in the 1960s. I ordered it through the school from a paperback book club. I must have read it 100 times and could practically recite it by heart. I used to think about it before I drifted off to sleep at night.When I married and moved to another continent, I took the book with me, among college texts, reference books and a very few favorite adult novels. Three years later, I returned home hastily, without many of my possessions, including the book. After a few years, my thoughts drifted back to it and I tried to get another copy, only to find that it was out of print. No one that I asked had ever heard of it. I looked for the book in Salvation Army stores, yard sales, and used bookstores whenever I passed one. I even wrote a letter to the publisher! You can imagine my surprise when I did a search here at Amazon and discovered it was back in print! AND that there were other people who had been as touched by the book as I was!Rereading it after so many years helped me to figure out what is so remarkable about the book. It is fantastically imaginative, yet uses simple language and lacks detail. In a way that no other book has since, it allowed me, as a child reader, to use my imagination to round out the story and fill in the details. The book requires the reader to picture things in her own mind's eye that are not completely explained or described in the book. For that reason, it is a living, highly personal book, and that may explain why readers develop a life long attachment to it.Now that the book is back in print, share it with any child you know.

I wanted to let my younger sister read the book, but none of my local libraries carried it, or knew how to find it. I'm 26 now, a GUY... a registered nurse in law school... but I haven't forgotten the magic contained in the pages of this special book. I want to reread this book... it had me in tears when I finished it... My eyes ate up the text and I was always looking for a sequel.

I am an avid Science Fiction/Fantasy reader to this day (I'm 41 years old) and my very first fantasy was Shadow Castle. I give this wonderful story credit for so much, that I cannot put it into words. Thank God my fiance was looking over my shoulder at the monitor and asked me to type in &quot;you know, that book you've been looking for that you read when you were a kid...&quot; at the Amazon search site.

Unfortunately, it was also my older sister's favorite book, and when we left the nest she had seniority rights over the book. I have been searching for my own copy since my sister left home 20 years ago. I am especially fond of this fantasy tale because the central figure is a strong little girl with an adventuresome spirit. Her courage and curiosity more than compensate for the traditional tale of romance retold by the prince. A hands down winner."},{"Title":"shadow castle","review":"I can't believe this book has finally been re-published! Reading this book is one of the happiest memories of my childhood.

But I seriously have issues with neighbors and this book does nothing to help solve those issues. You will get a fluff of stories upon stories about how others have it bad. Then the solution for noisy neighbors will be to buy a set of earplugs and turn up your tv. I couldn't believe the book recommended that if the noise from neighbors comes from a teenager/college kid holding a house party -- to pay that kid to not have parties there. That's promoting extorsion and it's bribery. Do you really think once you start paying a kid not to have parties at his house, he/she won't ask for more money?! This book is STUPID, STUPID, STUPID unless you just love reading about how others have it more worst off -- like the senior citizen who kills his neighbors because they wouldn't allow him to have any nights rest with all the noise they made."},{"Title":"Outwitting the Neighbors: A Practical and Entertaining Guide to Achieving Peaceful Coexistence with the People Next Door","review":"but I had to do something, my neighbors are so noisy...

I would highly recommend this book for anyone with neighbors."},{"Title":"Outwitting the Neighbors: A Practical and Entertaining Guide to Achieving Peaceful Coexistence with the People Next Door","review":"I have a copy of this book which I picked up years ago. It is good for minor problems but not in dealing with major legal issues. Some examples of what we did from learning from the book:We used it as reference when living in an apartment complex. When the young people living in the apartment behind us (sharing a kitchen wall) started to party in the kitchen, we put a boom box on the kitchen table and cranked up the electric organ playing fire and brimstone AM radio religious station. It drove them out of the kitchen as no one wants to play quarters and smoke while listening to a reverend yell over the radio about the perils of hell.Same apartment had an idiot guy and later couple living downstairs from us. The guy downstairs used to fall asleep with his tv/DVD player on full blast so then the DVD menu sounds would repeat over and over again. We'd jump off the bed to the floor to rattle his ceiling to wake him up and on occasion would play \\"It's a Small World\\" at full blast on the boom box pointing down to the floor until he got up and turned off the tv.He would also go away for the weekend and leave his alarm clock on for a 5:30am wake up but that was easy to solve as I would go to the power meter and kick off his entire apartment power for one minute to cancel the clock. I bet he wondered why the power always went out when he wasn't home.Then he got a lady friend to move in (off lease of course). For a while it -was- fun to listen to their amorous and freak-like bedroom activities but then he became a drunk and started to fight with her. So we put the local police phone number on speed dial and any time we heard fighting we would yell: \\"What is the police number again?\\" If they would shut up, we wouldn't call but if they kept it up or she yelled \\"Don't hit me!\\" we'd dial up the cops. They finally moved out after he was arrested twice for domestic violence.We had some other lazy woman who left garbage bags out for weeks by the side of her door on our floor. We moved the bags in front of her door and even hung ones with handles on the door knob. She thought it was her boyfriend's duty to throw out the trash but he only came around one a week or every other week. Because we kept moving them in front of her door, she took to storing the bags in her storage closet and stinking up ours. We then dropped a letter to the office about it and that stopped quickly.This book helped us understand different techniques to deal with people and also what -not- to do. Sometimes people \\"claim\\" parking spots in apartment complexes without assigned parking slots if they have lived there longer than you. Respect them and walk the extra 10' from a different spot- it is not worth the hassel. And if they move, then swoop in and claim that spot. It is really simple."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"so sorry that i accidentally got my loaner book wet and had to buy a replacement. the cost for this product was a little much for such an &#34;old&#34; book, but was sure glad to find it so that I could get it replaced!"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"The audiobook is read professionally.

I read sixty pages to read the conclusion. Also, George Eliot(pen name for Mary Anne Evans) has a way with words that is amazing. She uses specific words that give the reader an exact image. Though the sory was great, George Eliot needed to describe the characters greater detail.

Overall, I wouldn't say I hated the book, but I wouldn't recommend it to anybody but the most PATIENT reader."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This is the first book I read by George Eliot and it may well be the last. I thought it would serve as a good intro into her work but the novel was far too simple in prose and spirit. While there is nothing wrong with the story of spiritual rebirth that's all it adds up to - a story. For me the definition of great literature is not just a good story but something which takes advantage of the art of writing by plumbing into the heart of humanity and translating it so the reader can feel what has been written. To put it simply, great literature can not be translated into a movie without losing what made it so great. This book can be easily translated into a movie as there is not much going on outside of the story. No deep character analysis, no discourse on anything really outside physical perception. From the plot the book should have been a very emotional read but it wasn't. Eliot's prose wouldn't allow it. She really serves as an outsider looking on these characters and situations rather then someone intimately familiar with the emotions and thoughts which make up the themes of the book. So, in turn, I felt like an outsider reading it. This would make a good movie where the story and physical emotion are the most important aspects, but as a novel it doesn't do the craft justice. In terms of English Victorian era literature Silas Marner just can't compare to novels by the likes of Thomas Hardy and Emily Bronte."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This book is as sentimental as &quot;Middlemarch&quot; is complex. I found that the long introductory sections made for a difficult set up to the primary situation. The narrative involving the actual bond between Marner and the child were condensed and telegraphed so quickly that the reader is forced to take the author's word that there was an attachment. As a result, the emotional climax feels like a tear-jerker rather than an honest resolution of the characters' lives. It gives the impression of a 19th century &quot;Afterschool Special.&quot;"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I tried to download Audible.com 's download manager -- but it kept stalling on the manager.exe and download.exe for some unknown reason.

I was very pleasantly surprised. In a few places, the language is a little tedious. Mostly, it is read with a lively colorful and varying voice, that brings the novel vibrantly alive. That is saying a lot since it is piece of writing that is almost 150 years old."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"If you're required to read this book in high school, then kudos to your teacher for introducing you to George Eliot.Having said that, when I was in high school, I wouldn't have appreciated George Eliot either. She was a master crafter of literature, choosing words thoughtfully and laying patiently the foundation of characters, observations, storylines to form a more perfect novel. In other words, to most high school readers of classic literature, her books can be boring.But wait at least 10 years, pick up her works again, and find yourself pulled into stories that simultaneously take you back to provincial Victorian England while portraying the lives of characters who could be your friends, family, yourself.Silas Marner is a wonderful precursor to Eliot's Middlemarch. The story focuses on the main title character, of course, following this sad little weaver from the time he was a respected member of his community to the moment he was cast out to his wandering and settling in sleepy Raveloe where he seeks to be left alone. Betrayed by his best friend and rejected by his fellow worshippers at Lantern Yard, Silas loses faith in God and people. He means to live the rest of his life in Raveloe, shielded from the God who failed him and from people who would only disappoint and hurt him.He passes the next 15 or so years of his life, shunning society who responds to this odd-looking stranger by alienating him. Silas finds solace in weaving, weaving, weaving, accumulating gold for his work, and transferring his love to these gold pieces.Silas' core is shaken again by a shocking event, and he is in danger of soon dying a broken man. He is restored when a little girl with golden curls toddles into his life. He comes to believe the gold he lost came back to him in this \\"golden-haired replacement.\\" And from then, Silas is slowly drawn back to life, back to society, back to faith in God. The little orphan he saves and names Eppie ends up saving him.Sounds like a simple almost sappy story, no? Under George Eliot's pen, it's a wonderful telling of faith (in God, in people, in life) lost and found because of unconditional love for a little child. But it's also much more than that. The story explores themes of alienation, societal rejection of otherness and being different, questions of where one fits in society and how that role is interdependent on one's participation in society as well as its acceptance of one on what terms, love of course as a restorative panacea, love between a father and his adopted daughter trumping all, and so many different aspects of life and its challenges and rewards.All of these ideas are so expertly presented and turned over, my eyes were sometimes stopped dead in their tracks by a passage that I would then reread several times to appreciate the beauty of its truth and language. I'm about to date myself (I'm currently in my late 30s), but I just had to share one of the most memorable observations I'd read in a long time. It's about Godfrey Cass, a man who seems to have everything, except a child to call his own:\\"Meanwhile, why could he not make up his mind to the absence of children from a hearth brightened by such a wife? Why did his mind fly uneasily to that void, as if it were the sole reason why life was not thoroughly joyous to him? I suppose it is the way with all men and women who reach middle age without the clear perception that life never *can* be thoroughly joyous: under the vague dulness of the grey hours, dissatisfaction seeks a definite object, and finds it in the privation of an untried good.\\"I don't think George Eliot is saying here that Godfrey is silly for wanting a child when he has everything else a man could possibly want. It is the idea of many men and women never being able to be truly happy and forever chasing some thing, which they find is lacking in their life at that time, because they're sure that thing will make them happy. This is the classic middle crisis, but it is universal in us all to desire what we can't have and to think our happiness depends on us getting it. It doesn't of course.I say this book is a precursor to Middlemarch because we start to see in this novel George Eliot's beginning of writing novels with distinct townsfolk full of characters as memorable as the main characters -- folks that populate a village and are as recognizable as your kind neighbor, local bartender, neighborhood elder. I'm thoroughly entertained George Eliot's creations here: Mr. Macey, Dolly Winthrop, Squire Cass and his brood, Nancy and Priscilla and their respectable kin.So why did I not give this 5 stars? Honestly, it was too short. Much time was spent on Silas and his life before finding Eppie, but not enough was flushed out in the story after. I loved the chapter when Eliot described how this old bachelor is suddenly befuddled by the two-year-old he's adopted and becoming a father to her. Where does he begin? And when Eppie turns 3 and mischievous, it's hilarious to follow Silas as he tries to discipline his precious...and can't. Those little nuggets are treasured by this newish mom. But it comes to an end too soon and Eppie is next seen as an 18-year-old girl about to embark on her new life.The second part of the book feels hastily completed. Loose ends are tied up; difficult conversations improbably take place and are resolved in one day; Silas' journey to his old life at the former Lantern Yard and back home to Raveloe is rushed; and Eppie's story has its happy ending.Had George Eliot wanted to keep writing to flesh out all these paltry scenes, I would have happily kept reading and delighted to have given this book a 5-star rating."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Don't read the review following this one unless you want all the plot points revealed.If you've read George Eliot before, you know to expect interweaving plot lines, good characterizations and moral themes. This story is shorter than Middlemarch and Mill on the Floss, therefore not as deep in its levels and plot lines, but still absorbing and satisfying.It's the story of a bitter man, older than his years; a young child who changes him, and how their lives are interweaved with the lives of another, wealthy family. It's filled with life: tragedy, comedy, scenes you want to read out loud. George Eliot is a wonderful writer, one who can transport you to the English countryside and to the time period so you feel like you are there, and you always care deeply for the characters.I think very young readers might find feel there are \\"too many descriptions,\\" but I found it very entertaining all the way through. And I love those old-fashioned endings, where you find out what happens to everyone."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner / 0-553-21229-X\\"Silas Marner\\" is a wonderful story of maintaining perspective in life - a tale extremely comparable to Charles Dicken's \\"A Christmas Carol\\". In the height of his youth, when he is healthy, happy, and totally in love, young Silas is betrayed, cast down, and taught the 'lesson' that only the criminal and avaricious get ahead in life. He moves to a new town and abandons any attempt to connect with the society around him, instead focusing on hoarding his wealth and lovingly counting his money nightly. When his precious hoard is stolen, Silas is again crushed, but the arrival of a small \\"angel\\" - a little orphan girl with golden curls - starts him down the long road to redemption.A powerful aspect of this novel is the use of foils and counterparts against the main character as he learns his life lessons. The members of the local nobility live out their seemingly \\"perfect\\" lives unhappily, having not learned the lesson that Silas has learned through his exploitation as a lower-class member of society. By the time the local nobility realize what a treasure Silas' adopted orphan would have been in their barren home, it is too late; only the poor and miserly old man truly understood in time the value of living life for the sake of another.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I think the reader made all the difference.

Making a review of George Eliot's extraordinary oevre is like wandering into the panel lined smoking room of a centuries old men's club, settling into an over stuffed leather easy chair and taking a quantum leap backward...to sentences that actually charm, to pacing that suggests rumination, to the astounding gender explosion of this amazing woman's body of work so finely capturing a man's experience regardless of gender in writer or reader.

In his home-town, Silas Marner is wrongly accused of a heinous murder, forcing the poor weaver to move to Raveloe; there, his life-savings are stolen by a greedy aristocrat. Through this fictional character and his grievances, George Eliot brings tremendous support to the idea that Providence will mend things and make them whole, and that we can survive our trials by trusting in this goodly power. Although the plot develops slowly, it is engaging. You cannot help but sympathize with Silas when his reason for living- his money- is taken from him. He is devastated, and when neighbors come to offer support, he remains speechless. Life seems to have crushed him with its unfairness. It is at this point of despair that Providence intervenes, bringing an orphan girl to Silas' cottage. Silas finds her mother dead in the snow, but still he &quot;had formed no conjectures of ordinary natural means by whihc [the arrival of the girl] could hav ebeen brought about&quot; (115) The little girl, Eppie, transfroms Silas' reclusive life into one full of love and new happiness. Eppie comes to life as she &quot;toddles about&quot; and &quot;clings&quot; to weaver, who receives her affection awkwardly. Eliot shows, through heart-warming descriptions, how fate has blessed Silas by its miracles. Silas learns that the key to contentment is to remain optimistic. He learns the truth of neighbor Winthrop's advice: &quot;. . . isn't there Them as was at the making on us, and knows better and has a better will? And that's all we can be sur eon, and everything else is abig puzzle to me when I think on it&quot; (148)."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"\\"Life is what happens while we're busy making other plans...\\" John Lennon's lyric are words to live by in this hardy Victorian chestnut about a simple miser who finds love at his doorstep one snowy evening.Published in 1861, George Eliot's novel has a reputation for dreary earnestness that kept me away from it for quite some time, until I decided to make an effort at reading all the books I successfully avoided in high school. \\"Silas Marner\\" turned out one of the easier assignments, not only because of its shortness and simplicity, but for Eliot's engaging manner of writing, which feels less wedded to its time than even more famous writers of her generation like Dickens.Marner is a weaver and a kind of social exile who sets up his home and business in the English country town of Raveloe. Not happy but content, he spends his time either working or sleeping, his sole recreation being the counting of his gold coins. All this is suddenly taken away from him, but Silas's misfortune turns out to be a blessing, pushing him out of what had been a rut-like comfort zone.\\"Our consciousness rarely registers the beginning of a growth within us any more than without us,\\" Eliot notes early on in Silas's transformation. \\"There have been many circulations of the sap before we detect the smallest sign of the bud.\\"There's a lot to like about \\"Marner\\" the novel. The title character is a real treasure of literature as Eliot describes him, not because he's particularly exciting so much as because he's so readily identifiable, especially with those of us who are old enough to know disappointment in life. Many reviewers here compare him to Scrooge; Marner is a materialist and a bitter social outcast, but unlike Scrooge he retains a certain palpable sympathy and humanity throughout. This in turn makes the character's journey more compelling.Eliot captures a pastoral vision of English village life that feels absorbing and affecting, even if it is a bit gauzy. Her philosophic asides are marvelously quotable without ever getting in the way of the narrative. Her plot twists are well designed and hardly predictable, at least to me; I was especially impressed by how she dealt with a long-absent antagonist late in the story.But here's an odd criticism for a Victorian novel: It wasn't long enough. That's actually a problem, as the central game-changing transformative act of \\"Silas Marner\\" takes place when the novel's already half-over, and from then on the story speeds toward a spotlessly tidy resolution. The development of Silas's relationship with the others in his village, and with the little girl that changes him, feels rushed.To want more of a book is thin criticism of what is there. Perhaps a solution might be to read it again, for Eliot's ruminations on how people deal with the specter of misfortune, using various designs to try and ward it off, are both deep and charming. Her metaphysics are a trifle muzzy (I'm not sure if she was a Deist or an agnostic; maybe she was both at various times) but her take on the human condition comes across as well-grounded and relevant. She is a keen social critic, but not a blanket one; her take on organized religion manages to be both dubious and positive.In short, this woman with a man's nom de plume is very hard to pigeonhole, which also goes for her nifty novel. To adults like me of a certain age, the title may suggest boring homework assignments thankfully dodged, but \\"Silas Marner\\" is a real treat worth picking up."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is a great classic that tells a wonderful truth. I loved reading about the village and how mysterious it was. George Eliot twines a great story about a lonely man who keeps to himself until a surprise shows up at his house. It was fun and intriguing to watch Silas change and grow along with his suprise. The end is great!"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This is a book I read over and over again. I picked it up the for the first time when I was 15 years old. It was required reading in English class. Being a cynical teenager, I balked at it at first. As the class got into reading it, I was totally taken with the complex story line. I loved it. It is one of the best books I ever read and reread. A few years ago, I mentioned it to an English teacher who jokingly asked me to \\"compare and contrast the moral revelation between Scrooge in a Christmas Carol and Silas Marner\\". Well I replied, Scrooge changed his ways and realized what was important by being confronted with the unlikely encounter with the supernaternal; Silas Marner came to his realization through \\"bad eyesight\\". My answer brought much laughter, which of course was my intention. Read this book and love it."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Like so many other American high- schoolers I with great difficulty went through this work. Years later I subjected one of my children to the same ordeal when she needed to write a book- report. And this because I found then and now, this moral tale of redemptive love to be moving and instructional. For young people and I expect for most readers today the complexity of Eliot's language is an obstacle to be overcome. She writes the kind of sentences the masters of style have been teaching Americans not to write for years. But she writes with great intelligence and intuition, great moral feeling. The story of the weaver unjustly accused of a robbery, who retreats into his own private world and who is later redeemed by his meeting and taking care of an orphan child is one which cannot help but touch the heart. And as Hawthorne said when the heart is touched we begin to be .And this work comes alive with the old codger's care for and love of the orphan child. Like Scrooge the other great scowling isolato of nineteenth century Literature he exemplifies and proves the greatest moral lesson of all, that in loving and caring for other human beings we become human ourselves.Who can make it through the difficult language will find not only a very detailed and convincing description of English village life in the early nineteenth century but also a warm tale of the human heart healing itself through love."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I first read Silas Marner when I was 18 years old, and loved every word. I started reading it again immediately after finishing it! As said in other reviews, perhaps 9th grade is indeed too early because at that age, this older language style is difficult to \\"get into\\" quickly enough to hold their interest. I found myself wrapped in this little town with its odd characters and gossip, and wished I'd lived there. The imagery is so strong and sweet I still refer to the scenery evoked by this novel when I read completely unrelated historical articles! The story itself cannot be called remarkable because it is one of the basic stories about humanity and what matters in life. Yet George Eliot surpasses all others in the telling of it. There is a reason this book is on all the reading lists -- it is a great achievement."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"There are few great novels about people who are basically good and who are, in the end, rewarded for it. I can think of only three others I have read in this genre that had any literary merit: Eliot's ADAM BEDE; Elizabeth Gaskell's CRANFORD; and Oliver Goldsmith's THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD. I can see why SILAS MARNER is usually regarded as a novel to be read by the young, if only because it reinforces values that most of us see as desirable.Granted that Marner starts out as a miser, if only because he is so isolated from the rural community in which he lives. When Marner's small fortune is stolen, a strange thing happens: His neighbors gather closer to him and help him, drawing him out of himself and illuminating the goodness that was always inside of him. Marner's neighbor, Dolly Winthrop -- a poor, inarticulate wheelwight's wife who does everything she can to make Silas a part of the village of Raveloe -- particularly shines through in an excellent supporting role, one of many in the book.When a toddler whose mother dies crawls into Marner's house, the process begins to accelerate as he adopts her. The weaver now has someone to live for; and the love between him and the little Eppie begins to flower.Good seems such undynamic a quality in literature. George Eliot is one of the few writers who can make the tribulations of a good person worthwhile reading. In weaver and his neighbors, Eliot has created an entire community that strives for the greatest good (with the sole exception of Dunsey Cass, who steals Marner's fortune). The best books always make you wonder what happens next; and SILAS MARNER kept me turning the pages, marvelling at my own reactions to what I would once have thought was too simple and flimsy to engage my attention.George Eliot is a writer of many surprises and many surprising strengths. I had approached this book only because I was filling in a gap in my reading. Having read it, I urge anyone to pick up this book if you are young and hope for the best in life -- or come to it, like myself, an adult who has been &quot;nicked by the scythe,&quot; who has forgotten some simple truths about which he needed reminding."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Jan 28 2010 - Melvyn Bragg discussed this novel with leading academics in the UK. See [...] where this can be listened to............SILAS MARNERPublished in 1861, Silas Marner is by far Eliot's shortest and seemingly simplest work. Yet beneath the fairytale-like structure, of all her novels it offers the most focused expression of Eliot's moral view. Influenced by the deconstruction of Christianity pioneered by leading European thinkers including Auguste Comte and Ludwig Feuerbach, Silas Marner is a highly sophisticated attempt to translate the symbolism of religion into purely human terms.The novel tells the story of Silas, a weaver who is thrown out of his religious community after being falsely charged with theft. Silas is embittered and exists only for his work and his precious hoard of money - until that money is stolen, and an abandoned child wanders into his house.By the end of her lifetime, George Eliot was the most powerful female intellectual in the country. Her extraordinary range of publications encompassed novels, poetry, literary criticism, scientific and religious texts. But beneath her fierce intellecualism was the deep convinction that for society to continue, humans must connect with their fellow humans. And it is this idea that forms the core of her writing."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Newspaper readers were invited recently to submit their choices for the greatest works published in the English language. When the choices were totalled, two works by Shakespeare featured in the top ten. Also featured, I was pleased to see, was a novel by George Eliot. Internet users, familiar with her works, will probably guess which of her novels was chosen. For those unfamiliar with her works, the best one to start with is \\"Silas Marner\\", a much shorter one. It is short, it is easy, it even works well in schools (as I can testify), and yet it is undoubtedly a masterpiece.George Eliot sets her 1861 novel in the early decades of the nineteenth century in rural England. Silas Marner is a weaver. In the pattern that life weaves, he usually features as a victim. Because he is unjustly \\"framed\\", he loses his reputation and his betrothed in the town where he grew up. After years working as a weaver and living like a hermit in a rural district then, he is robbed by an unknown thief who uncovers and makes off with the cache of gold guineas Silias keeps under his floor. Happiness and joy come to Silas, however, and at the end of the novel he is told, \\"Nobody could be happier than we are\\".George Eliot tells her tale with a mixture of womanly sympathy, sharp observation, tact, and humour. Her depiction of a long-gone past, and her clear pointing of right and wrong impulses, give the story qualities that are sometimes found in morality plays or in fairy tales. Don't skip over the scenes in the local inn, the Rainbow, where the simple-minded rustics discuss relevant issues, including the existence of ghosts.For those who appreciate hearing good literature read aloud, I recommend the unabridged audio format of \\"Silas Marner\\" where the reader is Andrew Sachs. As you might expect of this fine English actor, who made Manuel from Barcelona so memorable in \\"Fawlty Towers\\", he is especially wonderful in portraying the argumentative, credulous, muddle-headed rustics that foregather at the Rainbow. His reading extends for nearly seven hours."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I use Silas Marner with many of the students I tutor because it so effectively portrays that there are consequences to wrong actions.

I also use Silas Marner to make students aware of their own predispositions toward people who are &quot;different&quot;...people they don't want to know.

The entire thing is practically one long sentence."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"SILAS MARNER/ By George Eliot/ David Campbell Publishers Ltd. *****What is faith? Faith can be something one believes in without knowing if it is really there. In the novel Silas Marner, George Eliot makes clear how a weaver loses faith in God. The weaver [Silas Marner] regains belief when he finds a little girl around the age of two wondering around his cottage. He raises her [Eppie] and becomes very close to her. While raising Eppie, Silas takes her to church to be raised and taught like a Christian. This novel has a great shift when his love for Eppie starts changing his personality. George Eliot describes Silas's as a person with no hope. He describes the lost of devotion when his best friend steals a bag of money from a dying man. His best friend then blames it on him. The decision was left to God; whether or not he was to blame. This method convicted Silas, which is when he decided to loose all his faith. Silas hesitates when he finds out that Eppie is Godfrey's daughter.Sometimes having faith can help people continue their daily activities. This novel is really captivating, and interesting. It can make you understand the different ways in which God protects his children. When Silas was to busy avoiding confrontation with God, God put Eppie on his path. If you are a person in need of finding yourself it would be a great idea to read this novel. It focuses in the struggles one has throughout their lives. The many obstacles one will have to go through to know that at end everything will be alright. Sometimes it helps to know that there is someone waiting for you on the other side. This novel's rating is a five because it captivates the readers mind."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I'm sure there are other good versions of Silas Marner available on CD or audiotape, but I must express my admiration for the reading by Andrew Sachs in an excellent unabrdiged edition of this Victorian classic. I was perhaps fortunate that I was not forced to read this book in high school when I might have found it a chore, so I approached the story with an open mind. Sachs manages beautifully to convey the inner life of Eliot's characters through his acting talent and his choices of slightly differing voices for each individual. A great reading of a great novel."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This is an odd little book, but it's a good one. It's odd because the famous story of the old miser who is redeemed by taking in an angelic little girl to raise doesn't really even begin until half-way through the novel. This was definitely a surprise to me, but it wasn't a bad one. It ends up that there is a lot more to this novel than I thought there would be. In that first half of the novel, George Eliot brilliantly elucidates the fallen nature of both Silas Marner and the community. They're are revealed to be such selfish and sinful people. They are all in the throws of despair, lamenting their plight as humans and questioning a God who placed them in their lives. Eliot is really wonderful at capturing the need of each individual for redemption and also that need in the community as a whole. The individuals are criticized as is the unfair societal structure. Into this fallen world comes the angelic Eppie, and that's when the story really picks up. Eppie is the catalyst of grace offering redemption to Silas and the rest of the community.Silas Marner is really an extraordinary little novel. It's a thoroughly enjoyable book (especially after you get through the first half) with a lot of valid criticism and some hope. It's a really beautiful little classic."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Long ago George Eliot breathed some life into these characters and their world of Raveloe, and if you look in on that place and time through the words on these pages, you'll find that things are still very vibrant there today. \\"Silas Marner\\" lives on because of the outstanding prose style and moral connundrums Eliot lays down as the foundation of her story.Her descriptions of people and places are so beautiful, her command of language so complete, and her style so refreshing, that it makes the world these people inhabit seem more alive and real than the worlds other authors attempt to spin. Her dialogue occasionly lets slip a touch of upper class pride, but overall her characters are expertly drawn, well filled out, and entertaining.The moral underpinnings of the story make it seem like a fable almost, but Eliot fortunately leaves final judgement of her characters up to the reader. Seeing Silas vindicated after so much going wrong for him made this worth the read for me. Despite some of the harsh realities of the class differences depicted, it is pleasant to watch the goings on in a small English town and to see Silas Marner at last catch some breaks and come into his own as a person. Even if it's a little unrealistic, heck, it's a novel so that's part of the fun.The choices we make for ourselves only determine part of our fate, Eliot seems to say with this story. Other things are not up to us, and those happen to us independent of any choices we make. I enjoyed pondering my own fate that way, through the lens of the little world of Raveloe. For such a short book, \\"Silas Marner\\" packs a lot of power in both language and meaning. This was my introduction to the work of George Eliot, and now I look forward to reading some of her other works."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"What can the reader of today find in a story about a weaver, who felt unable to assimilate into society, that he keeps to himself in his cottage? Quite a bit. As we read &quot;Silas Marner&quot; and watch him caress the only thing he has to love, the gold he's hoarded after so many years, we share in his grief when he comes home and sees it's been stolen. And the fact that it was the ne'er-do-well son of one of the town's most important people makes us more sympathetic. For each day, there are so many Silas Marners out there today, men and women who feel they are outsiders and who are victimized by those in a higher social rung. But we learn with Silas the more important meaning of life, when his old stack of gold is replaced by the new....the golden tresses of the child who wonders into this cottage to change his life forever. With rich characterizations, George Eliot creates a story that will move even the hardest heart. But look beyond the surface and see the indictment of the townspeople as well, who forced Silas into the outside, and then who welcome him."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"For any true connoisseur of life's ironies, there can be few finer than the fact that the radical Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot) is chiefly remembered for this completely traditional and eminently conservative tale. We needn't rehearse the elements of the story in detail because virtually every English speaking youth on the planet reads it in school. Just to jog your memory, Silas Marner is a devoutly religious weaver who is unjustly accused of theft. He moves to Raveloe where he becomes fairly reclusive both because he wishes it so and because the villagers find him odd. He devotes himself to the accumulation of wealth, but is once again devastated, this time when he is the victim of theft. Ultimately he is redeemed by a young girl who wanders up to his door. He raises the child and they come to love one another as Father and Daughter. The lesson being that neither religious fanaticism nor the love of filthy lucre will suffice to save a man's soul, but the basic love between two humans will do the trick.It's a fairly simple and straightforward story about the capacity of love to heal spiritual wounds and make damaged beings whole, hence its power. Her other novels are in vogue right now, particularly the unreadable Middlemarch, but this is clearly Eliot's best and one of the most affecting novels of the 19th Century.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"A powerful novel about despair and redemptiom, when everything in Silas's world was gone something unexpected happened to replace his gold with a new golden life.Always darkest before the dawn.Hope for the hopeless."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"THIS BOOK HAD A LOT ABOUT LIFE IN IT AND WAS A GOOD LESSON TO SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE A TENDANCY TO DO THINGS BEHIND OTHERS BACKS.

We had to read it for Freshman Literature. I thought it would be a book I wouldn't like but after I got farther in to it is got better and better."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is a skillfully crafted novel to be enjoyed by readers with varied tastes. It was written by a woman, who found it necessary to use a man's name because of attitudes in England in the nineteenth century. It is built around problems that all of us face in our lives, such as, \\"How important is money?\\" As in all great novels, the characters change as the plot develops.SILAS MARNER is a realistic novel because it portrays life in a real and believable fashion. The author, Mary Ann Evans, who used the pen name, George Eliot, pays careful attention to a few distinguishing details about here characters and settings.For example, we can see Silas Marner, the central character of the novel, with his pale skin and undersized body. We know how he looks with his large, near-sighted, bulging eyes. We can see the important-looking village of Raveloe, which lives peacefully in opulent neglect.When I was a teacher, I directed many high school sophomores to read SILAS MARNER. Most students dreaded reading the novel included in their literature textbooks. Once they met Silas and spent enough time with him to become acquainted with his unique personality, they became eager readers of this well-crafted classic.It has some of the same qualities that madePride and Prejudice (Vintage Classics)an endearing and enduring novel. In both works, the idyllic English countryside is an enjoyable escape from everyday life. There is romantic courtship in both, but the romance of SILAS MARNER is not the central theme; therefore it is not as compelling as that in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Since the readers are not required to become obsessed with yearning for romantic fulfillment, young guys who were in my class felt free to enjoy it. (Sixteen year old young men are still self-conscious about these matters.) Both books contain the same kind of satire buffered with compassion. In both novels we laugh with the local rural and village people. Because the language in SILAS MARNER is less complex, adolescent readers enjoy it more than they do PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.When as a student I first read SILAS MARNER in high school and when I read it with my students, I considered the coincidences plot weaknesses. Life doesn't work that way, I thought. Now that I have experienced a life of incredible coincidences, I no longer find anything in the book unbelievable. Events caused by Silas Marner's catalepsy seemed unlikely, but now they represent no problem.Theft with its resulting bitterness provides conflict with which the readers can identify. Earlier I found it difficult to believe that the lightning of theft could strike twice, but that part of the plot is one more realistic element now. Other twists and turns with their ironic mysteries are typical of human life as I have lived it.All the parts of the novel that seemed to be a contrived fairy tale are now a vignette of life. Even if I could not believe it all, the book would still break my heart the wayForrest Gumpdoes with its twists and turns of satirical accounts.When I enjoyed SILAS MARNER in my twenties with thirty teenagers at a time, I did not notice the shaping of Silas' religious beliefs as much as I do now. I remember that the students and I were indignant about the way Silas was duped by the evil church members at Lantern Yard. Now I have compassion for them, especially William, as well as for Silas.Mary Ann Evans showed the futility of idolatry. All my students understood the disaster of worshiping money. If I could return to my students, I would like to ask them what they thought of the villagers who seemed to rely on the habits of their church to bring them close to God. Could we discuss that in the 21st century? I feel sure we would discuss the addiction to narcotics as it is realistically portrayed.SILAS MARNER is a great English novel not difficult to read, but rich in insights. It shows what is evil and what is good in human hearts."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This is a very touching story. Our whole family loves to listen to it while we are in the car.

He never spent his money because he enjoyed its company. His gold was his only companion for several years of his life. Then one day, he was robbed, and he no longer had anything worth living for.Silas was slowly dying of misery and depression. He had no reason to live. Then one day a little girl walked into his house and into his life. Her mother died, leaving the baby girl as an orphan. So, Silas adopted her and took her into his home. She grew up a poor, hard-working girl who loved her new father Silas and vice-versa. Because of this new daughter of his, Silas changed for the better. He became more caring and devoted to someone else besides himself. He started to go to church again and changed his views on what really was important in life. And one day when his treasure was found and returned to him, he didn't even care for it. He had something even more precious than gold: someone to love and receive love from."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Set in nineteenth-century England, Silas Marner is a weaver who has moved to a new town, Raveloe. Repulsed by his appearance and cataleptic fits, he is ostracized by the community. After losing his faith and having his fortune stolen from him, his fortunes change over time.The fascinating subject is not Marner but the town, Raveloe, whose characters are of particular interest. It is interesting how Eliot spends more time discussing their thoughts and actions than the does Marner, the title character.I was interested in this book from reading Middlemarch and found Marner to be decidedly more entertaining, but not as in-depth. Yet there are important themes found in Marner--the loss of faith, the good of the community vs. the rights of the individual, and the importance of social class (this is present in every British novel).Marner is a masterpiece--written by a woman in the nineteenth century, the book's unassuming nature belies its importance as a great literary work. It is also an entertaining book to read, and not too difficult, seeing its short length. Those interested in reading Eliot may want to start with this classic."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is a nineteenth century Englishman.

I promise you will find yourself loving this book just as I have come to love it."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I've just spent the day reading this book. It's one of those stories that unexpectedly warms the soul and grips the heart.The plot is simple: Silas Marner, a naive young weaver, is betrayed by his best friend. Deeply hurt, he leaves his home for a village where he cares for no one and has no connections. He becomes increasingly reclusive, focusing only on the his weavings and the gold they'll bring. Like Ebenezer Scrooge, Silas covets his gold until it's the only thing he's living for. And then the gold is stolen.It takes a miracle for the gold to come back in the form of a fair-haired, trusting little girl whom Silas names Eppie. Once, the gold robbed Silas Marner of the outside world; now, it comes back to help him reclaim his joy.I'm fifteen years old and will remember this story for the hopeful message it builds up, but I know anyone be uplifted when they get to know Silas and Eppie."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I have to begin by saying I took a Victorian Literature class in college about 11 years ago. I had to read this book... and I did not like it at all.As another reviewer mentioned, I am now thirty and read it again. I now love this story! It is a story of loss, love and redemption.A miserly Silas Marner loses the one thing that makes him feel complete, at least he thought it did. His stash of Gold gone Marner opens up to the people around him for the first time in years. He also meets the little girl who changes his life forever.Silas Marner is a story about finding love and learning how to love someone else. It is also about the miniscule value of possesions as compared to the relationships we can build with those in our lives.Read this book... If you read it before and hated it, or have never read it... It is well worth your time. This classic story written by George Eliot (Mary Anne Evans) will change your view of the world."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner became a bitter, lonely miser after he was accused of stealing church money. Declared guilty even though he wasn't, Marner lost his relationships with friends and loved ones. He moved away to a small town and secluded himself from any social activities or events. The people in this new town didn't bother him, but they thought he was strange and evil. Silas found his security in his gold which he stored up in his house. His treasure became his only companion. But when his gold was stolen one night, Silas thought he would die right then and there. He had no reason to live. Then one day, a little girl walked into his home and into his life. Her mother had died, leaving her as an orphan. So Silas adopted her and raised her in a poor hard-working sort of way. But, she loved him and he loved her. The treasure that Silas had lost had returned to him in a new form. He began to socialize with the people in his town, and no longer did they think he was weird or possessed. This girl brought about changes in Silas' life. He discovered that there are some things more precious than gold."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"What can the reader of today find in a story about a weaver, who felt unable to assimilate into society, that he keeps to himself in his cottage? Quite a bit. As we read &quot;Silas Marner&quot; and watch him caress the only thing he has to love, the gold he's hoarded after so many years, we share in his grief when he comes home and sees it's been stolen. And the fact that it was the ne'er-do-well son of one of the town's most important people makes us more sympathetic. For each day, there are so many Silas Marners out there today, men and women who feel they are outsiders and who are victimized by those in a higher social rung. But we learn with Silas the more important meaning of life, when his old stack of gold is replaced by the new....the golden tresses of the child who wonders into this cottage to change his life forever. With rich characterizations, George Eliot creates a story that will move even the hardest heart. But look beyond the surface and see the indictment of the townspeople as well, who forced Silas into the outside, and then who welcome him."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"A great story about a misunderstood town recluse who hoards all the money he earns as the town weaver.

This is an interesting story and a recommended read. Is it pure gold? No. That is an over-statement. It is not another \\"Notes From the Underground\\" or \\"Death of Ivan Ilych.\\" It is a bit of a romance smaltz novel, and it is short. It is a long short story. But it is different from what one might think. After all, consider the author and the times in which it was written.The novel does have a measure of charm. The title is taken from the name of the lead character. He is a weaver in a small English town. One might say that he is a very dull character. But he has a few interesting events in his life - which I will not reveal here. There are only four interesting characters that run the complete length of the novel. They all live in the same small village. Also, there is a secondary set 3 or 4 characters. These are interesting and almost Dickens-like characters who drift in and out of the action.Coincidences give away the plot. That is a weakness. After 100 pages or so, or about 60% through the read, it starts to become clear what will happen. And, from that moment going forward it follows a most predictable script. Still, it is well written and colourful, and the novel does hold some delightful surprises.The novel is a quick read.Recommend. It ranks 4 stars."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I expected a masterpiece, instead I suffered through a predictable plot with religious overtones that were a little too heavy-handed & unsubtle."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is an excellently written book with many applicable themes. Although written in the 1800s its central theme and life lessons are still relevant today, truly making Silas Marner a classic. Because the book was written in the 1800s many words and the style of writing are hard to follow. This makes for a slow read, and although very descriptive, beats around the bush at getting to the point. For that reason alone i give it4 stars.The central theme here is the reedeming power of love. We see this in the evolution of the protagonist Silas marner. Silas is an old miser living in the English town of Raveloe. Silas was not always a miser. In his previous life in Lantern Yard he was falsely accused of a crime, and had his fianc&egrave; stolen by his best friend. As a result of these events, Silas became hardened, denounced God and moved away. For years he spent his time weaving cloth. He grew attached to his money, particularly the gold guineas. On the other side of the story we meet the antagonist Godfriey Cass. Godfriey is the selfish spoiled grown son of Squire Cass, the richest man in Raveloe. As the plot unfurls we see how these two very different peoples problems and lives intertwine, and through the power of love a life is restored, consequences are dealt, and the realization that nothing ever stays hidden.In sum the book is powerful for the reader who chooses to pay attention. When it gets bogged down with details, just keep reading knowing something great is around the corner."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"A rather sentimental tale of the recluse who regained faith and the ability to love his fellow man. If this didn't have the name George Eliot on it, I doubt this would still be in print, cause honestly, there isn't much to see here (move along.) Middlemarch is fan-freakin-tastic, don't get me wrong, but this one is nowhere near to that status. The story itself is rather unexciting, and there isn't (to my eyes) a depth of examination by a probing mind to merit serious study. Poor kids, having to read this in school!

I'm a particular fan of writers from the late 1800s, but this story's plot line, set in an earlier period, snagged my attention. I fully anticipated enjoying \\"Silas Marner,\\" even though it falls in a period a bit more obscure to a modern reader.Alas, I am that modern reader. When Silas Marner was center-stage, the story moved along, and it was hard not to empathize with the false accusations he endures and the self-exile he chooses. I enjoyed the plots twists from darkness and isolation to deeper darkness, and finally to unexpected redemption. The appearance of the little girl, though less enigmatic than the synopsis implied, was a nice touch. Despite these highlights, I found myself plodding through numerous pages and scenes. The writing has some high moments, but it violates so many of the modern rules of fiction-telling, telling us instead of showing us, pounding home its points instead of letting them simmer just below the service. I truly wish English teachers would use creative minds of their own, instead of succumbing to intellectual pressures and pushing books with little accessibility or interest to a new generation of readers.I can fully understand this book's appeal to readers of its day. It wrestles with certain issues of class and status, with the hypocrisy of the rich and the religious, and the superstitious but honest efforts of the working class. I'm glad to have entered the world of \\"Silas Marner,\\" but, sad to say, I was also glad to leave it behind."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This book IS slow...it's a Victorian novel, and full of descriptions of the people and the countryside, which makes it seem to drag in places. You have to have patience to read Victorian novels, and remember that at the time they were written, most people did not travel much, a journey of 5 miles in a carriage took an hour in good weather and on good roads, riding a horse that distance would take half an hour to 45 min, depending on the ablility of the horse and skill of the rider. Without TV and movies, people had limited opportunities to see scenes of other places than where they lived, so writers needed to describe scenes in detail. It is this richness in detail that attracts me to Victorian novels. I was not bored at all by this book.Silas Marner is a complex character, a nearsighted weaver, given to \\"fits\\" (possibly petit mal seizures), not handsome, and not wealthy enough to overcome his ugliness. He is betrayed by a friend, which puzzles him, rather than angers or embitters him. His neighbors distrust him, though they bear him no ill-will, for he comes from \\"outside\\" the village, and lives a short distance outside the village. The rift--such as it is--is partly due to Marner's nature, partly due to the villagers' natures. He becomes a miser, partly because he needs something to love, and gold is what he has....this becomes the object of his affections. Not because he cares to be rich, but simply because he loves the gold.He is robbed one evening. The thief is Dunstan Cass, a younger son of Squire Cass. Dunstan is a drunkard, a wastrel, a thug, and a blackmailer....he is blackmailing his older brother Godfrey (weak willed and spineless, easily led by the stronger-willed and cunning Dunstan), who has married an opium addict and kept the marriage a secret from his family, for fear his father would disinherit him. He pays Dunstan to keep silent. At one point, Godfrey collects rent from a tenent farmer, gives the money to Dunstan to buy his silence, and hopes not to be found out. However, he is unable to raise the money to repay his father for the rent he stole. He gives his prized horse to Dunstan to sell, but Dunstan kills the horse in a hunting accident. Dunstan walks home, past Marner's cottage, sees no one home, remembers the stories of Marner's hoarding of gold, finds the money and makes off with it. Marner comes home from his short errand, finds the money gone, and is devasted. He seeks help in the village to find the theif. But by this time, Danstan is gone, and the help the villagers can give is both confused and useless. The money is never recovered, and Marner almost loses his mind.During the New Year's party at the Manor, Squire Cass, his family (minus Dunstan) and his guests are enjoying themselves, not knowing that Godfrey's secret wife is coming with their child to force Godfrey to acknowlege her and pay child support. However, she drinks opium, loses her way in the snow, and heedlessly falls asleep under a furze bush. The child, about 2 years old, toddles aawy, a short distance to Marner's cottage, and enters while Marner is at the open door, in one of his \\"fits\\". He comes to, and sees the little girl asleep at the hearth. He traces the child's footsteps back to where the mother lies, frozen to death, under the furze. He runs to the manor to summon help, for he knows the village doctor will be at the party. Godfrey goes out with the doctor, for he has a suspicion who the woman is. He is relieved to find her dead, for this frees him to marry the girl he really loves.Marner insists on raising the little girl as his own child. Godfrey occasionally gives money or goods to Marner to \\"help\\" with the raising of of the little girl (called \\"Eppie\\" after Marner's sister, who died in infancy) but the bulk of the assistance comes from the villagers. Impoverieshed themselves, they nevertheless share what they have with the weaver and his child, and gradually their suspicions of Marner ease, and they become friendly with him.Fast Forward, to 16 years later: Eppie has become a beautiful young lady, loved and courted by one of the village boys. Godfrey and his wife, Nancy (whom he married shortly after discovering his first wife dead) are childless. Godfrey finally confesses his early marriage to Nancy, and tells her that Eppie is really his own child. Meanwhile, Dunstan's body is found, in the bottom the the stone pit, long filled with water, now drained. The bags of gold Stolen from Marner are with him. Godfrey is horrified by Dunstan's crime, and wants to make right all the wrongs done to Marner by the Cass family. He and Nancy decide to adopt Eppie, Nancy with the desire of righting a wrong, Godfrey with the desire to salve his conciense (he has a conciense, it's just a weak-willed one). They approach Marner and Eppie in Marner's cottage, and tell them the story, and that they would like to adopt Eppie, and give her all the privileges, comforts, and advantages that wealth can provide. Maner, thinking of Eppie's future, agrees, though it breaks his heart. Eppie, however, thanks Godfrey and Nancy kindly, but turns them down flat. She has no desire to leave the only father she knew, the villagers she's known all her life, and the young man whom she loves. Godfrey and Nancy leave, saddened and chastened.This is a story of redemptive love. Godfrey is redeemed by Nancy's devoted love of him; rather than berating him or leaving him for his early indiscretions and marriage, she continues to love him unconditionally. Silas Marner is redeemed through his love for Eppie; she literally changes his life, and he is a new man after she comes to him. The gold that Dunstan stole is returned to him, and he no longer cares about it. The desire to hoard is gone. The villagers are also redeemed; the man they formally shunned as an odditity and outsider is accepted into their homes as one of their own, and even the most belligerant village man (the farrier) is softened when Eppie comes to visit. Eppie, had she not been saved by Silas Marner, would have been an orphan and sent to a workhouse as soon as she could walk and feed herself.This is also a story about choices, and how making a decision can affect your life. Godfrey choses to marry in secret, and that choice leads to a life of fear, even after his wife's death, fear of people learning his secret, fear of his new wife learning his secret....he is never free of fear, until he chooses to confess his transgression. Marner chooses to keep the child, though he knows doing so will change his life, not necessarily for the better. A good-hearted village woman chooses to help him in this endeavor, rather than continue to shun him, and her life is enriched as a result.The differences in the lives of the rich and the poor is well definied. The rich, dispite all their wealth and privilage are the poorest in spirit. They are the useless idlers, the parasites, the criminals. The villagers, despite being impoverished, owning little or nothing, uneducated, are the richest, in terms of happiness and love.This is a powerful book."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I may only pity the plight of American society, for time and time again I hear complaints lodged against the British literary canon (indeed, even the American canon) that the books written long ago simply hold no relevance and plod along with no point. There is no relevance to an outcast being condemned in Victorian society for being an outsider and different? But certainly this country has no racial problems, particularly as we are so incredibly lucid and politically correct. Look at how openly we welcome outsiders into our society. We are nothing like the people of Raveloe.Is this George Eliot's masterpiece? No.Yet what parent hasn't felt the dilemma Siras faces with his future with Eppie? Who hasn't had their faith deeply questioned by a deeply-felt wrong in the world? Who hasn't felt the guilt of being unable to speak the full truth to those loved the most?Oh, the plot isn't there. That may be the point, for can the life of a man who lives without the presense of love and only ambition call his existence a plot? I hardly find that irrelevant."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This is truly a wonderful book. It is timeless and ought to make one pause and think about the priorities in one's life. A must have for a classic collection."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"The book Silas Marner is an interesting book to read. The book starts off slow but gets more interesting as you get into it. It's a good book about how lies can ruin peoples' lives. I am giving a mixed review because it has both good and bad points to it. In the book Silas Marner, there is a man named Silas who lives in a small town. One day he is betrayed by his best friend and gets into a lot of trouble. After that he moves to another town were he is an outcast. He works as a weaver; he was the only one in the town so he made a lot of money. One day something happens that causes great pain to him, but one day someone comes to him and turns his life around. He is happier than he was before because he realizes that there is more to life than his money. The book has many good points to it. It has some good morals to it which are nice to know. One of the morals are that people shouldn't tell lies or keep secrets because they aren't good for the people involved. That is why this book is a good one to read. The book is bad because it was hard to understand what is going on all the time. It wouldn't be a good book for people younger than the ninth grade to read because it is hard to understand. It would be a hard book for younger people to read. It is also slow through the first part of the book because it just gives information and nothing happens. That is why it isn't a good book to read. Even with these problems, it would be a good book for older people to read."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"With the publication of SILAS MARNER in 1861, George Eliot countered the rise of what she saw as the patently false view of life that the conventional pastoral engendered. Eliot opposed the cheery images of villagers happily frolicking in their quaint but comely homes. She intended to inject a lasting note of rustic realism in the person of Silas, a character deliberately conceived as a fairy tale creation. By depicting the metamorphosis of Silas from one of twisted values to one of traditional humanistic ones amidst the background of the pastoral fairy tale, Eliot was able to present a believable tale of personal redemption that made use of the political, economic, and social changes that were transforming England from a rural to an industrial based economic system.Silas is initially seen as a sympathetic character who suffers from a false accusation of theft in his small rural village. It is this village that connotes a totality of pre-industrial images of which much of England's older population still retained vivid memories. After his journey to Raveloe, he lives in a small cottage where he works as a weaver and slowly accumulates a hoard of gold which he keeps buried in the floorboards. He likes to play with his gold in a non-productive manner that now calls to mind the similar antics of the cartoon character Scrooge McDuck, both of whom saw their treasure only in terms of watching it grow. This gold is the central symbol of the book, for when he encounters the golden haired Eppie, he transfers his fascination from coin to strand, a changeover which mirrors a similar melding of gold as non-functional to gold as human functional in that a growing capitalist society began to include increasing numbers of newly rich middle class entrepreneurs who put their gold to productive use. As Silas raises Eppie from baby to young woman, he similarly raises his own consciousness so that the bitterness that led him to Raveloe he now sees as but the first step in his redemption. It is not only his ability to shed his bitterness that marks his emotional growth. He now can reintegrate himself into the community of men that he symbolically discarded when he entered the isolation of his secluded home. He further comes to trust in a Higher Power that he was sure had discarded him earlier. Finally, through Silas, Eliot shows that personal redemption also includes the belief that justice delayed is not justice denied. Contrapuntally, the one who stole the treasure for which Silas was blamed did not escape justice. He was killed by falling into a stone pit. Godfrey Cass, who refuses to identify himself as the true father of Eppie, is punished for doing what Silas does willingly. Godfrey must endure seeing his daughter raised by the very one whose purse is dwarfed by Godfrey but whose heart dwarfs Godfrey's. In the regeneration of Silas' nearly lost humanity, Eliot shows that as long as one has someone to care for, then the giving of care results in its return with interest, sort of like investing gold rather than hoarding it."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"George Eliot, born Marian Evans in 1819, spent most of her early life in rural Warwickshire. This early upbringing is apparent from her easy comfort in writing about country settings, with attention to detail and niceties that a born-Londoner would generally not be able to provide. Eliot's life was not that of the typical Victorian lady; she worked in publishing, including periodicals, translations, and writing her own fiction. Eliot led a 'colourful' life; living in a common-law marriage with Lewes, a man who left his wife and children for her, she then married after his death a man twenty years her junior, only to die eight months later.Silas is a weaver, a rather grumpy and sour man, whose primary occupation and avocation is the making of money. He is an outsider in Raveloe, having been driven from his earlier community under the false accusation of theft, an accusation that also cost him his engagement to his beloved, and left him with little faith in human nature, particularly that of the church-ly humans.The high society in Raveloe reached the pinnacle in the Cass family. Squire Cass had two sons, Godfrey and Dunstan, each his own unique form of scoundrel. Godfrey, who had an illicit marriage to a local barmaid Molly, is being blackmailed by his spendthrift brother Dunstan. Alas, Godfrey is expected to marry another, Nancy Lammeter, daughter of another society family. Godfrey attempts to buy off Dunstan with his horse, Wildfire, and during a journey to sell the horse Dunstan accidentally injures and kills Wildfire.Dunstan is stranded in the countryside, but sees light from a cottage -- the home of Silas Marner, reputed after fifteen years of weaving and miserly activity of having accumulated a large stash. He steals the bags of money he finds in the deserted cottage, and disappears into the night.Silas reports the theft, but is unaided. He is heartbroken, for his life's purpose has been the accumulation of this wealth. No one seems to make the connexion between the lost money and the disappearance of Dunstan (one flaw in the novel, in my opinion). Silas gradually recovers from this blow, and the people of Raveloe begin for the first time to see him in terms of friendship.At a Christmas party, the Cass family is in full celebration, for the upcoming marriage of Godfrey and Nancy. However, Nancy is not pleased, given Godfrey's reputation. Later in the holiday season, Molly makes her way to the Cass estate and confronts Godfrey with a two-year-old daughter in tow. Upon her return from the estate, she falls and dies in a drunken, drug-induced stupor, and the child wanders through the snow to the cottage of Silas. Silas lays claim to the golden-haired child, and Godfrey is relieved to be free from Molly and paternity.Sixteen years pass, and we come to meet a very different Silas, one who is now a truly human being, who is loved, and has an object of love in his daughter Eppie. Eppie is in fact about to be wed to the nice Aaron Winthrop. Godfrey and Nancy, however, have had a loveless and childless marriage.Things develop rapidly near the end of the novel. A pond near Silas' cottage is drained, and the remains of Dunstand with two bags of gold coins is found. Godfrey feels compelled to tell his wife now everything, how Dunstan dishonoured the family, how he (Godfrey) was being blackmailed, and admits his paternity of Eppie. Nancy is strangely tolerant -- she only complains of not having been told sooner. They decide to demand that Eppie be returned to them.In a beautiful scene of compassion and love, Eppie, given the free choice of deciding between Silas and connexion with the noble Cass family, opts for the man who was her true father, and chooses to remain with Silas.Later, Silas and Eppie revisit Lantern Yard, from which Silas was expelled so many years before. Here in no longer the old church, his old home, or his old friends -- all has changed; life has gone on. The old place is dirty and noisy by comparison to the serene Raveloe. The question of Silas' guilt or innocence cannot be resolved, but then, is no longer a question of concern for anyone in either place. Eppie then marries Aaron, in a wedding paid for by Godfrey, who cannot attend due to business, and Eppie declares in the end that 'nobody could be happier than we are.'Elliot intended to show that misfortune can lead to greater things, and provided a typical Victorian happy ending.This novel has been a traditional one assigned to students of secondary school age for decades now; it is a classic, fairly simple in construction and vocabulary, and brings up the timeless themes of good, evil, fate, and has a wide range of characters who change over time. Alas, many school-age readers come away cold, often determined never to read another novel again, as it is presented poorly and not put in a more modern context which students will more readily understand. But, it remains a good story, and a fine representative of the Victorian novel."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I would say that it is very difficult to read, but that makes you want to understand. I had to read it for school, and it was excellent! I would have given it a five had it not been for the ending. aFter all that Silas goes through, yes, you are happy for him, but things work out too well. There is not enough tragedy or bittersweetness at the end to make you think about it constantly and writhe in the pain of the characters, thinking, if only. I really get into books like that. But this book, however good and painful throughout ended TOO happily. I do like the fact that Silas had to endure so much. It made it a tempestuous book, and painful to read. That quality makes the book all the more wonderful. You can really sympathize with the author. It's a good read though, and I reccommend it."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"George Eliot, a.k.a. Mary-Anne Evans, was a popular novelist in her time, which has immediately made her books classic reads in schools, libraries, or even a novelist looking for inspiration to write a novel that shall be a classic in the future. Evans crafted a beautiful plot, and captivates the readers once the background chapters have been set up, and the action begins. It is rare that such a book in our day and age exists, and it is nice to read the popular things that were back in that day and age. I, being in high school, had the option of reading this book or Evans' other brilliant novel, \\"Middlemarch\\". I thought this might be an excellent read, so I chose this.At first, I thought I had made the wrong choice and thought of switching to \\"Middlemarch\\" before it was too late. It starts out slow if you are reading Eliot for the first time, but the mind is only preparing itself to the odd language of the period (thank goodness it isn't Old English). However, once the background of Lantern Yard and Raveloe have been given to us, along with Silas Marner's history, we dive straight into the plot -- Godfrey and Dunstan Cass, Nancy Lammeter, The Red House, The Rainbow, Silas, Eppie, Molly, Priscilla, Squire Cass, Dolly Winthrop, Aaron -- all characters and places which set us into the story. With the dialogue and tension perfectly set, it is no wonder why this has become a classic.Perfect for a classroom, Silas Marner promises each person who reads it a lesson in what really matters to the heart -- in Silas' position, I would have chosen the golden locks too."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I cannot more agree with the reviewers who say Silas Marner is slow moving at the beginning, and that it is slow moving for the first half of the story, however I find that Silas Marner is not actually a story, more a biography, or a discription of the times. The scenes are that era are very vivid; the characters are very true and clear. Silas's betrayal, his 'death' and his obsession with money are reflected in the monotony of the book, just when you begin to feel the story has completely lost track of any clear-cut line, something new happens. Then, Silas is reborn, he remembers who he has been and his family. The most wonderful thing about this book is its summing up, happy ending. Nothing is left hanging, this book definatly has a good ending, and a book with an ending such as this is clearly the work of a gifted author; such as George Eliot. Do not read this book in search of thrilling plot, and captivating characters, read it for it's planning, and mostly for it's joyful conclusion."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"\\"Middle March\\" is often regarded as George Eliot's greatest novel but \\"Silas Marner\\" is undisputedly a novel foray by the Victorian authoress into the realm of the rustic. First published in 1861,this masterpiece has transcended much beyond the bars of time and even in the 21st. century retains its ambition to tell a colossal saga in a genteel fashion boldly underlined by a conversational tone. \\"Silas Marner\\" is a brief and tightly cultural story invoking a symmetrical plot and adroit symboism to depict the tale of a linen-weaver who loses everything in his life only to discover them in a more divine,vibrant and concord dimension.Silas Marner is a poor,hapless linen-weaver who leaves his own village after being framed in a robbery case by his friend William Dane who goes on to marry his lover Sarah. Ignominy,betrayal and a haunting sense of being abjectly wronged conspire to lead him elsewhere and Silas Marner finds respite from his unforgiving past in the village of Raveloe. Here none is cognizant with his bitter history and Silas becomes a \\"simple weaver\\" and all the more enigmatic for it. He creates an atmosphere of mysteries around him and remains confined in this narrow scope of self-development for fifteen heavily limping years. He hoards up a massive amount of gold and silver but favours miserly expenditure. And then when everything gives the impression of being normal and steady,life takes a sharp bend for Silas Marner and forces him into a strange world.Running parallel with this story of a diminutive figment of the domain of village is the gentryfolk version of a life inndated with posh manners and biting apprehensions,this too in Raveloe. Godfrey Cass is the eldest son of the Squire who succumbs to his brother Dunsey's blackmail and leaves him his horse to sell. Dunsey Cass epitomises all that is lavish and bad and nonsense and grotesque and crooked and deceitful and cunning in a gentry society. He kills the horse in a freak accident and then to save his skin,steals the money from Silas Marner's dilapidated house. At the heart of \\"Silas Marner\\" lies his robbery---it lends an excuse to George Eliot to intersect two different,and at times poignantly contrasting,worlds and in this scheme,the reader is invariably led to ruminate on William Shakespeare's \\"The Merchant of Venice\\",where the two parallel stories,one concerning Antonio's plight thrusted upon by Shylock and the other describing Bassanio's endeavour to win Portia,coincide at the critical junction to shape the drama into the right posture. This comparison is not to say that Shakespeare's \\"The Merchant of Venice\\" and Eliot's \\"Silas Marner\\" resonate with each other but goes a long way really to prove tat the intersection of the various works of literature are not that detached from the intersection of events in a single work of the same.This robbery transmutes the eponymous protagonist of the novel from \\"a half-crazy miser\\" to a God-fearing man of depth and substance. That very same night Silas Marner's house is radiated by the return of the lost gold and silver pieces in a more divine and colourful form:\\"a tamp's child\\". Silas is bold enough to accept her as his daughter and despite being a bachelor,he undertakes for the development of the girl-child he baptises as Eppie. Eppie's growth and realisation of the world in the subsequent years spent amidst poverty and few glimpses of fortune results in Silas's own comprehension and rise from a one-dimensional figure to a pluralistic person,\\"There's good i' this world---I've a feeling o' that now;and it makes a man feel as there's a god more nor he can see,i' spite o' the trouble and the wickedness\\"---this may seem as the ultimate realisation of Silas Marner but it's not as much the understanding of Silas about life as the authoress's recurrent theme:that life,despite all the human,divine and unforseen forces perpetually thretening to distort its shape,is always beautiful.\\"Silas Marner\\" is virtually a ballad inprose and so inevitably always soaked in a gentle reassurance of poetic justice. Throughout these pages,the reader discerns elements of ballad structure,most notably in instances where the vivid flow of the tale is punctuated by phiosophical discourse. George Eliot's general framework of things in this book is great and occasioned with touches of delicate humour and subtle satire blent with the accent of superstitions so vehemently disturbing the society during the writer's era---all these features being reflected in the conversation at the Rainbow---augment the authoress's successful employment of a taut and intense yet elaborate and defining language. George Eliot may be focusing on a particular character in this novel but she doesn't neglect the suitable etching of other characters. art is symbolic in tone with singular effigies representing wider landscapes and in \\"Silas Marner\\" this nature is made pretty evident. Geofrey Cass embodies a man repressed by circumstances and personal fears,Dunsey is the sole villain in the piece,Nancy Lammeter proves a dedicated and devoted wife to Godfrey despite illustrating herself of a meek submissive nature bordering on self-denial,whilst Dolly Winthrop is the most accomplished of women characters in the novel,a constant source of sometimes vain but forever honest judgement and help to Silas Marner.George Eliot's language in this book is typically idyllic with a stunning coupling of narration and dialogue,the former being personal as well as philosophical and the latter neither lofty nor mundane but in essence commonplace and genuine. Dunsey's end is an apt revelation of the writer's belief that truth can never be obscured or erased. The book doesn't attempt to keep many mysteries from the reader---Eppie's father is forever a known person,Dunsey's ultimatum is never in doubt and the conclusion isn't that difficult to fathom. \\"Silas Marner\\" is not a superb classic only for the easy flow of its plot but also for the easy fairy-tale gratifications that it manages to combine with massive social and personal insights. This work must rank alongside the best novels of all time and indeed when George Eliot remarks this about Nancy's elder sister Priscillia,\\"She serves a little pepper to sprinkle over the talk---that's the reason why she never puts too much in her pies\\",we can easily qualify this statement to the authoress's ability to weave magic with her own talks and pies."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This book explores the best and worst of human nature in people, when they are at their highest and when they are at their lowest points in life. Marner also writes about the good nature in others that can develop after ones worst moments in life. I really enjoyed this book and hope others will to.-Tipcat"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"On the surface, Silas Marner is a fairly simplistic fable about a jaded weaver who finds solace only in weaving and in counting his gold each night until a little girl appears on his doorstep and he finds meaning and life in her love loosing his obsessions and becoming a well adjusted and well liked person. I can see how some do not find it interesting. It was several weeks after I read it that I realized that maybe Silas Marner was not the main point. He doesn't actually do anything, after all. Everything happens TO him. He simply responds to what happens to him. To rediscover life through the love of a child is a good theme but look at Les Miserables. There is no comparison.Look instead at Godfrey Cass and consider the story with him as the main character. If Silas Marner is actually the counterpart for him instead of the other way around (like a constant in a science experiment), it starts to take on the qualities of a classic. Godfrey Cass is also jaded and harassed but he schemes. He tries to manipulate the circumstances to his best benefit - not in a malicious way, no more than Voltaire's Candide. If we look at it that way, what we have here is an English Candide for, with Silas as the counterpart instead of Godfrey, the moral changes to become, basically, 'Roll with the punches', or - as Voltaire put it, 'We must cultivate our gardens'."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"So, you've savored Middlemarch and reveled in Mill on the Floss. What do you read when you're in the mood for the kind of witty observations and perceptively drawn characters you loved in Eliot's masterpieces? Though more sentimental and simplistically plotted than Eliot's other novels, this slight little fable is nonetheless a rich and rewarding read. It's perceptive, touching and written with Eliot's characteristic grace and gentle humor."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This book is considered a true classic. The story about a miser who was driven from his original home by false acusations to end up as a miserable weaver in a new town. His life changes when he finds a foundling and begins to care for her. It turns out the girl is the daughter of landed gentry who now want her and Silas does not to give her back. The story is not bad, but I do not understand why it is such a classic. I must be missing something because it was originally written in 1861. It is possible I am missing the forest for the trees in this case. It is a fast read and it is not a bad book by any definition."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I bought this because I had just listened to Middlemarch (books on CD, 28 of them) and loved Eliot's writing so much I wanted more. While Silas Marner is good, it does not have the depth of Middlemarch. Characters in Silas Marner are not as well developed as those in MM with all their psychological nuances, ups and downs, ins and outs. Plus, having MM read by such a talented Brit with all the different accents, tones, intonations, and inflections was like having a theatre in the car as I drove across country. The biographical introduction to Silas Marner was well worth it and I intend to review those facts again."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Enjoyed reading it again. I am sure I read it in high school or college English class but had forgotten much of the plot. The writing was wonderful as I remembered."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is a masterpiece. The deep characters beg the reader to understand them. The story is thought-provoking yet heart-warming. The questions and themes this short book presents are so deep and real and need to be thought about. You will be challenged about religion, views of God, light and darkness, and redemption. This book is such an enjoyable read, yet complex and challenging. Read it and you'll want to read it again!"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Fortunately, I did not have to read this book in grade school, because I would not have gotten anything out of it at the time. For those interested in character-driven stories and with the patience for 19th-century prose, however, Silas Marner is worth reading.This short book tells the story of a man who more or less withdraws from life after a crushing betrayal, to be eventually reawakened through his love for a child. It's a sweet story, at times saccharine and with some all-too-convenient plot elements, but still, it's a good one. The writing, of course, is excellent, sometimes sarcastic, and peppered with incisive observations about human nature. For the most part, the characterization is excellent; I fully believed in the Raveloe villagers, and even the minor ones are distinct and realistic.But then there is Eppie, the original Pollyanna--so perfect she's more plot device than person. Even when she misbehaves, she does so adorably; as a toddler she never throws tantrums, and as a teenager she's never for a moment rebellious or selfish or withdrawn. She's a fantasy child, with none of the human foibles the other characters display, and it's because of her that the later part of the novel sometimes becomes saccharine.Overall, though, a sweet, enjoyable story from a gifted writer. I decided to try this one before Middlemarch, and it's good enough that I'm eager to try Eliot's major work."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I'm a huge fan of George Eliot, and as always Silas Marner did not lack for literary content and great prose. If you've never read Eliot before this would be a good book to start since it's relatively short. On the other hand, I felt the story lacked the powerful dramatic ending I was hoping for, and so I cannot say it is one my favorites by her. All in all a good read that leaves you with plenty to think about and ponder when you look at your own life and what are the things that are most important to you."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"oor Silas. He can't get a break. After falsely being accused of a crime, he relocates to another village, where he focuses on working and earning money, living an isolated, antisocial existence. He loves his money. In fact, that's all he loves. Then someone robs him, taking every last coin.George Eliot, pen name of Mary Anne Evans, wrote several novels capturing life in 19th century England. Silas Marner, first published in 1861, remains a timeless, moving story of one man's struggle and redemption in the face of adversity. When Silas was a young man, one of his closest friends betrayed him by framing him for a crime and stealing his girl. As if being betrayed by his friend wasn't enough, he was also betrayed by the church; the drawing of lots declared his guilt.Moving to a new town, he earns his living as a weaver, and lives a miserly existence. He had no other purpose in life but to earn and save money. \\"His life had reduced itself to the mere functions of weaving and hoarding, without any contemplation of an end towards which the functions tended.\\" His only pleasure, all he looked forward to, was taking the money out every night, counting it, stacking it, sorting it, and handling it. Until one night, it was gone.And as suddenly as the money disappeared from his home, a little girl appeared. Silas found the mother frozen by the road near his home. Without hesitation, Silas took on the task of raising her as his own, finding the fulfillment he had been missing all those years: \\"Now something had come to replace his hoard which gave a growing purpose to the earnings, drawing his hope and joy continually onward beyond the money.\\"As the mystery of the missing money and the unknown parentage of Eppie, Silas's adopted daughter, come together, the story comes together in a clash of class and family that, while perhaps bordering on melodrama, is nevertheless moving and satisfying. When Godfrey, Eppie's biological father and a nobleman, comes to Silas and Eppie, the reader takes heart in Silas and Eppie's love for one another. On a personal note, I found the thoughts of Nancy, Godfrey's wife, on adoption were interesting. After they lost a baby and weren't able to conceive again, she had resisted Godfrey's wishes to adopt a child. \\"To adopt a child, because children of your own had been denied you, was to try and choose your lot in spite of Providence: the adopted child, she was convinced, would never turn out well, and would be a curse to those who had willingly and rebelliously sought what it was clear that, for some high reason, they were better off without.\\" I wonder how widespread this attitude was then, or even today. Certainly Silas's adoption of Eppie contradicts Nancy's view; Eliot clearly strikes a positive note for adoption here.As you might expect from a novel of the mid-19th century, many passages seem overly wordy and unnecessary. But even the dialogue and action that seems irrelevant to the story, like the men chatting in the pub, and the girls chatting as they're getting dressed for a formal dinner, add to the ambience by giving a realistic portrayal of the culture and language of the time.Eliot, decidedly not a believer, has little good to say about the church in Silas Marner. But Christians can don't have to try very hard to resonate with the moral lesson of the novel. The joy and rewards of life can be measured not by how much we save of what we earn, but by how much we give ourselves away in the service of others. James says pure religion is looking after orphans; Silas certainly embraced that call.Eliot's story is timeless and moving, and though it's a bit of a slog at times for the 21st century reader, it's certainly worth your time."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I've always heard Silas Marner described as a drab read, a lesser work of George Eliot that is forced upon school children because it is George Eliot's shortest novel. I am happy to report that Silas Marner is neither drab nor a lesser work of Eliot. I found it to be an engaging, ultimately heartwarming and moral story about the true price of gold and human relations. It was a story that in many ways I found to be very relevant to today's society. As Jane Austen did before her, Eliot writes about human characteristics that transcend time.As the story starts, Silas Marner is a happy man with a good job as a weaver, a productive member of his church, a great best friend, and a fianc&eacute;e. Things suddenly take a turn for the worst when Marner's best friend frames him for a crime he didn't commit, and also steals his fianc&eacute;e. Bitter against his fellow church goers and town, Silas Marner moves away to a place where he is not known and where his weaving is prized. Making a good living, Marner values his gold and puts it above all human relations. Things soon change when his gold is stolen and a young child shows up on his door step shortly thereafter. He raises young Eppie as his own, until her real father shows up when Eppie is a teenager and wants to take her back. Will Eppie stay with Silas Marner or go to the father that abandoned her as a child?George Eliot created a wonderful cast of characters in Silas Marner. Silas is the main character, but his neighbor lady Dolly Winthrop, is a wonderful lady who helps him raise Eppie. Squire Cass and his family are also fleshed out and discussed in great detail as their lives often intersect with Marner's. I enjoyed listening to all of their lives. Nadia May was a great narrator. This was also the first book I listened to on my phone from the library. I love the system, but wish that there were more copies of digital audiobooks available to check out!The most fascinating part of the book for me was how George Elliot captured timeless qualities in human interactions and life. My favorite example of this is how a bunch of old guys are together talking about how the youth of today are lazy and nothing like when they were young lads. How often have I heard this talk throughout my life about how the youth of whatever day are terrible compared with older generations.Another example of this is problems with drugs. We hear about drugs in the news often and it seems like a problem just of today, but in Silas Marner, Eppie's mother has a drug addiction that leads her to take one last fix that ultimately kills her and leaves her child an orphan in the snow. The drug of choice may have changed over time, but the deadly effects of them haven't. As I continue to explore Victorian literature this year, I've noticed that drugs play a prominent role in many famous novels of that time.Overall, Silas Marner is a moving, intriguing story, with characters and situations that are timeless."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"One of the best classics that have been written. I read this book when I was young, and forgot most of it. I watched the movie with Ben Kensley and it was so good that I had to read the book again. The book was by far much better than the movie and I recommend it to anyone that loves period pieces. I give it 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I dutifully read this book decades ago in Junior High School. The sum total of what I remember is the miser and there was something about a girl. It did not make any kind of impression, much less a profound impression. Now, many years later, I decided, for unknown reasons, to read this book again. And I am happy I did.Yes, this is a story of a miser who lives for his gold and silver coins. Having closed himself off from a world that has betrayed him, he finds his only solace in working to obtain his treasure and bringing his treasure out every night to look at it. But he is not a hard or cruel or even selfish man. He is nave and gentle. If he could just get rid of his gold, his life would be much better.Like its main character, the story itself is gentle. The villains hardly ever appear, mercy is prevalent and justice while an important element in the story is nevertheless mild. The story celebrates the quiet, unfashionable happiness of love at home.One of the features of this story is the revealing glimpse it provides of small town life during the era. Those familiar with Eliot's Middlemarch know that few portray small town life more accurately or sympathetically than she does. One has the sense that this is really what it must have been like to live in that time and place. From this accurate depiction, the story develops in such a natural way that new insight is given into why people become misers, and why rigid class distinctions exist even in rural country neighborhoods.The digressive, descriptive writing style prevalent in the Victorian era, is certainly present here, but this is a short book. My copy was only 150 pages. One can enjoy the leisurely pace of the story without having to make a long term commitment to the book. But the book still delivers an arresting climax that stays with me now that the book is done, and I expect I will remember it years from now. I did not remember any of it after reading it for school, but that is the difference between reading against your will and reading for pleasure. Silas Marner is a pleasure! Who knew?"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is a broken man. In training to be a religious man, he is falsely accused of being a thief and is betrayed by his best friend. Marner leaves town in disgrace and moves to a new place, where he mostly keeps to himself, weaving all day to make money. His gold, stored in a secret hole during the day and taken out to be stacked and counted in the evening, is his only companion.When Marner's money is stolen, his world is rocked again, and he lives in devastation and regret. But when an orphan appears in his cabin and nobody steps forward to claim her, Marner finally finds something of meaning in his life.This is a really sweet story of how a child's love can melt even the toughest of hearts. The path to Marner's destruction is long and heartbreaking, and my only complaint about the book is that there is so little about the life Silas and Eppie live together. I would have liked to have seen more of her growing up and the two of them forming a bond."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"If you have a heart, the story of Silas Marner will warm it. You are better coming to it fresh, without knowing anything of the simple yet solid plot, so I will say nothing of it. I will just urge you to read this wonderful book. Eliot writes beautifully and from page one, you realize you are in the hands of a true artist. This is a very human, very English story of simple people living through those very basic emotions that make the world turn and give the universe meaning."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Question: How can you ensure that a person will hate a book? Answer: Make her read it for 7th grade English class, make sure that the language is old-fashioned, and above all, make sure that the ideas and concepts are over her head. If that's what happened to you, and that's why you have an aversion to Silas Marner, and you are now over 30, pick it up again. Read it twice. Silas Marner is one of the greatest novels in the English language.Yes, it starts out sad, as our pathetic hero looses both his trust in humanity and his faith in God. But the power of love replaces his lust for money, and wins out in the end. Meanwhile, morally poor but financially rich, high-living Godfrey Cass provides a counterpoint to simple Silas. At the end there's a surprise when the fate of Godfrey's evil brother is revealed.When you're all done, before you file Silas Marner on the shelf, go back and read the paragraph about Silas' thoughts when he discovers that his hordes of coins are missing. If you have ever felt sudden extreme loss, you will recognize the stages of despair from disbelief to acceptance \\"like a man falling into dark water.\\" Which is why this book is not suitable for children, and is most appreciated by those who have undergone their own moral redemption.Silas has been the inspiration for many other characters, including Dicken's Scrooge. He has been portrayed in movies, including \\"A Simple Twist of Fate\\" starring Steve Martin. But none is as good as the original. If you haven't read it since junior high, try it again. Silas Marner is an excellent book. There's a gem of human understanding in every chapter."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is an excellent classic novel set in early Nineteenth Century England. In this story, George Eliot (pen name for Mary Ann Evans) depicts a man named Silas Marner, a weaver by trade. He lives happily in his home town of Lantern Yard, until his best friend William Dane betrays him by setting him up as a thief. William then marries Silas' fianc&eacute;e, and Silas is shunned from the town. He eventually settles in a very small cottage in Raveloe, where he spends his days making cloth and other materials for the townspeople. Due to his now secretive and reclusive ways, the people of Raveloe never really come to know Silas, and he lives in solitude, having turned away from his former faith and happiness.But one winter's night, a small orphan girl comes to his house, and everything changes. Silas cares for the child (with the help of his neighbor, Mrs. Winthrop, whose family soon befriends him), and his heart begins to soften.This is a very good representation of the redeeming power of love, and the consequences of a person's actions. For people who enjoy classic literature, this is definitely a must-read.Ryan RobledoAuthor of the Aelnathan:"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Reviews of this novel, seem to fall into three categories: those written by people who like to read great literature; those written by people who would prefer to read brain candy; and those written students forced to read the novel as a class assignment and,in some cases, would prefer not to read anything (if the third category is discarded, the average rating is much higher).One of the most remarkable things about this novel is the fact it was written by a woman, using a male pen name, in 19th century England when women were generally oppressed, i.e., they were not encouraged to have careers or to do anything outside the home. The story is well known. A man who blacks out during seizures, not remembering what happened, is falsely accused of theft of money from his church. He is shunned by his former friends and becomes a recluse. When he is later robbed of his savings, and an abandoned child appears on his doorstep in place of the gold, his life is changed as he takes responsibility for the child.This is classic literature from that time period, and is most certainly easier to read than many other novels from the same period (students should consider themselves fortunate that they were not assigned to read one of Thomas Hardy's novels). I first became acquainted with the novel when it was assigned reading in a high school English class. That was over 50 years ago, and the story is one that has stuck in my mind."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I used to hate \\"Silas Marner\\" when I was forced to read the thing for my English class in Middle School (1959).

The text is laid out very well for the Kindle. At this price it is truly a must-read. What a terrific book!This is a tale of how love conquers all. A bitter man, Silas Marner, who was done wrong gave up on humanity and decided to live in a cocoon of his own making. Silas' only joy and purpose in life was making and hoarding money. He spent hours on end working himself to no end all for the purpose of earning, saving, and collecting money. Then one day his money hoard was stolen. The rest of the story is a lesson in love.I have no idea why; here in America, George Eliot's \\"Silas Marner\\" is not well known. None of my friends have ever heard of this book. In India this work was well known. Anyway, if you have the time, patience, and inclination for a good read this is it."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"George Eliot, born Marian Evans in 1819, spent most of her early life in rural Warwickshire. This early upbringing is apparent from her easy comfort in writing about country settings, with attention to detail and niceties that a born-Londoner would generally not be able to provide. Eliot's life was not that of the typical Victorian lady; she worked in publishing, including periodicals, translations, and writing her own fiction. Eliot led a 'colourful' life; living in a common-law marriage with Lewes, a man who left his wife and children for her, she then married after his death a man twenty years her junior, only to die eight months later.In this novel, Silas is a weaver, a rather grumpy and sour man, whose primary occupation and avocation is the making of money. He is an outsider in Raveloe, having been driven from his earlier community under the false accusation of theft, an accusation that also cost him his engagement to his beloved, and left him with little faith in human nature, particularly that of the church-ly humans.The high society in Raveloe reached the pinnacle in the Cass family. Squire Cass had two sons, Godfrey and Dunstan, each his own unique form of scoundrel. Godfrey, who had an illicit marriage to a local barmaid Molly, is being blackmailed by his spendthrift brother Dunstan. Alas, Godfrey is expected to marry another, Nancy Lammeter, daughter of another society family. Godfrey attempts to buy off Dunstan with his horse, Wildfire, and during a journey to sell the horse Dunstan accidentally injures and kills Wildfire.Dunstan is stranded in the countryside, but sees light from a cottage -- the home of Silas Marner, reputed after fifteen years of weaving and miserly activity of having accumulated a large stash. He steals the bags of money he finds in the deserted cottage, and disappears into the night.Silas reports the theft, but is unaided. He is heartbroken, for his life's purpose has been the accumulation of this wealth. No one seems to make the connexion between the lost money and the disappearance of Dunstan (one flaw in the novel, in my opinion). Silas gradually recovers from this blow, and the people of Raveloe begin for the first time to see him in terms of friendship.At a Christmas party, the Cass family is in full celebration, for the upcoming marriage of Godfrey and Nancy. However, Nancy is not pleased, given Godfrey's reputation. Later in the holiday season, Molly makes her way to the Cass estate and confronts Godfrey with a two-year-old daughter in tow. Upon her return from the estate, she falls and dies in a drunken, drug-induced stupor, and the child wanders through the snow to the cottage of Silas. Silas lays claim to the golden-haired child, and Godfrey is relieved to be free from Molly and paternity.Sixteen years pass, and we come to meet a very different Silas, one who is now a truly human being, who is loved, and has an object of love in his daughter Eppie. Eppie is in fact about to be wed to the nice Aaron Winthrop. Godfrey and Nancy, however, have had a loveless and childless marriage.Things develop rapidly near the end of the novel. A pond near Silas' cottage is drained, and the remains of Dunstand with two bags of gold coins is found. Godfrey feels compelled to tell his wife now everything, how Dunstan dishonoured the family, how he (Godfrey) was being blackmailed, and admits his paternity of Eppie. Nancy is strangely tolerant -- she only complains of not having been told sooner. They decide to demand that Eppie be returned to them.In a beautiful scene of compassion and love, Eppie, given the free choice of deciding between Silas and connexion with the noble Cass family, opts for the man who was her true father, and chooses to remain with Silas.Later, Silas and Eppie revisit Lantern Yard, from which Silas was expelled so many years before. Here in no longer the old church, his old home, or his old friends -- all has changed; life has gone on. The old place is dirty and noisy by comparison to the serene Raveloe. The question of Silas' guilt or innocence cannot be resolved, but then, is no longer a question of concern for anyone in either place. Eppie then marries Aaron, in a wedding paid for by Godfrey, who cannot attend due to business, and Eppie declares in the end that 'nobody could be happier than we are.'Elliot intended to show that misfortune can lead to greater things, and provided a typical Victorian happy ending.This novel has been a traditional one assigned to students of secondary school age for decades now; it is a classic, fairly simple in construction and vocabulary, and brings up the timeless themes of good, evil, fate, and has a wide range of characters who change over time. Alas, many school-age readers come away cold, often determined never to read another novel again, as it is presented poorly and not put in a more modern context which students will more readily understand. But, it remains a good story, and a fine representative of the Victorian novel.This particular edition contains many extra pieces of commentary, notes and other study aids that will be helpful to the student trying to understand the text, the motivations of the characters, the world context of the story, and different ideas of interpretation."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is a very interesting book. It is filled with excitement and suspense. I liked the book very much, but as a freshman in high school, it was very hard for me to read. George Eliot uses a lot of dialect along with some Old English words in her lovable tale. Eliot tells the story of a lonely weaver. After getting betrayed by friends in his old town of Lantern Yard, Silas moves to the town of Raveloe searching for a new life. His delusions keep him from getting accepted into the Raveloe community. After losing his faith in God and having his money stolen he gets a very special gift from someone he doesn't know, a little baby girl with golden hair. After that things work out for Silas and Eppie. George Eliot tells her classic novel in great detail with a lot of adjectives and metaphors. She has made a great novel that while a challenge is good for everybody. Silas Marner is really easy to comprehend because it is so realistic. I live in a small town and it reminds me of Raveloe. Sometimes I imagine that I am in Silas Marner's place and all my friends are the villagers. I think about what I would do if I was in Marner's place. Eliot also created a great plot for this book. This classic is great because it teaches people about life. It teaches people not to be selfish and to be kind to people no matter how good you think you are. Eliot has made a great book that would be great to read as a family."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner spends his days weaving for the village-folk of Raveloe, weaving and saving, hiding his money in leather bags in the floor of his home. At nights, he counts the money, tinkling it between his hands, memorising the increasing total. He spends little, and has no friends or family. His life consists of waiting to leave his life, an endless weave that seems to have no beginning and no end.But Silas was not always a weaver. As a young man, he was engaged, and living in another town. But his best friend, William Dane, who was jealous of his good fortune and hopeful prospects, engendered a plan to strip Silas of everything he held dear. His hometown, convinced he was involved with the robbery of a senior deacon, accused him of theft and he was forced to leave. He stumbles upon Raveloe and begins to weave, and fifteen years past.It is to George Eliot's credit that a story with such fairy tale qualities is so successful. From the very beginning we are made aware of character-types and ideas, with Silas being an innocent man wrongly accused, and then, as a weaver, a giant metaphor of toil and struggle in an unfair world. The townsfolk of Raveloe, as they are outlined, remain simply that - a thick line that purports to show the broad details of a person, but in no way offers the subtle shading that makes a character come to life and become a person. But this is to the story's credit, for we are not interested so much in depth of character and complexity of situation, as we are in the constant weaving, the endless sadness, of Silas Marner's self-imposed exile.While we learn of Marner's new life as a hoarder, a miser, a weaver, we come to see other characters and situations. There is a young man, Godfrey, who is running out of money and seeks a desperate measure to fix his worries. There is his father, who disapproves of his life and choices. One New Year's, the two stories intersect, and after Silas is robbed of all his money, a young girl, blonde and innocent and nameless, is found on his doorstep. Her mother, an opium addict, is discovered nearby, frozen to death. A father, if there is one, does not step forward.Here, Eliot allows us to know the secret well before Silas or Eppie, his newly christened adopted daughter. Godfrey is the father, and it is a secret he carries with him well past necessary. His duplicitous action is flagged at a very early stage, which sets in our mind the idea that a comeuppance, or a truth revealing set piece, is somewhere along the line. Because this is known - for what fairy tale does not, in the end, end in goodness and retribution and justice for those who deserve it? - we are able to enjoy the experience of Silas as he becomes a good father, and learns how to love.In a sense, the themes surrounding Silas are trite and over-used. The idea of a sad, lonely man discovering the beauty of the world again through love, is nothing new. Yet Eliot's mastery of character and evocation of place allow us to sail along with Silas as he sheds the hard carapace of armour that he has placed around himself. He becomes, as we do, devoted to Eppie. She is a caricature, a purely good and ultimately pure girl who, through the tutelage of her father, understands the meaning of love even where Godfrey, her real father, does not.Eliot makes heavy use of dialect in Silas Marner. As a personal taste, I distinctly dislike dialect, because I find I spend more time translating what is being said than enjoying and understanding the character as they are presented. Yes, it can aid in characterisation and 'realism', but at what cost? Much like Wuthering Heights, several characters in Silas Marner were ruined for me, purely because I had to work so hard at what they were saying. And of course, upon figuring out their obscure words, I realised that they were saying nothing meaningful at all. A great disappointment, that.Throughout, various characters are introduced and then pushed to the background, as needed by the story. When Silas is in difficulties concerning the raising of a child, a goodwife is found, Dolly Winthrop, who provides him with advice and stresses that the child must be christened. Later, a love interest is given to Eppie, because what happy ending does not finish with a wedding?But these are minor quibbles. As a fairy tale, Silas Marner excels. There are good people done wrong, and bad people who come right in the end. There is a happy - or mostly happy - ending for everyone who deserves it, and a few that don't. But more than that, there is the construction of a wholly sympathetic man, and that is Silas Marner himself. Eliot does not stray down an easy route with him - when he becomes a miser, there is sadness, not avarice, in our minds as we sympathise.This novel is considered minor Eliot; it is not hard to fault that estimation. Middlemarch is a towering literary achievement, whereas Silas Marner is merely a single flower in a garden of like experiments with words. But what flower does not deserve to be smelled, at least once?"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"While reading SILAS MARNER, I kept thinking of a scene from Season Five of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, in which Tara's father and other relatives come to take her back home with them, very much against her inclination. Once Buffy realizes that Tara wants to stay, she states that they can take Tara only by going through her first, which causes the father to ask, \\"We are Tara's blood-kin. Who are you to interfere in her affairs?\\" To which Buffy replies, \\"We're family.\\" The same emotions that I felt watching that episode of BUFFY came roaring back in the marvelous scene near the end of this novel when Mr. Cass decides to reveal after sixteen years of denial that Eppie is his daughter and will take her to live with him instead of Silas when he says, \\"Your coming now and saying 'I'm her father' doesn't alter the feeling inside us. It's me she's been calling her father ever since she could say the word.\\" And Eppie herself adds, \\"And he's took care of me and loved me from the first, and I'll cleave to him as long as he lives, and nobody shall ever come between him and me.\\" It is one of the lovelier climaxes of any 19th century English novel.SILAS MARNER is very much a novel about faith and the search for those values that make life worth living. Marner himself seeks early on to find hope in a superstitious religion that ultimately disappoints him, and later in the acquisition of gold through hard labor, gold that is stolen from him. The money is later returned to him, but during the long interval he discovers the power and greater importance of love and simple human relationships, as he inadvertently inherits a young toddler who miraculously appears inside his cottage whom he adopts as his own child. Despite his hurts and crusty personality, Marner in loving the child is brought into the larger community as well, and achieves a kind of happiness he scarcely imagined earlier in his life.These concerns were very real to Mary Anne Evans, better known by her penname of George Eliot. Though of humble intellectual origins, she was precociously intelligent, and no figure of the 19th century overcame such obstacles to become one of the leading intellectuals of her day. In the 20th or 21st century, Evans would have held a chair of religion or literature at Cambridge or Oxford. Instead, she wrote literary reviews on a host of books on a wide range of subjects, made some of the most important translations into English of crucial German theological texts ever made (Feuerbach's THE ESSENCE OF CHRISTIANITY and David Strauss's THE LIFE OF JESUS), and wrote some of the most intellectual novels of the century. Eliot's novels are remarkable for their intellectual diversity and depth. Her novels constitute a fascinating exploration for how to have faith in a post-Christian world, and in this way she is the most typical post-Darwinian novelist of the 19th century. Furthermore, during the first half of her career as a novelist, she brought the novel down to earth. If Dickens was unique in writing in his books about many lower and working class characters in an urban setting, George Eliot did much the same for the rural poor. In novels like ADAM BEDE and THE MILL ON THE FLOSS, the bulk of her characters, even the landed characters, are very much below virtually all of the characters in Jane Austen's novels, and set even more off the beaten path than hers. Although she would turn to more universal, less specifically rural characters in themes beginning in ROMOLA and her later novels, SILAS MARNER represents her last exploration of the rural poor. She manages to catch in her pages a rapidly changing world, setting SILAS MARNER in an area where the lone weavers such as Marner were disappearing in favor of industrialized cloth manufacture and the countryside was giving way to a rapidly expanding coal industry (Eliot's part of England is very near what would later be the setting for D. H. Lawrence's coal mining novels, with Lawrence also reflecting in his pages on the changes industrialization had wrought, although he writes from the end of the process while she writes at its beginning).We tend sometimes to think of those who reacted against the Christian faith following Darwin and David Strauss as having forsaken faith entirely, but that is very much not the case. Most Victorians who forsook Christianity looked instead for alternate forms of faith. Take the philosopher Henry Sidgwick, who ceased to believe in Christianity, but founded the Royal Society of Psychical Research. Like many of his age, Sidgwick believed that a supernatural realm was essential to provide the ultimate validity of morality, and no longer believing in Christianity, sought to investigate like a 19th century Fox Mulder a wide range of supernatural phenomena to validate some vague form of faith. Eliot in this novel is desperately trying to believe in something. Like Mulder with the poster on his wall reading \\"I Want to Believe,\\" Eliot wanted faith. Not merely that, but she was convinced that there had to be a viable form of faith to make life worth living. She was hardly the atheistic materialist that many wrongly believe that Darwin produced.Just as Sidgwick believed that there was a supernatural order that make sense of morality (in particular instances of self-sacrifice), so George Eliot clearly sees a divine order in the workings of the world. This is illustrated over and over in SILAS MARNER, where everything balances at the end. Although she no longer believed in the Christian teachings, she remained very much a person of faith and ultimately an optimist. By the end of the novel, no bad deed has gone unpunished and no scales are left unbalanced. In the old expression, \\"Bad deeds will out.\\" But it is also a novel of redemption, with Marner finding his anti-social sins being forgiven and through family and friends discovering, very much to his surprise, happiness.Though George Eliot always liked to write superficially simply stories that were in fact paragraph by paragraph commentaries on the intellectual debates of her age (she had, for instance, been reading widely in German and English theorists on the folktale when writing MARNER), her surface simplicity always feels real and unforced. And the story she created is a lovely one, with vivid characters, a marvelous plot, and a thoroughly satisfying conclusion. I will confess that I came to this novel much, much later than most others who read the book, and only after having read many of her other books. This is one unquestionably one of her most enjoyable and marvelous works."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I was under the sexist opinion that George Eliot was a man. How pleasantly surprising that George was actually Mary Ann Evans, a woman gifted with powerful insight into human behaviour.The story of Silas Marner is that of a wronged man who finds solace in solitude and hoarding. The ritual and monotony of his loom keeps him captive, the reckoning and manifestation of his gold gives him companionship.One day his gold is stolen replaced by a far more precious gem, an orphan girl. An abandoned child offers Silas salvation, a withered miser offers the child a home. Together they change each other and those around them.The story is replete with penetrating behavioural analyses applicable to all of us but just beyond our reach."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXX xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI do not want to rate this at this time.

My parents adopted 3 children, so I love this story's look at adoption and how it's the love and time put into raising a child that are important; being related by blood doesn't matter. This book shows that our mistakes can't truly be hidden; they will always be there in the back of our minds bugging us until they are exposed in the end. So it's best to take responsibility for our mistakes and go through the repentance process, instead of hiding mistakes for \\"convenience.\\" I love how Silas is healed from his suffering and gloom through the love of a child.

They use first-class voice actors and sound effects. However, this version does not quite reach the level of the original book. It is not that there is any lack of quality, but just that something is lost in translation when a book is dramatized. No matter how good a dramatization is, it loses some of the depth of the book.However, this dramatization is high-quality entertainment and I highly recommend it.

And as the book went on, I almost felt myself getting dimmer,more cut off from society. It was rather sad.The book isn't the best representative of what life in 19th century England would have been like, but it is a very good picture of how uncultured people treat other people from other lands. It's only when misfortune falls upon that person, do they accept them.I absolutely loved the fact that Silas found a \\"golden-haired replacement\\". That was the sweetest thing I've read in my life, how he instantly wanted to protect her and give her the best things in life. Godfrey seemed nice at first, but as the book uncovered his past, I started to like him less and less. He needed to act like a man, buck up and take control of his life, and not be constantly cowed by his father. I can understand due to the time period why he thought Eppie would come with him and Nancy, but still, the way he kept asking even after she said no the first time was rude.The book was very uninteresting in the beginning. I had to force myself to read it. It was only after Dunsey stole Silas's money that it began to be interesting. Still, it was a sweet book and I liked it a lot."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"George Eliot is the best woman author I've ever read. She had God-given talent that you or I, no matter how much we read, no matter how much we write, could not consciously replicate. She had something which can't be taught, a kernel of genius hidden somewhere in the brain, which was allowed to express itself...to our collective benefit.Silas Marner, while not perfect, is something recognizably special--a book with lingering phrases, a book with extraordinary insight, a book that instates the reader with the feeling that the author knows what the hell she is doing. It's a book that matters.I know what you are afraid of: you are afraid this book will be a bloated succession of tea parties and persiflage with mutton-chopped vicars. No fear: the plot is credibly organic, and moves along briskly, wrapping itself up in just over two-hundred pages. It should hold your interest so that you can discover the ten or so gem-sentences dispersed throughout. Sentences that are not just airtight, but that meld with your mind, and cause an \\"Aha!\\" reaction. You know what I'm talking about.Perhaps the most convincing signal I can offer of my sincere regard for her abilities is the fact that I'll now seek out her other works...something I can't say about Virginia Woolf, for instance, whose literary inferiority to Eliot I would take as axiomatic. (Ironic, isn't it--or maybe not--that feminists seem to esteem Woolf more highly than Eliot?)"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner by George Eliot, the pen name of Mary Evans, is a well-written story, made more so by the fact it was written by a woman in the Victorian Age. The novel is set in the early nineteenth century England, during a time that society had three distinct classes: the rich and powerful, the working people, and the tradesmen.While the characters personalities in the book seem exaggerated to make there qualities or faults more obvious, Eliot's detailed descriptions of the people made it easy to create a mental picture of them. Though the book is well written, the style of language makes it hard to read and even harder to understand. I found I had to read it more then once and spend time thinking it through to get to the point of enjoying it. Silas Marner has many valuable moral and lessons in it, the most important one being that people are worth more than gold."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"The fact that Amazon has so many editions of Silas Marner available indicates that it is truly a classic if it is still being read more than 150 years after it was written.It is unfortunate that some high school reviewers (or former high school readers) feel that they had this book \\"forced\\" on them. Yes, the English language has changed since the early 19th century, especially for American readers of this British author.My suggestion would be to listen to \\"Silas Marner\\" as an audiobook, perhaps while reading along. I recently finished listening to this fine book narrated by Margaret Hilton, but I couldn't find her rendition among the titles available here. I'm sure there are many fine versions available.So, give this tale a listen, and let the language flow into your ears. Then you will discover why this tale about a miserly old weaver, who has been wronged by his neighbors more than once, finds redemption and a new life when he adopts the little girl left on his doorstep is truly a classic."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Very worthwhile- a classic! Everyone should read this once- lots of valuable lessons to be learned as well as entertainment to be had."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"The modern world with its IVF initiatives and other assisted fertility procedures have lead us to reflect on the role of nature and nurture as the prime developmental instrument in the character and personality of children - and also of the rights of parents. But it was a great surprise to me to find George Eliot writing of this so long ago - and I think there is little doubt where her sentiments lay (but then the issue in 'Silas Marner' was clouded by the involvement of the innocent and victimised, versus the guilty and self-possessed - but I'm sure that was written by design to emphasise a point).For a while 'Silas Marner' is a detective story. I had always thought Edgar Alan Poe was the originator of the detective story - but perhaps 'Silas Marner' may have been a trigger. This is an interesting mystery because we know who the culprit is and who the victim is - but will the culprit be exposed? and if so, how? For me, the circumstances of the crime was a little contrived but it did create a stimulating situation. But then the events of the story overtake the mystery and displace its resolution. When the resolution does come it is a real shock, not only to the reader but to characters as well - the ending is gripping and brings forth such desires for the four principle characters that I found it quite breathtaking to read.Some reviewers have bemoaned the use of this novel as a student reading text. I agree with them. I remember struggling through books inappropriate to my time when I was a student. It is only when people get older that they start becoming attuned to their history and the background to their society. The first George Eliot novel I read was 'Adam Bede' and its portayal of the Methodism I grew up with as an innovative cult was fascinating. But, as a youth, I'm sure it would have been just wierd. What would I recommend as a student text? Something current and engaging. As I have suggested elsewhere Philip K Dick's 'A Scanner Darkly' with its non-judgemental observations on the tragedy of individual destruction by the use of drugs, might have many levels of value to a student learning about literature."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I can not describe how painful this book was. The first quarter of the book goes at the pace of a moderately entertaining tale, but then grinds to a halt as soon as Silas is leashed with the orphan girl. This book stands out in my memory not just for instilling a loathing of the written word that nearly took my away from literature for the rest of my life, but for the great amount of negative space it left in my brain when I try to recall some of the \\"excitement\\" of the drudgery of Silas's everyday life.Truly a GREAT classic to unload on junior high children."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"After reading this terribly long and boring book, I found myself slamming my head against the wall in a vain attempt to dislodge the terrible memory of it.
