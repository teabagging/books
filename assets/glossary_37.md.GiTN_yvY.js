The interest to this reader was in seeing how irrelevant most of these issues were to the survival of the Confederacy, and yet how important they were to its leaders. In addition, while we frequently read of Lincoln's interactions with his cabinet and with members of the United States Congress, we less often have the chance to view the other side.The prospective reader should be warned, however, that the book's title and subtitle wildly misrepresent its contents. The book describes neither a betrayal nor a new explanation for the South's defeat. (Had president and congress worked together in total harmony, a situation that has never existed in human history, they would not have saved the Confederacy.) A more accurate title would be: \\"Confederate Politics - How the Leaders of the South Attempted to Govern in the Middle of the War they had Made,\\" but this title would doubtless have reduced sales."},{"Title":"Dixie Betrayed: How the South Really Lost the Civil War","review":"Overall, this was a very easily digestible and enjoyable book to read. At the core of \\"Dixie Betrayed\\", Eicher is making two arguments. They are arguments that have been made many times before. First, that the ideological nature of the states rights argument probably doomed the C.S.A., and second, that Lost Cause romanticism has created a distortion of the true narrative of the American Civil War. However, these are good arguments to make.I feel like this book was intended to be approachable to a wide audience but will not serve much of a purpose for veteran Civil War scholars. In essence, I liked this book and learned a great deal from it but something about it makes it feel like it isn't quite the stuff that a professor teaching me the subject would assign.I think this book best serves people looking for a general study of the Civil War in a quick and painless fashion and anyone who has never looked at a good argument against the Lost Cause outlook of the war."},{"Title":"Dixie Betrayed: How the South Really Lost the Civil War","review":"Eicher in Dixie Betrayed is refreshing in his willingness to be politically incorrect in his description of men and events leading to the failure of the Confederacy. Nothing he writes is new, but few historians have been willing to be so frank. Dixie Betrayed reminds me greatly of James Street's The Civil War: An Unvarnished Account of the Late but Still Lively Hostilities, which I first read in high school in the late '50s. Do not read either book if you subscribe to the Confederate myth."},{"Title":"Dixie Betrayed: How the South Really Lost the Civil War","review":"Dixie Betrayed tells of the relationships between Jefferson Davis as President of the Confederacy and many of the politicians and generals in that nation. The idea that a government dominated by state-rights advocates is weak is certainly not new. Eicher sets out to show the weakness of the Confederate central government through a series of vignettes describing the relation between Davis and some other person in the government. The two main problems with this approach are: (1) Eicher assumes I know lots of things about the obscure people in the Confederate government already (which I don't); and (2) there seems to be no central thesis that is supported.I expect that a well written biography of Davis would cover most of this material in a much more comprehensive manner."},{"Title":"The Year of Silence (Contemporary American Fiction)","review":"I had the pleasure of studying under Madison Smartt Bell at the University of Iowa's Writers Workshop in the late 1980s, and THE YEAR OF SILENCE was the only impression I'd had of him. But what an impression! Set in various parts of Manhattan and my home town of Brooklyn, I was in awe of this writer's command of his craft and his knowledge of the city. I figured he's spent decades honing his talents. When I arrived at the workshop, I discovered that Bell was NOT from New York City and that he was younger than me. Naturally, I wanted to strangle him.Anyway, THE YEAR OF SILENCE is a wise and sympathetic novel that prompted as many re-readings as there are narrators. Every voice is honest (even the con artist/breaking-and-entering specialist) and, above all, appealing in their own ways. Structurally, the multiple points of view is very effective, especially when you consider the book is set in the city where a person can touch so many lives (and is set in the city where everyone thinks their point of view is so important). However, the fact is that the death of the protagonist, Marian, did affect so many people who, on the surface, seem so disaffected. Marian, herself, is given a chance to speak before her untimely passing. In its way, the novel is a sort of AS I LAY DYING set in 1980s New York City.The strength of THE YEAR OF SILENCE, and I'll repeat this, is the profound appeal, the extreme humanity, of its narrators. I almost wish each one had his or her own novel. My favorite is an invalided old woman whose grandson races her through the NYU area in her wheelchair. Although she had only known Marian in passing, the news of her death prompts one of the most elegant but simple reveries on life, death and old age. THE YEAR OF SILENCE captures New Yorkers in a way that has rarely been done before. Of course, it was written by an out-of-towner."},{"Title":"The Year of Silence (Contemporary American Fiction)","review":"This book is about how the suicide of a woman named Marian affects those who knew her. All these people have problems. They hate their jobs. They hate their lives. Some hate both. An example of this is a cop more interested in winning a crime pool than really helping people. We don't really get to know the people in these stories including Marian, which would seem to me to be essential. She has bad luck with men, had a couple of abortions and got into drugs. We really don't find out much more about her than that. The only character we really get to know is the dwarf panhandler/pickpocket named Jocko. His story is well fleshed out and so is he. We get a sense of who he is and how he sees the world. I would have liked to read more about him. If not for the story about him reading this book would be a complete waste of time. I found this book's title to be very appropriate since the characters don't have much of a voice. I would give this one and a half stars if I could, but since I can't it has to settle for one."},{"Title":"The Cooking Of Vienna's Empire - Foods Of The World","review":"Fabulous collection of classic recipes of the area.

The job in this book was to survey the predominant opinions of elites and the working class toward the place of laborin 19th century American life. The author uses primary sources but also makes use of quite a few of the works of other authors.He surveys a myriad of subjects of the 19th century US. He starts off with a discussion of indentured servitude in the U.S, which lasted into the mid-19th century. He discusses how elites and the nascent American labor movement in the early 19th century used common law and Jeffersonian traditions to argue about the rights of labor in American life. He describes the evolution of the customs of workers at the Harper's Ferry military arsenal, which evolved in tandem with the spread of capitalism in the United States. He surveys how the proletariat of New York expressed themselves politically through ethnic and religious based political machines. Working people in urban areas often served in paramilitary formations on behalf of these political machines and engaged in street warfare against other political groups. He shows how charity was increasingly co-opted by the wealthy after the mid-19th century. This conservative approach to charity argued that the poor were lazy and mentally deficient and should only receive assistance if they agreed to hard labor. This approach was used in New York in the mid-1870's. From 1873 to 1878/79 there was an economic depression in the United States. Wealthy charity advocates convinced the city government of New York that they should provide the \\"deserving poor\\" with assistance while at the same time the police arrested other paupers, close to a million people, on charges of vagrancy.He discusses the role of the military in relation to the workers movement. Labor activists often felt ambivalent about military formations in America life. The experience of military service in the Civil War shaped a positive strain in the views of some workers toward military culture. The fact that the government continued to expand access to pensions for war veterans and widows of veterans throughout the 19th century was an additional military related factor that could help workers. However the Civil War also saw the imposition of marital law against mine workers resisting military conscription in parts of Pennsylvania. Then of course there was the terrible anti-conscription riot of July 1863 when thousands of white working class persons rampaged throughout the city, looting the homes of the rich, engaging in violence against prominent Republicans and lynching African Americans. The anger of the New York rioters was stoked in large part by the fact that the Federal goverment's military draft law allowed people to avoid conscription by paying the government $300, which, of course, only the rich could afford to do. In the 1870's and 1880's communities of organized urban immigrant workers sometimes formed armed self-defense organizations in the face of anti-labor violence by the authorities. Intervention by the National Guard against striking workers was a constant threat in the 1880's and 1890's to say nothing of the early 20th century. Workers could seldom rely on the authorities to impose decent standards of wages and conditions on employers. Eight hour laws, worker safety, laws banning child labor,etc. were usually not adhered to by employers and would often be declared unconstitutional by the judiciary."},{"Title":"Algerian White","review":"I bought this book hoping to find info about the algerian writers mentioned on the back cover, what I found was more interesting.. detailed info about the turbulance in algeria, personal experiences,stories and very important history of a sister country our arab jounalism failed to report and/or bring to us.

He is big and awkward and can't always understand what's going on, but he does know he loves to play football and that he wants to make a goal! Chris would just like to get on with being the captain of his team and ignore Danny, but he just can't--the kid really has determination...Even when the other students make fun of him, Danny keeps trying and Chris is always ready to defend him. In an exciting climax everybody sees some unexpected action out of Danny--now affectionately known as &quot;Dazzer&quot; and this fast-moving story comes to an exciting end.

Granted, this book may be more appropriate for older readers, but younger ones will also benefit as they prepare for the &quot;prime of life&quot;.Among the principles MacDonald covers include:1. Abraham exercised great faith when he left the comforts of his home and followed God's voice to go to a new land.2. Although Abraham experienced scars in his life, he was a man who learned to trust God.3. We have to go to quiet places to get a glimpse of God's majesty. Faith is built in the tough places of life.4. Character is what truly exists in the hidden life of a person. A fall in character is often due to the neglecting the inner life.5. Principles of perseverence.6. Jesus was (and is) very interested in a person's character.7. A person's character is revealed in impossible situations.8. To have life change, we must be willing to reach for the unfamiliar.All in all, an excellent and highly recommended book!"},{"Title":"Mid-Course Correction: Re-Ordering Your Private World for the Second Half of Life","review":"I have been a fan of Gordon MacDonald's books for almost a quarter century because he is so strongly focused on the practical aspects of the Christian life. This, his latest book, deals with the question of moving onward to the next step. He is convinced that God has more for His people if we live a life of continuing &quot;mid-course corrections&quot;. No matter what apparent disaster has befallen the Christ-follower, God can use it to bring good. If you are finding your spiritual life a bit flat, here you may find hope from one who has learned from experience that God is a God of the second chance."},{"Title":"Mid-Course Correction: Re-Ordering Your Private World for the Second Half of Life","review":"&quot;Mid-Course Correction&quot; is Gordon MacDonald's best book to date. As in all of his books, this is a very practical book, full of concrete suggestions. He suggests that all of us need to be in a lifelong process of continuing conversion. Either we need to escape from a certain staleness in our life, or we need to become more dedicated &quot;Christ-followers&quot; He sees Abraham as the most relevant model for conversion because his conversion was most like that which people today face. He, and we, come from a pagan culture and need to learn much that some from the culture (or subculture) take for granted. MacDonald is a gifted storyteller who uses events from his own life as well as biblical narrative to illustrate his points effectively. read this book, you will be better for doing so."},{"Title":"Mid-Course Correction: Re-Ordering Your Private World for the Second Half of Life","review":"I read this book when I was in my mid thirties (preparing for mid-life) and now I have read it a second time in my mid forties (wrestling and struggling with mid-life). I must admit that I enjoyed it more this time around, because I have been bruised, bent, and broken a lot more than I ever experienced in my thirties or up until that point. I suppose I will probably be reading this book again in my mid fifties too!I am partial to MacDonald's writing because he is a deep thinker, good story-teller, and weaves biblical principles in ways that are practical, well thought ought, and go beyond clich&eacute;s.This book is beneficial in helping one pause and take stock and evaluate their life. It is especially geared to helping those who aren't sure what to do with their lives; have had to, or desire to change careers, or are out of work; wrestling with meaning, purpose, and in need of hope and direction. It is thought provoking and doesn't necessarily give all the answers you may be looking for, but sets you on the right course - and helps to correct taking the wrong course for sure.In the body of the book MacDonald weaves his own story (and our own) with those of Abraham, Moses, The People of Israel, Paul, and the Disciples and uses the outline of the fact that we need to leave something behind; learn to follow Christ; and reach for higher possibilities. Learning, following, and reaching are well developed emotionally, spiritually, and practically and steeped in a good theology of \\"being\\" like Christ, rather than merely \\"doing\\" all the time.Gordon emphasizes the fact that God wants us to have depth of character, and this depth can really only be achieved through suffering, faith when we can't see, trying when we don't know if we will succeed. However, all these factors and more are necessary in our lives in order that we may become deep people internally (in and from the soul) with proven character.I have been helped significantly through MacDonald's writing as a broken man to another broken man, and have been given more hope through his writing in pointing me to Jesus - the only One worth following, being like, and living for. Gordon writes like a master surgeon on the soul - taking out what needs to be removed and fixes what needs to be repaired. GMAC (I'm told that's what his friends call him) - thanks again for your writing that goes deep into the mind and heart and for healing wounds and souls for the glory of God."},{"Title":"Mid-Course Correction: Re-Ordering Your Private World for the Second Half of Life","review":"I purchased this title with high hopes, after having read the author's book \\"Ordering Your Private World.\\" I'm a little disappointed -- he could have done better here. His basic principles are good, but the way he develops them lacks clear focus.When reading the title, the impression many potential readers will have is, \\"I have been in the Lord's service for years, but I sense God taking me in a new and different life direction. Surely this book will have some detailed answers.\\" MacDonald does offer some basic insights, but he fails to develop them well. The author looks back to the life of Abraham and other Biblical characters for guidance as to how God may lead us to change mid-course in our lives. The three ideas he seeks to develop through the book are leave, follow and reach.For those to whom God offers mid-course correction, the first thing He does is to call them to leave something. Just as Abraham was called to leave Haran, so we may be called to leave something with which we are very familiar. The second thing God does is to require them to follow. Abraham had to follow God in his journey of life, growing deeper and deeper in character. He was changed into someone who learned to rely more and more on God and less and less upon himself. So we too, once we leave something, must follow God as he refines and strengthens godly character within us. The third thing God does is to compel them to reach. Abraham was never content with the status quo, but was always reaching for more of what God desired for him. The Apostle Paul also was one who pressed forward toward the mark, willing to strain and to stretch to become more of God's man. So we too much always be reaching and yearning to stretch for all God has for us.The threefold theme of this book is very helpful -- leave, follow, and reach. Many of the stories used and the comments made to develop the theme however, lack clarity. MacDonald sets the bar very high with \\"Ordering Your Private World.\\" This title falls short of that standard, so despite its good insights it is disappointing."},{"Title":"Mid-Course Correction: Re-Ordering Your Private World for the Second Half of Life","review":"Gordon MacDonald is, in my opinion, one of the best possible writers on how to surffer, survive and grow through living those awkward years of a man's growth to maturity. We think we are mature until the bottom falls out, and then we relequish control to the One Who should have had it all along, but somehow, we didn't get it.

For the most part it is not overwhelmed by non-stop action and passion but instead uses a more realistic approach to relationships and life. People need time. They need time to get to know themselves and each other.The heroine is a confused young woman pulled into a storm and blinded by beauty and false charm. The hero is not a he-man. With the exception of his being rich, he is a regular man, perhaps even better than the average man. The women do not drool as he walks by; he is often overlooked (even by the heroine). His sense of patience, honor and kindness sets the overall mood which also works as a foil to his brother's, the original fiance, unpleasant behavior and actions.Overall, this story is a wonderful change of pace and a pleasant read."},{"Title":"Comparative Strangers (Harlequin Romance)","review":"Yep, the way the hero is described reminds me of Ben Cumberbatch's Sherlock and how brainy is the new sexy! It's a disservice to this uber-male to even think in terms of alpha and beta types. He is so beyond that and simply to die for.But, alas, not to our heroine. She is a very sweet girl, earnest if a bit simple-minded, naive rather than stupid, and I don't think she does cryptic crosswords. Naturally she falls for the flashy racing-driver brother and regards the hero as a neutered oddball. Actually hero is a highly specialized MD (a pharmacologist or biochemist, I think). And hoo boy! has she read him wrong. Low-key, incisive (mind) and lethal is more like it.When heroine catches sociopathic bro in flagrante, true to his nature, he turns nasty and scary. H/h turn to one another for support and slowly love happens like an unreliable bus schedule, comin', goin', detours n'all.The characters are fascinating and solidly portrayed. The storyline pulled me in and not so predictable as most M&Bs.; The h/h interaction is very absorbing, and funny, too, because the hero has the mind of a chess grandmaster behind the bland facade and the poor heroine has no idea what she's getting into. Their romance progresses at a thrilling pace, major focus on how heroine came to be aware then finally love the hero. The sexual tension (that \\"I can't breathe' atmosphere which is a different thing from mere smutty details) when she starts becoming aware of him is so delicious and excitingly played-out that it gave me a few shivers. The ending was very satisfying.This has got to be the best Sara Craven I have ever read and one of the best M&Bs; and is on my keeper shelf.

When a chef is driven to suicide by a critical restaurant review, Marc embarks on an odyssey of apologies to all the people he has wronged. From there its only a hop skip and a jump to Marc being appointed Chief Apologist at the UN. Not that Marc skips or jumps very much, given that he is a rather portly fellow who loves his food. Marc proceeds to apologise his way through a the whole smorgasbord of the world's wrongs and learns that sorry doesn't always make it better. (Stopping often to eat along the way.)Often cynical, sometimes insightful, this book is a reminder never to get mixed up in bureaucratic fads and always have a good PR consultant on your pay-roll. The food descriptions are to die for, especially the chocolates and of course the author has very thoughtfully added a list of suppliers.All in all, a very entertaining read- if you like your fiction flavoured with a dash of sadism- believe me it get really ugly at the end there, proving once again that sorry really is the hardest word."},{"Title":"Evolution and Prehistory: The Human Challenge (with InfoTrac)","review":"Although this is a great read to further understand the basics of anthropology.

He is the chief who returned with Lewis and Clark to Washington to be greeted by Jefferson himself. It was the delayed and troubled return of Sheheke to the Mandan Villages that ultimately led to Meriwether Lewis's death. A fascinating new angle on the Lewis & Clark Expedition, with keen insights into the amazing Mandan Indian culture.

Watson's points--that management and political jargon are the enemies of both clear writing and the more poetic kind, while serving to obscure facts--are well taken. But they could easily have been made in 30 pages, rather than 150. A few examples of how to fix some of the sentences are useful, but the real-life examples of jargon like \\"Key Performance Indicators\\" (KPI) quickly grow tedious.To get the same lessons in one-tenth the time, skip this book and re-read Orwell's essay \\"Politics and the English language\\"."},{"Title":"Death Sentences: How Cliches, Weasel Words and Management-Speak Are Strangling Public Language","review":"Nothing should be easier than to agree with than a book that takes exactly the same position on a subject dear to my heart--writing clearly and succinctly. Yet \\"Death Sentences,\\" which does a good job of trotting out a shoebox full of mangled bureaucratese, only shows why clear writing is not the same as clear thinking. Australian writer/intellectual Don Watson's work starts sanguinely enough. He lists scores of examples of the deadening incomprehensible corporate-speak, military-speak and advertising-speak. \\"Employment outcomes,\\" \\"quality participation opportunities,\\" and \\"major change drivers,\\" are just some of the oleaginous verbal slop thickly slathered on as mission statements, empowerment manifestos, or the proclamation of multicultural diversity.At the beginning of the book I felt myself nodding in agreement with the many examples of the problem, a problem that not only offends sensibilities (of requiring writing to be understood), but which seems almost designed to conceal meaning.Yet, after 40 pages of examples interspersed with homilies, I began to experience a sense of uneasiness. O.K., professional writing is going down the tubes; now what? By 60 pages I became impatient. Yes, much corporate-speak is abominable; what's next? Why, other than being ugly, is this bad? And is there a cure?Well, there was nothing next--only another 120 pages of more of the same. No indication of the extent of the problem. No explication of any actual harm. And no cure was mooted. The only change of cadence was a lurch into a series of anti-Bush barbs, as if he were the only American politician who ever mangled the English language. Malapropisms cherry-picked from the presidential campaign were notable only by the complete absence of a single Kerry grammatical flip-flop.The result is a 167-page listing of linguistic laments, annotated by the author, that could as well have been Xeroxed on a half-dozen pages. What is needed now is a sequel to this book to describe clearly and succinctly, why clear writing would make for good politics or good business. (Maybe it wouldn't.) Unfortunately, Watson's book starts a good argument that he fatally fails to finish."},{"Title":"Death Sentences: How Cliches, Weasel Words and Management-Speak Are Strangling Public Language","review":"Let me dissent from the praise this book has received.I found Watson's style overblown and pompous. He criticises modern discourse for lacking both passion and clarity. Fair enough. But he confuses the two; passion doesn't make for clarity. Often, the opposite.Some occasions demand a cool head, and the writing which describes them should reflect that.For example, Watson spends most of page 31 arguing why he prefers the phrase \\"universities are under siege\\" to \\"universities are under pressure\\". The second phrase smells of \\"21st century secular Methodists\\", whereas the first calls to mind the Trojans, who, like their counterparts in academia, live behind walls and who \\"have something the besiegers want--not a woman in this case, but their submission certainly.\\"To use an old-fahioned Australian phrase, get your hand off it. \\"Under pressure\\" will do just fine, thanks.Colour and metaphor are great. But too much makes for verbal sludge, just as thick and gooey as the bureaucratic double-speak Watson criticises.I really don't need to hear that modern official language obscures rather than informs. Orwell and others established that long ago. Where's the new spin? Watson gives none.On p. 139, he observes that Martin Luther King knew a good speech is like a song. A good book isn't. I personally found Watson's constant chorus of disgust a little hard to listen to, over and over, gilded with obscure references and going nowhere."},{"Title":"Death Sentences: How Cliches, Weasel Words and Management-Speak Are Strangling Public Language","review":"The premise of this book is sound, but as other reviewers have said, it is an unstructured mess. It starts off well enough, but after a few chapters of directionless examples of bad language, one starts to become bored.Then, part way through the book, Watson starts showing his true colours. On page 103 he takes an inoffensive quote from Australia's ex-PM (John Howard), that being \\"As a people, we have traditionally engaged the world optimistically. Our open, friendly nature makes us welcome guests and warm hosts\\", and then spends the next page arguing that this echoes the propaganda of the Third Reich. Earth to Don: the Nazis wore shoes, but all people who wear shoes aren't Nazis. We know you're a red-hot Labor man and hate Howard's guts, but be a good fellow and keep it out of your book about public language.The book is replete with this type of stuff. Avoid."},{"Title":"Death Sentences: How Cliches, Weasel Words and Management-Speak Are Strangling Public Language","review":"The author makes excellent points about the wind of pompous, meaningless jargon and deceptive spin that has swept through government, business and academia. I personally trudged through a lot of this muck in the social \\"sciences\\" and share the author's concern for the erosion of the language. We are losing our ability (or is it will?) to say what we mean in a way that is easy to understand and worth the reader's time.Chapter 1 should be digested by everyone whose job requires them to write or speak. In the beginning I thought the book was a 4; by page 58 I was thinking 3 stars; and by chapter 3 it was in freefall. His own writing bogs down in muddy thinking and poorly chosen examples. I lost sight of his sails as he drifted off point and disappeared in a fog of philosophical opportunism.I still recommend chapter 1, but get it from your library.

Have you ever attempted to read a book of laws--the rules by which we are all supposed to live in this country--and given up in utter frustration at your inability to understand any word other than \\"the\\"? Do you wonder why no one's said anything original in a TV commercial in decades (assuming you don't simply record everything and fast-forward through the commercials, as I've been doing for years)? In that case, Australian curmudgeon Don Watson's rant on the dumbing down of the English language is right up your alley.I tend to like my grammar books replete with footnotes and diagrams, but Watson is pointing out features of the modern language that don't require them; it's easy to find a plethora of examples of everything he attacks by just looking around us. Open up a company's annual report, or just look at the polished bronze plaque with the company's mission statement on the wall, and you've got examples out the wazoo. And lord help you if you attempt to read some of the crap that gets introduced in Congress. (Given that no one in Congress actually reads the legislation they vote on, which is common knowledge these days, you have to wonder--who's writing the stuff? No, I don't know either.) It all makes Watson (whose government, it seems, is as awful as ours when it comes to this stuff) want to beat his head against something pointed, and I have to agree with him. Given the book's bestseller status, I'm not the only one by a longshot.No matter how much you agree with a book's premise, though, if it's badly-written, you'll get less out of it than you otherwise would. Death Sentences is a wonderfully entertaining little book on top of it all, and that makes a great deal of difference. Anyone can rant, but it takes a true auteur to do it with style. Watson (a speechwriter by trade) knows how to rant with all the style necessary and then some.

Politicians, corporations, news media and the rest have learned how to talk without communicating. After all, if you say anything, it cna't help but offend someone. Taken out of the context in which they were intend, it is certainly funny to see the words that the author uses to illustrate his points.One point that he doesn't mention is the growth of paper written by non-English speakers.

Winchester makes a repeated point of how popular he is among South Koreans by virtue of his being English; that was snotty enough by the third go-round. What did me in was the time he arrived at a U S base, browbeat them into letting him stay there (when they didn't have to), and then proceeded to trash just about every single U S military person he ran across after accepting their hospitality. He also had a penchant for running into anti-American Koreans; you'd think they were rife, along with all of the many prostitutes throwing themselves at him. Oh yeah, there was one old soldier, fawningly pro-British, as though the U K had been the ones who saved South Korea.Yes, there's well-researched history here, hence a second star.

His only contact with the Koreans themselves seems to come through the sex industry, as he visits in turn a hostess bar, a strip club, and a barber shop/massage parlor. One cannot help but detect a note of wishful thinking in the author's descriptions of Korean women eager to service him.

There is insufficient insight into why Koreans are different from the Japanese and the Chinese, though all 3 great nations are so close to one another.For an Asian who would probably know Korea an bit more than fellow readers from the Western world, I do not find this book entertaining at all.

There is plenty of other perspective and imagery throughout his walk that you may dwell upon if you're looking for a romantic time. It was written in the 80s though, so you'll want to get up to date - after you go and read the Journal of Hamel and his shipwrecked accounts from the mid 17th century!Winchester's language is smart. His writing structure is a breath of fresh air as someone so smart chooses to write so freely. As a fan of Krakatoa I must highly recommend this book as well."},{"Title":"Korea","review":"Like one of the other reviewers mentioned, I was also intrigued by the simple design on the cover: sepia, Chinese characters, empty pair of shoes. I expected something thought-provoking, deep, contemplative and perhaps a little wistful. \\"Korea\\" turns out to be none of these.Books about Asia by western authors tend to fall into two categories: those by authors who \\"get it\\" and go deep, and those by authors who can't, and don't try, and instead parade their cultural biases around the country they visit and propagate shallow stereotypes.Winchester does try, and some of his diversions on Korean history and culture are fascinating, especially for someone who knows nothing about the place. This book is also interesting as something of a period piece,since Korea has doubtlessly changed a lot since the book was written.Unfortunately, Winchester doesn't get very far before he falls victim to the same sweeping generalizations that ruin books like this one: Koreans are \\"full of anger\\" and they're all \\"constantly depressed\\". Sure. For having traveled so far, his understanding of the Korean people is quite shallow. This is probably because he spends more time with foreigners than with Koreans to begin with, and it puts his book squarely in the latter category.Nevertheless, it's a quick, fun read, and there's definitely something to be learned from this book. The last chapter, on his visit to the DMZ, was by far the best. If you want to read a book about Asia by a western author who really gets it, and really connects to the place he's at, try one of the books on Japan by Alex Kerr or Alan Booth. At least Winchester's book is honest, and it's one of the few we have by someone who at least tries to understand Korea."},{"Title":"Korea","review":"The book's cover is very misleading. I have been around the world; South Korea twice, I have never experienced the negativity of what Mr. Winchester experienced. Korea is a nice country and the book is very misleading to people who have never been to South Korea.BUY THIS BOOK IF: You want to learn about a year 1985 pessimistic journey in Korea, prostitutes, stereotypes, politics, DMZ, American soldiers' negative opinion about Korea, an irrelevant comparison between Japan and South Korea.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK IF: you want to learn about the real South Korea and Koreans."},{"Title":"Korea","review":"A well written book with many first-hand experiences by the author as he walked through Korea following the historic route.

Maybe to trap buyers whohave a real curiosity about Korea the \\"Land of Miracles\\".After all the back story of Korea is truly interesting. Weall know about and have at least a curiosity about theKorean economy, the academics, the general orderliness,about Korea. But this is a bait and catch book. Thereis no understanding of Korea culture, the people, orthe history. Winchester just wants to satisfy his ownego and show what a \\"cool\\" guy he is. There are the usual East/Westposturing stands that are very tired, very obviousintentionally or unintentionally in the book. A better,writer of greater integrity is needed to explore these issues.Search \\"Korea\\" and read about in Wikipedia.

Happily, I can say that I have loved his interesting and insightful looks at plate tectonics, China, the OED, San Francisco, Krakatoa, Joseph Needham, so when I began the Korea book, I expected to be thoroughly engrossed. What a disappointment! It seems as if an aide ghost wrote it for him. The outlook is that of an overeager teenage boy about to enter his first house of ill repute, in fact this becomes so boring, it is difficult to finish the book. Winchester judges all Americans by the servicemen whom he meets at the bars and bordellos, well all except for one literate officer. Sorry, I cannot say anything more positive about this book.This was a total waste of money and of time - his, mine and anyone, who reads it."},{"Title":"Korea","review":"This book is well written and full of factual information. The stories descriping his travels include those things of every day life: eating, sleeping, contentment,humor, nature, people and more.

I've seen lots of really patronizing belittling of Korean customs in my time (there are expat message boards that are unpleasantly full of it) but ... I didn't see any of it in Winchester's book. He tends toward the sardonic, to be sure, but I get the feeling he'd be the same way if he were writing a travelouge of, say, New Hampshire. (The only other book of his I've read is \\"The Professor and the Madman\\", so I may be wrong here.)Maybe I'm breaking an Amazon rule about commenting on other people's comments, but \\"He even complains that in the country-side people have electricy and TVs, as if he expected Korea to be preserved as a medieval theme park for his viewing pleasure.\\"? Excuse me? He STATES at one point that countryside people have electricity and TVs, to be sure, but where is the verb \\"complain\\" being dredged from?To be sure, Winchester has a fascination with Korean women, and Korean prostitutes, and I don't think it would fatally injure the book if he'd left some of those details out. So, yeah, I could see how somebody could have a problem with his treatment of women. Otherwise, the only issue I can see that someone could truly be offended by is his utter non-treatment of Gyeongsang province, home of Busan and Daegu and Gyeonju but which he only mentions when he visits the thoroughly dull industrial city of Ulsan. I can picture proud Gyeongsang partisans getting thoroughly riled up..."},{"Title":"Korea","review":"This was the only book of Simon's I had not read. I can truly say now that I have enjoyed them all! Korea and it's people come alive. Reading a Simon Winchester book should be counted as a college level course. And it is always far more interesting."},{"Title":"Korea","review":"This is a great book for several reasons: the author actually speaks some Korean, he engages people all the time, he fills the gaps with actual historical facts and, most of all, he is not politically correct !This last point is the fact that irritates some of the reviewers here. Winchester says what he thinks, instead of trying to please people who are closed to any different opinion than their own. One reviewer complains that he tells if the women he meets are beautiful. Come on, the guy is a man ! What do you expect? He is also a foreigner, therefore, some of his views as an outsider will be in the book. If you want a book by Korea by a native, look for one. Or buy a book by Bill Bryson, where he only says good things about the places he goes.In fact, Winchester is very balanced. The author meets and talks about intelligent and independent women, and is sympathetic to their problems in such a traditional society. He criticizes the ways of some redneck American soldiers, but also praises the sacrifices of the Americans and the sensitivity of the American commander. The only problem of the book is that it ends soon, when there is so much else to learn.Guys, the key to intellectual development is an open mind and curiosity. Political correctness of the kind seen in the reviews here closes the mind and dumbs down people. You miss the pearls of wisdom because you can't get past the little details that bother your ultra-sensitive feelings. Grow up."},{"Title":"Korea","review":"I picked up this book hoping to get some insight into Korean life, culture, and customs. The subtitle--\\"A Walk Through the Land of Miracles\\" was also very appealing. However, Winchester should have subtitled this book--\\"Why I Hate Korea\\". His condescending attitude drips off of every word.The first problem with this book is that for a book that is supposed to be about Korea, he spends an awful lot of time with foreigners in Korea. In fact, you'll learn more about Irish missionaries and American soldiers than you will about Koreans. I would say that about 50 percent of the people he encounters in this book are not Korean. To make matters worse, the Koreans he does encounter are a weird lot (probably due to the fact that he is hanging around American bases rather than where descent family people would go). Of the Koreans he encounters, nearly half of them are prostitutes. From Winchester's account, you might believe that Korea is crawling with prostitutes. This is surprising due to the fact that Korea is a quite conservative country. My only guess is that Mr. Winchester went out of his way looking for prostitutes. So, instead of the land of miracles promised in the subtitle, you get the land of seedy red light districts.As if this weren't bad enough, Mr. Winchester has a very sexist attitude. Of the Korean women he met that weren't prostitutes, he always adds the adjective pretty or attractive, as if he were sizing up every woman he met for a romantic encounter. In fact, he tells us that many of them threw themselves upon him. Well, good for him, but I don't want to waste my time on reading about it. None of the Koreans he mentions seem to have any personality (as described by Winchester). There's no sense that he is meeting actual people.The final thing that I found really unpleasant was the way he kept belittling Korean customs and culture, and in the same breath complains about the loss of traditional Korean culture. In one sentence, he trumpets the glories of Kendal Mint Cakes and derides kimchi as a stink that makes him sick. He complains about sleeping on the floor, yet he'll shed tears when he sees a modern bed. He even complains that in the country-side people have electricy and TVs, as if he expected Korea to be preserved as a medieval theme park for his viewing pleasure.I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea. Don't bother with this horrible book. You can find better."},{"Title":"Korea","review":"This book details the author's walking tour in South Korea in the late 80's. Though tidbits of interesting historical and cultural facts are included, they were written in a disorganized and anecdotal manner. Occasionally careless statements about the Koreans and Asians were made, clearly with exaggeration or overgeneralization.Though the author said he loved Korea, what stands out page after page is the superiority complex he displayed for the land and the people. He mocked their age-old customs and current undertakings and gave proud accounts of his own bad behavior during his travel. The air of arrogance and condescension exudes from every single line. I am not a Korean, but even I am offended. The author obviously fails to understand that not everybody regards Kendal Mint Cake the best thing since sliced bread."},{"Title":"Korea","review":"Before reading this book, my understanding of Korea was as hazy as a foggy day in Seoul. Korea? Didn't they host the Olympics a few years back? And I think there was a messy war in the fifties that led to partition; the South became prosperous; the North became weird. Oh, and don't they eat dogs? Well, now the fog has cleared, and it's all thanks to Simon Winchester's absorbing and entertaining journey through this fascinating land. And yes, there are some references to canine cuisine, but more of that later.The basis of the book is the author's decision to follow in the footsteps of a group of Dutch sailors who were shipwrecked off the Korean coast in 1633. And I really do mean in their footsteps: he walks all the way from the southern coast to the edge of the North Korean border (he would have gone further, but the American border guards threatened to break his legs). He describes the places and people along the way, but digresses to explain Korean history, culture, politics and language in a way that's far removed from the dusty old history book.His journey begins on Cheju Island, off the southern coast, where thousands of Koreans go for their holidays. It's here that he meets Father Patrick McGlinchey (one of the McGlincheys of Cheju, presumably), who explains how a group of Irish missionaries raise sheep and knit Aran sweaters, which I think is an inventive way of converting folk to Christianity. They've been here since the 1950s and feel quite at home - apparently, if you screw up your eyes until they're almost closed, Cheju looks just like ConnemaraReaching the mainland, the author continues his trek, and finds drivers and bus passengers waving, smiling at him, offering him lifts, food and cans of fruit juice, just like they would in Glasgow. To us, the South Koreans would appear to be the most hospitable people on earth, but they themselves feel that Western influences are tainting their traditional ways. So much so that one observer expresses the view that, while North Korea is an ugly way to run a country, its people have retained their sense of respect for each other and resisted the Coca-Cola-nisation embraced by the South. Even so, the author's encounters with ordinary South Koreans are among the most charming and moving parts of his journey.Inevitably, the subject of dog-eating raises its snout, and having sampled some, Winchester professes it to be \\"...very strong, very rich and with a background flavour of kidney\\". But it soon becomes clear that Koreans don't eat their four legged friends for any other reason than to improve their libido. In short, forget Viagra, try Fido.For much the same reason, ginseng is big in Korea, but it also has huge cultural and economic importance. The author's visit to the town of Puyo offers the chance to see a factory where all the country's ginseng is made, processed and packed - and from where thousands of tons of the stuff are exported all over the world. The author's verdict on the taste of ginseng extract: \\"...the faintest hint of drying paint ...a freshly baked Victoria sponge cake, cooked in a pine wood on a spring afternoon....\\" Could be we've discovered the next Gilly Goolden.In fact, it's this vivid turn of phrase that was one of the reasons I enjoyed the book so much. The Korean desire to kill and eat almost anything that moves means that \\"...except for the odd weasel or mouse, Korean forest floors are like vast empty ballrooms, dark and quite silent.\\" But, before you're provoked to send a strong memo to the Korean branch of Friends of the Earth, you should know that there is one part of the peninsula where wildlife is flourishing - and it's not where you would expect. Inside the Demilitarised Zone that separates North and South Korea, no shots may be fired, allowing animals like the Korean wildcat and the little Korean bear (awww!) to wander in safety, at least from human prey. As the author observes: \\"It is an ironic counterpoint to the awfulness of war that so much that is beautiful and rare flourishes where human anger is greatest, and yet in those places where peace has translated into commerce, so much loveliness has vanished clear away.\\"This book first appeared in 1988, and Simon Winchester ends his journey at the North Korean border. But the preface to the 2004 edition follows him as he eventually ventures into the frozen North. In some ways, this is the best part of all. The North Korean capital, he claims, is much easier to navigate than Seoul mainly because in Pyongyang \\"...there is nothing there.\\" There's also a revolting encounter with a North Korean cappuccino whose foam on top turns out to be a whisked eggwhite.From a standing start, I can now say my knowledge of Korea has increased by a hundred thousand per cent, and although I might never get there, this book was the next best thing to experiencing the heart and Seoul of Korea.Who knew?&#61623; Most Koreans have the surname of either Kim, Park or Lee, and engaged couples with the same surname must prove they are not from the same clan before being permitted to marry.&#61623; Korean is linguistically closer to Hungarian or Finnish than it is to Chinese;&#61623; Confusingly, the Korean word for yes is \\"nay\\"&#61623; To Koreans, you're already 1 year old from the moment you're born - which means your 42-year old reviewer would be 43 (or 143, after a hard day at work)."},{"Title":"Korea","review":"This book is a bit rambling at times but, since Winchester's travelled through Korea on foot, perhaps that was somehow apt. I have seen several negative criticisms of what Winchester has to say and how he says it; too condescending, too sexist, too disorganized... too, whatever. Possibly these charges have some merit but it should be borne in mind that a score of people can visit the same place at the same time and will come away with a score of different impressions. Winchester has not especially held himself out to be offering an in-depth, comprehensive objective analysis of a nature and culture. Rather, he took a trip to see somewhere that interested him and he wrote about what he saw and what he thought about the things he saw. Certainly, his observations are colored by his own biases and expectations but I read the book making allowance for that and simply enjoyed getting a glimpse into a land and people about which I heretofore knew almost nothing. This book was an interesting read. I got what I paid for."},{"Title":"Korea","review":"Usually i don't let others' book reviews influence my own thoughts about a book, but this time, I'm going to have to side with them. Although this book depicts the amazing countryside history and culture of Korea not seen by the average tourist, Winchester's writing tends to always be sexist towards women, constant rhetorical bashing of the \\"typical\\" American sloth (Pp. 71-75), and non stop bragging about how Englishman are \\"Gentleman\\"; yet he lives in Massachusetts?. Putting all the propaganda of Winchester's style aside, the book is an entertaining read, but I'm sure others have done better."},{"Title":"Korea","review":"Simon Winchester's book about Korea answers so many of my questions about this often secretive country. Being an American, I had always thought that our soldiers, our power, had been put to good use in Korea, saving the South from the murderous North. My perceptions were wrong.As Winchester describes the hard-working miracle of South Korea's economic power, I caught glimpses of the regular Koreans and their determination for success. While holding much of its history close to their hearts, the Koreans also resent the constant war and military preparations for another possible attack from the North. But the Americans are not helping now. Instead of building bridges to the North and opening up a dialog between the two Koreas, Americans seem to be the new invaders, and ugly imperialists at that.There is little mingling between Americans and Korean citizens. Instead, the South Korean citizens prefer the British who are well-liked and friendly. The face of America here is dirty with ambition and ugly in its attitudes toward Koreans. It's the old \\"ugly American\\" that the Peace Corps and others have tried to replace. But, no. Here in South Korea in 1988, Winchester enjoys his long walk from South to North, and he castigates the craziness of the North-South hatred, but finds that America is not helping to bring North and South together.Would the USA only look at the rugged beauties of the Koreas and try to smooth the path toward understanding. Maybe then the preparations for war could be toned down and a new Peace Treaty could be formulated."},{"Title":"Korea","review":"First read this towards the end of my time in high school. The idea of starting at the bottom of South Korea (Cheju Island no less) and then just walking up to the DMZ was such a strange one and the book flowed so nicely that two decades later when I was fluffing about absent mindedly in a bookstore and saw it I just had to snatch it up.The pros of this book are that it is a snapshot of South Korea pre 1988 Olympics which did so much to put the country on the map and ever so slightly helped put it on the tourist trail. The author is quite forward in terms of giving his opinion on things. Not a problem per se but he doesn't hold back but he is also quite capable of musing about his expectations and what he finds in reality. A lot of the social and economic commentary are probably well and truly dated as I write in 2013 but books like this do stand the test of time as they not only provide up to date snapshots at the time of their release but serve as records of what was. In fact as he makes his way north the author mentions the fate of a group of Dutch sailors who were taken from their shipwreck in the south of the country to the then capital of what was known as the Hermit Kingdom and he provides quotes from the book which was written describing their ordeal.The authors honesty also helps us relate to his walk. He openly admits to days spent walking that weren't the most pleasant he has spent on this green earth! He also is at pains to talk to other westerners to seek their opinions on the place and people. This makes sense to me as expatriates who had been in the country would have a deeper understanding of what was going on.Of course he also spends a lot of time in the company of Koreans. He spends time with monks, people in street, ladies of negotiable virtue (as my mother would put it) and he honestly seems happy to be able to experience all of it - for the experience if not the joy if you take my meaning. As an avid armchair traveller this is a welcome addition to my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Korea","review":"Mr. Winchester has done a credible job relating Korea in this short work. I lived and worked there for six years, was fortunate enough to have married and lived with a Korean for 40-plus years, so understand a bit about the country and its civilization. I was pleased to be in accord with his writing throughout, though believe, nevertheless, that the North Korean government ought to be destroyed, lock stock and barrel, and without the slightest regret. The book relates Korea, well."},{"Title":"Korea","review":"I borrowed this book up after having lived in Korea for about a year, and after the first couple of chapters knew that I would buy it. It presents a fascinating portrait of a country in the between stages of development--after the \\"miracle\\" economic boom but before the democratic reforms of the late 1980s. Contrary to other reviewers, I found the author sympathetic to Korea's idiosyncrasies and romantic about its charms, if not blind to its faults.This isn't a textbook--if a balanced and detailed listing of facts is what you're looking for, this book is not for you. It is however a great presentation of stories of a very interesting country. Some reviewers have criticized it as scattered; a decent familiarity with Korean geography and stereotypes of the regions made the author's account, for me, not only logical but more meaningful for its organization.While the Korea that I live in has changed significantly since the author's journey, the modern history that he presents in the context of his historical research really sheds light on why South Korea exists as it does today.Recommended!"},{"Title":"Korea","review":"This book came as a birthday present from my brother. Written in 1988 by the British journalist Simon Winchester, Korea: A Walk Through the Land of Miracles is a fascinating account of one man's journey--by foot I may add--across a country that has been all but cut off--historically speaking--from the rest of the world. Winchester starts his trek on the \\"honeymoon isle\\" of Cheju, in the South China Sea, and finishes at the demilitarized zone, or DMZ, essentially the North Korean/South Korean border. For his path he chooses the same path taken by the Dutch sailors shipwrecked on Cheju in 1688, during their forced march northward and up the peninsula. Each chapter starts with an account from the journal of Dutch seaman Hendrik Hamel, written nearly 5 centuries ago.He meets a lot of interesting people along the way. On Cheju Island we speak to a Jesuit missionary and learn that there were once sheep on that island, but that they never really \\"got a hold,\\" because for some reason or another, Koreans don't eat sheep. It's a shame, because according to Winchester, who calls Cheju \\"The Irish Island,\\" the climate would well support them. Father Patrick McGlinchey tells Winchester what a frustrating experience he had trying to convince the Koreans to raise and breed sheep, a task that ultimately failed. His initial suggestion of importing the sheep was met with scoffs all around. \\"The grasses aren't good enough,\\" the Koreans said.\\"Well. Let's sow the uplands with something good,\\" McGlinchey suggested.\\"That won't work,\\" they said. \\"The soil is too poor.\\"\\"We'll add lime,\\" the missionary countered.\\"It won't work,\\" the Koreans insisted. \\"If it could work, our ancestors would have already done it.\\" I really love this passage because it provides invaluable insight into the stubborn nature of Koreans.Winchester continues his trek up the peninsula, stopping in Kwangju (now Gwangju) to visit the cemetery where more than 200 bodies--the results of the Kwangju Massacre--are buried. The only problem is they are all spread out, and he's never really sure if what he finds is what he's looking for, as he stands blankly staring at a bunch of headstones with strange inscriptions cut into them, while the taxi driver patiently waits. He visits a factory that makes \\"digestives,\\" cookies introduced by the British that have taken Korea by storm. He runs into a couple of costume jewelry buyers from America at a hotel. He meets a Buddhist monk, stays at several temples, and even tries some Buddhist meditation. He goes to karaoke bars and eats dried squid and chases it with cheap beer. He walks, and walks, and walks some more. The weather is terrible. It is raining most of the time.Why he spends so much time searching the nearest American military base is beyond me, but perhaps he's hankering for a cheeseburger or two after two weeks of eating rice and strange roots and pieces of tree bark. Luckily for him, he's in Korea and U.S. installations are a dime a dozen. The first G.I he meets can't make a sentence without inserting the word \\"pussy.\\" Later, further north, he spends a couple of days at one base near the town of Kunsan in Chollanamdo, and goes out drinking with a bunch of soldiers in American Town, the adjacent \\"commercial area\\" consisting of a bunch of bars and cathouses catering to the U.S. military. The soldiers he meets are by and large, loud, obnoxious, and ignorant. They treat the Koreans with contempt. They can't speak a lick of the language, and don't know squat about the culture. They are totally isolated in their own world of NFL football, cheeseburgers and French fries. They might as well be in the USA. Well, they ARE in the U.S.A. That's why it's called American Town.Basically, Winchester spends too much time on the military bases and not enough time in the massage parlors. At one point two women he befriends in a Karaoke bar show up at his hotel room at 3am, eager to please. He turns them away. Another time the same happens again, and his response is the same. Finally, when he arrives in Seoul, he goes to the first barbershop he sees for a 2-hour long massage, followed by shave and total body treatment. Or is it the other way around.Probably the best part of the book is when he goes and visits a man who renounced his American citizenship to become Korean. There aren't many people who do this. He finds this man, Ferris Miller, originally from Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania, living among the dunes on the West Sea, near the settlement of Chollipo. There Miller lives peacefully and manages his arboretum, which holds just about every tree, flower and shrub native to East Asia that one can imagine. Winchester spends a couple of days there kicking back and drinking beer with this reclusive, interesting man who has been such a positive influence on this country. We also learn that outside of the Bay of Fundy, the West Sea--which separates Korea from China--has the most extreme tidal range of any body of water in the world.The book ends at the DMZ. Winchester is accompanied by a veritable army of soldiers, guides, attaches, liaisons, spokespersons and what not as he marches to the edge of the world's most heavily fortified border, and peers across the DMZ into the strange, reclusive country that is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He stares at the world's tallest flagpole, supporting the world's heaviest flag, that of North Korea. He comes to the bridge of no return, and toys with the idea of just continuing--continuing walking into North Korea. He asks his \\"hosts\\" what are the chances he could do such a thing. One soldier says, \\"We would have to let you sir. We have no power to stop you. But they call this the Bridge of No Return. You do know that, don't you Sir?\\""},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"The Rub Al Khali, the Empty Quarter, or as the Arabs called it, The Sands, is one of the most inhospitable places on earth, and one of the least populated as a result. Like Mt. Everest, or the South Pole, each of which became the obsession of some men, sometimes costing them their lives, the Empty Quarter became an obsession of Wilfred Thesiger. He was not the first Westerner to cross it, Bertrand Thomas was, in the \`30's, and then Harry (Abdullah) St. John Philby after him, but Thesiger is deservedly the most famous, due to this wonderful account that is difficult to put down. His birth and childhood in Abyssinia, in 1910, the son of the first British Ambassador, seems to have marked him for the \\"path less traveled.\\" To fully appreciate \\"Arabian Sands,' it helps to have read \\"The Life of My Choice,\\" his autobiography.The first part of \\"Arabian Sands\\" covers his youth in Africa, and his initial desert trips in Dhaufar, and in the Danakil country. The end of the book involves his travels in then \\"forbidden\\" Oman. The heart of his story though, is his two epic crossing of The Sands. Unlike other Westerner explorers, he was unsupported in his efforts, by other Westerners, save for the financial support of the British Anti-Locust Board. He had to live by his wits, establishing firm and trusting relationships with his beloved Bedouin (Bedu) who were the essential element in his success. In so doing, he developed an understanding of the conditions of their very harsh life, and enthusiastically emulated them. In addition to coming to terms with the \\"ship of the desert,\\" the camel, and adapting to the rhythms of desert travel with such transport, he also had to stay one step ahead of central authorities, and deal with the tribal politics, which invariably meant that some tribes would be hostile to both him, and his traveling companions solely for tribal reasons. Furthermore, since he was not a Muslim, he had to deal with those individuals and tribes who were hostile due solely to his non-adherence to their religion and beliefs, but Thesiger was wise enough to realize that much of the hostility resulted from the fact that all the other Westerners who were exploring were looking for oil, and the natives feared a loss of their land - it was hard for them, or even most Westerners to understand his motives of doing it solely \\"because it was there.\\" After his second crossing he was arrested in the town of Sulaiyil by adherents of the Ikhwan, the fundamentalist brotherhood that very well may have made an \\"example\\" of him, \\"to encourage the others\\", and executed him. It was only the direct intervention of his friend, Philby, with the Saudi king, Abdul Aziz, which secured his release.The book contains numerous excellent maps, which outline his trips, as well as the tribal areas. It also includes some excellent black and white photographs, many of them of his traveling companions. On a personal note, he inspired a passion to visit Yabrin, on the northern edge of the Empty Quarter, and I was able to see it develop into a significant town, over a 23 year period, a far cry from the absolute absence of people at this oasis when he passed through in 1948.I couldn't give the book a 5-star however. As one other reviewer indicated, it would help if we looked a bit at the man himself, and his reference frame. The book was written around 12 years after the events, and he admits to not maintaining accurate notes, so how much was changed in his memory? Certainly he experienced \\"comradeship,\\" like men do in war, but does that mean we should have wars for this experience? It seemed that he unduly romanticized the hardship, and bemoaned that the bedu would loose their remarkable way of life with the coming impact of the modern world. And there is no question that there are only a few real bedu left on the Arabian peninsula, as they have enthusiastically embraced the conveniences of the modern world in the subsequent 60 years. It should be noted that Thesiger carefully picked the timings of his travels, to do so only in the winter. If he had spent a couple of summers with the bedu, I strongly suspect that much of his romanticism would have evaporated, and the hum of an air-conditioner would be much appreciated. Also, there may have been more than an aversion to the modern material world behind his passion for the remote areas of yore - throughout his life, including his days in Kenya at the end, there was always a youthful companion with him.Setting aside these caveats, and realizing that the prism may be distorted, his achievements are remarkable, and we are fortunate to have an enthralling narrative of this vanished way of life."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"A rare look at the empty qaurter of Arabia by a seasoned adventurer who obviously loved his subject both place and people.

One becomes attracted to the silence and vastness of the unknown deserts of the world."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"Thesiger's background and his detestation of the modern world (just after the end of the Second World War) made him uniquely suited to live and travel with the Bedu. It is astonishing that so few Westerners should have traveled to some of the places that Thesiger visited, until one reads of the difficulties that he had to overcome. I found his book to be a thoroughly enjoyable description of a fascinating people and an intruiging part of the world."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"Not only a magnificent travelogue chronicling travels in in a harsh, surreal landscape, here we see the age-old yearning of the explorer to discover the things which cannot be found among the comforts and conveniences of civilization,chief of which is a knowledge of what kind of man he will prove to be when tested to his utmost. Though Thesiger never promotes his undertakings as spiritual experiences,it becomes evident that surely they have as much right to be called so as any other avowedly represented accounts. His fascination with the ascetic lives of his Bedu companions with their fierce nobility and many customs of traditional Arab culture shows the desire of a searcher for meaning transcending the materialism of the modern West. It is a tribute to his integrity that, despite his admiration, he also realizes he is bound to his own heritage and could never be truly one of them. His descriptive powers are outstanding,both of people and places. This is the best adventure/travel book I have read to date."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"After you read this, you'll never think the same of the \\"Empty Quarter\\" which encompasses much of the south of the Arabian Peninsula. First of all, you'll find it's not so empty, with the nomadic Bedu plying the dunes and oases of the region as they have for centuries. In fact, this story is primarily about the Bedu who are incredibly tough but also incredibly principled. Their moral code could teach us a lot. Their love for their camels, who literally enable them to live in their hostile geography, and for their fellow man is humbling. The author, an intrepid explorer of these desert sands, does an outstanding job of bringing the Bedu culture to us. If you want to more fully understand the nomadic Arab mind, you could do much worse than to read this outstanding book."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"Wilfred Thesiger spends 5 years in the desert of Arabia in the company of the Bedu. This book is very well written and gives us a glance into a life that doesn't exist anymore. The Marsh Arabs is equally interesting, A life of my choice a little bit less. If you like Thesiger try also The lost world of the Kalahari by Laurens van der Post."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"I thought this book was great. Thesiger was an interesting and somewhat enigmatic man. He claimed to disdain intellectual matters, yet his formidable intellect is obvious. He claimed to seek solitude, yet he obviously craves the companionship of the young men of the desert. He was among the last of the great explorers and understood that contact with the \\"civilized\\" world would destroy the culture of the people he traveled among. After distinguished service in World War II, he determined to cross the \\"Empty Quarter\\" of the Arabian Peninsula and he did. Twice! ARABIAN SANDS tells the story of these crossings. Certainly the trips were dangerous. He faced death from starvation and thirst, a hostile climate, hostile governments, hostile fauna (snakes, spiders, and scorpions), quicksand, and fanatical desert Muslims who considered it an honor to kill Christians. There is adventure in this story, but the parts that impressed me most are the introspective moments when Thesiger ruminates on such matters as the beauty of camels and the extraordinary generosity of the desert tribes. There are also some descriptions of circumcision rituals that are not for the squeamish. He claimed to be asexual, but he is obviously smitten with a couple of the young men in the book: \\"This boy was dressed only in a length of blue cloth . . . and his dark hair fell like a mane about his shoulders. He had a face of classic beauty, pensive and rather sad in repose, which lit up when he smiled, like a pool touched by the sun. Antinous must have looked like this, I thought, when Hadrian first saw him in the Phyrgian woods.\\" Thesiger's descriptions of the desert and desert life are quite vivid and poetic: \\"We had unsaddled beneath some acacia trees, where the wadi widened out. Soon, Arabs appeared from the pool staggering under filled water-skins, which they had laid out in the shadow of the trees. The skins lay there in the thin shade wobbling slightly like giant slugs, bloated and curiously obscene.\\" I found this an exciting, yet thoughtful book that I found much easier to read than SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM. Highly recommended. Five stars."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"The exotic Near- and Middle-Eastern lands of the Levant and Arabia Felix were as unknown as possible for the average British or American citizen. But Thesiger was born to the expatriate breed. Familiar with the culture and fluent in the language, he was prepared to undergo any hardship to traverse the forbidding &quot;empty Quarter&quot; -- the vast desert in south Arabia. His narrative, travelling incognito and sharing the dangers and very simple pleasures with his guides, portrays a now-lost vista of dunes and camels from the REAL Arabian nights."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"Excellent travelogue by Thesiger. Thesiger was one of those 'desert-loving English' guys. He traveled across the Empty Quarter (southern Saudi Arabia, northern Yemen, Oman) with members of several different Beduoin tribes. You get a great feel for how the Bedu lived and survived in such a harch environment, and you'll have a different perspective on the origins of today's conflicts with extreme muslim fundamentalists when you're through. Thesiger wasn't out for glory; he loved the Bedu way of life and the desert, and it shines clearly through in his writing. Interesting from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"I have read many book on Arabian travel, and this is the best. (Bertram Thomas' account iS #2.) A wonderful read about travelling though the Arabian desert by a man who lived like a native for several years.

I am now off to read the rest of his books and the Asher biiography of Thesiger."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"When I was a kid I dreamt of being an explorer. Never mind that I had never been out of New England and had no possibility of doing so. Discovering new lands and peoples seemed such a great job. What I couldn't figure out was how you got BE an explorer ? What, did you take a course someplace ? Once, in talking of other things, my father happened to remark that there must have been parts of the Maine woods where nobody had ever set foot (I don't think he was considering the Indians). Yes, I thought, first I would explore Maine and then, maybe some other, more distant lands. As I grew older, I realized the awful truth. Unless you wanted to freeze in Antarctica, dangle from icy rocks on a few mountains, or chop your way through insect-ridden, steamy jungles, there were no places left to explore. I was a slide rule in a computer age. Ah, well.....Wilfred Thesiger was born in more fortunate circumstances for an exploring life. His father was not a small businessman in New England, but the British ambassador to Ethiopia in the days when all parts of that country had not been visited by Westerners. The first part of ARABIAN SANDS describes the author's adventures travelling in wilder parts of Ethiopia. After Middle Eastern service in Sudan and elsewhere during WW II, Thesiger signed on as a locust hunter in the Arabian Peninsula, trying to locate the then unknown breeding grounds for the dreaded insect. He did it purely to be able to travel through the most unknown parts of the region, the Rub al-Khali or \\"the Sands\\"; Oman, the Hadhramaut, and the southern reaches of Saudi Arabia. He travelled with small groups of Bedu (Bedouin) on camelback, always barefoot and dressed in Arab clothing. He faced thirst, hunger, cold, the risk of serious accident, arrest by Saudi and Omani authorities, and death at the hands of raiding tribesmen. With no available maps, Thesiger relied completely on the guiding skills of various Bedu whom he hired. He had no radio, no global positioning whatevers, and no chance of a helicopter rescue.ARABIAN SANDS tells the story of Thesiger's travels in the Arabian deserts in the years 1945-1950, before Big Oil changed the lives of everybody there. An interesting pair of books to read to get an idea of the old world and how it changed would be this one plus Abdelrahman Munif's novel \\"Cities of Salt\\". Thesiger hated modernization and cities and would have preferred that the Bedu remain in their poverty, but in a state of desert purity. I feel that he romanticized the Bedu and the desert environment to an extreme because of his own character. Nevertheless his descriptions of Bedu life, their culture, and behavior are fascinating, as are many of the events that took place over the course of his long travels. If you are at all interested in that part of the world or in adventurous travels before the world became entrapped in visas and metal detectors, you must read this one !"},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"If you like true adventure (not fiction), have a spot in your heart for nature, different cultures and personal hardships and challenges with a goal of self improvement and introspection, then this book should be in your personal library. If you don't have the above, you will probably find the text slow and boring, and put the book down before the half way mark.The author goes into some detail that is minutia, irrelevant, and tedious, and then all of a sudden, you find yourself re-reading the same few sentences several times in order to fully grasp the magnitude of what he just said. Amongst all the sand that he describes in the book, he'll also provide golden nuggets of insight into the human soul and spirit, and done so very elequently, just like an Oasis in the midst of a bleak desert. That is to say, it's worth the effort to get there.This is not a book with a &quot;plot&quot;. It's a personal account of an individuals travels with the Bedu. You can read into it Protagonists and Antagonists, but again, this is not a fictional work. Nonethless, you find yourself rooting for &quot;Umbarak&quot;, as the author is called, and worrying about other Arabs who would kill him given the chance, and there are many chances and near misses.Surprisingly, there are also bits and pieces of insight into the Arab world that help put into perspective some of the tensions we see today in the Middle East. While that is certainly not his intentions, he does touch on some things that are relevant today in respect to the Muslim attitudes towards Christians and Jews.This is not a book that can be glossed over and read during TV commercials, on the bus, or while the kids are screaming up and down the hallways... you need to focus and concentrate, and if your heart yearns for nature and adventure, you'll find it well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"An extraordinary book, by an extraordinary man, about an extraordinary people - the desert arabs (Bedu) - before the outside world encroached on their way of life. Thesiger travelled through that inhospitable desert between the Yemen, Oman and the south of Saudi Arabia (\`The Empty Quarter') in the 1940s, most of it then unmapped.He account of exploring this unknown hostile territory, against a background of tribal raids and blood feuds and tensions where many tribes would have considered it an act of merit to kill the foreigner \`infidel', gives these travels an additional level of drama beyond the excitement of new exploration.The harshness of the Bedu life amid the driven sands with its intense cold, heat, and blinding glare in a land without shade or cloud is the everpresent backdrop to these travels and adventures between scant and bitter wells. Sometimes travelling for up to 16 days between wells, death was often a palpable presence at the very edge of the camel's endurance.The book is also a valuable anthropological log of these tribes, and their differing customs. The men is his party come alive in the sparse prose and a narrative pace as steady as the unfolding days. Thesiger's companions live in the anecdotes and black and white photographs. Listening to their talk the reader comes to love and admire those \`ships of the desert' (camels) for their patience and endurance and individuality, and to marvel at the simplicity and standards of honour of the Bedu tribes.This is one of the truly great books of exploration. It is even more significant however as a journal of human encounter, and a unique and tenderly perceptive record of a people whose way of life, which had endured unchanged for 4000 years, was to become irrevocable changed by roads and the impact of oil exploration.A book that educated Arabs give to Westeners to help them understand the Arabs. (That's where my copy came from). Contains a comprehensive index."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"Strange that such a book - which is basically a biographical resume of 4 years in the desert - can be that interesting. It is very difficult to put it aside once you have got into it, and it is sad when the story is finished. I actually bought the book in Abu Dabhi, after a few trips through the desert, and it was fascinating to read how people lived, what values they had, how the coped with an unbelievable tough environment in places where 40 years later highways and highrise buildings fill the landscape. A purchase - and a reading that you will not regret."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"While waiting for my inter-library loan of Arabian Sands to arrive I pulled THE LAST NOMAD (same author) off my library's shelf. Turns out they are the very same book! Same tho only in text. The Last Nomad is a big 20\\" x 20\\" book filled with BIG beautiful black and white photos Some full page and a few even two page spreads. Tho they do suffer from being black and white imho, Wilfred Thesiger is an excellent photographer. The \\"portraits\\" of the people are wonderful.So FORGET ARABIAN SANDS. Arabian Sands is a small 7.8 x 5.1 book with small dark pictures. And not all the pictures to boot.My favorite part was the Iraq Marshes (1950-'58). The stunning \\"buildings\\" the Marsh Arabs made solely from the TWENTY foot tall reeds that grew there. WOW. THE LAST NOMAD is probably the only pictures of the marsh area before its destruction. Well you can find them online of course just google marsh arabs. Go to laputanlogic dot com's webpage on marsh arabs.\\"The 5,000-year-old way of life of the Marsh Arabs, celebrated by Wilfred Thesiger among others, has long been under threat. Its final disappearance is documented in 'The Iraqi Marshlands' by Emma Nicholson and Peter Clark. Saddam Hussein's aggressive drainage program in the 1990s, in pursuit of rebels hiding in the waterways, turned much of the marshland into desert, depopulating the area. Some 200,000 of the inhabitants fled, many of them to refugee camps in Iran. The damage is probably irretrievable.\\"Dams in Turkey, Syria and Iran have further reduce the amount of water flowing down the Tigris and Euphrates. All the bird and wildlife is lost.

It used to be a much simpler world, with different values that developed slowly, and endured longer. Mr.Thesiger belongs to that era of rugged adventure, and I have enjoyed reading this book. There is a connection between people's feelings, and a developed respect, instead of just avarice. Good reading!"},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"I'll admit I've got a deep suspicion of comfort and convenience, probably because they seem so inexplicably important to a lot of people. Sure, we can like our easy chairs; but without a steady diet of raw experience and unprotected (social) intercourse we lose our edge. Thesiger was addicted to living on the edge, and he was lucky and intrepid enough to capitalize on some sweet opportunities. He had the explorer's instinct to be the first one in, the humility to be accepted most places he went, and the intelligence to understand and record what he experienced.After living in Saudi myself, I still look forward to every opportunity I get to go back and visit; but they've got air conditioning there now. I can appreciate the unique-window-to-a-vanishing-culture angle, but at several points in this book I wondered to myself, \\"Why in the world would this guy keep going back to such a hellish place?\\" The desert may seem romantic from a distance, but to be stuck in the middle of one without food or water is truly heinous. Even the solitude he expected from being in the middle of nowhere was hard to find. Not many people today would choose to do what Thesiger did.It's interesting to speculate why Thesiger did keep going back: ego? masochism? love? Or did he want something we've been conditioned not to want anymore? With all the money and psychological expertise that's gone into advertising since Thesiger made his trips it's nave to think our desires haven't been conditioned to some extent, and this conditioning will not have been designed to make us seek out hardship. I worked for three years to recruit people to join my team in Saudi. That experience made me very pessimistic about the sense of adventure and curiosity in people these days.Thesiger shows in his observations that there was genuine curiosity at work. Love, masochism, and ego were probably also involved; but there's a strong possibility that Thesiger really did understand he was preserving a mosaic of cultures the only way he was capable. And it's obvious that the awe he felt for these dying, ancient ways of life placed a heavy responsibility on him that he worked hard to shoulder. Today, this kind of awe seems too often overcome by a strong temptation to bow down to the dollar... or the easy chair."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"A rare look at the empty qaurter of Arabia by a seasoned adventurer who obviously loved his subject both place and people.

I won't say how this feat is accomplished, but let me say that a Bedu who does this must want that milk badly).Really, it is like a travelog in that it takes you along with him on desert journeys.

Ostensibly financed to increase biological and scientific knowledge of the area these journeys seem to have been undertaken by Thesiger for vastly different reasons. And it's these cross purposes that inform much of the conversational style of this dry yet at the same time engaging display of man against nature and the rich and varied experiences Thesiger converys.And indeed it must be said that Thesiger is a keen albeit haphazard chronicler. One minute he is imparting explanations of local attitudes and throwing in anecdotes to illustrate them and the next he is giving precise information regarding some feature of the local flora and fauna. While he is busy describing the grinding nature of the journey he is to be found digressing to present some moment of idle whimsy. And all at the same time he is actual giving you a chronological description of his time \`mucking in' with the locals, getting involved in their everyday lives and sparing himself no hardship - in fact he seems to court it like it's a beast to be fought at the most base level. This guy seriously missed his time, he should have been born a couple of thousand years ago in Sparta. I came away not so much beguiled by the writing style or even the physical part of the world this journal portrays but for the all consuming experience the author quite obviously had. Not to mention his stoic and inspiring indestructibility both physical and mental and the reader is forced to consider their own fortitude in the face of descriptions of soul sapping hunger, endless deserts, infinite hardships and debilitating remoteness.Wilfred Thesiger was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, went through Eton etc and is in many respects an anachronistic throwback to a very different time, as are his attitudes to a great many things. But it's important to remember that being born in 1910 he IS from a very different time. And it would be churlish of the reader to expect his writings of over half a century ago to conform to our ideas of political correctness. Not to mention that when it comes to attitude/anecdotes and his conclusions derived therefrom he is perfectly entitled to his opinion, informed as it is by direct experience rather than a preconceived philosophical standpoint."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"I had heard this was the definitive work on the desert country but never had gotten around to reading it. I now have and it is terrific - every thing it's cracked up to be. I had read Michael Asher's biography; I had been in Ethiopia, Oman and Yemen; I traveled in the Hadhramaut -- all of this over fifty years later but still there is the flavor of Thesiger's days. His writing of crossing the Empty Quarter was a precursor of Asher's more recent writings about desert travels. He writes well and keeps the reader completely caught up with his trek. There is a sadness, on Thesiger's part (and mine), that as progress has affected the Bedu life, the stability of the old days is no more. But for a loving report on life as it used to be with the Bedu tribes, I whole heartedly recommend Arabian Sands. (I should not Rory Stewart's introduction was worth the price of the book)"},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"This is simply a wonderful book. I actually found myself wishing I could go back in time and travel with Thesiger. This really is one of those books you will not want to put down. It is a great adventure and gives great insight to a time and way of life that is gone forever. Thesiger is definitely one of the great adventurer-travelers of all time. Thankfully, he had the writing skills to put it all down on paper."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"It's a wonder of the human spirit that people can go through the things that true adventurers do and want to do them again. We are lucky that so many of them manage to write about their adventures so well, and Wilfred Thesiger is one of the best. It's inspiring in a world of such violence, nationalism, and tribal wars to read the stories of those who have travelled to utterly foreign places and found themselves to be at home."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"Nice, convenient Penguin edition, with, unusually for Penguin, quite good maps. I am taken by Thesiger's soul baring and his descriptions of all that relates to the Bedouin. The book is short, convenient to carry on a trip and an enjoyment to read."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"I live most of the year in Saudi Arabia and saw this book at a local bookstore. I was attracted by the cover, reviews, inside photography, and the author's opening comments. I purchased it hoping I would get a greater understanding of the world I live in before the influence of Western luxuries/conveniences. I also thought it would be an enjoyable true-life adventure story.Thesiger was drawn to the bedu setting from of his disdain for the onslaught of technological progression which has been infiltrating every corner of the earth. And no doubt, I benefited from the book with learning more about the bedu culture/mentality as well as their relationship with each other and other Arabs and the degree of attention that they gave to Islam (or \\"cultural\\" Islam, not to be confused with Islam as it truly is). But make no mistake, those fascinating points are very SPARSELY scattered throughout the text.Since the book contained rich descriptions and I did learn a few interesting things from it, it would be unfair of me to give only 1 or 2 stars. But why didn't I give it 4 or 5 stars? Of 287 pages, it seemed that nearly all of it consisted of traveling in the sands, occasionally visiting a town to get permission from a Shaykh to travel therein, and then OCCASIONALLY noting interesting observations from his traveling companions. That's what it was, from beginning to end. There was little to no plot, just the author's love for basking in asceticism. However, even THAT is lacking because there is very little personal reflection of life from the author in the midst of his surroundings. We don't have a page where he looks up into the sky and ponders the creation of the universe or anything of that nature. Quite simply, the book is a narrative of dealing with camels, searching for water, and getting dinner invitations. A few times throughout the book he mentioned some important historical points about Islamic history (it's spread and how it propelled Muslims to be the most advanced civilization of their time) and he concludes that this is because of the bedu participation/influence--yet even these observations, if brought together, could not cover a single page. Although the journey was a true-life \\"adventure\\" -- there was danger from thirst, lack of food-source, etc -- and sometimes it seemed that the author, as a Christian, would be in a tough bind, yet none of those scenarios ever greatly escalated, which of course is good for the author(!) but boring for the reader.For those of you who do choose to purchase/read Arabian Sands, my advice is simple: find a cozy spot where you can read it without any distractions or any impending time engagements. If you don't, the pleasant writing style will slip by unappreciated and your enjoyment will be even less."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"Had he been born in the 18th or 19th century, Wilfred Thesiger would have explored the Nile or mapped uncharted territory in North America. His mid-twentieth century journeys in the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Peninsula, related in this book, confirm him as an acute observer of humanity and an untrained but brilliant amateur anthropologist. This book is unparalleled."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"I'm only about a quarter through this book, and I'm enthralled. Takes you back to another world, before oil riches flowed, to a time when conditions were unrelentingly harsh and unforgiving, where the people were hard and austere, accustomed to a life of great demands and hardships, yet also capable of great courtesy and hospitality. The author explains why he was drawn into the desert and living with the Bedu and describes how the time he spent there was the happiest of his life.Thesiger served as a foreign service officer in Sudan for a number of years as a young man before setting off on his 2 crossings of the empty quarter in southern Arabia. He notes the great abundance of wildlife in Sudan: herds of thousands of elephants, an abundance of lions (he shot 70 himself on hunting trips while stationed there). It's such a sad shame that it's almost all gone now after years of poaching, over-hunting, and civil war. Though apparently there has been some return of these animals on a much smaller scale with some degree of peace in South Sudan.It's hard to imagine that a description of desert life--traveling with camels and how important they were to survival, the daily hardships and rituals of endurance that were just routine, the constant danger--would be fascinating, but it is.Even though Thesiger's travels happened only about 60 years ago, they seem taken from a different era, a much different and wild time. It is, for example, jolting to read that slavery still very much exists in Arabia at this time. And the religious fundamentalism is striking too: for example, a Beduoin is taken aback when Thesiger tells him that in England they have weathermen who can tell you when it is going to rain; the Bedu think that is something only God knows and that it is blasphemy to say otherwise."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"I just completed this book. It was recommended as a way to understand the culture I was going to enter. I recently took an assignment in Doha, Qatar.I didn't know what to expect from the book, but I found it enlightening. The Arab culture has been turned upside down by the new found wealth that oil has brought.Thesinger was concerned about the affect of oil on the culture he fell in love with. I would say his fears have come true. The wealth has changed a simple culture of survival to one of entitlement.It is a good read and insight into the closed culture of the Muslim mind now forced to accept the Westerner that brings the technology and business acumen that helps them acheive the benefit this new found wealth provides. Unfortunately, it has created an arrogance in a culture formely proud of its ways.I believe the Arab still sees the Christian as an infidel and only accepts their presence as a necessity."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"This book is a fantastic read for anyone interested in the middle east history.It arrived within days, well packaged and in perfect condition.Reccommended reading."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"The deserts of Arabia cover more than a million square miles. The southern desert occupies nearly half of the total area. It stretches nine hundred miles from the frontier of the Yemen to the foothills of Oman and five hundred miles from the southern coast of Arabia to the Persian Gulf. It is a wilderness of sand, a desert within a desert, an area so enormous and so desolate that even Arabs call it the &quot;Empty Quarter.&quot;Wilfred Thesiger was born in Addis Ababa in 1910 and educated at Eton and Oxford. Though British, he was repulsed by the softness and rigidity of Western life, &quot;the machines, the calling cards, the meticulously aligned streets, etc.&quot; In the spirit of T.E. Lawrence, Thesiger spent five years exploring and wandering the deserts of Arabia. With vivid descriptions and colorful anecdotes he narrates his stories, including two crossings of the Empty Quarter, among peoples who had never seen a European and considered it their duty to kill Christian infidels.Thesiger greatly illuminates our understanding of the nomadic bedouins of Arabia. He loved, admired, respected and was humbled by a people who lived desparately hard lives in the harshest conditions with only a few possessions that might include saddles, ropes, bowls, goatskins, rifles and daggers and traveled days without food and water. Yet these people were unflappably cheerful, welcoming, generous, self-reliant, loyal and dignified. Thesiger explains why the Bedu with whom he traveled refused to forecast the weather (blasphemy against God)or could discern where to find a hare in the sand (only one set of tracks into the buried hole). As a reader I could almost sense I was traveling with Thesiger, could not help but mourn the passing of the way of life he described, and, as he, pondered the meaning of the word &quot;civilized&quot; as we Westerners conceive the term."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"Besides being a wonderful book, as other reviewers have remarked, 'Arabian Sands' is important reading for anyone who wants to understand the culture and history of the Arab countries of the Middle East and North Africa.The Bedu are, and always have been, a small fraction of the Arabs; historically, they have been disliked, mistrusted and often hated by the settled Arabs of the Middle East. In North Africa, the Berbers (a completely different people, with non-Arabic languages) have sometimes been confused with the Bedu. The Bedu way of life is now nearly extinct; Thesiger's book, which describes his travels with the Yamani Bedu of Southern Arabia, is the only careful account of Bedu culture and Bedu peoples I have ever come across. I know of no similarly illuminating study of the Qaysi Bedu of Northern Arabia, not even the works of T. E. Lawrence.The historical importance of the Bedu in the Arab world is that on several occasions from the 8th century to the 20th century, Bedu tribesmen formed the core of armies that swept across the Middle East and/or North Africa. Invading Bedu armies overthrew decadent regimes in North Africa in the 13th century, and effectively destroyed Berber power on the North African coast. Bedu formed the core of the Arab armies that defeated the Turks in the First World War, and were the core of the army which Ibn Saud created that turned him from being a refugee into being the founder of Saudi Arabia as it is today. How did the small number of people who comprised the various Bedu tribes exercise such military power throughout the Arab World? Read &quot;Arabian Sands&quot; to understand this."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"A book about &quot;the spirit of the land and the greatness of the Arabs.&quot;This is a must read for anyone interested in the tribal Arabs of the desert (southern Arabia). I had this book for many months until I got around to reading it and then I absolutely couldn't put it down. The excursions of Wilfred Thesiger (Umbarak) take place during the 1940s. Thesiger loved the Bedu tribes (Rashid)and he writes from the heart, which is why I think the text is so readable. You relive this phenominal experience with him. Thesiger never fit in with his own people of England. He couldn't bare to live amongst the materialistic culture he found in the western world and felt more akin with his Arab friends yet as a &quot;Christian&quot; he could never be one of them. His relationships with two of the Rashid in particular, bin Kabina and bin Ghabaisha and the love, admiration and loyalty he had for these two young men was very moving. Amazingly Thesiger survives many dangerous encounters while traveling in the desert with his Arab companions. How he ever survived some of these excursions is astonishing; between the lack of food, water, heat and cold exposure but mostly other hostile Arab tribes. His companions and he escape being killed by mere hours. By our western standards many people would think Thesiger's companions to ultimately be murderous and barbaric yet I have met very few westerners that held the same unbreakable code of honor that many of Thesiger's Arab companions lived by. Their generosity, faith in god, honor, dignity, strength and endurance is nothing short of amazing. They would give a stranger who stumbles upon their camp the last scrap of food and final cup of water even when starving in the desert for days. As a &quot;westerner&quot; reading this book I realized the immense differences in what we as a culture think is barbaric and immoral compared to these tribes of Arabia. Of course the ease at which they would kill between tribes to settle blood feuds and their &quot;habit&quot; of stealing camels was truly mind boggling when contrasted with their overwhelming personal ethics. As a female reader I didn't miss the lack of discussions about Arab women although I would have been very interested in the various tribal Arab woman's role as mother, wife and sister. What little I did find in the book about women sent chills up my spine. I do feel that female readers would enjoy this book none the less. Many readers will empathize with the author's sentiment as he writes about his dismay and disgust in the way the Western world has invaded the lands of these nomadic people with new mechanical inventions and infiltrated and ruined the unique beauty of this desert tribe (as well as many other indigenous tribes) which are now completely lost and irreplaceable."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"I had the opportunity to meet Sir Wilfred Thesiger while I was working in the United Arab Emirates. He had come to the city of Al-Ain to promote his book &quot;My Kenya Days&quot;. He was about 85 years old at the time and his hearing was impaired. Yet when someone mentioned something about an incident he had written his eyes lit up and his voice got louder, and it was as if he had been taken back to the Empty Quarter amidst the camels and the bedus. I read Arabian Sands and The Marsh Arabs, (which was, in my opinion, better than Arabian Sands), after I met Thesiger, and I was moved to see a country that had changed so rapidly in such a short time. Thesiger is definitely anti-west, anti-development, anti-modern; he has lived a life that far few of us could ever imagine. I think he became anti-modern because of what wealth was doing to the Arabs and how it was eradicating vestiges of a culture that would be hard put to replace (I believe that there are currently one half of one percent of people who would classify themselves as Bedouins on the Arabian Peninsula) It is a kind of life that far few of us would want to live; going for days without water in the middle of nowhere; not bathing, not having any of the 'comforts' of life, it is hard to imagine doing what he did. Yet as I read Arabian Sands, and walked in parts of the desert around the U.A.E, I could hear, almost smell, the life Thesiger came to admire and the life that really he became for him one with the Bedu."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"A truly magnificent book, such an easy pleasure to read in comparison to Doughty's great but exhausting work, Travels in Arabia Deserta. The author is a man in the fine tradition of T.E. Lawrence, a man who resigned from the British Political Service in the Sudan to rejoin the service as a contract officer not eligible for pension on the understanding that he would only be asked to serve in the wilderness. He served in the S.A.S. in the Western Desert, but makes only one oblique mention of that mission in this text. See Thesiger's autobiography \\"The Life of My Choice\\" for the broader picture of this unique life.Wilfred Thesiger writes, \\"I went there with a belief in my own racial superiority, but in their tents I felt like an uncouth, inarticulate barbarian, an intruder from a shoddy and materialistic world.\\" I wonder how many men among us today would agree with Thesiger's deep belief that \\"even today there are experiences that do not need to be justified in terms of material profit.\\"One passage, if even remotely true, bodes ill for our crusade to spread democracy. \\"Arabs rule, but do not administer. Their government is intensely individualistic, and is successful or unsuccessful according to the degree of fear and respect which the ruler commands ... Focused on an individual life, their government is impermanent and liable to end in chaos at any moment ... To these tribesmen security can be bought too dearly by loss of individual freedom ... Here the evil that comes with sudden change far outweighs the good.\\"Wilfred Thesiger closes by writing that leaving the remote Bedu world with which he was obsessed, The Empty Quarter, was to him an exile. It was in the stimulating harshness of an empty land that he found satisfaction. When he began to lose courage in an \\"intolerable\\" state of thirst, hunger, and fear for his life, he asked himself, \\"Is there really anywhere else I would rather be?\\"I have met one solitary Beduwi in my life, a man imprisoned, caught up in a great tragedy. I regret that I had not read Arabian Sands before that meeting. Not that I could have helped, but I would have understood that in his eyes I was a more pitiful creature than he, \\"for he was Bedu and Muslim, and I was neither.\\"I highly recommend \\"Fire and Sword in the Sudan\\" to anyone interested in anything Wilfred Thesiger has written. I sought out that memoir, written by an officer held captive in Sudan for 12 years, because of the new world which \\"Arabian Sands\\" opened to me."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"Thesiger stands in a long tradition of English who found the deserts of the Middle East hospitable. Wilberforce Clarke, Burton, Doughty, Lawrence, Glubb, Philby (Senior) - the list sometimes seems endless.One is tempted to speculate that the Arab world brings out certain facets of the English character, and perhaps it is true. &quot;Arabian Sands&quot; is one of the best travel books ever written. The purported idea behind the book was a chronicle of crossing Al Rub' al Khali - The &quot;Empty Quarter&quot; of the Eastern Arabian peninsula, one of the most barren areas on earth. This central focus of the expedition, and the story, gradually pales as one reads on and the reader becomes caught up in Thesiger's relationship with his Bedouin companions.The Bedouin are admittedly a fringe society in the Middle East. However, the values that their way of life represent have always been seen as having a central place in the Arab view of life, and Thesiger's obvious sympathy for his companions allows us to understand them as humans as few other western books can do. In this sense he resembles T.E. Lawrence, although he manages to tell his story in a lot less words than Lawrence did.This book will stand the test of time as one of the best books in the English language on the Arabs, and it is a rewarding read."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"Having traversed the Antarctic with Shackleton, Scott, and Mawson, the Himalayas with Maurice Herzog and others, and the high seas on the doomed whaling ship, Essex, I can say that for non-fiction adventure, nothing beats Thesiger in the deserts of Arabia, before they were tamed by oil money.Each page is gripping, whether Thesiger describes the desert environment itself, his own adventures, or the Bedu camel herders with whom he lives and travels. This last theme is the most important in the book, and Thesiger's 1940s travels uncover the ways and even the mind of these most Arab of Arabs as well as anyone can. Thesiger understands and praises the Bedu's better aspects, but is not blinded to their faults. He points out the differences among the ways, thought and even religious practices and tolerance of the desert tribes, and their even greater differences with Arab townsfolk.Read it to understand the places we are sending our troops, or read it to be taken away completely from whatever troubles your urban or susburban psyche, but read Arabian Sands."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"I have not been to Arabia, but as an Archaeologist I worked with Arabs in Israel and Palestine and enjoyed their company greatly. Thesiger's book gives the reader an excellent introduction to the nobility of the majority of Arabs; their willingness to die defending a friend and traveling companion; and, their contradictory nature. To see the world of the Arabs in the era before Middle Eastern industrialization is a real treat not to be missed by anyone who enjoys visiting \\"vanished worlds.\\""},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"I could not find a truer book that this one to describe us, the Arabs in the proper & correct way. The Arabic mentality is fully explained in this book. Although the incidents occurred more than fifty years ago, the true essence of Arab culture today is still mirror image of ancient times, which was described fully in this book.As an Arab, I can attest to the author's success in understanding Arabs, although from time to time he confuses Islamic tradition with tribal traditions. For example, in one paragraph, the author describes the marriage process as if it's solely an Arab process, while in reality it is an Islamic process shared by every Muslim whether in Malaysia or in US."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"i read so many books and novels about the Arabic world and people..i was trying to figure out how other nations look at us and what they know about our culture and people...but unfortunately..many writers wrote about the surface and didn't describe our culture deeply....and i guess i can say that this is the first book among the ones i read that describes this unique culture honestly.. although i agree with Wendy Kreitzer that it lacked the mentioning of women's role in the Bedu's life...but as an Arabic woman i can tell u Wendy that it was and is still a very great role...it is true that the world that Thesiger described in his book had nearly vanished....but many Bedu tribes are still there...maybe they don't have now to suffer and struggle as before....but they still have the same ethics and beliefs..some of them chose to change their way of life..but some were forced to"},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"I just spent 3 months travling in 5 Saudi cities and their surrounding deserts and read the book after having it recommended by a Pakistani Engineer supervising a project I was involved with. After I made a comment about feeling that the Arab people had become lost in some way, they being extraordinarily kind and hospitable in many ways yet totally insane in others, automobile diving skills for example, I felt sad over a since of a dyeing greatness. The gentleman said, \\"You need to read a book titled \\"Arabian Sands\\" to better understand these people. So I did. The author bore witness to what I only felt had occurred. It is a very good read for anyone interested in knowing about the Arab people just prior to the arrival of the oil companies. Arabian Sands is an Anglo-Christian window into a world that is all but gone."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"Born in Addis Ababa in 1910 Thesinger had a life that was one big adventure.In 1935 he joined the Sudan Political Service and began his African travels. He then served with the SAS in the Western Desert in WWII, being awarded the DSO. After the war he travelled extensively through Southern Arabia, the marshes of Iraq ( the subject of a book on its own) and numerous other African countries. These travels werer always on foot with animals rather than mechanical transportation.This book relates to his five years living with the Beduon and entails his two trips across the \\"empty quarter \\" of Southern Arabia with some smaller trips included.These travels were with small groups of Beduon and camels. Why anyone would want to walk across the most hostile hot desert on earth twice is any ones guess. There is the constant worry about water and food and at the time the very real threat of being attacked by hostile tribes.There are numerous anecdotes regarding the desert life of the tribesmen which is a life of basic subsistence.The thought of being that thirsty that you would drink camels vomit or camels urine to survive is not something that crosses your mind these days, but I suppose you'd do what you had to, I suppose maybe.............A fascinating read first published in 1959. The only travel writing I have found more harrowing was Apsley Cheery-Garrard's \\" The Worst Journey in the World\\" and he had to walk through the Antarctic Snow to live, he didn't do it because he felt like it."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"Arabian Sands is an intriguing, extremely well written work that chronicles a journey across the Arabian desert with the Bedu (Bedouin) tribes who inhabit it. Wilfred Thesiger describes in fascinating detail his arduous journeys into and across the Empty Quarter - a parched and for the most part lifeless area of the desert. As the reader travels with him he describes the interactions amongst the Bedu, their culture, habits and beliefs with intimate knowledge and honesty. He crossed the desert at a time when Saudi Arabia was literally on the brink of drilling for oil and deplores the inevitable loss of the traditional way of life in the name of greed. Anyone remotely interested in the Arabian world, the Bedu, or the trials and tribulations overcome by a man whose sole passion was to conquer the Empty Quarter will find this book compelling."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"Great story. They write movies about people like this and still don't do them justice. The book certainly gives us the sense of what it would be like to walk in the shoes of an adventurer traveling through the sands of the Middle East. On the backs of camels no less. Wow!"},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"There was a line in Leans Lawrence of Arabia to the effect that \\"only an Englishman could love a desert\\"; Thesiger is another in the line of desert loving Englishmen. After a life which had already been filled with more adventure than most men would dream possible, in his early thirties Thesiger was offered the opportunity to live and work as locust control officer amongst the Bedhu of the Arabian peninsula in the late forties. In Arabian Sands he records his experiences in Arabia, twice crossing the Empty Quarter, travelling to the Quicksand of Umm al Samim and visiting Oman while it was still a medieval feudal kingdom. But more importantly he records his experience of living and travelling with the Bedu, before their culture was destroyed by the influx of oil money. What he presents is an image of a people who have become perfectly adapted culturally and physically to survive in one of the harshest landscapes on earth. It is a tale told with much sadness from Thesiger's view point, as he comes to love and respect the Bedu and their way of life yet is painfully aware of the oilmen from the west who mark the end of old Arabia.As Thesiger observes \\"No man can live this life and emerge unchanged. He will carry, however faint, the imprint of the desert, the brand which marks the nomad; and he will have within him the yearning to return, weak or insistent according to his nature. For this cruel land can cast a spell which no temperate clime can hope to match\\""},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"In thisslender book Thesiger recounts several of his journeys though the Peninsula including the two crossings of the vast deserts ofthe Rub-al-Kahli. A fascinating tale, this book not only manages to skillfully capture our attention about a bleak and desolateregion of the world, but it also brings our attention to the people who live in these lands. Inhabited by fierce, fanatical, and aggressivewar-like tribes, the feat that Thesiger managed to achieve -- that of cris-crossing this bleak region -- is further accented by the fact the hewas Christian traveling through a fundamentally lawless region ruled by a series of very suspicious and ruthless sheiks. Add to this thatThesiger was a Christian, and you can appreciate the great efforts he took to disguise himself and use elaborate cover stories.Thesiger spent many months travelling with the Bedu and over time became accepted as one of them among the tribes. Along withMarsh Arabs and the first part of his autobiography, My Life, My Choice, he paints what is best described as a human but oftensterotypical picture of the Arab world. While he is quick to dismiss many of the myths associated with the Arabs, he still uses theharshness of the desert to keep impressing upon you the hardships and the bleakness of the terrain and how he still manages to surviveit all despite terrible and grating thrist."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said by others here? This is a terrific read, detailing Mr. Thesiger's trips through one of the most notoriously desolate places on Earth. It's a great adventure and one that should have killed him. Remarkably, the combined forces of heat, dehydration, bandits, hostile imans, hostile tribes, snakes, quicksand, starvation, and King Ibn Saud himself didn't manage to do it. Fortunetely for us, we're left with a wonderful, illuminating account of the Bedu people and their landscape - that while harsh and hostile - begins to take on an intoxicating beauty when seen through Mr. Thesiger's eyes.You'll be glad you read this one."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"What a challenge! Living for years among the Arabs of old. Thesiger was one of the few westerners who made the experience. And he seems to be the last one who can claim to have lived as an Arabian nomadic tribesman. In our days it is difficult to find an opportunity to repeat such a feat as there are hardly any nomads left who give you the unspoiled experience. What kind of difficulties the author must have faced when travelling through the ever hot endless sand dunes of the Empty Quarter, can be very well suspected by anybody who travel on a camels back for just a few days through a sand desert and got exhausted by it.The narrative is much more than just a travel report. It contains many anecdotes of a real nomad\`s life in the deserts. But much more than this it is an ode about and to the Arabs, it is indeed all about the Arabs, the Sand is nothing more than a staffage.No doubt the author is an adventurer par excellence but I have a problem with him which other readers might share. He is just relating what he lives for, he is an observer, interesting enough, but where are the more sophisticated observations? It is not fair to claim from all great voyagers to be an Alexander von Humboldt who puts travel in and gets a depiction of cosmos out. But going through an \\"Empty Quarter\\" of southern Arabian sand deserts without emptying to a remarkable extent the never filling quarters of the human mind, is -sometimes - tiring on the long run.No, Thesiger is not a philosopher, he has no \\"wisdom\\" to offer, except to let the peoples live their traditional lives, whether they include killing out of revenge or insult or treating women in the Allah\`s angel given method or whatever.Thesiger is not very critical with the Arabs; he admired them. \\"I knew the essential decency which was the bed-rock of their character, their humour, stubbornness, and self-reliance. I knew that if called upon they could adapt themselves to any kind of life, in the desert, in the jungle, in mountains, or on the sea, and that in many respects no race in the world was equal.\\" Which is true for any race. So Thesiger was a racist? No, he is not constantly over-stressing romanticism. He is of the kind, I presume, who would have emphasised the preferences of any human tribe.Thesiger seemed to have himself such qualities he praised of his chosen customers, no wonder that he got along with the Arabs. He was just lucky not to fall victim of any representative of Arabs who assault, kill and forget to ask afterwards for the merits. Of course Thesiger is not blind to this: \\"Always reserved in front of strangers and accustomed on formal occasions to sit for hours motionless and in silence, they are a garrulous. Light hearted race. But at the instigation of religious zealots, they can become uncompromisingly puritanical, quick to frown on all amusement, regarding song and music as a sin and laughter as unseemly. Probably no other people, either as a race or as individuals, combine so many conflicting qualities in such an extreme degree.\\"Everybody who wants to get acquainted with the real Arabs, as we would like to have them, should read this book. And sweep the sand away with an iced drink!"},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"An excellent travel adventure through the Arabian deserts in the early part of the 20th century. For anyone who wants to understand the Arab mind/viewpoint or who just loves tales of far away places and exotic locales this book will make an excellent read."},{"Title":"Arabian Sands","review":"Agreed, this is a top notch book if you want to know what \\"the \\"Bedu\\" life was like sixty years ago in what is now Saudi Arabia. In that respect, I'm in complete concurrence with the other glowing reviews. But, as another reviewer has brought up, there's something missing here: Thesiger. Having read this book, I feel I know much more about camels, Bedu culture and desert travel. I even feel I know and like Thesiger's Bedu companions very well. But Thesiger himself? A bit of a mystery.Yes, Thesiger mentions his dislike of machines and modern society. But, I don't really get a \\"feel\\" for what he's all about here. I suppose his perspective as presented here could best be denominated Stoic (although another reviewer speculates masochism may play a part). But, even then, Thesiger is no Marcus Aurelius, and any meditations or introspection are scant as the desert brush. -Can any reader imagine Thesiger meditating like M.A. on such questions as, \\"What is life but a warfare and a stranger's sojourn?\\" - Reflections, or at least the disclosing of them, are simply not his gulp of brackish well water.Others are obviously quite content with a narrator about whose inner life they know next to nothing.

I wanted to know the inner workings of a withces coven and what it involves and what makes it click. This book satisfied my curiosity. I never realized how much work that is required in being in a coven until I read this book. The book describes some of the problems that arise in a witches coven like disagreements regarding spells/magick and she gives good points on how to solve them. Also she touches on how certain individuals in a coven who always have a issues/crisis/problems going on in their lives and are always draining the coven energy level with their constant problems which could hinder the covens magickal working. She gives examples of dealing with these kinds of issues.Coven practice and coven group excercises are also given in the book so that eventually the coven can sense and raise energy for future magickal workings. What I like about this author is that she stresses how magick is not easy and how it takes practice , practice and more practice for the outcome to materialize. Spells may have to be inacted over and over again. Successfull magick is hard work and she always stresses that point. This book answered a lot of questions I had.

Dr. Puff's focus on breaking the cycle of abusive behavior towards ourselves and others is particularly helpful for those who struggle with feelings of guilt and shame.

We've all heard the advice &quot;count to ten when you're angry.&quot; This book goes far beyond that and tells you what you REALLY need to know. Not only did Dr. Puff convince me that being passive aggressive or making rude comments ultimately hurts ME more than anyone else, but he also offered the hands-on &quot;here's what to do&quot; advice that I was looking for. I actually tried some of the suggestions, and was able to work through and let go of a long-standing grudge. I enjoyed reading the personal stories, especially the one about Bob in the section People Who Don't Feel Angry, But Have Issues From the Past. I love that quote: &quot;Quick forgiveness is often false forgiveness, and false forgiveness can be detrimental to the health (both mental and physical) of the one who practices it. In that sense, false forgiveness can be worse than no forgiveness.&quot; I am an artist myself, so I found it refreshing to see some creative alternatives included with the more classic kick-boxing or punching bag methods.

While trying to read the historic introduction with the included magnifying glass, I got a headache. This was caused by constantly have to focus and refocus my eyes every time I moved the magnifier.

Little Yau is hoping that soon the Wise Ones will take her up into the mountains to continue her education. Her healing skills are put to the test when her friend Trup falls ill. The Wise Ones reveal that Trup has been poisoned (by weed killer sprayed in a human's garden), and the only cure is the thumbfoot leaf. The white furred cat-like Fuzzheads creatively face the dilemma of living in close proximity to humans. When the Wise Ones and Little Yau need to search the nearby human town for the rare thumbfoot plant, they don human clothes to disguise themselves.The story is complemented by beautifully bright full-color illustrations. The smaller black and white sketches beside the text add details such as how Trup was poisoned and what Trau does to care for Trup while the others search for the thumbfoot leaf. Some of the illustrations are quite comical. Sure to generate giggles is the two-page spread of Little Yau attempting to run on two feet like a human, then giving up the pretense in favor of speed. Similarly delightful is the \\"Human Phrase Book\\" the Fuzzheads have studied in order to have (limited) conversations with humans."},{"Title":"Little Yau: A Fuzzhead Tale","review":"Charming story that opens many opportunities for discussion about the natural world.

In my graduate department, students arrive early in the morning in the hopes of being the one to snag the Alcalay. These dictionaries are invaluable to both casual students and serious scholars of Hebrew. Each entry contains not only a careful philology/etymology of the word, but also an exhaustive, well-organized list of common phrases which incorporate the word, as well as differing usages. Biblical references, which are so important to understanding Hebrew usage, are provided, but Alcalay (now his son) also has his ear tuned to the street, and includes popular/slang meanings. For a language which evolves as quickly and as often as Hebrew, this is really critical. Unlike many other Hebrew-English dictionaries, which are often inconsistent in including or omitting vowels from the Hebrew, Alcalay is logical and consistent, so you always know where to look, and which form of the verb to look up. I may seem to be going overboard here, but I am a very serious student of Hebrew, and I can't praise the Alcalay dictionaries enough. Anything else is really a waste of money."},{"Title":"The complete English-Hebrew dictionary","review":"I am owning this work since 1969.

I was initially excited to learn that Lee has written over 80 novels and counting, but a couple years and numerous Lee novels later, I've found she's written easily half as much dross as real works of genius. I picked up The Wars of Vis duology hoping it would be the latter, hyped up to read a good, thick royal intrigue fantasy.The story is completely flat. The book is narrated in such a distant, impersonal way that I couldn't connect with the story. A lot of lush description, a lot of people, and I don't know who I'm rooting for. None of the characters have any substance or personality. The bad guys are vile and the heroes even worse. There's a lot of royal corruption but no emotion to balance it out. The women are not strong enough to think for themselves, the notable exception being the evil queen Val Mala, though there's not much depth beneath her cruelty. Val Mala was quite frankly more interesting than our first heroine Ashne'e, who as usual for Tanith-Lee-at-her-worst did nothing but act like a mentally challenged puppet of those who pushed her about. The main character (a sword-and-sworcery-with-a-royal-past-destined-to-become-a-hero male) is typical of the genre too. And don't get me started on the violence against women that seems to happen in every chapter without any authorial didactic purpose or repercussion--and our hero has a hand in some of the rape too.In short, then, it's an unholy cross between Flat Earth and Conan the Barbarian. Don't laugh, it's not at allfunny when you're reading the thing. (Well, kind of.) I really had no idea what I was getting into. The Storm Lord was written very early in Tanith Lee's career (70's) when this kind of pulp fiction Sword and Sorcery fantasy was a heady genre all its own. Conan the Barbarian? Fine. Make FUN of the convention or...something. Instead we get glorification of the stereotypical unrealistic muscle man, and hey why not, let him have his women too, that's all they're good for anyway, right?I never knew why a lot of magazines' cliche lists have something alone the lines of: \\"Wedon't want to see stories where there's a muscle-and-sword hero who is forced, by natural or supernaturalcircumstances, to rape a woman, even though he really didn't want to, REALLY.\\" Now I do. Please don'ttell me people READ this stuff as standard fantasy fare in the 70's?Don't waste your time on cliche-ridden drivel that really isn't entertaining. The book is now out of print and reviews are few and far between. Read the positive ones by all means, read the negative ones, and decide whether you want to expend the time and money tracking this fossil down. Be forewarned, it adds nothing new either to the Sword and Sorcery Pulp Fiction subgenre or to the fantasy genre as a whole, and it is not written in an engaging style that makes you care for the characters."},{"Title":"Little Lamb's Big Question : Little Hugs Books","review":"My one-year-old was irresistibly drawn to this one in the bookstore -- she loves stuffed animals and she wanted that lamb!

The author brings to life the Indian leaders--Tecumseh, Pathkiller, Sequoyah, Major Ridge, John Ridge, John Ross, Boudinot, et. al. He clothes them with humanity, helping the reader to understand them as real men who lived within the historical context of the nation. The author's descriptive writing style weaves a captivating story of the Cherokee nation and its interaction with the missionaries and the Presidents--Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, J.Q. Adams and Jackson--and of the ultimate tragedy which paved the Trail of Tears. This compact volume traces the accomplishments of the Cherokee--their high rate of literacy, the creation of a complex written language, their adoption of a Constitution, the creation of a court system and their conversion to an agrarian culture. The research is well-documented. It is a sobering read."},{"Title":"America's Trail of Tears: A Story of Love and Betrayal","review":"Having grown up near - and often utilizing - Ross' Landing on the Tennessee River in my home town of Chattanooga, TN, I was deeply rattled by this powerful and informative story. Thoroughly researched, the author weaves a historically accurate and heart-wrenching narrative about betrayal, deception and cruelty. The depictions of the Cherokee leaders as valiant - though imperfect - people, striving to come to grips with the values, beliefs and often contradictory policies of our powerful ancestors reminds us of what may be most important about them. Tecumseh, Sequoyah, Major Ridge, John Ridge, John Ross, Boudinot were human.Arnold's book is worth your time; but it is more than a good read. It is an important reminder about who we are as a people and where we have come from - concrete things we have done. George Steiner has written that he wishes to assisst tellers and readers of stories to become &quot;rememberencers.&quot; Dean Arnold's book will help us in this direction, but not without sorrow."},{"Title":"America's Trail of Tears: A Story of Love and Betrayal","review":"Cherokee Betrayal was a decent book. The thing I did not like about the book was that the plot was not very exciting. I was not able to think much and hope for an exciting. I knew in the end that the Indians would be removed and that conflict would arise. The people in the story were rather interesting. Many of them were missionaries trying to spread the Gospel throughout the Indian nation but it just felt like a history report. I don't remember feeling much emotion. The other characters were Indians who were trying to \\"integrate\\" with the white population of America. Two of the characters were trying to marry white women, but the women's parents would not let them do so till later. It was not very emotional or dramatic. They all faced hardships because of their race.The most enjoyable thing about the book was reading about the development of the Chattanoooga area. Because I live on Lookout Mountain, it was appealing to know a little bit of it's history. It was also interesting to see the different names that certain areas were called and what not. But this information was limited and was only toward the beginning of the book.As you can see, I have mentioned the word \\"history\\" a lot. The book didn't have enough of a satisfying plot. Every other line was some quote of from someone else. There wasn't much emotion at all. However, the end of the book was the best part. There was a little bit of suspense. Anyway, I just felt like I was reading a text book from school a lot of the times. This was the book's biggest weakness in my point of view. It just wasn't that engaging.If you like a book that is backed with a lot of facts, then this is a book for you. There are many quotes and excerpts from journals and newspapers of the time. If you like to be informed about the Cherokee Indian removal, then this is a book for you. On the other hand, if you are looking for a novel with a an exciting plot, then this book is not for you. Truly, the book had some good moments, but overall, it did not cut it for me."},{"Title":"Reason and Revolution: Hegel and the Rise of Social Theory.","review":"I agree with the previous review. However, when you pick Marcuse, you should know you are selecting no &#34;right wing&#34; theorist. His lore is historically significant and should be considered as an expose of a particular stream of thought, which had originated with the Enlightenment philosophy and has not ceased wielding influence over us today."},{"Title":"Reason and Revolution: Hegel and the Rise of Social Theory.","review":"Marcuse's goal in Reason and Revolution is to demonstrate that Hegel was not as right wing as people believe him to be, and that there is no excuse for using him to vindicate Nazi practice. The later is true, but the former is not. Marcuse is certainly a deeper Hegel scholar than I am, or ever will be, but page after page it's clear he's reading his own Marxism into Hegel, and not the other way around. In passages that most people would find to be reactionary, and repressive, Marcuse ask that we ignore what he's actually saying, and dwell on Hegel's method as a revolutionary method. While the method may be revolutionary, why are Hegel's results always so authoritarian?His Chapter on Marx is interesting, but hardly worth picking the book up over, and he spends too little time defending Hegel from Kierkegaard (8 pages). In short, he concludes Kierkegaard must be wrong because Kierkegaard wants to find man's solace in religion, and despises socialism. It's not a very philosophical argument, but more of a presumptuous one, where Marcuse just presumes the reader is a socialist and/or not a christian, and therefore won't see any wisdom in Kierkegaard.Overall a mixed bag of a book, I'm not sure I'd recommend it to anyone though."},{"Title":"Jaguar XJS: A Collector's Guide","review":"Having just purchased a twenty year old XJS, I found this book to be just what I wanted. It is full of the history of this car and extensive information to the owner of one of these classy rides."},{"Title":"Final Report (Makers of history series)","review":"This work provides Jozef Beck's perspective on such things as the Pilsudski coup of 1926, interwar Poland, international diplomacy and Poland's \\"dance of safety\\" between two aggressive powers, and much more. It also touches on his personal life.Beck considered the Jewish problem in pre-WWII Poland. (pp. 134-136). He found the Litwaks (Litvaks--erstwhile Russian Jews) objectionable. On the other hand, he condemned the prejudices directed at Polonized Jews, commenting: \\"Something quite different again was the old group of Jewish assimilationists of the end of the XIX century, who were deeply connected with the file of our nation and who were obviously wronged by the eliminating movement so fashionable during the last years before 1939.\\" (p. 134). Beck suggested that mass emigration, as to Palestine, was the only solution to the Jewish economic dominance of Poland, but that it had been complicated by the resistance of the British and French, and the lack of understanding of eastern European Jews by western Jews and their Zionist organizations.This work is timely because Russian revisionists have recently tried to nonsensically relativize the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact as a 1939 Soviet-German dismemberment of Poland that was \\"really no different\\" from the 1938 Polish-German dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. The latter involved Poland's taking of the Teschen (Cieszyn) Trans-Olza (Zaolza) area. To begin with, this area annexed by Poland was a tiny border one, comprising just 0.6% of the territory of pre-WWII Czechoslovakia. So it was not a Polish participation in the German-Nazi dismemberment of Czechoslovakia except in the most trivial sense of the word.The tiny border area was not Czech: It was, according to the 1910 Austrian census, 76% Polish. (p. 268). The Teschen (Cieszyn) area had recently (1919) been fraudulently seized by Czechoslovakia (p. 78, 153), with the Czech forces disguising themselves as French ones, and taking advantage of Poland's weakness. (pp. 268-269). A French-based commission waved off the promised plebiscite that was supposed to fairly decide the fate of the area, and unilaterally awarded six of the eight counties of Teschen (Cieszyn) to Czechoslovakia. (p. 269). This left 180,000 Poles in this small, compact area on the Czech side of the Polish-Czech border. No wonder Poland wanted to rectify this blatant injustice.Beck's memoirs also remind us that the recently-stated Russian revisionist accusation of Poland having a secret deal with Nazi Germany to attack the USSR is nothing more than an old saw. Beck commented: \\"Our pact is non-aggression with the Soviets and the German Reich were negotiated one year apart and each of them presented full value in itself. As, however, it was with difficulty that the world would believe that the aim of these pacts was so simple, as could be seen from their texts, people looked everywhere for some secret appendices which would change the nature of these agreements. I attached great importance to the necessity of stressing that there was no contradiction between the two pacts, as the improvement of our relations with Germany and Russia was limited by the impossibility of making our policy dependent on any of these dangerous partners.\\" (p. 51).The 1939 wartime evacuation of the Polish government from Warsaw has at times been misrepresented as some kind of panicked, cowardly flight. It was no such thing. It was a protective move that had been planned before the war. (p. 211). Owing to the rapidity of the German advance, initial plans to move the government to Lublin or Lwow were abandoned in favor of Krzemieniec. Beck and other government officials were there by September 11. With the unanticipated Soviet aggression against Poland commencing September 17, Beck and others moved to Kolomya (p. 226), and then on to Romania."},{"Title":"the History of Surrealism","review":"This work is the definitive word on surrealism.

The index has the names of some famous authors: Antonin Artaud, Charles Baudelaire, Henri Bergson, Ambrose Bierce, Albert Camus, E. E. Cummings, Albert Einstein, Friedrich Engels, E. M.

Hegel, Heraclitus, James Joyce, Franz Kafka, Karl Marx, Henry Miller, Edgar Allan Poe, Ezra Pound, Arthur Rimbaud, Marquis de Sade, Jean-Paul Sartre, Wallace Stevens, Emanuel Swedenborg, Leon Trotsky, Oscar Wilde and William Carlos Williams. That such people existed was important to the creative thinking that was sorting out what people were up to. I am a fan of Geroges Bataille, the last name at the end of a footnote at the bottom of page 155. Near the beginning of Chapter 12, The Crisis of 1929, which quotes a timely question:What could men still concerned with their status in the world hope for from the surrealist experiment?A letter was sent out asking about activity limited to an individual form, and:to what degree do you believe that a common activity can be continued; of what nature would it be and with whom . . . ?The footnote which mentions Bataille declares:Let us list the names of the persons to whom this letter was sent.Artaud was listed as an expelled surrealist. Leon Trotsky had been exiled. The major sentiment was: \\"it was the duty of the men who worked for the Revolution to be concerned with the fate of Lenin's comrade.\\" Georges Bataille stated opposition to common action. A meeting turned to \\"the degree of individual moral qualification.\\" These were people deeply moved by a splendid occasion for scandal.Like an abortive discussion in philosophy, those who lost the argument were left hoping:Surrealism contains and transcends these two attitudes; it has no concern for the figure it may cut, absorbed as it is in the search for the point where contradiction no longer exists.

I thought I had something after reading the first one. Not so. Brim was a great character to start with but goes down hill after book 1 I guess Baldwin turns him into what Baldwin secretly wants too be, a Lothario who gets all the beautiful, big breasted women including wives plus the action becomes very predictable and unvaried. Brim flies, fights, takes a lot of damage, kills a lot of bad guys and a lot of his crews.Very uneven, poor continuity, terrible morals. I will not be buying the new book coming out this year."},{"Title":"The Defenders","review":"Baldwin takes the battle of Britain and rehashes it in space with &quot;Starfuries&quot; replacing Spitfires.

York wants revenge and Selena is his ticket to getting it. She determines not to succumb to York, but she can only resist him for so long...Overall, I really enjoyed this book. The only complaint I have with it is the same complaint I have with most of JAK's early books...she uses too many exclaimers and the love scenes are too purple. Even though there are 3 or 4 consummation scenes, I still rated the book PG-13 because the descriptions are fairly flowery. Here's a passage from the first consummation scene to demonstrate what I mean:&quot;Tell me you want me, Selena darling,&quot; he ordered roughly as she writhed beneath him. &quot;Tell me you need me tonight as much as I need you!&quot;She moved her legs lightly along his, glorying in the feel of him, and her arms curved lightly around his neck. &quot;I want you, York. You must know that by now!&quot; Did the canvas have to beg for the artist's touch?&quot;Sweetheart!&quot;Okay...get the picture? If you can quit laughing long enough to get through that scene, you'll find that the remaining consummation scenes aren't quite so purple. All of them are varying shades of it, but none of them are the pulsing, neon flashing violet of that first scene.All in all, this is a great book and their relationship is pretty hot for the most part. I wouldn't let the canvas analogies deter you from buying it."},{"Title":"To Tame the Hunter","review":"Richard Anderson's company cheated to win the last engineering contract.

It made me feel as if she was tentatively dipping her toes into the genre of romantic fiction, but was hesitant to go all the way. The heroine, Selena Caldwell, needed a bit of backbone - could one really have an immediate affair with the guy who just told you your fiance is married? I found the characters insufficiently involving to allow me to accept that, and, frankly, I didn't like York Sutherland. Driven guys are OK, but he seemed slightly obsessive, overly arrogant, and Selena should have given him a boot up his ego several times before surrendering to his charms. Other Stephanie James books are better - try those first."},{"Title":"To Tame the Hunter","review":"This is the worst JAK's novel I have read. Only the writers you love a lot can disappoint you so much. It is very out-of-date. I can hardly believe there are contemporary readers that like this novel. York is a dominant male, arrogant and so prepotent that sometimes he verges on violence, not considering just for one second what the heroine, Selena, thinks, hopes or believes. And she is so weak! and inconstant: first she cannot stand his arrogance, and suddenly (the morning after...- she loves him. He says terrible sentences like: I want you, I will have you, give yourself to me. And she: her mouth says no, but her body says yes - which has always remembered me of rape. Sex, even in romantic novels, is something two enjoy, it is not something one gives and the other one takes as a hunting piece."},{"Title":"To Tame the Hunter","review":"ok - normally i am a big fan of Krentz (who wrote this under the name James) but this time, not so much.the basic story line is selena finds herself constantly cornered and hunted by york, in an apparent attempt to ruin selena's boyfriend's business.ok, first of all, how many of you would date (let along sleep with) a man (or woman) who you KNEW was using you to get to the person you are already dating... then, it gets worse, selena finds out bad things about her current boyfriend and runs away, right into the arms of york. i have issues with york - big issues. first he is too hard, has no feelings, and i did not relate to him at all. for all i cared, he could have dropped off the face of the planet. then there was selena - she stood there and took pretty much whatever york dished out. she tried to hold her own (not in a good way, but in a sneaky, illegal way - can we say industrial spying) and failed miserably. personally i think she might as well have laid down and let him wipe his feet on her.in addition to the horrible 'created' characters, the story felt rushed, and the plot just didn't do it for me either. the whole story is them going from place to place and him accusing her of running away. if she was smart, she would have called the police when he followed her to utah - it is called stalking people. this is not a good thing. plus he constantly manhandles her. also - not a good thing.so all in all, i personally felt this was a oomplete waste of time, and not worth the paper it was written on. if you feel the need to read it, i beg you to check it out of the library, please, save yourself some money."},{"Title":"To Tame the Hunter","review":"This rerelease of older JAK Silhouette is a delight though way too rushed to be considered a gem.

The murder of Senate intern Nadia Zarinski, romantically linked to her boss, outside the historic theatre now run by the senator's ex-wife and Hollywood producer, Clarisse Emerson, who is preparing for her confirmation hearing as the next chairperson of the National Endowment for the Arts sets off a media frenzy all too familar in the nation's capital. The case is so sensational that Truman's favorite Washington couple, George Washington University law professor Mackensie Smith and his wife Annabelle, are compelled to play leading roles once again. Supporting cast members and Lincoln buffs, detectives Klayman and Johnson, representing the Metropolitan Police Department, and Sydney Bancroft, aging British thespian and Ford Theatre artistic director, add colorful moments to this fast paced drama.It is impossible for me to criticise Truman's work. Her attention to detail especially about local landmarks and legends in Washington, DC provides the reader with a sense of place that locals recognize and visitors remember. I don't doubt that Truman strolled the cafes and galleries of Dupont Circle sipping latte at Kramerbooks & Afterwoods researching the details about historic Ford's Theatre that she got correct right down to the spelling.Above all, \\"Murder at Ford's Theatre\\" is first rate suspense. Whether you live inside the infamous beltway or not, add this book to your list right away."},{"Title":"Murder at Ford's Theatre","review":"Nadia Zarinski, intern to Senator Lerner, is found dead in the alley out back of Ford's Theatre in DC. She volunteered time at the Theatre now and then. She was found by Johnny Wales, a stage hand at the theatre. The only eyewitness to her murder is John Partridge. He is an alcoholic and thinks he is a CIA agent. He was sleeping it off in the alley.Detectives Rick Klayman and Mo Johnson are investigating this death. There are rumors that Nadia and Senator Lerner were involved. The Senator's ex-wife, Clarise, is the head of Ford's Theatre and was unaware that Nadia was volunteering time at the theatre. Clarise is also to be confirmed as the head of the National Endowment of Arts within the week.The Senator and Clarise's son Jeremiah becomes a suspect in the murder when a previous boyfriend of hers mentions that Jeremiah dated Nadia. That information is confirmed by another source.Mac Smith is now a professor of law. He is teaching a special class on Lincoln the lawyer. He was a criminal lawyer until a drunk driver hit and killed his first wife and only son. He is remarried to Annabel who was a divorce lawyer and now owns and operates a Columbia art gallery. Mac is asked by Clarise to assist Jeremiah when he is arrested. Mac and his former law partner Yale Becker represent Jeremiah.Detective Klayman wonders if they haven't been hasty in arresting Jeremiah. He's not convinced that all the other suspects were sufficiently interrogated.Mac and Annabel are surprised by the Senator's and Clarise's detachment from Jeremiah through this ordeal.Detective Klayman is very interested in President Lincoln and attends Mac's class. They are careful to not discuss this case, just Lincoln.I am very happy that Margaret Truman has returned to her Capital Crimes series. I like Mac and Annabel and always enjoy seeing Mac get involved in a murder investigation. They feel like very down-to-earth people to me. Like your neighbor next door.The Senator in this book was very well written. He was very detached and always too busy to deal with the daily problems.All of the peripheral characters were well constructed as well. In the end of the book, I found myself flip-flopping from thinking one person did it to another. I wasn't able to easily pick out the killer. A sign of a good mystery!I highly recommend this book and all the books in this series. The fact that I know the DC/VA area that was discussed always makes it more interesting."},{"Title":"Murder at Ford's Theatre","review":"After a seventeen-novel run, you might think that Margaret Truman must have pretty well exhausted the possibilities for murder and mayhem on the Washington scene, but with \\"Murder at Ford's Theatre\\", she has found yet another fascinating new venue to explore in her popular 'Capital Crimes' series. Her real life premise? Restored to its original Civil War Era splendor and maintained by the National Park Service as an historic site, today Ford's is also a state-of-the-art, working theater run by the non-governmental Ford's Theatre Society. Fictional charismatic Clarise Emerson: former Hollywood TV producer, ex-wife of playboy Senator Bruce Lerner and presently a nominee for the Chairmanship of NEA is currently its producing director, but...aided by her new comptroller, Bernard Crowly...her primary concern is fund-raising and public relations, so she delegates the actual production mounting tasks to her staff of trained professionals including former Shakespearean matinee idol, Sydney Bancroft. When Sydney is a no-show at an early morning tech staff meeting, real life drama abruptly intrudes into Ford's make-believe world as a stagehand going out for a smoke stumbles over the badly beaten dead body of alluring volunteer intern, Nadia Zarinski. Seasoned police officers Rick Klayman and Mo Johnson 'catch' the case. As they pursue their investigation, among other confusing pieces of conflicting evidence, they uncover a romantic relationship between Nadia and Senator Lerner as well as one with his and Clarise's son, Jeremiah. After Jeremiah is arrested and charged with her murder, Clarise asks Lincoln scholar, legal expert and law professor Mac Smith and his wife Annabel...her close friends...to come to his rescue. In the novel's exciting denouement, their insiders' take on the tangled emotional environment at Ford's helps winnow out the real killer during a Gala evening at the Theatre while, on-stage, history almost repeats itself in a chilling tour de force performance by a madman.Margaret Truman has such a marvelous flair for capturing the minutiae of Washington's history as integral addenda to her thoroughly engrossing mysteries. She successfully combines a solidly-crafted police procedural format with completely believable characterizations and plenty of fast action to always provide an extremely pleasurable reading experience. I was especially interested in the material that I found here about the Theatre itself as well as Abraham Lincoln which made \\"Murder at Ford's Theatre\\" a thoroughly enjoyable read for me."},{"Title":"Murder at Ford's Theatre","review":"I have read many of her books. I found this one better than a lot of her others. I kept me going and I finished it in 2 days."},{"Title":"Murder at Ford's Theatre","review":"Margaret Truman's mysteries get better with each new one that appears. In this one, she uses Ford's Theatre as her site. Anyone who has visited Ford's Theatre will agree that she picked a place with the right atmosphere for a mystery. Someone murdered Nadia Zarinski in the alley behind Ford's Theatre. She was an intern for Senator Bruce Lerner, and there are rumors of an affair, so he is a suspect. The murder also casts an unwanted spotlight on Clarise Emerson, Lerner's former wife, head of the Ford's Theatre Society, and presidential nominee to chair the National Endowment for the Arts. Aging actor Sydney Bancroft claimed that Jeremiah Lerner, son of the Senator and Clarise, had been dating the victim. A surly brat, he ran when confronted by detectives, and was soon arrested for the murder. Clarise begs law professor Mac Smith to help her son. Mac and wife Annabel, an urbane couple, are in many of Margaret Truman's mysteries. Mac agrees to help, and the real mystery unfolds until it reaches a surprising climax. This is a splendid tale, with real characters (not cardboard) and a nice pace."},{"Title":"Murder at Ford's Theatre","review":"This was not one of Truman's best books. I kept waiting for some action and mystery... and then it did not come. The other Capital Crimes book I read most recently (Murder at the Smithsonian; Library of Congress) had a lot more intrigue.

This book fully portrays the historical content and shares the setting within the theatre to great length. The story and plot were great, but the book dragged somewhat in the middle when \\"as-been\\" actor spent time in London. I think Truman was trying to throw a bone to get readers off of the focus of the story. But overall, it was a good read and I plan to order the book as a gift to my daughter for the historical content alone."},{"Title":"Murder at Ford's Theatre","review":"I skipped the book that comes right after Murder of the Library of Congress - it's about a plane crash, and I don't like flying. I was not impressed with LoC, but since I checked out some of her more recent Capitol Crimes, I gave this one a chance. Once again, it's simply an average read. I felt that the main detectives, Klayman and Johnson, were stereotypes. Klayman is the nerdy, white Jewish kid with a bleeding heart; Johnson is the black family man who sees crimes realistically. Their dialogue was not believable, but I did enjoy their working together on the job. (Did I need to read about Klayman dining with Johnson and his family? No, and I skimmed those and other irrelevant parts.)I dislike the fact that everyone uses the term \\"make love\\" to describe Nadia's hook-ups. Only in one instance, when being described by a young man, was the term \\"screw\\" used. Instead of the fluffy \\"make love\\", couldn't other professionals have used \\"have sexual intercourse\\", \\"become physically intimate\\"?The Smiths aren't as prominent in this story. Mac is more of the \\"hero\\" in that he is teaching a class in which that one of the other characters is enrolled. Mac also becomes involved in Nadia's murder case. Wife Annabel tries to support friend Clarise, who is working on something political.What I did like what the history woven into the story. Truman researched Lincoln's assassination. The descriptions of DC were, of course, appreciated.As the daughter of a former President, Truman knows what makes Washingtonians tick - what gets them to become so cutthroat, so phony, so immoral, etc. She's not afraid to use that knowledge in this book, creating a few vile characters in this installment.Because of all the cliches and forced dialogue, I'm not sure if I'm going to read the other two Capitol Crimes that I checked out of the library."},{"Title":"Murder at Ford's Theatre","review":"I Love these books, I love the insight and the stories. Keep them coming."},{"Title":"Murder at Ford's Theatre","review":"With a title to entice one to expect a connection to John Wilkes Booth (perhaps his ghost) and the happenings of April 14, 1865, the reader will be sadly disappointed. This being the first Margaret Truman-penned book for me to be even slightly interested in reading, I was not prepared for something so mundane. It was full of politics, not so much mystery.The elderly British movie star who got no respect in America put on a show as demented spouting Shakespeare: \\"to be\\" (to go on living) or \\"not to be\\" (to take his own life) emulated Booth's actions at times. Some prurient characters ruin the story which might have historical significance had not the premise fallen into morass.One historical fact I did not know was that the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. was around the circle from Watergate, which has its own stigma, faced the Reflecting Pool, with the Capitol on the other end, had been copied from the view by the Taj Mahal and Versailles. Another bit of history is that in 1965, Ford's Theatre was restored and opened again as a working theater and proclaimed a National Historic Site. The British spelling was used as back then all things British were considered superior to USA (Jack, now you know!)"},{"Title":"Murder at Ford's Theatre","review":"This is my first encounter with a Margaret Truman mystery; I choose this audio book after reading her obituary. I did enjoy the experience overall - she had a very engaging writing style. There are spot-on descriptions of characters that fall into classic archetypes. And the book is full of rich detail on the Washington and arts milieu. I especially appreciated how facts about Lincoln's life and death were made relevant through various characters. However, I found the story itself serviceable; there were several plausible suspects to keep me guessing, but not much action or twists."},{"Title":"Murder at Ford's Theatre","review":"Margaret Truman has entertained us for years with her homicidal tour of Washington landmarks. The current stop at Ford's Theater is no exception. Nadia, a young, sexy, female intern to powerful Senator Lerner is found dead in the alley outside of Ford's Theater, where she sometimes volunteered. The media had previously alleged sexual activity between her and the senator. Clarise, the director of the operating arm of the theater is the senator's ex-wife, currently preparing for confirmation hearings on her appointment to head the National Endowment for the Arts. Their son may be the last person to have seen the intern alive. While there are other suspects, the police narrow in on the son, and Clarise calls on friend Mackensie Smith to help out. Smith, and his wife Annabel, are the usual principles in Truman's Washington tours, but this time we have new characters in the leading roles. D.C. police Rick Klayman, the young white detective and his veteran partner Mo Johnson carry the investigation and much of the story line to its not unexpected but still satisfying conclusion. Along the way we learn quite a bit about Lincoln, the theater, the assasination, Booth, and others. There is even a has-been British Shakespearean actor, and admirer of Booth, who attempts to recreate that worthy's most famous role. All in all, Truman has given us another enjoyable and educational stop on her continuing tour."},{"Title":"Murder at Ford's Theatre","review":"Yes, it does remind one of the sorry scandal in Washington concerning Chandra Levy, and it makes one think these things still go on.

In fact, Klayman has enrolled in Mac's class. Since Clarise's son is charged with the homicide and Mac and his former partner represent him, things start to get interesting.In the end, Clarise withdraws her name from NEA consideration.

It begins in an unknown city somewhere in America in years and decades directly after the McCarthy era levels of censorship. Media has become the center of American culture, and many people's parlor walls are covered with giant, super-enhanced HDTVs, lowering their level of interaction with each other to almost nothing in respect to both its quantity and its quality. The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman, but he has never actually put out a fire in his life (at least not intentionally). All houses have been permanently fireproofed with plastic sheaths for nearly 50 years, and the jobs of firemen have been changed from protecting the public from fire to \\"protecting\\" the public with fire. As reality TV, comedy shows and pulp fiction/romance novels became more and more popular, non-fiction and the classics were read less and less until, as Captain Beatty, the fire captain and primary personified villain of the novel, says, \\"(Most people's) sole knowledge of Hamlet was a one-page digest in a book that claimed: 'now at least you can read all the classics; keep up with your neighbors.'\\" As public interest in books, newspapers, and other sources of information waned, the school system and general level of education grew less and less complex/competent, until eventually the government took advantage of the situation and began cutting off all books which \\"offended\\" any minority, no matter how small, proclaiming equal treatment for all and the evils of literature loudly. In order to enforce this ban which the people had so perfectly brought down upon themselves, the government changed the fire department into its secret police, stating that they were protecting the public from the \\"harm\\" of these books while truly cutting them off from the only source of knowledge able to save them from the impending but largely ignored or unconcerning massive international atomic war. As Guy races against time, the odds, and the power of the government and its incredibly seductive mass media, he attempts to break through to someone, trying to find some way to destroy the killer system before it's too late. Can he destroy the system with the help of an old retired English professor named Faber? Or will Captain Beatty and the government's deadly Mechanical Hound catch up with him first? The playing out and ultimate conclusion of this conflict is an incredibly deep and powerful reflection on our American culture today, and on our seemingly insatiable desire for pleasure and entertainment without having to do any more work or self-education/learning in order to get it than we see as being absolutely necessary. Written in McCarthy era America before the dawn of the television, the rise of televised NFL and ESPN, and the surrealistic and ever growing worlds of video games, movies and the Internet, Fahrenheit 451 predicts with eerie accuracy directions in our culture which 50 years ago would have been regarded as impossible science fiction dystopia, but now are considered an ever growing part of normal daily life. As the quality of our public school system continues to decline, and fast cars, pornography, and having fun with friends quickly become more important than keeping on top of government, state, or even local affairs for the vast majority of the American population, one might stop to wonder between one's job and the entertainments we all seem to live for and rush home to every night why we're doing anything like this-what is it we really value in life? In Montag's world, the sources for those values have been taken away, sacrificed to the peoples' ever-growing and insatiable desire for pleasure. Will--or could--our civilization go the same way, walking blindly to the very edge of a worldwide atomic war? Judge for yourself after reading America's fate in the incredible future-predicting novel Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"By Brian WalshThis book is set in the future. A future where the idiot reigns supreme. A future where TVs are full, 4-wall rooms, and the characters on it are called a family. A future where all learning and real thought is illegal. A future where books are illegal, and the fire brigade has been changed into a book-burning brigade. A future where the government strives to make everyone happy. A future that, thankfully, will never exist.The government abolishes anything controversial, to keep the masses happy. This includes religion, the arts, and all forms op open thought. No-one has a vent for the soul, and they become mindless mush-people. All they do in life is get up, go to work, press buttons, come home, go into the TV-room, eat, and fall asleep.To please everyone, books have been abolished, to eradicate controversy. However, the populace still kept books they liked and read them. To enforce the law, the government called book-readers insane andTurned the (obsolete) fire brigade into enforcers of this law.The main character in this book is a fireman called Guy Montag. His wife is a typical person of his time. However, he is starting to talk to a young girl, his next-door neighbour, who obviously reads books. He becomes a little confused, and starts reading books himself. His workmates start getting suspicious, and it's only a matter of time before they find out his hobby. What happens? Read the book yourself!This is a good futuristic fantasy, focusing on the pessimistic side of society, and thinking what would it be like if this were society. Ray Bradbury is a great writer, and this book, despite its faults, is a great read for anyone who is ready to read it. My rating: 4 stars (out of 5)."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"From the temperature at which books burn, Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 illustrates a frightening idea of the future, a future where firemen do not put out fires but start them. Guy Montag, a book-burning fireman, obtains a job to achieve the society's highest objective, happiness. In Montag's world, trivial information (as from television) is good, and knowledge and ideas are bad. Guy was once happy when he burnt books in the fireproof houses, but this happiness becomes questionable when he meets the new 17-year-old neighbor girl, Clarisse, who is thrilled by the ideas from books and the world around her. Before he met Clarisse (who told him about the past when people were not afraid and firemen prevented fires) Guy never questioned anything. While Guy experiences a faith crisis, his wife spends all day in front of the television wall, with her television \\"family.\\" When Clarisse disappears mysteriously, Guy becomes motivated and starts to hide books. Eventually, Mildred, Guy's wife turns him in and he must either flee or become arrested.Fahrenheit 451 is a novel with many alarming resemblances to our current world. This story talks about how books are unnecessary. To keep people happy, society only lets people remember insignificant information, mainly from television. Some people will receive ideas from books, while others may not. Therefore, books imply that people could be discriminated against, and discrimination would defeat the purpose true happiness. This is similar to what our world, where young people are more interested in television than reading.Books give people knowledge and the freedom to perceive differences. This novel taught me a lot about the importance of reading for everyone. At the end of the novel, homeless people realize how important books are and that authors spent their lives, writing their thoughts and expressions, which would eventually be forgotten in the fires. Authors write their stories to have the reader relate to the characters and plot. These wanderers memorized books to convey their knowledge to the next generation. I would recommend this novel to everyone, especially people who do not like to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury makes it look effortless. The story reads so fast it is as if the author wrote it in one sitting with no revisions. This book is the perfect quick read for those on-the-go folks who have little time for leisure reading. And when you are finished, you will uncover another reason the book is so short."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I admit it was strange reading at first and a slightly different writing style that I am used to...but considering this book was written 1953....AMAZING! A book definitely before its time and can be truly applied and understood today. This is something I would definitely want my children to read!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I love the science fiction genre of books. This one tops my list of sci-fi stories.I first heard of Ray Bradbury in sixth grade with a short story called \\"All Summer in a Day\\". I loved the story so I looked for other books by him. I found this one in a bookstore and even though the price was high I bought it.It was worth it. I finished it in a matter of hours, as it was well-written with a very interesting plot. Having that special Bradbury touch was a great bonus."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This timeless classic speaks to what can happen as life continues to speed out of control. Censorship runs rapid as people seek to become more efficient. The phrase \\"take time to smell the roses\\" has been obliterated as these people would only recognize a rose as a colored blur as they speed through their lives. It is a story of one man, full of hope, listening to his heart as he figures out that there is a sense of purpose for all of us. Originally published in 1950 under the title \\"The Fireman,\\" this story has stood the test of time."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I cannot stress enough how this work is a priceless asset to our social community. Along with helping our society to protect our right of free press it continues to alert many of us to the necessity of books. Sure, with free press we also got some filth floating around, yet you're free to not read those, as you are absolutely free to read this and the many others of invaluable worth. We are humans, we are not perfect and we may have already taken turns we could have avoided. (Like maybe way back when, we should have chosen the steam car option instead of the gas one. Think about it, take the same years of innovation that we invested in the gas car and, well, by now we would have gotten that steamer to go pretty fast too.) But here we are and it's best to continue with our best foot forward. Books like this one, like 1984 and like Utopian Reality are not only entertaining, but also very instrumental in helping us decide the best foot to step out on. It's a comfort to know authors like Bradbury, took that difficult trip to examine the future and then presented it to us, so we can simply make the decision; well this is a road we don't want to take. Without the commotion and concern created from Fahrenheit 451, where do you think we would be right now? Well a good chance is, you wouldn't be reading this at this exact moment cause books that question our societies future would have been banned."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ok. I read Fahrenheit 451, and I have to say that I should have read it earlier. The story encased in this bound grouping of parchment is a warning to the societies of today against censorship and ignorance, which I really enjoyed.The book takes place somewhere in the 21st Century, and revolves around a man named Guy Montag, who is a fireman, but not of the conventional sense. The government of the story's time is one of ignorance and arrogance. It boasts several nuclear wars and a ban against books, which is where the firemen come into play; whereupon books are found, the firemen appear soon afterwards.The entire line of events surrounding Guy and his job is very interesting and thought-provoking, lined with intellectual discussions concerning firemen, the ban, and the emotional detachment to most other people that is sported by the entire population of the country.The conclusion of this book is surprising, and highlights a miniscule but hardy population of intellectuals living outside the public eye, just waiting for the opportunity to bloom in a society wiped clean by their own conceit and cruelty. Plus, it's nice to think that, even in a world full of lies and spite, intelligence and compassion can still survive, even if it's only in a brilliant literary work.At around 179 pages long, Fahrenheit 451 is a fairly easy read, as well as a powerful one. I was able to finish it up on a ferry ride to Victoria, and then still had time to sit around and chew on pocky for the rest of the trip. You should read this book, it's very good."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"So much has been said about \\"Fahrenhiet 451\\" already. I don't really have much to add to it. Just do yourself a favor and read it. You may be shocked to find how much it mirrors the world we live in today."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Mark Twain defined a literary classic as \\"a book which people praise and don't read.\\" This, however, is not the case with Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. This was a magnificent book that really makes you appreciate life from a different perspective."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"While I didn't respect this book back when I was in high school, now that I am older I have reread and more fully understand this novel. Books like this are always terrible to write a report or critique on but are a fun read when there is no pressure. I ended up picking up a copy and reading it in less than a week. I will plan to read more Bradbury in the future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Burn it! \\"Any problem that you have can be burned away!\\" These were the lies that Guy Montag had been told ever since he came out of high school to be a fireman. But, these fireman are differerent than the fireman of today, they burn books and the houses they are found in.Guy's life was virtually the same old routine: stay at the fire house, alarm goes off, drive out to burn the place to the ground, go home and rest, do it again tomorrow. That is until he meets this 17 year old girl, Clarisse, who teaches him of a life outside of the rut. A life besides burning everything that you are called to burn. A time where books are not burned, but cherished. This lesson sends Montag into a spiraling argument inside of himself. The more that he meets with Clarisse, a side of him shows that he didn't even know existed, and Guy begins to grow curious about what books are really like to read.I love this masterful creation by Bradbury. The beginning is very slow and confusing to understand but the ending keeps you waiting for more. This book is perfectly written as to set you up with background information and then pour on the action towards the end. I highly recommend this book for higher level readers looking for an intellegent thrill ride."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I started reading Fahrenheit 451 for a summer reading assignment. As I kept reading I really got in to the book. Ray Bradbury did a great job describing the characters. The book is about a future world that gives you a glimpse of what our world would be like without books. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a book with some action and a great story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A dark tale that warns about the limits of censorship. Highly recomended as an introduction to Bradbury. Everyone should read this because it is a classic and is referenced throughout pop culture."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ordered this for my son for a required summer reading assignment. Arrived quickly. He dug right into the book and seems to be enjoying it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a science fiction classic that really gets you thinking. In America it is difficult to imagine a world where free thought is so blatantly censured, but other governments in our world seek to keep their peoples ignorant of the great ideas of writers. This is one of those \\"it could happen if we're not careful\\" books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"While many people consider Ray Bradbury to be a science fiction writer, that is a very inaccurate and incomplete categorization. He is a master storyteller, in many ways I consider him superior to Asimov and Heinlein, because he is better able to take an effective turn to the dystopia or macabre genres.This book is truly one of the best unfortunate futuristic or dystopia stories ever written. Montag is a fireman, only now they start fires rather than put them out. The job of the fire department is to wait around for an informant to expose someone who still owns books. If that tip turns out to be accurate, they go to the house, douse the books with kerosene and then burn them.As the story opens, Montag is like his comrades in the fire department, he loves his job and never thinks too much about the consequences of what it is that he is doing. However, when one woman prefers to go up in flames with her books rather than live without them, he begins to have doubts. Unfortunately, his is not a society that deals easily with people having such doubts and he becomes a criminal on the run.In typical Bradbury style the story ends on an ambiguous note. While Montag is still living and there is the potential for a better future, it is not a certainty. Fortunately, he is now among other people who cherish the knowledge contained in books, so there is hope that literary civilization will rise again."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"While many people consider Ray Bradbury to be a science fiction writer, that is a very inaccurate and incomplete categorization.

His use of language is versatile and poetic, his stories are intriguing and intelligent, and this one is no exception.Like all the best science fiction writers, Bradbury is not just talking about the future. His book is a message for today. It is an error to think that Bradbury is talking here about censorship and control in the manner of, say, 1984. In fact Bradbury is more concerned with a hedonistic society with an increasingly short attention span as we are spoon fed what we need to know through sound bites and adverts.Bradbury is making a case for the reading of books to enhance critical thinking, and to allow us to understand the bigger picture. He was worried about how television was eroding the reading of literature - and he was rightly worried.This book is a powerful statement, and a good read. Classic Ray Bradbury."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a quick read, but nonetheless powerful. Montag's world mirrors our own in many ways. The parlor walls=LCD TV's. The seashell radios=constantly being preoccupied with our iPods/cell phones. Even the dog, man's 'best friend' is replaced by a mechanical hound. In Montag's world, people have become mechanized and conditioned to become mindless, selfish consumers of entertainment to the point of losing their humanity. Montag's got an itch to scratch, and it's interesting to note that he had already begun his journey out of the cave well before he met Clarisse McLellan as the book begins, so when did the initial spark actually happen? He relates his story of how he met the man in the park (Faber), so Clarisse was really just a catalyst in his transformation. Many themes are explored in this book: censorship, individuality, literacy, illiteracy, suicide, man vs. society and many more. This was required reading while I was in high school, a time when cell phones were much less ubiquitous and iPods non-existent. At the time, I understood the story, and we analyzed the book in class perfunctorily, but re-reading the book myself through the years, I've come to appreciate its themes and relevance. I smile every time I see it in Barnes & Noble at the summer reading table, along with the other classics. I'm jealous of whomever is reading it for the first time because I'll never again get to experience that genuine shock when that salamander stops at Montag's own home. It would be a shame if Fahrenheit 451 wasn't required reading in high school these days."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I mainly bought this book to read it in a plane (a 14 hours trip, and for some reason, I rarely sleep in an airplane). However, I couldn't sleep that day not because I usually don't sleep in airplanes, but because this book was THAT good. It's surprising how close to reality the narrative is. For today, people worship their TV's and laptops. The book is well written; the author utilized metaphors, similes and other writing techniques to create the dark, desperate atmosphere of the unnamed city and its people.I really enjoyed reading this book. If you want a dark, short, great novel, this is the perfect choice. However, be warned, the extensive use of similes and metaphors might confuse you (I had to re-read several paragraphs due to their complex structure.)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have heard that some people refuse to read books which have not been around for at least 30 years, having proven their ability to stand the test of time. In reading Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury* I came to understand this reasoning. I read the 50th anniversary edition and as I delved into it, I found myself shocked to have never read this igniting book before. It has been said that books are so patient they will at times wait centuries for the right reader to come along and bring them to life once again.\\"Cram them full of noncombustable data, chock them so damned full of \`facts' they feel stuffed, but absolutely \`brilliant' with information. Then they will feel they're thinking, they'll get a sense of motion without moving. And then they'll be happy...\\"Books such as Into the Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains and Fahrenheit 451 though they were written years apart are trying to raise awareness that we are losing something. We hear everywhere about how education is going downhill, literacy at an all time low. These are all red flags to show the dangerous path our culture is headed down. We must listen! It's time to wakeup as individuals, and not settle for the status quo, there is such a richness we are missing in the power of reading, because we feast on momentary delights.Fahrenheit 451 is a book for book lovers, educators, and parents. Each of us has the power to influence someone in our lives and one of the most important areas which we must encourage others in is literacy. Today we live in a culture which is being robbed of literacy and creativity by lulling simplistic entertainment and never ending noise coming through such mindnumbing channels as TV, social media, gaming, internet surfing, etc. \\"Then- motion pictures in the early twentieth century. Radio. Television. Things began to have mass...And because they had mass, they became simpler.\\"Oh, I am not pointing any fingers at anyone but myself, lately I have seen that if I do not intentionally guard my life and invest it wisely, I look back to realize that it has slipped through my fingers like water yet produced no nothing lasting.\\"This age thinks better of a gilded fool than a threadbare saint in wisdom's school.\\" - Thomas DekkerSo be revolutionary, unique, eccentric, radical, unsatisfied and pick up a book! Because your thirst will drive you to wells more deep than what you have experienced. Allow reading to take you on a journey of awakening, it may give you a glimpse of the something more you have been longing for.* I definitely recommend the 50th Anniversary version, because for those who love to know the story behind the story there is an afterward written by Bradbury, as well as an interview and some other goodies."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have read Fahrenheit 451 several times, and it is one of my favorite novels. Its censorship themes seem just as relevant today as they did in the 1950s. In Fahrenheit 451, some books deemed illegal, and firemen are responsible for tracking down and burning every last copy.The U.S. government's efforts to stop Wikileaks reminded me of Bradbury's firemen. Federal agencies went through extreme measures to attempt to stop or slow the release of classified documents. I was also reminded of Fahrenheit 451 when the Pentagon arranged to buy every copy of Army Reserve Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer's memoir \\"Operation Dark Heart\\" before they could reach the shelves.I would like to ask Bradbury, do you think current censorship policies are on the verge of reaching Fahrenheit 451 levels?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Because of the current usage of terms taken from classic dystopian novels - Big Brother, Fahrenheit 9/11, etc - I had stayed away from such novels. I wasn't interested in what I thought would be whiny books about the government and the authority.Thank God, I was wrong.*Fahrenheit 451* is a true masterpiece. Known as science-fiction, it's much more, because the world Bradbury depicts shares some striking similarities with ours, and, considering the time Bradbury wrote it, one can only bow to his sense of foresight.*fahrenheit 451* is somewhere between *1984* and *Brave New World*. It combines elements from both dystopias and does something very clever with it. Instead of having a dystopia imposed from the top down, Bradbury creates a more subtle world with shades of grey. The result is a much more believable universe, which we can already recognise in our very own, current world. And that's the freaky part.The writing per se is rich, poetic, never pointless, always efficient. Everything counts, not one page for nothing. It has all the elements of a good short story - which it started as - combined with the dimensions of a novel. It's still a relatively short novel, at 200 pages or so, but that doesn't matter one bit. Bradbury's prose is terrific.I can only recommend this novel to anyone. Whether you're into sci-fi or not seems beside the point with this book; if you like sci-fi, for all the good reasons, then you should love it, and if you don't care about sci-fi, you should still love it. It may even make you appreciate sci-fi if you never did before.This novel is deep, well-crafted, and philosophical. It's one of those books you feel has truly given you something valuable."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Imagine living in a world in which you are so disconnected from other people that you spend your waking hours in your parlor surrounded on all sides by your TV \\"family\\". You sleep at night with ear buds whispering sweet nothings in your ear. There's a war going on and world-wide economic problems, but you don't notice. In fact, you don't want to notice because that would upset you. You don't read books because that might upset you too. You don't talk to people or even think because that too might upset you. So you spend your time amidst the flashing lights in your parlor or speeding 100 miles an hour down the road - anything that distracts you from anything upsetting.This is the world Guy Montag lives in, is part of and actively enforces. He is a \\"fireman\\" - one who starts fires rather than putting them out. When the alarm goes off, he races to the scene and glories in the smell of kerosene and the power of his igniter. He is merely protecting people from danger - the danger of books. He feels triumphant as he watches them flutter like dying birds amidst the flames. Life is good. He is happy.Or is he? The first clue is that Montag seems to be the only one who doesn't like the Mechanical Hound so much. But his \\"happiness\\" really starts to unravel when he meets Clarisse McClellan, a girl who's \\"seventeen and crazy\\". She does really odd things like take walks, look at the stars, talk to people. She asks Montag if it's true that firemen used to put out fires? Nah, couldn't be.Montag is irritated and infuriated by her, but still drawn to her, awakened by her. Then one day she's gone and Montag's world is never the same. He's haunted by a fire in which a woman was burned - chose to burn herself - along with her books. He secretly steals a book from the fire. Actually, his hands have been doing that all along, but he's never let his mind know it. Montag becomes drawn to - obsessed by - books. He tries to share them with his wife, Mildred, but the more he reaches out, the more she retreats to the parlor \\"family\\" to soothe her distress. He's going to ruin her happiness. Montag secretly turns to the one person left who might help him - or at least hear him. A old professor he met once, actually talked to.Of course, nothing that Montag does is actually secret. His Fire Chief, Beatty, knows the anguish Montag is going through. He tries to explain it all to Montag. How books cause insecurity and conflict. How they conflict with each other and are, ultimately, empty. How people are better off - happier - without them. How the people themselves wanted the books banned and burned. Beatty tries to teach Montag a lesson and then give him the opportunity to return to the fold. But the fabric is already rent, and things unravel as they inevitably must.This book is remarkably prescient for having been written in 1953. Not only does Bradbury accurately predict the invention of large-screen TVs that can be hung on a wall and personalized entertainment systems that can be plugged directly into one's ears, but he predicted much of the dystopian society we now live in. Wars, famine and economic crises are erupting all over the world, but we're more concerned about our \\"family\\" - Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears, the Palins, among others. People are going hungry, but all is right with the world so long as we can have our SUVs and iPhones.\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" isn't so much about government censorship. Sure, the Firemen operate under the auspices of the government, but it's a democratic government. The government operates on behalf of the people. It is the people who have demanded the suppression of knowledge because it is messy, unsettling and \\"unhappy\\". The people don't want to be roused from their pleasurable bubble of overstimulation. True thought and relatedness - and the pauses and silences necessary for them - are far more threatening than being \\"comforted\\" (controlled) by a benign authoritarian government.Nevertheless, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" optimistically predicts a world in which, if enough people can hold on to enough shreds of the knowledge contained in books and passed down generation to generation, eventually the cycle of destroying knowledge as threatening will cease. Wisdom will eventually permeate enough of the world to be able to withstand the destructive forces of fear and ignorance. I'd like to share Bradbury's optimism, but I'm not sure I can. Within my lifetime I've seen education devalued and ignorance celebrated. Wisdom may win out in the end, but I fear our civilization will face the same end as Montag's before that happens.But aw, heck, let's talk about something important. When does the next \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" begin?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Very well-written science fiction from 1950. Despite being written before the explosion of modern technology, Bradbury's book-burning story makes many timeless observations about censorship and the suppression of original thought and personal interaction.Bradbury's seashells as earbuds and the parlors with surrounding interactive screens are hardly a stretch to imagine if you have ever competed with an iPod or a flat screen for another person's attention.SPOILER ALERTDespite many hopeless characters and some violent destruction, the ending is optimistic as Montag and his hideout professors devise a way to preserve the classics."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is the second time I've read this book, and it's even more engaging than I remember.

I hated this book for several reasons. First of all, the story was way too jumpy. It started slow, and then randomly got fast. It had absolutly no suspense to it. I found myself forcing myself to read! I couldn't relate to any of the characters! For instance, some of the characters were too boring. Maybe if I read this book in this book in ten years I would have a different opinion. Another reason why I didn't like this book, is because the characters weren't seen enough. They were all just thrown in at different times. You didn't feel like you got to know them very well and I hate that. I would not recommend this book. I think that Ray Bradbury needs to rethink his book ideas! I do not want to be critical of Ray Bradbury, but really I couldn't stand this book. It had no meaning to me. It also, had a poor plot and setting. For instance, it was plotted in the future yet it was no different than today.

How can a book that takes the name of the Lord in vain, in almost every page, be used as a class novel. Everyone knows that taking the Lord's name in vain is breaking one of God's commandments, and is a sin. I have never read a book that was as bad as Fahrenheit 451 in language.

This story takes place in a place that is supposed to be in the future where books are restricted and illegal. Firemen did not go to set out fires, but to light books on fire. The main character of this story is Guy Montag, who is a fireman. He becomes friends with an odd girl named Clarisse. She changes his mind about his job and how life should really be. Television is more important than family in this story, and Montag's wife, Millie, refers to the people in the television as her \`family'. This book was very original and out of the blue and also creative. Ray Bradbury's writing style was very interesting. He used a lot of skilled vocabulary that was confusing, and the whole book was like a jumble of words that were hard to understand. Some of the ideas in the book did not really pertain to the book's plot. I would definitely not recommend this book to anyone below the seventh grade. I am a seventh grader in Massachusetts and I hated this book. I didn't like it because it was so boring and it goes really slow. Fahrenheit 451 is this kind of book that makes you feel like reading it was a whole waste of time because it was so boring and pointless. I would recommend this though to people above the seventh grade who like science fiction book. If not, this book is not recommended at all by me."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I believe this book to be completely and inutterably crazy. I dislike it because of its content.

The main character is a man named Montag, a fireman whose job it is to burn books. In this story Montag is secretly reading, even though the punishment for reading is either life in jail or death. In this world there are many technologies that control people's lives.I think that Ray Bradbury should have done made the plot more clear. At the beginning of this book I was confused about the world where the story took place, which meant I couldn't relate to Montag or the story. By the end of the book, I was still left wondering about what happened to certain characters or why certain things happened.There are many ways he could have made this story better. He could have added more conflict in the plot or action in Montag's life. I did not enjoy the sci-fi aspect of the story because the complex technology interfered with the lives of the characters.

She was the only good character, and she was only in it for two chapters! By the end, I hate to say, I really couldn't have cared less what happened to Montag. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to burn books or anything: the plot was an excellent idea, but the story didn't pull me in at all. I was hoping I'd enjoy it, even though I don't like science fiction, but I didn't. It was better than I had expected in some ways, which is why I'm giving it two stars. It makes you think about important things, like censorship and where it will lead us in the future.So, read it if you must, and think about its ideas, but don't expect too much. The best thing about this book is that it's short."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book I read this quarter is called Fahrenheit 451. The author of the book is Ray Bradbury. The book takes place in the future. Some of the environments include: Montag's house, the fire house, and Faber's house. In my oponion, the city and the river were the most important sites in the book. The city is were Montag was chased, and the river is important because this is where Montag finally dodged the city officials. I think that Fahrenheit 451 would best be classified as a science fiction. It is this genre because it is set in the future. Also, it is make believe because firefighters don't burn books in our society. Ray Bradbury has written many short stories, novels, plays, and poems. At 12, he wrote his first short story. He has produced two of his own plays, made two musicals, and helped with an animated film. In 1962 Icarcs Mantgolfer was nomanated for an academy award. Ray Bradbury has had his own television show, named the Ray Bradbury Theater has won many different cable awards. The book is about a firefighter named Guy Montag. His job is not to put out fires, but to set books ablaze. As the story goes along he starts to question many things about his job and the books he burns. About this time Guy starts stealing books. He made many attempts to read them, but he didn't understand them. Guy then contacted Faber, a retired professor, to help him interpret the books. Then Beatty, the fire chief, suspected Guy of burning books. Because this was aganist the law, Bettay went to Guy's house to burn his books. At that time Bettay placed Montag under arrest. Fearing he might be killed, Guy flees from city officals. He finally loses them when he hides in the river. When Guy emerges he meets a group of retired professors and teachers. They helped Guy escape and they recite to him as they travel. That is where the book ended. . The main character of the book is Guy Montag. He is a firefighter. Montag was not very educated, but he was \\"programed\\" to set books on fire. Guy is important to the book because if he wasn't there then there would be no book. He is also important because he is the olny person with the drive needed to change the laws of owning books. He is married to Mildred Moontag. Another improtant character of the book is Faber. He is a retired professor who quit when the college where he taught closed. Faber, a very well educated man, had been illegally reading books very discreetly. Faber is improtant to the book because without Faber's help Montag never would have escaped. Faber is also the person who coached Montag whenever he was in trouble. I think the theme of the book is that we shouldn't take books forgranted. I think Farheniet 451 is saying that books are very important resources and that slowly with technology thay are becomming more and more obsolete. Overall I liked most of the book. There were many dead spots in the book that left me lost. At the begenning I really didn't catch on and understand the it. But, when it picked up, it was a very good and interesting book.

In this society, the fireman has to set up fires and burn the books. Usually when we hear &quot;fireman&quot;, we always think about that their job is to put out fires.

Bradbury's usage of imagery allowed me to really get into his other short stories. I immediately had an interest for the book as soon as I read the first page; the way Ray Bradbury created a visual image in my mind lead me to continue reading to the very end.Fahrenheit 451 is about Guy Montag, a fireman in a futuristic world where he and his fellow firemen start fires, rather than put them out; however his whole way of thinking is put into question after meeting a strange girl who lives on his block. Ray Bradbury creates a situation where the main character (Montag), after discovering the knowledge books bring, has a desire to be heard with his ideas expressed. \\"I just want someone to hear what I have to say. And maybe if I talk long enough, it'll make sense\\" (81). Guy Montag can be described as a person who relies on others for support and direction. Guys' new way of thinking is challenged by the fire chief, Beatty, who tries to return Guy back to ignorance like the rest of the world, trying to convince Montag to burn his books. \\"Its real beauty is that it destroys responsibility and consequences\\" (115). After a long internal struggle within his own mind Montag comes to a decision that ultimately changes him. No longer does he rely on others and follow what they say, Guy Montags' knew found knowledge gives him an independent growth. \\"I don't want to change sides and just be told what to do. There's no reason to change if I do that\\" (93).I agree with other costumer review when they write things like \\"wonderful and still relevant\\", \\"wonderful book\\", and \\"short classic\\". The book in itself is a very interesting view on society and it is truly a short but still entertaining book. Touching on many key issues in our own society while putting them in a creative twist I can understand why many people gave this book such a high rating.In conclusion this book was fascinating with great characters and an even greater storyline. Though many people may not like this story, I found it to have an excellent plot and I felt Bradbury put amazing imagery within the text. I recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Ray Bradbury and even if you're not a fan I would still highly recommend this book to someone who wants an exciting and interesting novel to read.TJHS 12th grade student"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have long been a fan of the 1965 film \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" which is based on this 1953 Ray Bradbury novel. The two are only somewhat similar which makes reading the novel and seeing the film well worth your while. This novel paints a dystopian view of the future...a society where books are banned because of the way they make people feel. Bradbury imagines a world where people are drawn to video images on the screen (how hauntingly predictable!) and a government which has strangled creativity and original thinking. Guy Montag, a fireman, is a government \\"agent\\" whose job requires him to destroy by fire books wherever they can be found. He meets a young woman and is suddenly challenged by feelings he has long since suppressed. He begins to read some of the books seized and this sets him on a collision course with the government and his superiors.

People want to be happy, isn't that right?\\"Guy Montag is a fireman in an American city of the future. However, with all of the buildings fireproofed, Guy spends his time burning the one thing that cannot be allowed in society - books. He enjoys his work, the purification of civilization by fire, but something is missing. When he meets a new neighbor girl, Clarisse, he realizes that it's something that has been done away with - the idea of thought.Clarisse opens Montag's world to the fact that society as he knows it is useless. Citizens walk around numb, feeling and thinking nothing, over-stimulated and constantly seeking pleasure and happiness. There is no sadness, no discomfort of thought, no desire to be a better person. Ideas and thoughts have gone away with the books who carried their message, and silence has been replaced by constant noise and activity.It is this new-found knowledge that changes Montag's life. No longer content to simply exist, he begins stealing books from the homes he burns to see what all the fuss is about. And by gaining this illicit knowledge, he begins to make changes that will impact not only him but those around him.I must confess that I picked up \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" with no clue as to what it was about. Throughout, I was shocked at how much of the horror in the book has come to pass. Though it was written less than 60 years ago, our world has come to resemble the society in the book in many ways.

It is a frightening vision of a fascist, future America where dissent and independent thought is discouraged.

People are absorbed by huge televisions displaying mindless programming. Written in 1960, the novel is set around our time. In our alternate history, people stopped reading books, and humanities courses in college lost interest and were dropped. Society became ever more automic and fast-paced.

He meets a lovely, young lady who asks him questions and gets his mind thinking. In secret, he begins to keep and read some of the books and discovers a new world. He also meets an old man who used to be a humanities professor; he shows Montag his library and helps him to see things in a new light.This is an amazing classic novel.

While watching Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, I was overcome with a desire to read the book when the Nazis were burning books. For years, whenever my college Christian group discussed book burning, I would accuse them of being Nazi Germany or mention this book under my breath. And, of course, I had never read it. However, after reading it, I was more right than I ever could have known . . .When I started this book, I fully expected some elaborate government coup to permanently do away with books as a way of citizen control. But I did not expect it to have originated with the people! In a society where people are focused on instant gratification and personal equality (similar to Harrison Bergeron), books are thrown by the wayside. Condensed down to small encyclopedia references, people can no longer need a college education to be up on the latest work of literature, like Shakespeare. However, seeing the pointlessness in that, books, which are about people who aren't even real, were replaced by \\"real\\" people in wall TVs.However, after the people decided to do away with books, the government saw a toehold and used it for their advantage. Reading the book really made me think more about what we put importance on. Look at all of the game shows on TV, the bigger and better entertainment systems we want, etc. We stopped asking why.Even though she did not have much time in the book, I loved Clarisse! She was a simple, beautiful, and delightful character! Just her presence and her refusal to accept life the way she was told made a huge difference in Montag's life. Her love to just talk and ask questions was pivotal in his development as a character.This book is really hard to explain.

Bradbury's writing is powerful and at times nerve wracking as he takes us through fireman Montag's conversion from a book burning drone to one who wants to read and preserve them. Through his almost stream of consciousness writing, his edgy use of adverbs which create powerful images, Bradbury builds the suspense and action at a breakneck speed. Bradbury is prophetic in characterizing how modern technology can turn humans into mindless, manipulated morons. The TV screens surrounding the typical home in the novel are eerily familiar to the way reality shows today envelop the minds of their viewers, making them obsess on meaningless and mindless things like which rich wife yelled at whom, while those in power create and manipulte the world for us for their own ends."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Even though this book was written 60 years ago it's amazing how much it still applies to today.

The government says that books are silly and the words meaningless yet destroys them all proving that someone in authority firmly believes that a book is a dangerous thing. Which is actually what happens. Montag meets a girl who society deems 'crazy' and she puts a little thought in his head. Next thing he knows he is questioning why. Why he is a fireman. Why the books are so dangerous. Why Why Why. Questions that to maintain peace and balance should not be asked.Overall I found that I enjoyed this book despite it being totally different from what I am used to reading even though many times I had to read a paragraph over again because I missed some thing that ended up being important. I found Montag's discovery of himself and nature a bit hard to follow. His journey to discovery read a lot like descent into madness which I thought was hard at times to follow.

Through his strong use of metaphors, the reader is able to better understand the complex feelings and emotions of the characters that would otherwise be difficult to describe. The division of the book helps the reader watch the main character, Montag, progress and develop.

This distrust of intelligence and non-conformity is taken to the extreme by Bradbury, with stark and memorable results. By discouraging education and all forms of intelligent discourse, the future government is able to control the population not merely by force or threats, but by providing an endless flow of mindless entertainment, which (nearly) everyone happily accepts. Like sheep before the slaughter, the placated citizenry of Fahrenheit 451 simply doesn't know any better than to believe what the government pronounces at face value. This perverse form of \\"mind control\\"- enforced by keeping minds happily engaged in only the most trivial of pursuits- works only too well, since it is far easier to remain ignorant than struggle to form an opposing opinion that might require courage to express. And by burning the last remaining learning tools that threaten its empire- books- the government tries to erase the possibility that anyone could stir an uprising based on ancient philosophical principles such as democracy, liberty, and self-determination.Ignorance becomes not only bliss, but a frightening way of life.Bradbury is one of the original \\"Golden Age\\" science fiction writers, and that shows in this book. There's the element of the fantastic in the everyday gadgets here, more speculation and wonder that science. For this reason, it doesn't quite have the realistic edge that most mainstream fiction has, although the philosophical themes in the book elevate it to mainstream status.

Tolkein. (And yes, i understand, you can't compare the two) Fahrenheit 451 is filled to the brim with metaphors and things that seem so outlandish, that they fit with the whole aura of the novel. Now, even though, it is a very small novel, it packs a very lasting punch.According to the world(it might be our world in the future) that Bradbury created, the U.S. and possibly everyone else, hes become so automated that the people had no use for knowledge anymore! Thus, books were for burning. Thus, the title Fahrenheit 451 (the degree that paper burns). Also, the reason that books were burnt was that there were conflicting ideas in them.Ray Bradbury has created this horribly believable and yet extremely frightening FUTURE for the United States, in my opinion! Also, ity deals very slightly with the effects of war, and the fact that ALL other countries hate the U.S. in the story.

The story from Bradbury's imagination causes the reader to think... Why are books so important? Why is censorship dangerous? Why is the individual more important than the society? Why are mindless activities (such as television overdose) harmful and unprofitable? The author writes of treasures that our society takes for granted, and shows how these riches should be guarded and appreciated- not ignored.In the 50th anniversary edition of the book, the author writes an afterword about the different ways that books are \`burned' today. This censorship is not as evident as the censorship depicted in the story of Montag, but it is still happening. Bradbury suggests that political correctness has served as a censor to art. Authors and readers alike are afraid of offending someone, therefore art has been reduced to little more than People magazines and reality TV shows. Bradbury writes that it is difficult for \\"any author who dares to speak above a whisper or write above a nursery rhyme.\\" Also included at the end of the book is an interview with Ray Bradbury. This is an excellent 10-pages of interaction with the author.Will censorship ever get as radical as what happened to Montag? I doubt it.

What I didn't like about the book was that it was a little hard and confusing at times for my age reading.My favorite charater in this book was Clarisse McCellan because she has such a different mind than everyone else and sees things in different perspectives. A paragraph that meant something to me was on page 37 and said \\"Books bombarded his shoulders, his arms, his upturned face. A book lit, almost obediently, like a white pigeon, in his hands, wings fluttering. In the dim light, a page flung open and it was like a snow feather, the words delicately painted thereon.\\" It meant something to me beacause all of these books around him makes him wonder about his job, life, and Clarisse and what she had said.I would tell someone about this book that it is great but to read it at a good reading level.

And obviously, when such an issue is handled by one of the last and greatest surviving writers of the past century, Mr. Bradbury strikes the note perfectly using his his wondrous ambiguity and delightful imagery and infinitely unique writing prose.The first true step taken in a lifelong career of literature."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman in a future where they don't put out fires, but start them for the purpose of burning books. He likes his job well enough until he meets an odd 17-year-old girl named Clarisse who lives in his neighborhood. She talks about all sorts of things that Guy has never considered and he starts to think about his life and the world he lives in. Thinking is not encouraged in this future world and the entire culture seems to revolve around sensory bombardment, mindless entertainment, and a mindless apathy about anything in the real world.This book is a classic largely due to the theme of censorship and free thought. The story is more powerful because it makes it clear that book burning and censorship from the government came well after most people had already turned away from books. It started with one group being offended by one thing, another group offended by something else, until no one wanted to bother with books or anything that challenged them. As many have pointed out, our culture has actually moved closer to the world that Bradbury portrayed and that is a bit scary.The weakness of Fahrenheit 451 is the writing itself as much of the prose reads like bad poetry. It's obvious that the author was attempting to use language to evoke images and feelings, he just wasn't quite up to the challenge of doing it well. It's also quite preachy at times. I found myself skimming through whole pages after a while and even though this is a very short book, it felt like a long read.Those who have never read this book should probably do so at least once. It does discuss important issues and is probably even more timely today than it was when it was written. Don't expect a sparkling read, but the story is strong and even suspenseful in the second half."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I do not want to tell much of the story, as the unfolding is part of the intrigue. However now that houses are fire proof the purpose of firemen is performing a service by burning books to maintain the happy social order.Naturally one fireman goes awry after several emotional incidences from someone burning up with the books to a young neighbor with strange ways, which run counter to his carrier. This leads to all kinds of deviant things like reading. What are you doing now?One big rift between the book and the movie [Fahrenheit 451 (1966) -- Oscar Werner, Julie Christie] is that in the movie the \\"written word\\" was completely removed (even from the credits); where as in the book the state was against was literature and not technical writing.Books are just symbols of ideas that could have been on the screen also. There is deference between training and education. Among other reasons the book was a symbol of one mans superiority over another in a world of equals.Fahrenheit 451"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This was the first serious book I read as a teenager and it changed my life forever. I had no idea up till then how one human being could be so perceptive about what was going on around him and be able to describe it is such beauutiful prose as that used by Ray Bradbury. It made me seek out other books to where now at the age of 54, I have a substantial library. I hope this book never goes out of print, although I'm sure there's no fear of that in the near future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read the book Fahrenheit 451 as a group in my English class. I thought it was a good book to read as a group because one could get lost easily.Fahrenheit 451 had a good sequence that made the reader want to continue. The events that took place were very interesting and in a strange society. The setting was in a way a futuristic city. The houses were fireproof. The cars were traveling at fast speeds. The people were controlled by a law that stated that people are not allowed to read books.There are a few important characters in Fahrenheit 451. Montag is the main character who is a middle aged man, and works as a fireman. Mildred is Montag's wife who afraid to break a law. Clarisse is Montag's neighbor who is very intelligent and has good points. Beatty is the captain of the fire station. Faber is a very smart person who helps Montag on understanding his reading.I picked this book up because the events didn't stop. At the beginning Montag, who is the main character, talks to a girl named Clarisse. Clarisse seems intelligent, and asks Montag if he is happy. In this society they don't read books; instead they burn them. Montag is a fireman, so he burns books. After that he started to question everything in the society. Things like his job, and why they burn books instead of reading them. He sneaks a couple of books and reads them with out anyone knowing. Then he explains it to his wife who then gets scared and calls the firemen to have his books burned. Montag gets in trouble and has to hide fast. His friend Faber, who is really intelligent, helps him out.I liked couple of parts of the book.\\" They would have killed me, thought Montag, swaying, the air still torn and stirring about him in dust, touching his bruised cheek.\\"(128) In this society people drive really fast. The minimum speed limit is around 55 miles per hour. And lots of people are careless. In this case Montag almost gets killed by a group of twelve and sixteen year olds. \\"The Hound leapt up into the air with a rhythm and a sense of timing that was incredibly beautiful. Its needle shot out. It was suspended for a moment in their gaze, as if to give the vast audience time to appreciate everything, the raw look of the victim's face, the empty street, the steel animal a bullet nosing target.\\"(149) This is when the police are trying to catch Montag. Just to make the society feel safe they make it look like they caught Montag but instead it was some random person in an alley.This society that Montag lives in is much different from today. The book seems to be in the future because they have fireproof houses. The one thing that I can connect the book to is the movie V for Vendetta. Both of them take place in a society where it is run so that something is missing from the society. In both the movie and the book there is a person who stands up for a right. My group also talked about the movie Equilibrium being very similar to Fahrenheit 451.I would recommend this book to young adults. The reading level according to me is average. It is also easy to get lost in the book because it switches back and forth on a topic. There are also many metaphors. \\"Come on now, we're going to go build a mirror factory first and put out nothing but mirrors for the next year and take a long look in them,\\"(164) is an example that is used in the text.Overall I liked the book. It was not the best book that I have read. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy reading fiction, adventure, and a little bid of action."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a great book, it was interesting, and is a good for a thoughtful reader. It's a quick read, and I'm busy so it was nice to have an interesting story with some depth. Sometimes I get too busy and it's hard when I'm reading a long book and try to come back to it from a prolonged absence. 451 is around 165 pages, with really no slow tedious parts, which helps keep you on track.The gist of the book is a futuristic society/science fiction. Formerly a banned book, it suggests patterns of human behavior that very well may be the result of the changing patterns of society today. The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman, however it is his job to burn books, and the houses that they are in. The question of what is in the books he is burning perplexes him, and it pushes him to the extreme. According to the author, Ray Bradbury, this book is just set in the future, no specific time frame, however in this futuristic world, knowledge is considered dangerous.One thing I would like to mention again is the pattern of society and social interaction. There are very little social interactions between people; they don't talk just to talk. There is very little regard for human life, and they speak of death and especially suicide as if it was as common as waking up in the morning. \\"The Family\\" entrances people for hours, and TV is now the size of the entire wall, and is nothing more but shapeless programs of color and video clips no longer than 10 seconds. Wages are much less than in today's world, for Guy Montag, $6,000.00 is his income for an entire year, and he would be considered middle to upper class.Personally, I don't think I would buy this book. Its not something that I would want to read again, however I got a lot out of it, and it gave me a lot to think about. It is a book that everyone should read, however I think borrowing it from the library is a better decision. There are a few confusing parts, and it takes a little time to understand a few things, but overall it all comes together in the end, and really is a good book and gets you thinking."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Undoubtedly you will read reviews that reveal the plot of this book, and then state their approval or disapproval of it. What makes this book truly great is that it takes you on a shocking and (pardon the pun) inflammatory journey and drops you off wondering \\"if this could ever happen\\" where you live. Great fiction does more than entertain briefly. It makes us think. Great fiction gathers us in its webs of intrigue and forces us to see our own world in new ways. This book is timeless. At any point in civilization we can see the effects of the control of information (for better of worse) on us as individuals, and therefore on each of our own very thoughts and actions that we believe to be so highly personal, the 'one thing' that no one can take from us. It is for this reason that this book should be read by everyone at an early age. This book does not proselytize: it shows us the fate of living under censorship and allows us to choose the \\"safety\\" of overt thought-control and \\"decide\\" if that is what we wish for ourselves. It is for this reason that this book should be banned ;-)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Its no wonder this book was flagged as one of the most controversial books of its time.

The firemen are paid to raid homes and burn any books they find there. 451 degrees Fahrenheit is the temperature at which books burn. Guy loves his job--at least, he thinks he loves his job. He has never really thought deeply about it, until he meets his new neighbor, sixteen-year-old Clarisse. She is a very strange girl, and she points things out to Guy and asks him questions that make him reconsider his life. After talking to her, he begins to think about whether he is realy doing a good thing, burning books. He thinks about his wife, who watches television all day and listens to a walkman all night, and occasionally overdoses on sleeping pills. Does Guy love her? Does he even know her?Guy begins to rebel. He starts secretly reading books, which is strictly forbidden. He contacts a man who used to be a professor and he goes to visit this man, hoping the professor will help him to change things somehow, to change the world and to turn his job back to one that fights fires rather than starting them. When his wife turns him in, Guy becomes a fugitive, forced to run away from town where he can hide to avoid prison. Will Guy be able to change the world, or will he be hunted down by those who want a world without books?This book presented an interesting view of an alternate reality, and there were good details about this society of the future. However, this book was driven more by ideas than by people. There wasn't a whole lot of character development or investigation. I would have liked to have known more about what the characters were thinking."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A Review by RyanOne night, while walking home from work, Guy Montag runs into a girl named Clarisse McClellan. This girl changes Montag's life and helps him notice that he not really happy. This setting is in the future when books are banned both to read and to have possession of. Montag had a job as a firefighter, but he was not assigned to stop fires from spreading. Instead hid job was to burn books and the houses in which they were hidden. Whenever Montag was at work, he always felt wrong when he was burning books. This change occurred after he met Clarisse. She helped him notice that books were a good thing. But one day at work Montag was faced with choice to either burn a book, or to keep the book and read it. I won't tell you what happens next because that would ruin the book.I liked a lot of things about this book, but the thing that enjoyed most was the amount of description and detail. When you read the book you could just picture yourself as the main character and see clearly in full detail you surroundings. Most authors lack this amount of imagination. Second I like the pace at which this book flows. It wasn't too fast or too slow. It would first fully explain one part of the story before it moved on to another part. I also liked the way he wrote this book. It was in such a way that you just had to keep reading until you finished the whole book. Third, I liked the vocabulary that Bradbury used. The words he used made his book sound professional, but the words were not so complex that you can't understand them. The vocabulary also helps in the descriptions that Bradbury made.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who has a ninth grade reading level or higher. I think it is the type of book that anyone who reads would enjoy reading this book. People who enjoy science -fiction would like this book even better. I say this is a must read book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451-ReviewFahrenheit 451 is a since fiction book set in the future about a fireman named Guy Montage. Only Guy doesn't put out fires like firemen today, he starts them instead. The point of these fires is to burn books, because his society has decided that books do more harm then good. After seeing the look on people's faces after their books were burned Guy becomes interested in books and wonders why people seem to care so much about them. He starts to read books and eventually gives up his old lifestyle.Overall, I thought that Fahrenheit-451 was an interesting and exciting book. It was a little slow and hard to understand at first but eventually it started to pick up and became hard to put down. I can't say much for the setting or the character development but the book was worth reading just for it's phenomenal theme. Near the end the suspense started to pour in and it does keep you on the edge of you seat but immediately after that it slows down. I myself did think that this was an all right book. If you like science fiction and enjoy creative and important themes then Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent choice.

Most people say that this book is about cesorship. But if you dive behind the printed text, you will see the true meaning behind this book. Bradbury satirizes [in this book] what our society is slowly becomig through our own intellectualism(s). And that has been my thesis statement for the three papers I have written on this book: &quot;This book satyrizes what modern society is slowly becomming; as such then we can conclude that [through the socratic definition of justice] that our world is slowly becomming unjust. All in all this is the best book I have ever read. It will enlighten a true reader. Please, for the sake of all great literature, please read this book. I am a highschool freshmen, and I found it exciting enough to do a fifty two page paper on. Please, give Bradbury a chance.

Bradbury seemed to hold on to my attention through the whole book. I think that, after reading this book, everyone will have a new perspective on our current society. From reading about Montag's quest to find out the truth behind the illegal books and the weird laws of his generation's government, it taught me to appreciate what I have now, and to pray that our world will never come to the point where they want to ban books all together from their love to new technology and a faster, better, easier way of life. Reading this great piece of work makes you, just as Montag, question.... are these people really happy?!? You learn throughout the book that it is important be able to think on your own, rather than being a mindless person just sitting as a statue { :) trick} in front a TV, watching what the government wants you to watch, not what you want to watch.

I loved the metaphors, similies, and symbolism throughout the book (although at first I had no idea what the guy was talking about haha). That was one of my favorite things about it. I also liked the plot of this story. At first, I thought, &quot;This is so weird, who would think of a future with no books and firemen starting fires instead of extinguishing them?&quot; But as the book progressed, I started to realize that this could actually be possible in reality in the future. Right now, most of us would go and reach for the remote instead of a book. Yea, don't try to hide it, you know it's true. Anyways, if this habit of ours soon becomes like a big thing, Ray Bradbury's idea of a book-burning future wouldn't be too out there, if ya know what I mean.I reccomend this book to 7th-8th graders and above, since there are many similies, metaphors, symbolism, etc. in this book(as stated before) that younger readers wouldn't understand.

I had 14 years old then and though I liked it, I appreciate it now even more. Should I think I was not mature enough to understand all the ins and outs of the book?When Ray Bradbury published his Fahrenheit 451 several decades ago, he depicted a decaying society, only preoccupied by its facade of happiness. Not that people are entirely free of the usual constraints but everything is done through games, shows, comics for them to forget the notion of thinking, source of all distress and misery. Those who resist are destroyed, dangerous books (those *who* make think) are burnt. And finally, does it work after so much trouble?Well, at first sight, it depends on the basic purpose of the system. If its aim is to make people happy, it's undoubtedly a catastrophic failure. On the other hand, if it plans on making people believe they are happy or at least act as if they were, the answer may appear less immediate but little by little, you realize that for most of the characters, and therefore for probably most of the society, it comes to the same thing.Montag, the fireman who burns the books, is suddenly confronted to the emptiness of his life. Is he happy? No. He will refuse the system and fight, like Granger and the old Faber. Mildred, Montag's wife, has accepted it all. It's so practical for her to live without thinking, with a virtual family on screens around the walls of the parlor. She has friends she can talk with. She has plenty of leisure, goes on parties, but is she happy? Can she be happy when she frequently needs a bunch of pills to get dopey to the point of risking her life? Obviously not. Same for her friends, you'll see it fast.Two characters are really apart in this book.Clarisse, for example, doesn't like or hate that fake prosperity, simply because she doesn't care. She just does what she likes and she's happy. It's probably the only person you'll meet who is. Unfortunately, it will kill her but her short encounter with Montag will have been fundamental.Okay, I admit it, even if he's not from the &quot;good&quot; side, I've a compassion of some sort for the last important character of the story, Captain Beatty, the firemen's chief. He's really disconcerting, an opponent worthy of Montag. You quickly feel his cogency, his volubility. Despite his current lifework, it's easy to suspect he read a lot in the past and reflected over everything. He would once have been a precious ally for Montag but now, it's too late. He abides by the system and resigned himself, sincerely convinced of its ineluctability. So, of course, he must oppose Montag. The way he dies, the way he chooses to die, is terrible and you'll realize then what despair has haunted that man, how strong his disgust of life has been.Oh, while I'm writing this, I've just remembered a scenery. In fact, each time I think about Fahrenheit, this one always comes to my mind. At a certain point of the 2nd part, Montag thrust himself in the parlor occupied by Mildred and her friends who were watching their favorite show on the 3 walls, the White Cartoon Clown. Montag pulls the switch, and after some words exchanged about the coming war, he simply says &quot;Let's talk.&quot; The passage that immediately follows his request is powerful, from the bewildering words of Mrs Phelps about the children she never had to the furor of Montag appealing them to get out of his house, it's a total delight! I guess it's only there that the reader discovers in what terribly absurd world s/he was dived. This passage is a great moment of literature history, I swear you! :)If you make up your mind and wish to buy that magnum opus, I suggest you buy the 40th anniversary edition for Fahrenheit deserves a choice place in your library. The dustcover is beautiful, with the back reproducing the original illustration. Now, let's remove delicately the dust cover. Wow, there's a nice hardcover under it, the main sides are light brown and my fingers can feel the author's name raised slightly in the same color :) and on the black edge, title, author and editor are in gold letters. Hum! Hum! What's more? Ah, yes, a very interesting and recent foreword by Ray Bradbury, very instructive, it explains everything: the genesis of the book, the historical context, the how and the why. The original introduction (written in 1966) is still there, as captivating as the foreword, both of them are worth reading. From all points of view, I'm very proud to own this edition. I hope you'll feel the same pride."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I just purchased the Kindle version of this classic today. I paid $9.99.

Ironic, and sorely disappointing."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Books are dangerous. They're full of ideas that make people think about the world, feel passion, and perhaps act out. That's not good for society; it causes conflict, uprising, and interference with the status quo. People who read and think scare people who don't, so most citizens have happily given up the right to decide what to think about and now let the government fill their brains with constant loud mindless entertainment. This managed input has equalized society; nobody feels inferior to anyone else and there's no conflict anymore. Dull minds, constant entertainment, and conformity make society run smoothly.Guy Montag works as a fireman. He burns books at night while his wife sits in her parlor and listens to inane media shows at high volume. But Clarice, the teenager next door, is different. Her family sits around and talks. They discuss things and they laugh with each other. Guy wonders what they talk about as he watches his wife talk to the strangers on TV and pop sleeping pills...Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 presents a possible frightening future in which intellectual pursuits and nonconformity are deemed dangerous and subversive. It's been more than half a century since Fahrenheit 451 was published and we've seen censorship laws actually become looser over the years and the advent of the internet has brought on the current \\"information age.\\" But that doesn't make Fahrenheit 451 irrelevant because it's about much more than literary censorship. It's about freedom of speech and individual rights. It's about thinking for ourselves and what might happen if we let the government tell us what we can see, hear, or own.Fahrenheit 451 resonates with me on so many levels. First of all, it's just superbly written. I love Bradbury's intense style which translates especially well on Blackstone Audio's version read by Christopher Hurt (sample). Here he describes the show that Mrs Montag watches all day:A great thunderstorm of sound gushed from the walls. Music bombarded him at such an immense volume that his bones were almost shaken from their tendons; he felt his jaw vibrate, his eyes wobble in his head. He was a victim of concussion. When it was all over he felt like a man who had been thrown from a cliff, whirled in a centrifuge and spat out over a waterfall that fell and fell into emptiness and emptiness and never -- quite -- touched -- bottom -- never -- never -- quite -- no not quite -- touched -- bottom ... and you fell so fast you didn't touch the sides either... never... quite... touched... anything.The thunder faded. The music died.\\"There,\\" said Mildred. And it was indeed remarkable. Something had happened. Even though the people in the walls of the room had barely moved, and nothing had really been settled, you had the impression that someone had turned on a washing-machine or sucked you up in a gigantic vacuum. You drowned in music and pure cacophony. He came out of the room sweating and on the point of collapse. Behind him, Mildred sat in her chair and the voices went on again...Second, I share Bradbury's ardent passion for knowledge and learning. The thought of lost information, burned books, mindless entertainment, meaningless small-talk, conformity, and intellectual malaise makes my stomach twist. I don't believe that we're in danger of the anti-intellectualism that Bradbury posits, but still his ideas get me riled up.Third, I'll admit that I'm a rebel at heart. While I recognize that obeying laws and paying taxes are a necessary part of living in a well-functioning society, I feel mostly distrustful and suspicious when the government increases taxes, takes over more functions in society, tells us what to believe, and tries to revoke constitutional freedoms. In this context, Bradbury's possible future doesn't seem so impossible anymore.I'm pleased that my school district assigns Fahrenheit 451 in its middle-school curriculum, though I find it a bit ironic that some publishers have edited the language to make it more \\"suitable\\" for teenagers."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"An important statement against censorship and anti-intellectualism, Fahrenheit 451 presents a prophetic vision of a world where people are pre-occupied by 'popular entertainment' and distracted away from any serious thought and true learning (as represented by books). The disturbing similarity of this fictional world to the one we actually live in today, makes this a thought-provoking must-read.I must say, however, that I am not a big fan of the writing style. Points are driven home without much subtlety. It even sounds a little preachy in places. This style actually takes away from the importance of the message for me, much the same way that an over-eager preacher can sometimes diminish the impact of an important sermon. Even the imagery of book-burning, though very provocative, ultimately makes the world of Fahrenheit 451 seem more un-real and distant from ours than it actually is.The other problem is that the book never gets past the central premise to explore questions like why or how such a world might come to pass in any real detail. This is probably because it was originally written as a short novella. However, in this case, I would have liked to see a sequel!In the end, this is the kind of book that every thinking person should read for themselves, so read it and make up your own mind! :)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I've been checking out some of the classics that I never gave a chance while in high school, now that I'm a much more aware and mature reader. &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; was something I always wanted to read but never got around to it. Well, I have finally read it and the time was very much well spent. Ray Bradbury offers a bleak and dim future where thinking for yourself is against the law.Guy Montag's life had always been simple. He understood the order of things, and he understood the nature of his job. He was a fireman, and that entailed burning books and burning down the buildings that hid them. He never questioned it once and never felt guilty for what he was doing. Things take a different route when he meets a peculiar girl who asks the tough questions that he has never had to answer. And with those questions, he starts to think and wonder why things are the way they are. Ever since the meeting with this stranger, Montag is curious about the true nature of his job, leading to dangerous revelations that will put his very life in jeopardy.Bradbury has created a magnificent piece of literature that attacks censorship and the numbing of society head on with no regrets and no remorse. He doesn't need to give us an exact year of this future, as that makes it all the more frightening. Even though this is a work of fiction, it seems so realistic and so possible that all of this could really happen to us. Think about it. We are now a &quot;TV Generation&quot; who spend a lot less time reading, people are trying to ban different types of books for different reasons, and anything that is deemed &quot;unpleasant&quot; is demanded to be &quot;fixed&quot; or &quot;taken care of&quot; so we can all feel happy and not deal with the pain and troubles of life. Bradbury captures all of this and does not give you a bitter rant about today's youth, but he uses all of that negative energy and creates something so profound and well established. It's no mistake that this fine novel has sold millions upon millions of copies and is forever deemed a classic.The writing is simple to read and it is a short book. You will have to give it a few pages before you can really get into it all, but make sure that you stick with it. Once it gets moving, there's no stopping the pages. Bradbury is great with imagery and provides excellent descriptions--but never goes overboard with them. It's such a short read that you could most likely finish it in a day or two if you put the effort into it. Turn off that TV for just a few hours or so and pick this up! It definitely sticks in your head once it's all said and done, and you will be thinking about everything that has transpired in this book.&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is a tremendous work of fiction that is both thought-provoking and terrifying (in a subtle way). It really goes to show you how terrible things can get if censorship wins, and it really can happen if you think about it. If you haven't given this a read yet, I strongly encourage you to pick up a copy as soon as you can. This is a book that I know I will be re-reading again in the very near future. -Michael Crane"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury has taken an issue so overlooked even today, to have written something about the topic of censorship in the 1950s was quite a daring act. Ray Bradbury did it well enough, and with his ficticious novel Fahrenheit 451 he explores the horrible underbelly of education and society, and forces the reader to re-examine the values of our society.In the novel, the main character (protaganist) Guy Montag, is a fireman, but not what you'd expect, his job is to burn books and the houses that contain them, but then he meets a young woman named Clarisse who teaches him the wonderful truth of books, and a place where imagination and thinking are praised. Montag become obsessive with the idea of obtaining books, knowing that they must be wonderful treasures, so great, that people would give up their lives for them.Soon, like most things in life Clarisse fades away, but so does the thin strand that was Montag's grip on life. He seems to spin out of control, the books that he once destroyed now seemed to be destroying him, becoming his every obsession. Montag finds himself becoming afraid of everyone and everything, and he feels alone, unable to be helped.Fahrenheit 451 is a fabulous book dealing with an issue that still badgers people today even in the 21st century: censorship. This book takes an immediate look at the history of censorship, and sets forth startling revelations as to what will become of mankind if we take away the creative process, the independent, thinking spirit of man and gives a warning that must not be ignored. Fahrenheit 451 is an absolutely essential read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book pictures a world where, in order to keep everybody happy and orderly, books are denied the public and burned when found. Guy Montag (the central character) is a fireman (a servant of the public who burns books) who's life is turned around by several cicumstances. He meets a mysterious teenage girl on the sidewalk every night on his way home from work and gets into deep conservations with her. She opens his eyes to the world around him and leaves him hungering for something he can't explain. His wife is a virtual reality junkie and spends all her time listening to the radio or conversing with her electronic &quot;relatives&quot; via VR. Montag begins to see his wife as an empty, meaningless shell of a being and begins to steal books from the houses he burns.The characters are real and you understand them. The setting and technology isn't futuristic but that's not the focus. The plot isn't spell-binding, but it is interesting and it keeps your interest. While the book is short, it is full of symbols, representations, and philosophy. A similar book to this is &quot;Brave New World&quot; written by Aldous Huxley. In both novels, books are outlawed.Overall, the book focuses on the mind of man and what can prompt him to do certain things. This book may sound like a boring essay, but it's not. It makes you think and examine life in a different light."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"We live in a disposable society, where we are expected to do and say everything we are &quot;taught&quot; by the &quot;great educator&quot;, Television. Farenheit 451 is one of the most revealing books ever written and after 46 years, remains to be relevant. The reason being, it was written as science fiction and is slowly, but surely, becoming science fact. Although, I'm sure that he never meant it to be so, Mr. Bradbury has predicted the future to a degree.The main character, Guy Montag, is a man who is just doing his job. He's a fireman, which is kind of strange, because in the future everything is fireproof... except for books. Books have been outlawed, and it is the job of the fireman to find and burn hidden stashes of books. Why would someone want to burn books? you might be asking yourself.Throughout history man has always burned books that go against his: beliefs, religion, philosophies, government, etc.; because they saw these books as a threat. What better way to control a society, than if you take away their ability to think and reason on their own? Books allow us the opportunity to think and question our reality and what is going on around us. With out that, then we just become a society of mindless drones. Which is what we've become in Montag's future... slaves to our &quot;interactive televisions&quot;. In this book, television has become our extended families, while the real families are left by the wayside because the television families seem more real. Montag questions his actions after watching a woman refuse to leave her books, while they were being burned. He can't understand how someone could care for something so much, that they would be willing to die, instead of live with out it. Read the rest on your own, because you need to, not because you have to. Read this book and then look at the world around us. You'll see what I mean when I say that this book has turned from Science Fiction to Science Fact."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This Book Burns Your Brain!Ray Bradbury fires out another hit with Fahrenheit 451. This science fiction novel captures a society where books are outlawed. Fahrenheit 451 tingles your senses in trying to imagine a world with no written literature. Trying to imagine a society without any books is mind boggling and upsetting. Just think of how books effect our everyday lives. For instance, you wouldn't be reading this right now because I wouldn't be allowed to read this book and write about it. Bradbury paints a realistic image about a fictional society that replaces books with television because reading books or having them in your possession is illegal. The thing that is so realistic about this society that Bradbury creates is that it could very easily be the society that we live in. Our society spends so many hours watching television and watching movies that one day we could question the value of books and what they bring to our lives. The government controls censors of what we watch on television and one day they could prevent us from reading books because they have the power to do so. Guy Montag, the protagonist of the story, is a firefighter who instead of extinguishing fires, sets them. Books are supposed to be his enemy and he sets his enemy on fire with kerosene as his fuel. After Guy meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan, he starts to question the world that he lives in. He starts to wonder if books do have any real value like Clarisse says they do. She tells him how rich they are and how he should read one of them because it is a great experience. After he reads a book, he realizes that he does not want to live in this censored society any longer. The plot of the book then becomes Montag's journey with his internal conflict of censorship. He can not live in this ignorant society and struggles to get himself out of it. Bradbury, in Fahrenheit 451, has a very enjoyable writing style. His plot is fast-moving and his descriptions of characters and scenes are explicit. He beautifully depicts this futuristic society and the people that live in it. Overall, this is a work of art from Bradbury. This book was a fiery blast from start to finish. The suspense of this book never let you out of its inferno. For under six bucks you can hold the fire of the future in your hand."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"After listening to the excellent Book-On-Tape version of this book, I was depressed for a week. So why am I giving it five stars? Because this book and its characters affected me so much, this book literally forced me to reexamine the relationships in my own life.You surely know the basic story, from the Amazon description if from nowhere else. This is a depiction of a sick, but not unfathomable society. Science has advanced to the point where homes are constructed in such a way that they cannot burn, unless the fire is intentional. Firemen still exist, but they are only called out to burn books, and the houses (and sometimes people) that contain and love them.The concept is chilling, but the psychological effects of such a super-paranoid society are what I could not get out of my head. Guy Montag is a fireman, has been for decades. But in the back of his mind is an itch, that little spark of human curiosity that hasn't quite been burned out of him yet. He meets a girl, Clarisse, who isn't like all of the other people left in the world. She laughs, and doesn't conform, and challenges him with thoughts that she could not have gotten from the ubiquitous video walls that occupy most people's lives.Guy's curiosity is stoked, and adventures ... somewhat depressing adventures, ensue ...By the end of this chilling and frightening experience (which includes, by the way, scarily prescient &quot;Reality television&quot; shows a la Stephen King's The Running Man or Fox's Cops), like I said, I was depressed for a week. But I also found myself listening more to people, turning off the television to spend time with my wife, and ultimately inspired to stop being such a go-with-the-flow zombie that our shrink-wrapped culture demands."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman whose job it is to find books and burn them. A short while into the story it becomes apparent that Montag already has a certain unease about his job, when he meets a new neighbor of his, Clarisse McClellan, who makes him realize the discomfort he's been feeling. He and the other people around him, including his boss, the Fire Chief, become doubtful of his devotion to his job. This book follows Montag on his journey as he discovers the impotance of literature in a world where knowledge is strictly prohibited.The characters are for the most part non-charismatic and without enthusiasm, with the exception of Clarisse who, having served her purpose, dies within the first few pages. It's a shame, but it is balanced out by the introduction of an old professor named Faber. Both these characters act as guides for Montag as he becomes self-aware and abandons his ignorance.This is the first book in a long time that has made me really think, about what the book means, about what the future will look like, about a life without books. It is an extraordinary piece of writing about a repressive society caught up in its own rules and ideas. Reading through it and hearing as the Chief describes to Montag the history, the process of how slowly, books went from being solely for intellectuals, to being superfluous and completely replaced by television, and finally to being illegal, hits very close to home. While the situations in this books are very extreme, it brings out ideas of this two-dimensional world that doesn't seem so far away."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenheit 451 was overall a good book. It did have some strong points as well as its weak points as well. The characters in the novel I thought were very well developed and gave enough detail to make you get a picture in your mind about what he/she looked like. The character that I thought was the best developed out of them all was Guy Montag. He was described physically but also mentally so you could really understand what he was thinking in certain cituations, like how he goes against his heritage of a fireman and decides to start reading books. Guy was a fireman, and firemen in these times burned books. The book says \\" First Fireman: Benjamin Franklin\\" (64)I also like the technology of the novel. The technology was very relavent to what is reaslistic. The ear peaces that they wore to listen to the radio could become very popular in the near future. When Clarisse McClellan said \\"...did you know that once billboards were only twenty feet long? But cars started rushing by so quickly they had to stretch the advertising out so it would last\\" (39). This shows what society was and that technology got so fast that they had to change billboards.The setting of the novel was developed well also. The setting was in a futuristic city, which seemed very high paced, like I would envision most large cities to become in the future.I did not like the fact that people did not have there own feelings about things. They never came up with there own ideas and just seemed to go through everyday monotonously. I do not agree that this is what the future holds and that people pride themselves on having there own ideas.I also disagreed with that nobody likes books and doesn't read them anymore. I feel that it was not a good idea to say that nobody reads and most of the people don't mind that. I would think that if people enjoyed reading like the group led by Granger, there would be violent revolts. When Mildred says \\"...Why should I read? What for...\\" (101). It shows that people had no desire to read or what reading had in store for them.Overall the book was very good and I suggest that you should read it if you are in the mood for an action novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a important and influential book. When written in 1953 he didn't know he was going to predict today's society. Guy Montag, the protagonist, loved his work as a firefighter. He seemed to liked nothing better than to start a fire on a pile of books and watch the pages burn. Until, one day he meets his new neighbor Clarisse, a young girl to whom is educated about the world. They began talking and she asked Montag &quot;Are you happy?&quot;. After returning home from meeting his new neighbor he looks at his wife, in bed and listening to \\"little seashells\\" in her ears which entertains her mind during the night, The author says \\"he wore his happiness like a mask and the girl had run off across the lawn with the mask and there was no way of going to knock on her door and ask for it back.\\" he realizes that indeed he isn't happy. Montag realizes his wife has tried to overdose on sleeping pill and she is taking to the hospital and revived. To much for Montag to handle , he becomes observant . Montag and Clarisse begin meeting up everyday and walking to the subway together and sharing and talking about each other. When Clarisse one day disappears, Montag starts hiding books in his home. His wife Mildred does not agree and she turns him in. Forcing Montag to set fire to his own house. When Montag knew he was caught by his boss Captain Beatty he threw fire on them and fled to avoid arrest, Montag now a delinquent joined a group of scholars whom were outlawed because they kept the contents of books in their heads. I liked this novel because it is very honest, it shows how the society does not always change for the people, but the people can change for the society. You will never see a time or a place where everyone agrees with the same thing and this novel is a great interpretation of a two sided belief ( books vs. no books). The novel shows what censorship can do to a society, and the importance of free speech. People must learn to accept different views, whether they agree totally with them or not."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Living in philadelphia could not have been any more boring or easy.

No one thinks about their job, no one thinks about their rights, no one thinks about their families, and no one thinks about their education. Imagine, there were no worries in the world. Does this appeal to you? Fahrenheit 451 is a novel about a man coming to know the destructive society he is living in. His culture is such that if you own a book, you are burnt along with the book. For people who read are corrupted, their minds have been filled with silly ideas and shouldn't be able to spread them to others. People aren't educated well, and have no opinion. This leads people into a culture where thought is prohibited. He meets a girl who opens up his eyes into &quot;a past where people [were] not afraid&quot;(on the back of the Book). The story outlines the struggle that came with his recognition and and a changed, happier Montag. I loved the book, and think it taught many lessons. Although the world Montag lives in is not alike to ours in that our society prohibits us to think, I would still say that we are on our way to it. This book should be read by our entire populous. It helped me realize the blinding culture that we live in. I rate this book 5 stars. Good writing. Good themes. Good story. Amazing lesson."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is quite simply an amazing book. Ray Bradbury draws a picture of a futuristic society in which books are banned-all books. Then he uses creative, real-like characters to present it to you. Each and every character has his or her own uniqueness. The opening line-\\"It was a pleasure to burn\\" is a perfect way to start off a book about burning books. I especially enjoyed the character Clarisse McClellan. It was she who introduced Montag to a different kind of world; one in which he could look at everything with more then just his eyes. The part of the book in which Clarisse was letting raindrops fall into her mouth was quite amusing. When Clarisse and Montag part, Montag tilted his head backward and let the raindrops fall in his mouth. I really think the character Clarisse was a great addition to the novel. It helps the readers feel the words of the book all the way up to the surprising ending. The overall quality of this book is great. I would recommend this book to almost anyone. I do, however, think if you are not at all into futuristic, fictional books then this is not the one for you. I would give this novel four out of five stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's 'Fahreneheit 451' is a classic that almost everyone should read before they get out of high school or college. It is not just for science fiction fans, but for lovers of good storytelling."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"1950: A year in which one of the greatest novels of our time was written. Fahrenheit 451 was originally written as a short story and was titled \\"The Fireman.\\" This was Ray Bradbury's first novel but definitely not the last. Taking place in a society where reading books is outlawed, firemen are paid not to put out fires, but to start them...on books.Guy Montag, the main character of the book and one of the most dedicated firemen, had his routine life turned upside down after meeting a young teenage girl named Clarisse. Meeting Clarisse was the first turning point in the book. Clarissa asked Montag the very personal question of \\"Are you happy?\\" (10). This struck Montag as a huge shock considering he did not know how to answer it. Evaluating this question took up most of Montag's time. After being called to set ablaze to an elderly woman's home, and burning her to death in the process, he knew the answer to Clarisse's question. Living in a society where knowledge is turned down, where his wife is too wrapped up in her \\"soap operas\\", and where people want to kill each other for fun, wasn't how he wanted to live. Unhappiness was the basis of Montag's life. He realized that there must be something in books that fulfill people like Clarisse and the woman who burned herself, he had to find out what was in them.Montag's boss, Captain Beatty, caught on that Montag might be exploring books, or even housing them and tried to discourage Montag. After finding an old friend to help him interpret the books, Mildred his wife, became frightened and eventually turned him in which was the major turning point or climax in the book. After that point, an adventure begins. Bradbury uses his unique literary devices and other writing techniques to truly bring the reader into the story.Many allusions were used and referred to in this novel. The most vivid was the allusion of the Phoenix. A Phoenix is a mythical bird that over time dies and catches on fire, burning to ashes, and then is reborn through the ashes. This bird can be related to the mechanical society in which the characters of the novel live in. The knowledge and the conditions of the world in which they used to live in, eventually died and burned as does the Phoenix. However, the symbolism of the rebirth could perhaps also be foreshadowing the ending of the novel.Bradbury's similes, metaphors, and other literary devices combine to allow the reader to better visualize the imagery and place themselves into the scene. The organization of his words alone, contribute to the understanding of the sentence structure. \\"They had one machine. They had two machines, really. One of them slid down into your stomach like a black cobra down an echoing well looking for all old water and the old time gathered there... It had an Eye.\\" These words are connected with a simile and a metaphor, making a better visualization for what was taking place. Symbols were also widely used throughout Fahrenheit 451.The titles of the first two parts alone, serve as very important symbols in the book. \\"The Hearth and the Salamander\\" symbolizes both the fireplace and the creature who is believed to be unaffected by fire. The hearth, where the fire is housed, symbolizes the heating of a home and the salamander which is the official symbol for the firemen. \\"The Sieve and the Sand\\" is also very symbolic. Depicting that if placed on the sieve, the sand would fall straight through, not accumulating any of it. This is comparable to Montag trying to read the books. The words were going in, but also going straight back out. He did not know how to keep the knowledge he had just gained.Overall, I think this book was a wonderful interpretation of a man who knew things were wrong and who built up enough courage to go after what he believed in. Possibly a prediction of the future, Bradbury influentially shows the readers of Fahrenheit 451 that knowledge is a very sacred thing and its sacred components, the books, should not be taken for granted."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A book revolving about the burning and destruction of books seems kind of ironic, right? But that is exactly what the plot of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is based on. Taking place in the not so distant future, Fahrenheit 451 revolves around one fireman, Guy Montag, whose job was to start fires instead of stop them. Living in a world where is was a crime to read books, punishable by getting your house burned down, and where the government controls all forms of entertaining media, Montag never questioned what he did for a living. All this changes one day when he meets a strange seventeen-year-old girl on the way home from work one day, and asks him a simple question; \\"Are you happy?\\" This triggers a chain reaction within Montag when he comes to the conclusion that he is, in fact, not happy with his life. Throughout the rest of book, we see how Montag struggles with this and how he quests to do something about it.Bradbury breaks down Fahrenheit 451 into three parts. In the first, the reader is introduced to the protagonist, Guy Montag, and his life and background information up to this point. However, as mentioned earlier, when he meets the young girl, Clarisse McClellan, everything is turned upside down for him, making this the defining moment of this part. She asks him if he is happy which starts to make Montag really sit down and think, a rarity for the people in this particular setting.\\"He felt his smile slide away, melt, fold over and down on itself like a tallow skin, like the stuff of a fantastic candle burning too long and now collapsing and now blown out. Darkness. He was not happy. He recognized this as the true state of affairs. He wore his happiness like a mask and the girl had run off across the lawn with the mask and there was no way of going to knock on her door and ask for it back,\\" (Bradbury 12)Through the author's use of similes, it is easy to see that this is the beginning of the change within Montag after his encounter with Clarisse.From there on, the reader experiences the inner conflict raging within Montag, and then later, outside him. With Bradbury's frequent use of symbolism and metaphors, the reader can get a clear picture of just what is going on in the protagonist's head, yet not so much that the reader would not have to think about it. The way Bradbury writes with these literary devices also helps him depict the imagery of each scene. An example being:\\"With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head, and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins if history,\\" (3).Keeping with one of the themes of the book, Bradbury is also constantly comparing things to the aspects of fire, or fire to a blooming flower and he compares books to wings or birds of purity and peace. The unique style in which Bradbury combines these traits helps to distinguish Fahrenheit 451 into the classic novel that it is.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Fahrenheit 451. I found the plot intriguing and oddly believable for a futuristic sci-fi piece. It was written in a way easy to understand yet not so simple that it takes away from the novel. The characters were well developed and the protagonist was likable as well as easy to sympathize with. There was little to complain about except maybe the ending seemed a bit too abrupt. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good science fiction story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm a highschool freshmen and I read the book last year when was in 8th grade.

The story is easy to follow and has the moral of never lossing hope when everything around you feels lost. The book doesn't have too much deep meaning behind it, which means it basically reads out how it reads out.

I am not an avid reader nor do I enjoy reading, but with this book, I was forced to make an exception. Pick it up, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"From the standpoint of literature as a whole, it seems 451 is an important piece of work simply because of its eternal message of censorship. Ray Bradbury was a science fiction writer but managed to elevate this novel to the most important rungs of the literary community, something not many SF authors do. There's a reason for that vacuum- typically SF writing is dry, much like 451. It's a good novel, but I don't think it added much to realm of science fiction as it did to the literary community.Science fiction novels from the 50s and 60s have a distinct feel and flow to them and Fahrenheit 451 is no exception. Like many of the other novels of the era, 451 was based on a short story written and was later lengthened to a novel. The basis is simple: books are illegal and must be burnt. That makes a tidy short story. But stretching a simple idea like that into a full length novel loses an ethereal something (the spirit? the essence? the soul?) from its inception. This occurs in many Poul Anderson novels, as well as John Brunner, James Blish and others from the same era.That ethereal something lost changes the feel and flow of a normally placid plot... much like in 451 where the onset of the protagonist's change of heart is sudden and undeveloped. The direction of change is clear and predictable. Perhaps 451 is the waving flag of examples of censorship, but its undeveloped underpinnings starve it of greater breadth."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have read this book more than once, when I first read it I had to for school but really enjoyed it.

Orwell's \`Nineteen Eighty Four'.It is a picture of a totalitarian State at war, where people have no friends, no families, no houses. They are surrounded only by walls of TV screens. They know only things, not the meaning of things. People are made equal, being snatched from the cradle and pounded into submission. They function with automatic reflexes. They have no time to think, no education and no responsibilities (and consequences). They have to forget the rest of the world. All books have to be burned. All memories of former times have to be destroyed.\`Intellectual' is a swear world. Those who resist (the \`antisocials') are killed.But, there are still dens of resistance of older people who escaped the brainwashing.Their message is \`stop making the goddamn funeral pyres. We must remember, dig the biggest grave of all times and shove war in it and cover it up.'This remarkably memorable book is a must read for all lovers of freedom and peace.N.B. This book contains an important interview with the author."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Great book with a cautionary tale! I don't know how anyone who could understand the books message give this book a bad review..? Anyway, all around Fahrenheit 451 is a great book!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a cautionary tale set in a world where books are banned. Named after the temperature at which paper catches fire and burns, the book tells the story of one extraordinary week in the life of Guy Montag, a \\"fireman\\" whose job it is to burn the houses of those harbouring books. Until one day he begins to think that his job is not as worthwhile as his society would make him think. This single act of questioning leads to a chain of events. By the book's end, the world that Montag once knew will never be the same again.Part fable, part thriller, Fahrenheit 451 is a fascinating and provocative read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 sees the future of the world, and it hates what it sees. People have become apathetic and worthless. No one cares about morality or the search for truth. Everyone is a mindless drone.As mentioned by other reviewers, the story is in many ways prophetic. It's fascinating how the author predicts modern technologies like projection TVs (the TV parlor), iPods (ear thimbles), and even Bluetooth headsets (Faber's \\"green bullet\\").My favorite part of the story is Beatty's lecture in Montag's house, just before he leaves. Through Beatty's character, Bradbury warns of out-of-control government growth and the brainwashing and indoctrination of children. We'd be wise to heed this warning.This book is a fairly easy read because it's short, but it provides plenty of food for thought."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"451F refers to the trigger temperature for paper to burn (though 450C is more popularly thought to be the right temperature - no matter, since \`Celsius 451' just doesn't have the same ring).Set in a postmodern era, a lawless America has turned itself into an anti-intellectual state which persecutes anyone who is caught in possession of books and worse, reading their contents.Into this setting steps a new breed of firemen, who abandon their traditional roles by actually setting fire to these books whenever a \`concerned' member of the public reports on their neighbour. Intellectuals and professors go underground as universities and higher institutes of learning are eradicated. People \`interact' with their newfound virtual families, which are akin to real-time projections of our modern day talkshows (replete with canned applause and laughter) on their walls.Fireman Guy Montag is forced to question his existence and life as he knows it, when confronted with seventeen-year old neighbour Clarisse, who tells him of a past where people were not afraid to think and question.This book is so clearly ahead of its time with chillingly accurate predictions of the numbing (dumbing?) effects of technology, which breeds complacence and unquestioning acceptance of status quo.One especially disturbing scene was the way the manhunt for the fugitive Montag turns into a televised spectator sport, not unlike reality TV programmes in the Noughties.Published in 1953, this dystopian novel still remains relevant and current in the 21st century, though one wonders at the impact of e-books and the future of the books as we know them.Highly recommended - to be read as a companion to Don Delillo's 'White Noise'."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"My son needed this book for his summer reading. Because he needs to make notes and create references in the book, this is the perfect solution at a very reasonable price."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I can definitely see why this book was written and why people get wrapped up in its moral. However, the delivery needs some work. I find that the entire buildup to the climax was weak and mostly unnecessary. It either needed to be much longer with greater detail, or entirely rewritten. The author, for some reason, enjoys repeating words or sentences to add stress on the situation... which is fine until it is done on practically EVERY page. He also likes lists. It gets to the point to where you can read the first sentence, then skip the entire rest of the paragraph because all it is is the repeating of the same information. The book also has a weak ending. I reference it to the Tortilla Curtain. A wonderful book with a good moral... but the author decides to rape your mind of everything you've been trying to build of what your expecting in the end. It just doesn't make sense. It does, but of all the ways you could have ended it? REALLY?A few other flaws in the book is that there is virtually no background of... the background. Its quite a few pages before you manage to figure out what kind of year theyre in (past or future). And you only do this by them referencing futuristic devices that you're somehow supposed to already know what they do and why they exist. You almost have to accept that you don't know and move on.The book is sometimes compared to 1984... however 1984 does a much better job at a similar, yet different moral of society. 1984 is government focused, 451 is literature focused.I would recommend this book simply because it is a highly referenced book. Not because of his excellent writing style or plot abilities... but because the lesson needs to be learned. I really only started caring during the 2nd half of the last section. The rest... meh. It's almost like taking the highway vs the scenic route. sure you get there... but it's not nearly as exciting. And don't we read books FOR the scenic route?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I finally finished reading Fahrenheit 451 by Bradbury. For such a small book I sure took my time finishing it. I did not enjoy this book. It had its moments, as do all books, but they were minimal. The characters don't develop much, and the ending is a bit extreme. I'm not a fan of long books but this one was just too short for the story to go anywhere. The ending felt rushed and a bit too dramatic for the speed at which it developed. I probably won't read another Bradbury book for a long time. This book was so hyped up, and for me it just didn't deliver."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It was exactly as described, the only \\"flaw\\" being that the cover had a clean cut about halfway across the front cover.

If there is ever a time when books are banned or burned, society will be in deep trouble. Freedom to read whatever we choose is one of the blessings of being educated people. Fahrenheit 451 should be read by anyone who is even capable of reading.Zachary B.

I am currently attending college and due to the amount of reading I have had in past years it was hard for me to bring myself to reading other books as well; related to laziness / lack of motivation.This year, however, has brought a new change upon me. I have made it my goal to read at least 1 - 2 different books each week which are not related whatsoever to school material -- and let me tell you, I am happy I have. Textbooks are boring, dry, and repetitive. Books such as Fahrenheit 451 and others I have purchased open your mind and make you think in different ways.Anyways, I have a few friends who suggested this book to me which lead me to purchasing it. I knew \\"book-burning\\" was going to play a factor before I even opened it. But, while reading this short novel I have noticed that Fahrenheit 451 plays a much bigger concept. It's hard to believe that this book was wrote in the 50's for how prophetic and how much it can relate to our currect society and perhaps the society to come.There is no doubt TV (Bradbury comparison to the 'Walls') has killed free thinking. I have read numerous works on Media Control, Propaganda, and how TV controls minds. Think about it. What do Americans buy? The item they see on TV advertised by their favorite 'celebrity'. Who do young girls wish to be like? Models on TV, Actresses, others they see in magazines. How can you gain support for a war? Mass propaganda on TV about WMD's. How can you get your President elected? Spend the most money on advertising for the campaign. You can broadcast anything you like, if you have the money, to sway public opinion one way or another and it proves that TV controls Americans.I'm 21 - I find it hilarious the amount of TV watched by people my age and defintely younger. Some of my friends can sit their whole Saturday and Sundays infront of their HDTV's watching College Football and the NFL. Kids under my age are absorbed by TV shows on MTV, nothing ever meaningful to expand your mind; you could make the claim that watching shows such as Jersey Shore may even make you less intelligent, that's for another time though haha.To close, the book shows great implications where society is heading and how society is today. In the book, Clarisse, explains how people drive fast and how they don't acknowledge the world around them. I took this in a sense that Americans work, work, work, constantly, to provide for the family / themselves. We are always in a rush. We rarely stop to observe the world around us or take a look at what really is going on and enjoy being on Earth. We are tied to working to survive. Life is too short not to admire the beauty that may be around you; if you take the time to look, that is."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Enjoyed it thoroughly - I had never read it - am not usually a sci-fi fan, but it's truly a classic"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I didn't think I'd like this book as much as I did.

Early in the book he meets a young girl who causes him to change his thoughts on everything that has been existing in his life forever. The book follows his journey through the world.SettingThe book was originally written in 1953, and the time frame for the book was set in the 90's or early 2000's. Anyway, the idea for the setting is that books are outlawed from society. The government has a firm grip on it's control of information and very little is given to the populace as a whole that isn't controlled by the government. In this way it's very similar to George Orwell's 1984.PlotThe book begins with Montag at work, burning someone's house down because they were reported to have books in their possession. Coming as no surprise, the book quickly forces Montag to question just how right it is to continue to hold back the knowledge of the past from the people.EnjoymentThe book has a very interesting premise, and the author's message of the importance of information and being able to think for yourself instead of allowing others to think for you is clear. I'm not quite sure what I think about the ending, it's not that it comes from nowhere, but I think it almost stretches out a bit too long.Overall GradeI enjoyed the book, it has a lot of interesting ideas. However, I'd seen most of the ideas from reading 1984 (which was written a few years before Fahrenheit 451). Either way, they are still good ideas that merit reading multiple times.6/10All of my reviews are also located on my blog, check out me profile for the link to my blog."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"InFahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury has created a world that chillingly seems to reflect our present and near future. In this upside down dystopia, firemen burn books, women congregate with their fake wall (television) families, youth engage in high speed car chases, killing themselves and others, and products are promoted on 200 ft billboards, and hawked by Jesus Christ. In this world where supposedly everyone has everything one wants, no one is truly happy, no one loves anyone, and unhappy people overdose on drugs. No one slows down to smell the flowers, taste the rain, sit by a fire, talk with friends, or just sit and think. No one cares that that the world seems to have been at war for as long as anyone can remember, with fighter jets streaking above their homes everyday. After all, no one has to sacrifice anything; its always someone else's spouse or child that dies.Guy Montag was a faithful citizen of this world, satisfied with his job of burning books, until he has a chance encounter with his new neighbor, a strange, precocious 16 year old who is wise beyond her years. Clarisse McClellan changes his views of the world dramatically with her strange habits of tasting the rain, gazing at the moon, and asking pointed questions as to why he became a fireman, whether he loves anyone or whether he is happy. An awakened, transformed Montag, after failing to impress and change his shallow and depressed wife and others around him with his new-found wisdom, is discovered, hunted, and is forced to flee the city. He joins a vagabond group of outlaw-professors, who plan to restore the world by imparting the wisdom they have gained by memorizing books.This is the best novel depicting our future world that I have read. Other books, likeBrave New Worldpresent a frightening, realistic future, but have poor plot and characterization. On the other hand, books such as1984andAnimal Farmare thrilling and well told, but really do not reflect our future very well. FAHRENHEIT 451 does both, and does so brilliantly. Apart from depicting a realistic and scary future, Bradbury writes a tight, exciting plot packed with suspense, including fires, chases, murder, suicides, and nuclear war. I could scarcely put the book down, wondering what Montag was going to do next. Although it is but a short story, the characters, including Montag, his shallow but deeply depressed wife Millie, the youthful but insightful Clarisse, the cowardly but wise Faber, and the disillusioned arrogant bully Beatty are engaging and fully realized.If you have the BALLATINE 50th anniversary edition, the extra material (afterword, coda, and interview) is illuminating, but should be read with a grain of salt. One of the most powerful elements of a great book is that it reaches out to the individual reader, who is able to take it in according to his or her own experiences. The message the reader gets from such books ultimately may not be what the writer intended, but still be fully relevant. Reading the author's views and intentions for the novel can upset this great experience.The afterward is quite charming, an account of how Bradbury first typed the novel using a paid typewriter (it charged him a dime for 30 minutes, he spent $9.80.) Bradbury also mentions how his characters still visit him, and gives additional insights/alternatives plots, especially a fascinating and rather sad look at how the Beatty, once a mad lover of books, became an arrogant, obnoxious book-burning fireman.The coda is an amusing diatribe at those who want him to update his works to fit the modern times (include more women, blacks), or, more disturbingly, change his work (without him knowing it!). Such censorship is indeed frightening and should be avoided at all costs. However, one also gets the feeling while reading Bradbury's somewhat smug rant, especially while reading statements such as \\"the real world is the playing ground for each and every group, to make and unmake laws (p.178)\\" that Bradbury has never been a part of a denigrated minority. One doubts that Bradbury has ever experienced the disadvantages that comes with such membership, which includes having to put up with disturbing elements in books from insults (the 'n' word, savage) to works attesting to prove minority inferiority in a myriad of ways ('proving' a lack of intelligence, propensity towards violence, lack of morals) and finally calls for eugenics to destroy them altogether. Certainly Bradbury does not seem to have reflected on the fact the real world might be a very unfair playing field- with some groups having much more power and ability to make and unmake laws than others.The interview at the end was the most disturbing for me; Bradbury comes off as out of touch with both his book and the present world. He flatly denies that the US today with its unending and nebulous 'war on terror' reflects the unending war that his own book talked about, a war in which we sit comfortably while other people make sacrifices and other countries suffer. Even worse, Bradbury very naively states \\"there's no chance for censorship today.\\" (p.184). Tell that to Don Imus, the Palestinians, anti-corporate activists, and those critical of homosexuality, evolution, official versions 9/11 and global warming, and a myriad of other topics.Sadly, fifty years after his book, Bradbury does not seem to grasp the power of his own book; he does not really seem to appreciate how his vision of a mindless dystopia is rapidly becoming our reality."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I thought the book was pretty overrated. Admittedly, the concept was interesting and the story rolls around all right, but the superfluous metaphor-laden rambling passages really irked me. I can only sit through so much.I think I would have liked this book more if I didn't keep picturing Bradbury sitting somewhere with a painfully smug look on his face. But all in all, Fahrenheit 451 is worth reading, though not necessarily all it's cracked up to be."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Reading this book for the first time at the beginning of 2003, I found it remarkable that a novel about the suppression of information in an oppressive police state stands as a powerful critique of the assaults on freedom and personal liberty that the U.S. Government is now engaged in in the name of protecting its citizenry from terrorists.Who exactly are the terrorists? In the view of the shadowy government represented in the novel, they are those who hoard and protect forbidden printed works, and they are those members of an underground information subculture that commits works of literature to memory in the hope that one day, the printed page will be welcome again.In the post-9/11 America of George W. Bush and John Ashcroft, the terrorists can be anyone with a foreign-sounding last name. Even blameless American citizens are suspect. Under a provision of the USA Patriot Act, the government can force public libraries to hand over records about what books anyone has checked out, and they've furthermore made it a crime for the libraries to inform those whose library records have been invoked.Bradbury depicts a nation in which individuality is frowned upon, in which the government is deeply suspicious of its own citizenry, in which suspected \\"criminals\\" can be hunted and murdered by the state without a trial, in which content is spoon-fed to the public. In light of news stories reporting on the Total Information Awareness project in development by the NSA, how much of this can be taken as fiction? How long will it be before the cautionary tales of Bradbury and Orwell and Huxley become a nightmare reality?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent novel that I highly suggest to those who like well-written, thoughtful books. The plot and the story in general are extremely interesting- not only due to the actual events, but due to Fahrenheit 451's frightening connection to our lives. The futuristic, dystopian setting where the government has censored all forms of high art and learning, and where humans have 'dumbed down' to an unbelievable degree, gives way to a story where humankind fights with itself to regain a civilized society.Fahrenheit 451 is no doubt a critisism of our society and a scary prediction of may be ahead. Don't miss this wonderful novel!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This short book has been around for over forty years and I'll bet it will be around for at least another hundred because the truth of its message is a constant reminder of the value of books and priceless-ness of freedom of speech.Ray Bradbury takes a simple scenario....what would the future look like if &quot;real&quot; media were the only allowed form of information, and books, especially fiction, was outlawed. At first blush, there would be a few who might say, &quot;well we don't read that much now...we get most of our information from tv, our entertainment from movies, or our computers.&quot; But it's more than that if you really stop to consider that when you choose to pick up a book of YOUR choosing your are excercising not only a basic intellectual freedom, you are also exerting your privacy, your right to choose how you'll spend your time, and how you'll choose to look at the world.Bradbury considers all of these things and the choices one man decided to make as a consequence. What was so exciting for me was to be able to contemplate these ideas within the context of a story told with beautiful language and images and a story that will grab you until the very end.I know this book is one of those that gets assigned in high school and then never sees the light of day afterward......well, as an ancient 40-year-old, I think that's a shame.

In the book, Guy Montag, a fireman, is paid to burn books. In fact, all fireman are paid to burn books. This book, being a science fiction, takes place in the future. Guy enjoys his job. He gets paid well and understands the system, books are for burning. He is under the impression that books are full of nothing but garbage. He meets a girl named Clarisse who changes his views completely. He starts to become more interested in books. He hides books in his house. He suddenly realizes what he has been doing. This book is a somewhat difficult read. It may not be enjoyed by children under sixth grade. The sentences are somewhat long and complex. At times, the vocabulary is also difficult. I would rate this book fair. I would only recommend it to people who are heavily interested in science fiction."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The basic premise behind Ray Bradbury's novel 'Fahrenheit 451' is compelling. In the future, fireman don't put out fires, they start them. It is their job to seek out books and put them to the flame, making sure that no one indulges in the 'crime' of reading one. But what makes this nightmare so interesting, and relevant, is that it was not forced upon the people by their government, but was decided upon by the people themselves. Minority groups, religions, and ethnicities, who were offended by the words of writers, simply made reading unpopular and convinced the world that books were, first, a waste of time, and then the root of all evil. A wonderful 'Negative Utopia' novel in the tradition of '1984' and 'Brave New World' Bradbury's novel differs in his writing style. His prose is difficult to follow and at times leaves the reader unimpressed. If you can you're not easily turned off by Bradbury's odd and difficult way of writing perhaps you'll enjoy the deeper message of this work."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman who's job requires him to efficiently burn books when a call enters the station.

Discovering this universal wonderment lies at the foundation of the author's main theme, highlighted brilliantly through his distorted and domineering society.With this futuristic society and a distortion of trends found in today's culture, Bradbury captures his reader's attention and makes them open their eyes, hearts, and mind to the true importance of independent intellectual enhancement through reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What a profound Novel!This should be required reading to all students.

Most have never read the books they have chosen to vilify. Strange that only a few outspoken right wing groups think they speak for all of society.The irony of it all is that Fahrenheit 451 has been banned from schools and classrooms because of its \\"negative\\" views toward those individuals that ban books.

Complaints against this novel have ranged from its use of language (yes there is swearing) to characters drinking/smoking and ultimately the questioning of government. Heaven forbid that a book actually depicts things that occur in real life.What I enjoyed most about this novel was just how much it resembles life today. True, we are not a society who burns books in an attempt to repress freedom of speech and creativity, but we are a society that spends an exorbitant amount of time in front of the television watching reality programs and other mindless forms of entertainment such as video games. Ask a kitten what s/he has read recently and it's more than likely they will stare back at you with vacant eyes and a lot of hemming and hawing. Pitiful really.I also enjoyed the overall message about censorship. In fact, the part of the book I found the most fascinating was the coda wherein Bradbury gives a quick discussion of his dealings with the subject first hand. In his own words, \\"There is more than one way to burn a book. And the world is full of people running about with lit matches. Every minority...[he goes on here to list various groups]...feels it has the right, the duty to douse the kerosene, light the fuse\\" (Fahrenheit 451 Coda 177). And ultimately that is what it boils down to, the idea that every time someone tries to censor a piece of literature, or a movie, or what have you, they are striking the match against creativity and freedom of expression.Unfortunately I did run into one problem that made it hard for me to really enjoy this novel and that was Bradbury's writing style. It was extremely dry and tended towards rambling. Some of the ideas were brilliantly flushed out, but others, like the war, were simply stated with little detail whatsoever. An old tom cat professor of mine once said that in the art of writing the idea is to show the story not tell it. In this regards, I found it very challenging to picture the events taking place within the novel.Regardless of that, this is one of those books which everyone should read at least once in their nine lives."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In an age of instant &quot;classics&quot;, this book has stood the the test of time. Let us remember, this book was written in the 1950's, not today. So, yes, the story line might seem a little worn, but that's because it has been repeated, used, and indead, to pardon a pun, worn by humanity for five decades. Like many of Bradbury's works, this stands as a warning of humanity's arrogance, dependance upon technology, and lack of learning."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I've heard some people say that this book rips off 1984, that is NOT true. It's essentially the converse of 1984. In Orwell's masterpiece (I won't deny either of these books that title) the government has absolute power. 1984 has been called &quot;The end of all Utopias&quot; because the people can't win.In Bradbury's work, however, the government is not all powerful, and still has those who work against it that it foolishly ignores. Furthermore, the war is not to permanently distract the people, it is a real thing to win or lose. The people aren't closely monitored, they can even have ideas so long as they don't have books. In the end this is the beggining of a Utopia, in 451 the government can't win, they will eventually fall and a new age of learning will rise...to fall again, and again, and again, but as Bradbury points out unlike the Phoenix we may eventually learn NOT TO JUMP IN THE FREAKIN' FUNERAL PYRE, OR EVEN TO BUILD IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is a novel about a futuristic society where censorship reigns supreme and independent thought is deeply scrutinized. This is a world where the televisions talk to you, vehicular manslaughter is an innocent charge as long as you have insurance, and fireman burn books instead of putting fires out. The main character in this novel is a fireman named Guy Montag, a man happy with his job, his wife, his place in society, and life in general. All of this holds true until one fateful evening, after a successful night of setting millions of pages ablaze, Montag runs into a wistful teenager named Clarisse. She is an introverted girl by this future society's standards because she doesn't enjoy playing sports, or driving fast. Her main interests are thinking and talking about what she's thinking--very anti-social to everyone else. Clarisse is the catalyst for Montag's rise from subservient book burner to independent thinking intellectual. Montag begins to take books from the houses he burns and hide them in his air conditioner, promising to read them one day. One night, the firemen come to an old woman's house where they are to burn her collection of books. Beatty, the firehouse captain, douses her collection of books with kerosene, but instead of letting that be the end of it, the old woman decides to set herself on fire along with her treasures. Montag becomes very sickened by this event and decides not to be a fireman anymore. This is where one of the most crucial scenes comes into play, Beatty comes to Montag's house to talk him into staying a fireman, using all of his cunning and sly words to tell him how things were, and how they are better now. Montag makes a choice not go with what society wants, and to become a rebel. Montag meets with a professor to learn how to fully understand what he's reading, and they come upon an insidious plan to plant books in fireman's houses and call alarms on them, effectively destroying the idea that books should be burned if the burners themselves want them. Montag decides to go into work one last time, and after they get a call, much to his surprise, they arrive at his house. Montag's own wife Mildred had called in an alarm, and quickly left. Montag kills the other firemen and goes on the run, eventually meeting a gang of old college professors in the woods, and becoming one of them.The character I felt I could most relate to was the main character Guy Montag. Montag was really confused with his life, and how it was turning out, he didn't know if he liked the person he had become. I think I would do the same thing as Montag did if I were in his position. Montag's society reminded me of today's society slightly where censorship is still a problem, but to only a small extent. Also, the only way people in Montag's society could enjoy anything was if it was fast paced and devoid of any need to think, sometimes I feel that holds true with our society as well. Take our sports for example: football, basketball, hockey, all of these are extremely violent and fast.I did not like the book for a few reasons. The first is that I felt the view point of the novel was too extreme, and it lost some of its value because I just could not relate to it as well as the novel wanted me to. Another was the characters, outside of Montag, all the characters are static and flat, not one of them changes. I did enjoy the digressions in the book, the time Bradbury took to stretch his own personal talents with beautiful, and sometimes scary, descriptions of what Montag was thinking. But, I felt that Bradbury was trying to hard to fit into an Ernest Hemingway style of quick thoughts without explanation, giving the reader the opportunity to figure out what is being said like a puzzle. It just didn't do it for me.My recommendation is that people should read this novel because it can give insight to how any society works. But I do not believe it is an important novel because it just did not get its point across well enough. Read this novel if you dislike censorship and wish to see it completely abolished, but this is the only type of reader I feel could totally enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The author of the book Fahrenheit 451 was focused on teaching appreciation of God-given rights to his readers. Ray Bradbury considered a life without reading, without control of one's own thoughts, and without knowing history. He also considered a life where parents don't like the children that they have. Bradbury considered this and thought best to write a book so that people would not take their lives for granted. He considers reading a privilege, while most others would consider it a right, a right that isn't thought of as a right, but just is. Bradbury conveys a horrible story that helps his readers understand what they should value in life."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I began reading the book Fahrenheit 451 I did not enjoy it very much. But after I put more time into reading this book I started to like it more and more. One of the reasons I liked the book so much was because of the great detail, but it still leaves room for you to think about what is going on. Ray Bradbury's vision of the future does not seem to far fetch for me. With how our society is, and the love for television I could see how the banning of books can occur. This has already happened in history before.This story is about a fireman Guy Montag and his life. His job is to burn books and the houses they are in. He is happy with this until his young neighbor Clarisse Mcclellan. She shows him how horrible the society the live in really is and changes his views in several ways. All of the symbolism in this book was so amazing once you understood it. Light and dark, symbolizing good and bad, was used often in Fahrenheit 451. I also enjoy how rolls reverse in this book, like in our society and in the future society. In the book the fireman are completely the opposite of what ours are today, also in the future society you can not drive under the speed minimum or you get a ticket. This shows how the government doesn't want people to take there time because they could have time to think about new and interesting thins. One thing I didn't like about the book was that throughout it the author goes into less detail about how the society in which they live in is ran and more detail on how he goes about living in it. But I think the author did this to get focus on the problem at hand. I enjoyed how the author makes you find the under lying meaning in the book and that is a good aspect in my opinion. I also like how the book can be compared to Hitler and what he was doing when he was in control of the German government. The way the society does not like having freethinkers and having open minds is almost exactly like what Hitler was trying to do to the people of Germany. I think it is great how it shows how far ahead of his time the author was. I think his interpretation of the future could be accurate.My overall opinion of the book is it is a good read. It can become boring at times but it can also be extremely exciting at points too. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes the thought of futuristic societies and what can happen to the world after we leave. I think it is a very well written book but doesn't define some of its characters as well as it should. But that isn't a reason to not read the book. I think anyone could enjoy reading this book. It makes you think and has so many metaphors and similes that at some points are too much. But it is a great book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"My initial thought of the book, after reading the back cover, was this is going to be very corny. After putting much time into reading the story, I was surprised when it turned out to be one of the best books I have ever read.One of the key ingredients for my much love for the book was the sufficient detail, but still leaving room for you to interpret it in your own way. The glimpse of the future does not seem so far fetched. With the new interest in television over a book, and the \\"un-colorblind\\" society, book burning would seem like a good answer.I enjoyed the book, it was a fun read, and portrayed what may happen later in our time. The story is about Guy Montags life as a \\"fireman\\", one who destroys books by burning them. He is challenged by a younger girl, his neighbor, and notices the horror of his times. One thing I did notice with the story, however, was some parts in the book were very well described, and others I wish had more explanation. For example, more details on how the society is run, and set up would have been nice. I think the author may of done this to keep the focus on the point of the story, but I felt I was missing things when \\"painting my picture\\". During my period of reading the book, I couldn't help but compare the story to that of incidents of book burnings during the Second World War. The government in Fahrenheit 451can be compared to Hitler, and his drive too uneducated the people of his generation, and erase all evidence of their past.This book requires you to read between the lines, to get the under lying meaning, which is a great aspect in my opinion. It stupefies me on how a writer so long ago, could accurately portray what exactly is happening in our society, for this reason I alone I read the book cover to cover, and made special note of other areas of prediction. I read other reviews before reading the story myself; I noticed that many of the reviewers felt there were too many metaphors. I don't think this should be a reason not to read this book.I enjoyed this book very much, and would recommend it to any one that asked. It is a must read classic. Bradbury's interpretation of the future is none but awe inspiring."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a very intresting and mind boggling book. It made me realize how important books are in society, and just how much books really do influence your reality. In F451 the government was afraid to let the people have their own ideas. They wanted the community to think what they wanted them to think. The people were so caught up on their material items, that they even forgot about thinking of humans as real human beings. Most people in this particular community did not \\"talk\\" with one another, they would rather sit in front of the T.Vs. After a while the community wasn't even people anymore, they were robots.

It's absolutely amazing. It draws you in and you can't put it down. If you're looking for an intriguing and intelligent book, this one is for you."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am teaching \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" as the example of a dsytopian novel in my Science Fiction class, although it is certainly one of the most atypical of that particular type of narrative discourse. Compared to such heavy weight examples as George Orwell's \\"1984,\\" Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World,\\" Yevgeny Zamiatin's \\"We,\\" Ray Bradbury's imaginative meditation on censorship seems like light reading. But the delicious irony of a world in which firemen start fires remains postent and the idea of people memorizing books so they will be preserved for future generations is compelling. Of course, there have been more documented cases of \\"book burning,\\" albeit in less literal forms, since \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was first published in 1953, so an argument can be made that while all the public debate was over how close we were the Orwellian future envisioned in \\"1984,\\" it is Bradbury's little parable that may well be more realistic (especially in terms of the effects of television).The novel is based on a short story, \\"The Fireman,\\" that Bradbury published in \\"Galaxy Science Fiction\\" in 1951 and then expanded into \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" two years later. However, those who have studied Bradbury's writings caw trace key elements back to a 1948 story \\"Pillar of Fire\\" and the \\"Usher II\\" story from his 1950 work \\"The Martian Chronicles.\\" Beyond that, there is the historical record of the Nazis burning books in 1933. The story is of a future world in which everyone understands that books are for burning, along with the houses in which they were hidden. Guy Montage is a fireman who has been happy in his work for ten years, but suddenly finds himself asking questions when he meets a teenage girl and an old professor.\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is not only about censorship, but also about the inherent tension in advanced societies between knowledge and ignorance. Reading this novel again I am reminded about Pat Paulsen's editorial on the old \\"Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\\" (a series well acquainted with the perils of censorship) about how we might enjoy freedom of speech in this country but we do not enjoy freedom of hearing because \\"there is always the danger of something being said.\\" Censorship, in practical terms, is the effort of those who do not want others to hear what they find offensive, for whatever reasons, basically because it leads to people thinking thoughts they do not want them to be thinking. Through the rambling diatribes of Captain Beatty, Bradbury makes this point quite clear to his readers.Even though this is essentially a novella, Bradbury's work retains the charm of a short story. The recurring use of animal imagery throughout the story, the use of the mythic ideas of the salamander and the phoenix, make \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" more poetic than any other dystopian work. Even if it is predominantly a one note argument regarding censorship, it is impossible to deny that Bradbury makes a clear and convincing case for his position. Besides, there is something to be said for any work that insures that beyond the point at which water freezes the only other recognizable number on the Fahrenheit scale is the point at which book paper starts to burn."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I never attended an American highschool so this hasn't been part of my mandatory reading. I heard much about it though and finally decided to pick up a copy in the bookstore the other day. I loved the story and prose. I wish the book had been longer with more details about the world the story takes place in. Bradbury leaves many facets of daily life untouched, that I would have liked to hear about. Alas, this is not a descriptive science fiction novel though, but a rather philosophical approach, that leaves more to imagination than other authors do.One complaint I have with this edition is, that the main character's name (Montag) was misspelled as \\"Montage\\" in at least one occurence. While this is no big deal, it really bothers me, especially when the book isn't brand new but has been read and reviewed millions of times."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"+++++(Note: this review is for the book \\"Fahrenheit 451: The 50th Anniversary Edition\\" published by Del Rey in 2003.)This particular book has five sections:(1) The actual novel by Ray Bradbury that was first published in 1953 (165 pages).(2) An \\"Afterward\\" written by the author in 1982 (7 pages).(3) A \\"Coda\\" (a section that reinforces the novel's conclusion) written by the author in 1979 (5 pages).(4) An interview with the author in 2003 entitled \\"A Conversation with Ray Bradbury\\" (11 pages).(5) \\"About the Author\\" or a brief biography of Ray Bradbury, born 1920 (1 page).This novel is a dystopian science fiction novel. (A \\"dystopia\\" is any society considered to be undesirable; the opposite of a utopia.) It is set in a world where books are banned and burned and, as well, where critical thought is discouraged. The novel's title refers to the ignition temperature of paper. (The ignition temperature is the temperature at which something catches fire and burns on its own.) For paper, this temperature is 451 degrees Fahrenheit (or 233 degrees Celsius).What's eerie about this novel is that, even though it was written more than fifty years ago, it seems to be predicting what is beginning in our society.The novel itself is divided into three parts. (There are no chapters.) These parts are entitled:(1) The Hearth and Salamander(2) The Sieve and the Sand(3) Burning BrightThere are only five major characters in this novel:(1) Guy Montag: is the protagonist of the story. He is a \\"fireman\\" (or more precisely a book burner) who realizes that the world is wasting away because people live only to be entertained. Montag eventually begins collecting books by stealing them instead of burning them.(2) Mildred Montag: Guy's wife whose only purpose in life is watching television. She is very unhappy (but doesn't realize it).(3) Clarisse: the unusual girl who lives next door to Guy. She refuses the entertainment of society and is a free thinker who enjoys the outdoors and family conversations. She informs Montag that there's more to life than burning books and watching television.(4) Captain Beatty: the fire chief for whom Montag works. He is the villain of the novel.(5) Faber: a retired English professor. When Montag needs help understanding what he reads in his stolen books, he turns to this professor.There are a few minor characters in the novel. The most significant are a small group of \\"outlaws.\\" Their crime: being scholars who read books in the past.This novel might be considered a social commentary that predicts what may happen in the future. Some themes that run through it are as follows:(1) the use of fear to control(2) the dangers of indifference(3) the dangers of censorship(4) the importance of free speech(5) the importance of the individual.The afterword is interesting and is where Bradbury talks about his love of books and writers. As well, he revisits some of the main characters in this novel.The coda explains how some publishers have tried to censor some aspects of this novel. This got Bradbury very angry and he states, \\"There is more than one way to burn a book. And the world is full of people running about with lit matches.\\"In the interview with Bradbury, many intriguing things are discussed. I found Bradbury's critique of the 1966 movie based on this novel interesting. I learned that a new movie based on this novel will be coming out soon. I also admire Bradbury even more when he states, \\"Reading is the center of our lives. The library is our brain. Without the library, you have no civilization.\\"Finally, the cover of this book is of special significance. It is the original cover of the 1953 hardcover book showing a person covered in printed paper with books (presumably that he's/she's read) at his/her feet. The person and the books are shown set ablaze.In conclusion, this is a short, fascinating book that really makes you think about the future of society!!(Originally published 1953; this particular book published 2003; 3 parts; main narrative of 165 pages; afterword; coda; interview with author)+++++"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"First off, I would like to tell you why I picked this book. I picked it because I like books that have the future in it. When I first looked at the headings for this book, I was really undecided, but when I went to amazon.com I fould out that this book took place in the future with the firefighter and his troubles. I thought, &quot;Well Hey&quot;. Maybe I would actually be able to raed the book and see things differently and my thought was right. It was a book about a firefighter named Montag, who instead of putting fires out, he sets them. When I first found out I thought to myself, &quot;well thats pointless, why would you set a fire and just let it burn like nothing happened?&quot; But after I read on through the pages I found out that they dont just burn houses for no reason, they burn them because of books. If there are books in the house and they get a call, they will go and start the house on fire. One night Montag was setting a fire and an old lady was sitting there saying something. Montag tried to get the lady out of the house, but she wouldn't go. That made Montag thing, and me also, &quot;why would you want to die in a fire?&quot; Montag grabeed a book, hid it under his arm, and left. After that fire, Montag went home to his wife Mildred. (Theres something weird in the book, the walls are TVs and the TV characters on shows are &quot;the Relatives&quot;). When Montag got home, he hid the book under his pillow and he barely slept that night, and when he woke up in the morning, his wife Mildred was watching TV, or should I say talking to the relatives, and he told mildred he wasnt feeling well, and if the cheif comes and asks for him to tell him that he wasn't feeling well and would go to work. Mildred thought that it was unusual because Montag is never sick. Montag asked mildred to get him some advil and turn down the relatives. Mildred refused because she didnt believe Montag at all. the door monitor went off and it was the cheif, Montag told mildred to tell the chief &quot;I dont know, I dont want to talk about anything&quot; Mildred of course let him in and the chief had a clue that Montag had a book and that's why he didnt feel good. So the chief played it off the way I pictured it, was like this, &quot;I know that the fire last night wasnt' so pleasant, but when people have books and they know it is against the law, but on the other hand if the fireman had the book for more than 24 hours, then we would have to burn his house&quot;. That made Montag kind of scared, after the chief left, he said I must tell you something Mildred, after he went and pulled 8 books from the light fixture in the hall, mildred didn't know what to do and went ballistic. But then she sat down to read a book or two thinking it would help, all of a sudden tthe phone rang and she answered. it was her friend and she told Montag she was going out with her friend and Montag ws shocked. But then Montag remembered, &quot;I remember a guy a long time ago I was sitting in the park, he would carry a bible around, and he told me that if i ever needed help to call me and he handed me a card.&quot; Montag went dashing around the house finding the card. He finally found it and he called him, and his name was Faber.For the rest of the story you must read the book. it is actually kind of interesting if you think about it. Maybe 60 years from now, maybe firefighters will acttually start fires instead of putting them out! As for me, the book was an okay book. I have read better but it was interesting."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman. His job description differs from the job of firemen of our society. Guy's job is to burn books and the houses of those who conceal them. Guy stumbles upon a woman unlike any other he has met before. Her name is Clarisse. She is very different than anybody else from this society. Guy takes long walks with her and listens to her as much as possible. This is the beginning of Guy's rebel against society.One night, Guy responds to a call about a woman concealing books. They find them and Guy happens to pick one up and hide it in his jacket. The woman is so in love with her books that she burns herself with them. Guy wonders why she had done that and why people have such a passion for books. He seeks these answers and reveals 24 books he had stolen. He sought an old acquaintance named Faber to help him understand them.Faber read him the books he presented and explained the logic behind them while Montag thought up a way to beat the system of the firemen. His plan is working when books are reported at his house and he is forced to burn his house himself. He is so enraged that he burns the fire chief and races off for the country.In this rural area he meets a group of men full of knowledge. They talk for a long time until they decide to move.

Specifically books, and the houses they are found in. He lives in a state where books, and possesion of them, is illegal. Guy enjoys his job until the day he meets Clarisse McClellan.Clarisse makes Guy doubt his motives and he soon becomes daring enough to break the law and read a book. He finds he loves litereature, he keeps steals books from the houses he's burning and reads them at home. He finally goes as far as to skip work one day, and his Fire Department Captain, Captain Beatty, shows up at his home. He tells Montag that it's normal for a Fireman to go through such doubts at a stage in his life. Then proceeds to go through a long monologue as to the history of banning books. According to him, special interest groups objected to books that criticized, belittled, or undermined their causes. For this reason, books became more and more neutral in order to avoid offending anyone. However, this still wasn't enough. So society agreed to outlaw books.Montag is not convinced and begins to plot with a professor he had previously met named Faber. They plan on planting books in the houses of Firemen as a way of discrediting the profession and destroying the governments unit for censorship. However, thing go when the alarm sounds at the firestation and Montag goes to the last house he'll burn in is career, his house.Unlike its fellow dystopia-themed predecessor, 1984, much of Fahrenheit 451's depiction of modern society came true almost prophetically. Although not outlawed, literature now holds a narrow audience. And the brainwashing televisions Ray Bradbury depicts aren't far off of today's one-eyed-boxes.Ray Bradbury's adjectival descriptions in this book are strong, even at times; on occasion, one could even say they became monotonous. However, the books never crawls forward for to long; the progress, although not quick, still moves fast enough to keep the reader's attention.Overall a strong novel censorship. Although not perfectI would recommend Fahrenheit 451 to any reader interested in either mere science-fiction, or one actually interested in a political criticism of censorship. Both will find their time well spent, the latter will definitely get more out of it, as for the previous. . .Maybe you would enjoy Star Wars??"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is simply the tale of a fireman, Guy Montag, whose job it is to burn books. Life for Guy is a routine--the same lifeless relationship with his wife, the same job day in and out, the same shallow fullfillment of time.There must be something else.The humanity in Guy is writhing and struggling, but Guy knows not what he lacks. Montag is forced to choose between what he knows is right and what he feels.And the consequences make all the difference.In this novel, Ray Bradbury, in this novel of a futuristic world eerily similar to our own, critiques censorship and the education in America.

In the years since that, I have grown to love this book and become swept up in the character quirks and bleak yet wonderful portrayl of the future. One point that is eluded to in the book and seems to be a prophecy that could very well come true is that of the society's need for friends(see Montag's wife's urgency around her &quot;friends&quot;) but the reality being that it is shallow company. For them, real entertainment is provided by the television, and friendship is a hollow term for the company that we so desperately desire. This is part of what makes Clarisse such a compelling charecter; she has rejected this notion of friendship for family and conversation. She sees that the hollow pleasures enjoyed by so many are just an excuse to keep the mind idle. Clarisse was a visionary, a free thinker, but most of all an enjoyer of books, a love she paid for with her life.

It seems almost ridiculous to have firemen to burn down houses because the obtain books in them. But is it really? Today's American Society has already started the burning of books and persecution of those who own them. There are already banned book lists that are preventing the youth of today from expanding their minds. It is a travesty that this is happening, but the fact remains that it is. By preventing High School students from reading &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; because it uses a derogatory term towards African-Americans is ridiculous. We are forgetting what the word &quot;satire&quot; means. To ban Vonnegut's works because they are different is insane. We may not have begun to burn down houses, but we are not helping books to survive. We are too locked into computer screens and televisions to remember what it is to be human. The human-experience can never come from a computer or a television. We must protect what keeps us human. Forget being politically correct, forget Jehovah, Allah, and any other diety...

Indeed the new role of the fireman is to ensure that fires happen, fuelled by books, writing and probably artwork if there was any left in this future.Enter Montag, a dedicated fireman who finds himself curious as to why people keep defying the law and owning books. Given this is a dystopian novel imagine you can tell where this leads.While shortish (the novella was orignially 25,000 words, before various magazines including Playboy asked for a longer work) Bradbury was a lot to say about the future of Western society. The scariest part for me was the fact people had all but become reality TV zombies, considering the people of the 'walls' to be their family's. A trend which I can see happening entirely naturally without any tyrannical political force.In summary, Fahrenheit 451 won't take up much of your time, but is worth more than the time you will spend on it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury crafts a dark future that strikes at humanity's desire to destroy the mirror that reflects our short comings.In an age where books seem to be losing popularity, this novel reminds the readers the importance of the written word and the necessity to preserve our history, lest we be doomed to repeat it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Must read if you are a slacker like me and didn't read all the books you should have when you were in high school :D"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I loved this book in high school and now that I'm reading it ten years later the messages are even more relevant and insightful."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury considered this novel his best work -- identifying himself on his tombstone as the author of Fahrenheit 451. It is an intriguing piece of work, though more fable than novel. Bradbury, like Dick, was never one to develop great characters, though his dialogue is a lot better than Dick's. And while Bradbury's plots are never as brilliantly convoluted as those of Dick, the imagination and philosophy behind his plots are his strength.Here Bradbury anticipates by 60 years the plugged-in, hyper consumerism of our present society. Books and ideas are abandoned voluntarily - first the books are condensed, then outlined, then just not read at all. And finally society as a whole mobilizes against the perceived snobbery and divisiveness of intellectuals, resulting in organized bookburning. In the background is a commitment to a permanent state of war with other countries.Like the interrogator of the hero in 1984, the chief book burner who tries to keep Bradbury's book-burning hero on the straight and narrow is one of the most interesting characters in the book. One gets the impression that he's an intellectual who has recovered from his heresy with a vengeance. Also interesting is the character of Clarisse, who first persuades the hero to ask questions about his life. I wish that character had been better developed.This is a very good book, though it has a truncated feel. The novel would have benefitted from expanding the characters and from giving a better feel for day-to-day life in this imagined future dystopia."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I doubt I can add anything new to a book with over 1500 reviews. So, like always, I'll just give my personal insights. In my opinion, what makes a classic a classic is something like this. . .it's pretty obvious that this book, when it was written, takes place in the future. Never do we know exactly when, and never is it actually stated that this book takes place in the future, yet it is. The fact that the fictional plot isn't really far-fetched is spooky, and mabe that's what caused such a stir when this book was causing controversy.Another thing is that a classic can not be defined as just one genre. This book is sci-fi, but it's not hard sci-fi. It's not the sci-fi that Asimov presents, where it takes place in space, across planets and galaxies and so on (by the way, I like Asimov alot, I'm not at all saying this type of sci-fi is bad), but with the little details, such as a Mechanical Hound (who was quite intimidating I might add), and the seashell worn by Mildred. It was more science fiction than I expected it to be, yet it was far from just a science fiction novel. It is also mostly a dystopian novel, yet at times it's also a thriller, even a tad of horror, and not to mention some heavy pyschological tendicies. And all of it works beautifully together.This story also does two things that a classic does: it takes a toll, or has a profound effect, on you, and also gets you thinking. From early on, and I mean the very first pages, the mood is dark and gloomy, and already the reader feels dreary. Montag's unhappiness is so realistic, his world so seemingly hopeless. Instantly the reader pities and sympathizes with Montag. His unhappiness, his refusal to just do as he's told like everyone around him does, is so well written as to be completely relatable and realistic. The scene where he watches his wife being \\"operated on\\" after she overdoses is both intense and horrific.It's pretty amazing that this book was so controversial and so challenged, especially considering the plot. Bradbury fit a whole lot of story into 150 pages here, and whatever he was trying to accomplish, I'd say he was extremely successful. Something Wicked This Way Comes was a good book, a really fun read (one thing I really liked better about fahrenheit 451 is that Bradbury's writing is much more concise) but THIS book is the real deal, and this is what proved to me that Bradbury deserves the praise and accolades he received throughout his lifetime. One of the best books I've read and I certainly recommend you read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I love this book! i tried to read it when i was younger but couldnt understand it and when i read it all the way through a few years ago i feel in love. this book is so beautiful and hopeful even through all the darkness.

As I get older I notice more and more the similiarities between what Bradbury said the future would be when he wrote the tale and what it is now. One of the most chilling sections is when Montage's boss describes how &quot;political correctness&quot; got out of hand and became a harbringer of the new dark age the book describes. If you haven't read this, do. I am definitely not the first to call it a classic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"WOW! This book will make you think, and be thankful that you can. At first the futuristic world that is proposed seems foreign and unrealistic, but as you sink deeper into the story, you realize that the zombie-like society isn't that far from our own.

I have heard of this before and was some how part of a small group who didn't have to read this in high school or College. So I decided to give this classic a try.I loved the premise of this book, the idea that \\"Firemen\\" were causing fires instead of putting them out. And then the idea that the government is eliminating all books. It would mean a severe downfall in education. This was fun to read and I found the more I got into this book the more freaked out I became. Since I have gotten into reading more lately it was a scary thought of a world without books.I began asking myself questions, \\"What would I do if I couldn't read?, Would I be courageous enough to stand up to a government who would take away this great art, or would I hide my personal collection?\\" Well, over all I really enjoyed it and was glad I finally read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is a great story story predicting our grim future where books are banned and only electronic entertainment is allowed.I found this story absolutely mind blowing and a classic Ray Bradbury book.

This book is both thought provoking and an interesting study of human nature.I recommend it to readers of all types of literature. It is an excellent read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's novel, Fahrenheit 451, is an eye-opening science fiction novel that is definitely a recommended read for anyone with a passion for reading. Bradbury takes the reader into a dystopian society where many things seem backward. Firemen don't put out fires - they start them. Books are not read, they are burned. The government tells you what to think and what to discuss. Free thinking is discouraged. Maybe the most starling thing about the novel is that free thinking is not craved. A vast majority of the citizens are satisfied with their ignorance. They are comfortable with being nave. This brings the reader to an unsettling but very real conclusion: Are we as a society becoming more and more comfortable with our ignorance?The novel focuses on chronicling the eye-opening experiences of a middle aged firefighter, Guy Montag. Montag appears content with his job, but the reader soon learns that this is not the case. He begins to question everything when he meets a young girl named Clarisse. Clarisse is a very peculiar girl. She tells Montag that she enjoys taking walks and that she rarely watches the Parlor Walls, which would be our equivalent of television. Clarisse asks questions, an uncommon practice in their society. She asks if Montag has ever read a book, and if it's true that firemen used to put out fires (Bradbury 8). Montag is taken aback at the way she freely addresses him. Most surprising all of all, is when Clarisse is about to leave. Before entering her house, she stops and asks, \\"Are you happy?\\" (Bradbury 10). Montag scoffs and pays no attention to her seemingly irrelevant question, but later he begins to think more and more. Am I happy with the life I am living? Am I satisfied with burning books, houses, and sometimes even innocent people?Throughout this masterpiece of a novel, Bradbury frequently uses symbolism. Bradbury uses fire to symbolize cleansing. For the firemen, is it the cleansing of knowledge and what they perceive to be dangerous to the minds of the people. The chief fireman even says, \\"Burn all, burn everything. Fire is bright and fire is clean\\" (Bradbury 60). For Montag, fire is a cleansing of evil within the society. Montag sets fire to the chief fireman and believes that by doing so he is helping to cleanse the evil that clings to their society. Another example of symbolism in Fahrenheit 451 is a giant mechanical hound the resides at the fire station. The hound \\"slept but did not sleep, lived but did not live\\" (Bradbury 24). The firemen played a game with the hound where they would set a few animals lose in its vicinity and place bets on which animal it would kill first. The hound represents the government and fear of the government.Overall, Bradbury's novel is a thought-provoking classic that should not soon be forgotten. This novel will make you question the way you think, the way you interact with technology, and it might even make you want to turn off the computer and pick up a book instead."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"{my thoughts} - This book is interesting. It is futuristic and very engaging for the reader. It is about a guy named {guy montag}. He is a fireman but not the in customary sense of the word. Instead of putting out fires he starts them. The only fires started are the one's at residences houses where the individuals have books any books. They are banned not allowed and therefore those caught with books are subject to losing all their worldly possessions. This book is about his defiance of such laws, his determination and his will to make a stand for things he believes to be wrong. This book is well written and and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it!{reason for reading} - This book is a well known classic. I have been wanting to read for sometime. I had started it a few years ago but had misplaced the book. I know bad bad bad, but it does happen."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury warned us of a culture that had no more ambitions then to watch TV. Much has come true. I mean how many people think &quot;Titanic&quot; actually qualifies as entertainment. He described a society were simplistic plots dominated. He also described a presidential race won because of one canidates charisma not because of wether or not his plans would work. Most of all Grandmaster Bradbury gives us hope. I sincerely believe that TV and movies will become obsolete to holograms and VR. Holograms and VR will become obsolete to somatic input devices. Nevertheless books will always be read. Why? I'm sixteen and proof that love of literature hasn't been completely lost on my generation. These are a few of the reasons this is one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I don't know nothing about tha"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is one of the best books I have ever read. This book potrays a society, which may look too fake to be true, however, when we realise in what society we live in, we understand that it is not too far away. Every charachter of this novel wants to learn something to us.I liked especially one phrase of Beaty about Clarisse which shows exactly what people the government of the novel wants &quot;She did not want to learn how a thing was done, but why.That can be embarrassing&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"At first the book is very confusing and lame, but it gets better towards the middle. The idea is a little stretched out. I think the book should have ended without the last couple of chapters because I got sick of reading it.

If you buy this book, brunt the hardship; it gets incredible later!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book just sweeps into the world of so called happiness.I think the book is warning us about the dangers of technology.I love the way he portrays life in the future and how liberal and lazy the people have become.I especially love Captain Beatty's personality, he can burn books but yet he knows quite alot about them.Captain Beatty's name is kind of ironic in how it incorporates the word beatific, which means to show extreme joy or bliss,when in the book they all are trying to stay happy when really they're not.They are not happy in my opinion because they always have to be doing something they can't just think or have a conversation with a human being.This book is very interesting and I recomend it to teens so they can learn more about life itself."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is scary when you read it. It opened my eyes as to what is slowly starting to happen to our society. Bradbury may have written this around mid-century, but he is closer to predicting the future than any author I have read works by."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book, as many of Bradbury's, is incredibly interesting. With symbolism and strangeness Bradbury depicts the future as it would be without books. Not only is this novel an amazing tale the first time it is read, but it contains the same excitement and wonder many times thereafter."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Wow! I just finished this book for my 8th grade reading class two days ago. It was the wierdest book I've ever read, yet in an awesome way. The things Bradbury talks about in this book that should come as a shock are almost prophetic. I'm not suggesting that our world will come to the point of men burning books for a living any time soon, but it's kindof scary to think about the glimpses of some of these things (ex. TV &quot;families&quot;) that we are already beginning to see. I think that we should take this book as a warning not to let ourselves be so worried about being happy that we let ourselves be trapped in the kind of world Bradbury illustrates. This was an awesome book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As a gifted student I deal with things relating to this book all the time. I have found that the school systems, in order to please everyone, find a way to mask stupidity and praise every child meaninglessly. In Farenheit 451 the lack of books is like the school system's mindless praise. There is nothing that displeases anyone. I find this classic novel a shockingly truthful account of the not-too-distant future. A must read book for anyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In perhaps the bleakest outlook of what the future would be like, Ray Bradbury tells the world how the thinks the future will be. This is a very bleak book, with wars all to common, firemen burn books, not put out fires, and the world is in a horrible state of turmoil. There are no teachers in schools, children go to schools for days at a time, and parents don't care at all, and an accquaintence to the main charachter had her father arrested for being a pedestrian. Guy Montag (main charachter), a fireman for awhile, realizes something all to true when Clarrise, the accquaintance, asks him a simple question: &quot;Are you happy?&quot; Montag looks at the question as a joke, but soon realized the bleak truth that he is not happy at all, and his wife, Mildred, obviously doesn't even like him at all. After a woman decides to burn with her books with Montag watching, even lighting the match herself, Montag thinks that books must have something true to offer Through all the experiences he has in these events, he begins to read, which in this book is a punishable offense. The books truly do open his life up to newer situations and great works, until one day his boss finds out Montag's secret.In great sense of irony, Ray Bradbury actually made some true predictions, even the microwave oven. Most of this book, however, is inaccurate with the future. Too bad, because other countries sadly do hate us. Wars, however, are far less common than this book has predicted. Other than that, this book is just too real, and recommended to both teenagers and adults."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. Bradbury's prose is direct but beautiful, full of sylistic twists that enhance the reading experience greatly. The story moves quickly, and the brisk pacing is expertly handled, never leaving the reader minutely bored. At under 200 pages, the length is perfect for the story, yet delivers its haunting message about censorship, superficiality, and the dumbing down of America with force without ever becoming preachy. Truly a magnificent accomplishment and should be required reading for everyone!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was a disappointing book for a reader who is not an avid science fiction lover. This book is very difficult to read. The correctors a sometimes very confusing to understand. The setting is also very hard to have a visual picture. Although the plot is very good the way that it is described is hard to understand. I think if you are a science fiction lover that you would like this book. But if you sometimes like to read science fiction you will not like this because you have to be a huge science fiction lover to like this. I also think you need to be above the 6th grade or a very advanced reader."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is about a time so far ahead in history that humans have decided that books are evil. and they are banned. people live very superficial lives. the book, as i remember, i read it like years ago, follows this one guy who starts to think that maybe all this anti-book is wrong. he finds a group of people that had all the classics memorized, each book one person. i was amazed to see how the author had chosen to protect the written world, he brought it back to spoken stories. this book was great. it really brings you to a time where everything u believe in is thought to be wrong. strange thought huh? :) i enjoyed this book a lot. happy reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I don't give very many things five stars.Bradbury's novel is simple, powerful, beautiful, and truly marvelous.A negative utopia along the lines of Brave New World or 1984, I like this book more than either of those because it is ultimately, utterly hopeful. Bradbury is in love with a messed up world and his message comes across with an urgency and honesty that is both startling and impressive.You know the plot -- they burn books because they're scared of ideas. Montag wonders about the ideas and becomes an outcast in a sterile society. This book makes me want to change the world. And so I want you to read it. And then maybe memorize it.A quick read, and a fairly easy read. Engrossing enough that you won't want to put it down, and once you finish it, you might be tempted to just start over and read it again. I recommend doing just that."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was very interesting.I read it in 11th grade English. We had many disscusions and look deep in to the concepts of the book. It had our class debating on topics that were'nt even mentioned in the book, but brought the ideas to our minds.This book makes me wonder about what our future will look like with all the advanced technology thats coming about. Will we soon become the victims of a world like this book describes.....? The people in this book become almost like a slave to technology instead of technology becoming a slave to them.Is that happening to us now, always wanting fast entertainment, not applying our Knowledge to problems or circumstances in our lives,or maybe not even taking the time out to sit down and read something. Makes you think and thats what Brandbury does throughout this book. So if you like to take the time out to read a book,think about what you've read and apply that knowledge to intances throughout your life then you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was standing in my local bookstore, which as usual didn't have what I was looking for, browsing the School Reading List shelves for a book I could get extra credit in English I for.

I decided to buy it to see what my opinion was. I was pretty sure I wouldn't like it because I am normally a fantasy reader and don't usually go for this kind of book. But when I got home with it I picked it up and it stayed permanently attached to my hand until I finished it. I was finished in two days (about two hours total reading time). I won't say I recommend this book for everybody. If you don't like to think, if you prefer to view everything as having a distinct happy ending, if you hate symbolism, if you are an extreme pacifist, or if you only read books that have absolutely no profanity in them, this is DEFINITELY not the book for you. Anyone else should read this book at least once. And I mean the whole book. Don't give up on the first ten pages.

For example, when the city is bombed, there should be some line of chaos and the people inhabiting the city running for their lives.

Clarisse is a seventeen year old who enjoy reading. She meets Montag and tells him that at one point books were legal. She explains to him why she reads and tries to convince Montag to read.

The main character is Guy Montag who lives in a time where books are outlawed and firemen burn them. He is a fireman who liked his job and never asked questions about the things that he did until he met seventeen-year-old Clarisse McClellan who was not afraid to ask questions. She along with a professor he meets helps him open his eyes to the truth. He knows now that he must turn against the very people he works for.I liked this book because it is very realistic of somthing that could happen in the near future. The book can become confusing at some points and is told in third person. This book is good for people who like to read about future \\"what ifs\\". I highly recommend this book to people who like to read books that change their outlook on life."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Somehow I've never managed to read this book, even in school. I'd seen it for years in the library, but was always turned off by the title/cover. To be honest, I didn't even know what it was about. However, the minute I started reading it, I couldn't put it down! With interesting themes and characters, this is definitely a must-read classic!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's story was written in the early 1950's, but has great resonance for today, with all our high-powered, big screen technology.

The lasting power of his short novelis shown in how long it's lived, being published now for 60+ years."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Whenever I first read this book it scared me because of the realism and how relevant it was to how American society is and where it is going. Even though I was much younger than I am now when I finished it (I'm 20), I was still able to realize that the future Ray Bradbury portrays in this wonderful work of fiction is entirely possible. I absolutely love to read, a bibliophile if you will, and when I first realized that the world in this book takes pride in BURNING them AND the people who read them I remember thinking, \\"God help us\\". What made me say that is the realization that many of my fellow class mates all throughout school (K-12) did NOT like to read one bit but they did like to burn and destroy things. Society, in the story, values everything that destroys knowledge and wisdom so that those in charge are able to stay in power and keep everyone under there thumb. Turning people into mindless sheep. Many of the technological \\"advances\\" (I consider them more of a step back then a step forward) include only a few hours of school with nothing actually learned, destruction parks where people can go smash and destroy everything there, insanely fast cars, and (in my opinion the worst one) the ENTIRE room dedicated to television. This book is an extremely accurate portrayal of where American society is headed if we do not do something to stop this trend. We must value knowledge and wisdom above all else because those two things are what primarily separate us from all other animals. I absolutely loved this book and author and I hope you will pick this up and give it a try."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Reached in time for my daughter's school . My daughter enjoy it.

Ray Bradbury truly is a master storyteller. I instantly gelled with this book and could not stop reading until I knew what was to become of Montag (and those poor outlawed books!!). The writing contained the perfect level of description - it painted vivid pictures in my mind, yet never got hung up on the mundane.And the story! Though written over 60 years ago, I found the plot and underlying messages to be very applicable to modern life. It was a sad, yet fitting portrait of our obsession with technology and pointed towards that frightening theme of \\"the future is bleak\\". I'm always a total sucker for these dystopian novels, but this one takes the cake - or at least a hearty-sized slice of it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 populates most \\"Best Books\\" lists and yet it is still somehow under appreciated. I think some of this stems from critics focusing much of the attention on the censorship of books, which, while certainly an important aspect of the novel, is not necessarily its most compelling point. The most devastating scenes are those where it is clear that this society has lost its soul. In commenting on the war that wages around them, Mrs. Phelps states, \\"It's always some other woman's husband that dies.\\" Montag, the protagonist, is married to a woman who has attempted suicide multiple times, who can't remember where she met her husband, and who doesn't care about...anything.The images that Bradbury can call forth during the book's climatic moments are heart-wrenching. Books die like slaughtered birds. Bombs fall like seeds scattered by the hands of God. Sparks dance like fireflies.Yet, in the middle of all of the carnage and waste, there is hope. Hope that we will not forget the past and the lessons it teaches. Hope that even in an age where the iPods, massive television screens and casual violence that Bradbury predicted 60 years ago exist that we will not lose our humanity.This is a beautifully written book that has never been more relevant."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"First off, I'm not a literature buff, I just like to read.

Here is a book of a future where books are like drugs: outlawed, sold on the black market, and if there's a &quot;library,&quot; firemen destroy it. And the added bonus is that the main character, a loyal fireman, has a library! The irony that gets me is that this book is about banning books, yet it is a banned book, so nobody read it! (Ha ha, just kidding folks!)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When i first found this book in my eighth grade social studies classroom, the catchy title and the mysterious message lulled me. Beforehand i had never read Bradbury, or had been interested in him at all. The book changed everything for me. This insane landscape of mindlessness and of throwing away free thought enchanted me mentally and i was hooked. Mr. Bradbury is one of the greatest liberal thinkers in the world. Reading 451 can break the silly chains of political bias, and start you thinking for a change about how much freedom you need and how much you should use it. The ignorance and greed in us today echoes the insane eletric city of the firemen, and we mustnt shut our minds off to the world of literature and creativity if we ever wish to truly think about life."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 is a great book to read. It is about a futuristic world that we all fear. This is a where freedom of speech and thought are completely taken away. Guy Montag is a fireman but instead of putting fires out they set things on fire. The things that they set on fire are books and and the houses that hold the books. Later in the story they talk about Guy Montag meeting this girl named Clarisse. They engage in deep conversation and he soon learn to like the small things in life. After he met her he realizes how dull and boring his family really is. In the end of the story he escapes from the city after killing the fire-cheif and taking a couple of books with him. Guy Montag has the ability to like his job without knowing what he is actually doing to the society. He went to work and liked to watch the book get consumed by the flames. I would recommend this book to other readers. I think the book was interesting and very challenging. The book was fun to read and that is why I would recommend this book to other readers."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Did you notice that nowadays writers and filmmakers tend to make no difference between Horror and Science-Fiction? ... Real Science-Fiction plays not only in the future but in a society very different from ours and with people who have habits and a mentality which also are different from ours. Fahrenheit 451 is a very good example of that. Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature that makes books burn and this is the problem we are dealing with (and no longer in the far future I'm afraid). Guy Montag is the hero of the novel. He's a fireman who burns books that are in people's houses, usually because someone denounced them at the police. It's forbidden to read books because they make you think and therefore make you unhappy. (Clothes have only zippers and no buttons; buttons take to much time so you start thinking and once again this makes you unhappy.) But Montag is a lonely person who has no contact with his wife; she only watches TV from dawn till dusk. The irony is that all the measures, which are taken by the government to protect people from being unhappy only, make them more unhappy than before. As the story unfolds, Guy Montag starts wondering what books are all about and he starts meeting people who read books (without notifying his superiors). The novel ends in a peculiar way.I said in the beginning that the problem is maybe no longer in the far future: a psychologist I know once said that all books ought to have a happy ending. I never asked her what would become of the books that don't have a happy ending because I'm afraid what she might answer."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"he stopped worshipping fire and treated it like the enemy it was when it came to books, except when it came it beatty, whom he turned into a marshmallow. then he met the others who were doing their best to keep the words alive to pass along to the next generation... don't be put off by the fact that it's sci-fi. i love reading stuff that no one thinks i would read. it's not &quot; war and peace &quot; ( 165 pages ) you can read it in a day. and the message will stay with you for life...don't make any more excuses...."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's classic &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; seems to become more true all the time (although it was not intended as a prediction) for example, one of the characters mentions students shooting eachother as if it was an everyday occurence.Beyond that, the plot of &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; is intriguing, poignant, and fun to read.Anyone who has not yet read this classic should pick it up."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In this book, the author shows what can happen when books are taken away, it is based in a time when origial thought is frowned upon and even at times dispised.

But the themes in this book are timeless and the hero is just like you and me. Hopefully. If we a more people like the fireman in this book then perhaps half the holocausts of history would never have happened. then again during those same holocausts there were men and women like the fireman and they helped defeat the tyrants in power or save millions of lives by making the right decision (moral decision) over mindlessly following the status-quo.

It seems that many of the classic science fiction novels deal more with man's attitude toward his surroundings rather than the stories of aliens and the future world gone crazy thru technology. This book takes the simple premise of a world where books are illegal and turns it into a Twilight Zone episode. The best part of a novel such as this is that the reader is forced to contemplate a scenario which is actually imaginable and decide how he or she would act and react. An interesting story to say the least....."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 absolutely cathes the reader's attention of the importance of books. In this story the government has become so corrupt that it has banned the ownership of any sort of literature. It is not until the day when protagonist Montag realizes, while talking to a young girl, how unhappy and naive he actually was. Bradbury takes the idea of a Utopia society and turns it completely upside downThis book shows the damaging effects on the censorships of books and stresses the importance of literature. This is a highly recommmended book to those seeking to open their eyes and realize the truth of how society can be.

Yes, we have a long way to go to be in a state where books are outlawed and firemen start fires instead of stopping them. But still, we have a good head start. People come home from work and plop on the couch and watch TV. You have to be an intellectual to read books. It's just not the norm anymore. In this book, TV has taken over people's lives with wall to wall TV screens. The imagination is lost in the hours of meaningless violence and comedy that is blasted through cables to people's homes. Then, through an array of events, the main character, Montag, starts to wonder about things and think for himself. With society frowning upon thinking, he's in a world of trouble.

This book is awesome and one of the best books I have ever read. It has completely changed the way that I read books and has increased my appreciation for the written word. I highly recommend this book to every single person who is able to read honestly."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I recently decided to go back and read some of the books that I was forced to read back in high school. I was not the avid reader back then that I am today (sixteen years later) so I wanted to compare what I thought of them then to now. I decided to start with Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 because it's a relatively short read and because I remembered it being one of the books that I actually enjoyed in high school.I thought I remembered the book being a warning about government power and censorship and while those are certainly addressed at some level in the book, after reading it again now I realize that this book is equally about the dangers of mindless entertainment and about allowing ourselves to forget what it's like to think for ourselves. I couldn't help but laugh as I read the interactions between Montag and his wife. While she's hopelessly lost in her shows, I kept picturing her watching \\"Teen Mom\\" and \\"The Kardashians\\".There were some exchanges that got to be a little difficult to get through while Guy argued with himself. The dialogue got choppy and hard to follow. Aside from that, the book stands up remarkably well even after six or seven decades. The last few pages of dialogue between Montag and Granger are both meaningful and beautifully written. I hope this book continues to be required reading for kids in school. It's teaches a valuable lesson....one that we need to be reminded of. Kudos to Mr. Bradbury."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Item was exactly as described and was shipped very quickly.

Gripping and viable!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, the author creates the setting of a future in which books are illegal. In fact, if someone is found with a book in their possession, the fire department will burn their \\"fireproof\\" house down. The story is told from a man named Guy Montag's perspective. Montag works for the fire department, meaning he burns books for a living. In his world, people are expected to deal with their problems by watching television or driving 100 mph while hitting everything that gets in their way or putting \\"shells\\" in their ears to drown out their thoughts; people are not expected to think in his world.However, Montag begins to question the world he lives in after he meets a rather peculiar young girl named Clarisse. She is different than the rest of the people around her: she spends most of her time just sitting on the porch and thinking about the world around her. This book by Bradbury is very well-written and is a quick read. It is especially great if you are someone who enjoys books that make you think, like fitting all the pieces together at the end.Bradbury does an excellent job of predicting the future, being that the book was written in the 1950's. Obviously the future has not gone to extremes like in Bradbury's book, but he does accurately predict that people will put \\"shells\\" in their ears to drown out the world (like iPods), the numerous TV's in every household, and taking sleeping pills every night because life is easier that way. It is a little bit hard to understand what is happening at times, just because Bradbury leaves it up to the readers to interpret what is happening. Overall, Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent book, and I would recommend it for higher-level readers."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book when I was 12 for school and it schoked me then.

It's an easy to read enjoyable story, but it also makes you think along the lines of &quot;What would life be like if . . ?&quot;Most books that take place in the future involve alien warfare and voyages through space. This futuristic story, however, takes you to future earth, where books are illegal to own.After reading this book I wanted to go out and read all the classics I could find. It has been about five years since I read the book, and every time I read a classic, I think about the characters in farenheit 451 who couldn't.I've always appreciated books, but after reading Farenheit 451, I cherish them. It's one of those books where after you turn the last page, you say &quot;Wow.&quot; And then you just sit there, contemplating how real this unreal story actually is.It's true that books are still legal, and hopefully always will be. But, I wonder, is it also true that in the age of e-mails, websites, and cell phones, can we lose interest in simple things like letter writing, non-email greeting cards, and books? I would say yes. And, I think that in Farenheit 451, Ray Bradbury says yes too."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"After reading this book, I realize that our society is really destroying itself. I really enjoyed this book, and I think other people should read it, so they can think about ways to help society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is an exelent book. I'm not quite sure why kids don't like it; I read the book when I was 12, and I couldn't put the book down. I found that the author did an exelent job showing the emotions of the characters, and made me feel almost like I was one of them. I would recommend this book to absolutely anyone, but I will give one piece of advise: If you get to the second chapter, and don't like it, stop reading the book. Though it may seem like you have to finish it, if you think the first part is bad, you'll probably hate the book. Though some books have little action at the begining, then change, this book really doesn't change. There are a few parts with action, but only to a small extent. The first part may seem like it doesn't have any action, and it doesn't, but if you are waiting for the real story to start, you probably missed it. Though the entire book has little action, the author constantly adds very thought-provoking ideas, which makes the book intersting even when there is absolutley no action what so ever. One more thing, if the idea of firemen starting fires sounds like the most stupid idea ever, it won't matter. I definatly didn't start reading the book because of this concept. I thought it was a horrible idea, but it turns out, it works very well. So, read this book. If you don't like it at first (and I'm guessing but probably only about 1% of everyone who reads it won't like it) then stop reading it. It won't get much better."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Even though this book was written in the 1950s, it shows life how it really is now in the 21st century.

Fahrenheit 451 offers much more than a usual science fiction classic; it's incredible detail. Just by reading the first page, you will be captured. At points, I honestly could not put the book down, nor look away. The characters all differ so much, and a fine contrast is established between Montag and the Firemen within the first few chapters. Needless to say, Clarisse must be one of the most riveting, and unique characters of all time. This book is well worth the read.

On the first quiz my teacher gave me, I got a 70%, but after reading more deeply into the novel (and taking some marginal notes to study from), I received a 100% on the next quiz. Unfortunately, when you look at our society today with all the ignorance, technological advancements, and anti-intellectual behavior practiced by many, you realize that it may end up a dystopia just like the F-451 society in the near future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is an amazing novel, from start to finish.

It'll give you one lasting impression....and you'll be grateful for books that much more."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was your average school assigned novel. NOOOOTTTTT! It was jam-packed with humor, drama, horror, and action. Guy Montag, the protagonist, turns upon his profession as a fireman. Firemen in the future burn books and the houses that contain them.

We must forgive them, they are in their teens and were forced to read it for school. Its only natural, in these circunstances, not identify with Montag and his passion for literature.Fahrenheit 451 is not difficult or boring. But it isnt a normal SF book (not that I have anything against the genre). Bradbury's books tend to have more to do with Lewis Carrol than Issac Asimov. To me it is really a tale that deals with the significance of books in life and society. But like the every great book, its real meaning will be different depending on the reader or the moment it was read.Its a book to stir you. The first time I read it, I got interested in philosophy and thought deeply about my own existence.For those who read it and didnt like it... try again next year!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I picked up an old paperback copy of this book at a flea market 8 years ago. I couldn't put it down. It's a quick and enjoyable read. Bradbury doesn't hit you with the message until he's ready. He prepares you for it with the main body of the story, and, in the last few pages he provides a biblical quote, from revelations, regarding what books are really for. The quote describes the tree of life and says &quot;And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.&quot; Quite a slam dunk ending that you won't get unless you're ready for it. True literature, he is saying, is to serve a higher consciousness and heal our world. And the tree of life is books, and the leaves on the tree are the pages in those books. This book changed the way I saw and understood things. It's amazing how one book can awaken your vision, and, in turn, awaken your understanding."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is one of the greatest books ever written. Bradbury is a master of the written word. He is the &quot;Air Jordan&quot; of the adjective. Fahrenheit 451 is a stab at political correctness. The premise of the novel is that if we try to dispose of &quot;incorrect&quot; thoughts, we may be forced to eradicate ALL thought."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was amazed at the incredible imagery and poetic use of extremely choice adjectives and adverbs. The main impression I have is how immediate every single sentence felt; each felt totally alive and pulsating with life. To some, this style may seem to err on the side of melodrama, but he can easily be forgiven. I tend to forgive a bit of self-indulgence when dealing with such a fine writer. Those who call it boring and predictable, without knowing how to savor imagery and elaboration, are contributing to the very cause Bradbury is pointing at - a society craving instant gratification and lacking the capacity for self-reflection. It's a fantastic read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"was that the abridged version? no, but it sure seemed like it. This book had some very powerful ideas and the impression it is making on me is currently setting in (as I finished it about ten minutes ago).

It has all ready been made into an indifferent film by Francois Truffaut. In the end, this is one novel that deserves to stay a novel. It will always remain because it tapped into powerful metaphors - firemen STARTING fires instead of putting them out, a society ruled by interactive TV (or is it really?), banned books, and books as human beings. If we ever do reach a state where books have to live in people's heads, this will be one of them."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenhiet 451 is an excellent book. It's set in the future where people aren't allowed to read books. Guy Montag was a fireman whose job was to set books on fire. He meets a girl named Clarice who shows him how you should appreciate what you have in life. He also meets Faber, a professor, who tells him about a future where people can read books and think for themselves. Then, Guy Montag finnaly realizes what he has to do. It's a great book but it's not for people who like books where everything turns out happy and they live happily ever after."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book is in its own way very ironic. It tells the story of a world where the written word is banned and firemen burn books. The story talks of censorship when the book itself is censored in many countries including in some parts of America. The story itself comes from the authors own point of view. He claimed that as he was growing up he saw Hitler burn books and thought it was one of the most criminal acts he had ever scene. I wouldn't recomend this book to any who do not like to read, but if you are an intellectual reader then this is the book for you. It brings to life real issues that affect the society today and can open your eyes to things you have never noticed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 in my mind is a very well-written book by Ray Bradbury. Sometimes this book did get very weird, but it all had a purpose towards the end of the book. The author of this book had a very good idea for a story like this and he wrote it very well.Guy Montag has had his job for ten years as a fireman, but books were for burning and the houses in which they were hidden. This man goes out on midnight, runs and watches pages become inflamed in fire.

I read an article that said much of the band Radiohead's artwork was inspired by this book; as well as some of their little scribbles and a Tee- Shirt.Now I have always respected Radiohead as smart dudes, and have found the image of book burnings full of symbolism. Thus, I gave it a read, and low and behold what do I find? A beast of a book.All the other reviews pretty much get it right, but I didnt like how one reviewer slammed the idea of how easily the main character was converted. After all, the people who did so read books did they not? How could he debate with so little knowledge. Also look at people in our world who are converted from other religions. It usually doesnt take much. Some things just FEEL right after you hear it out loud.All in all, I do not consider this science fiction, but more of a political or social commentary.Interesting, Thought provoking, and entertaining; while maintaining a beatiful simplicity that lets the reader think and imagine."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is about a middle aged man named Guy Montag. Guy is a fireman but, instead of putting out fires he starts them. Since all the houses have been fire proofed years ago there was nothing left for firemen to do so they started burning books. Books were a feared thing in the time of Guy. They are mysterious and scarey things so they must be burned.This was a good read. It was short, but excellently writen as are most of Bradbury's books. It was suspensfull and full of detailed descriptions about everything ranging form the color of the sky to the warmth of the burnig pages of the books. Infact I thought that sometimes there was a little too much description, but that was just me. I really liked the plot. THe idea was really good.

FLEMING THE COOL, instructed us to read Ray Bradbury's &quot;The Pedestrian&quot;, which can be found in &quot;THE GIVER AND RELATED READINGS&quot;. Fahrenheit 451 takes place in a future where they burn books. Guy Montag, a Firemen, enjoys his job and the pleasure of burning pages. He meets young Clarisse McClellan, a girl who changes his view of the world and of books. He begins to think and brood. He starts to question why the Firemen burn books and what secrets lie hidden in them. Thus is the bare beginnings of one of the greatest books in modern literature. There are a cast of powerful secondary characters: Beatty, the cynical Fire Captain who tries to stifle Montag's curiosity; Faber, a Professor who sides with Montag in his crusade; and Granger, the leader of a camp of refugees of society.Also Recommended for anyone who likes this book:The GiverThe Man Who Was ThursdayRead all three of the mentioned books!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a great book for any age.

He later meets a man named Faber which teels him of a future and becomes a very important friend. He feels that he is not doing the right thing, so he has to do something about it!

I may be slightly bias, since I love to read, particularly Sci-fi (Star Trek rules!), but this book was really good. I know many read this book in their junior high years, but I think it's better if it's read a little later, when it can be &quot;digested&quot; more thoroughly by a more mature audience. So many people, regardless of high school levels, hate to read, and I sincerely believe that is one of the most dangerous things in today's society. Schools do not stress music, art, and literature nearly as much as they should. We learn to THINK--we gain WISDOM from what we READ, not from playing sports and playing games on computers. Even many colleges give out more sports scholarships than academic scholarships.

Bradbury portrays the future in a very interesting way. The firemen burndown buildings, instead of saving them. Bradbury portrayed what he thought the future would be like. He portrays a world where people who think for themselves and question are outcasts and fugitives. Fehrenheit 451 is a very interesting story, but it can be confusing at times, making the reader reread paragraphs to understand what is going on. Bradbury doesn't use complicated words, so the reader won't need a dictionary by their side. I like the lenghth of this book. It is only about 150 pages long. The story also moves at a very fast pace. The plot is set right from the beginning. I feel that the story is developed well until the end. The climax comes and the end is right after that. There are not many characters to get bogged down with either. I liked this because the whole book centered around one person, not many people showing many stories. Over all, Fehrenheit 451 is very well written and exciting. I would recomend this to anyone interested in sci-fi and fantasy books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I enjoyed the book very much and would definitly recomend it to others.

With the attempted eradication of books, people of this futuristic society are left empty, afraid, and become enveloped in materialistic and trivial exploits.

I personally loved this book, reading it just a day ago. I was entirely captivated with the plot, and the idea of censorship in the future, and that it was precise that it being a book would be censored is unbelievable. What possesses any person to censor a book that is so realistic it is amazing. To actually prove to the writer that his writings are so precise is astonishing. I would recommend this to anyone.

I read it at the same time I learned about my sense of self, and it fit into my life so well. It inspired me to become a writer, because of the way it affected me. Since then I've read it seven more times, and I'm surprised every time at how true it rings for me."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"According to the beliefs of some citizens who have posted their comments on this site, Fahrenheit 451 is about books. It seems like it is, but in its true form, the story about something deeper than books.The story is brilliant because it perfectly describes how willing people are to give up knowledge for something that is faster, easier. It also brings up the topic of control through the media. The government and media focus on happy, cheerful things (such as chasing Montag), rather than the war about to begin. This makes an excellent point about how we as a species are too willing to turn a blind eye to our problems, and allow someone else to fix them. This book does a fine job at shining new light on the saying &quot;Ignorance is bliss.&quot;This is a masterpiece of our time, and I suggest getting it from your public library, if you decide not to buy it. Either way, read it. Its got some insight that is very thought provoking~"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Wouldn't life be nice if we didn't have books? As a person who doesn't enjoy reading, this particular book caught my interest. Guy Montag, the main character of the story, is a book burner. In the society he lives in, the knowledge and ideas one gets from books is believed to be bad. As a fireman, Montag has the job of starting the fires rather than stopping them. This book forces you to think about what society would be like without books. Think of all the knowledge, ideas and pleasure they bring.Fahrenheit 451 makes you realize how much books really do contribute to everyday life. I would recommend this book to all who enjoy a good story and especially to those who don't appreciate reading. Maybe life with books isn't so bad after all."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is set in a terrifying world of the future. Books are not allowed. Firemen burn them and the homes of those who own them. The main character, Guy Montag, is one of these firemen. The joy of his life is setting books on fire until his loony 17-year-old neighbor suggests that maybe books are good things. She tells him of a time in the past when people read and were not punished for it. This gives Guy an unstoppable urge to see what's in one of those books. He reads one, and now he can't stop.While this was a great book with a very scary plot, I do have one complaint: Bradbury will often list completely random things for no apparent reason. They make no sense and make me wonder why they were included in the book. Other than that, the writing is wonderful. Bradbury's descriptions create vivid, sometimes spooky images of his characters and places such as the terrifying electronic hound. There's lots of great action and strange developments.Fahrenheit 451 is a wonderful work that I would recommend to just about anyone. It would be a great way to pass an afternoon. It's a very quick read that you could finish within a few hours. The writing, while confusing at times, is still very interesting. You are quickly brought into the story. Once again, this is a great book for all ages and an interesting view of the future from the past.-Fitzgerald FlabbermonkeyP.S. I'm actually over 12"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"At first I was roped into the idea of a book about book burning by fellow classmates that said it was a \\"cool\\" thing to read about. Then, later on I became enamored by this compelling story of the way others can affect the minds of the ignorant.The book begins with a section Bradbury entitles, \\"The Hearth and the Salamander.\\" The hearth being a symbol of the home and where the fire is kept/made in the home, the salamander being a symbol of fire immortality. The animal is believed by ancient cultures to be fire resistant. It can be burned and walk out without a mark made. This makes sense for Bradbury to use considering his whole book is shaped on the idea that the new futuristic firemen are unscarred by flames and find a great pleasure in creating them. So in turn the firemen of the story sport salamander logos on the arm of their uniforms. I loved this sort of symbolizing and the way Bradbury ties these facts into the rest of his story makes it a worthwhile reading. Throughout the rest of the book he takes the main character Guy Montag through a whirlwind of emotion and self exploration. After meeting a young girl by the name of Clarisse McClellan who is a self proclaimed individual Guy begins to view his life as he knows it in a different light. Clarisse is even seeing a psychologist for her \\"tendencies\\" as prescribed by society's fear of her lack of uniformity. She is a strong willed character that can open the eyes of any reader. I fell in love with her for her uniqueness as she reminded me somewhat of myself.The new future is a scary place as described by Bradbury. It makes the present and our issues with race and diversity a walk in the park as compared to society in the future. Close-mindedness sets in and people begin to close down and build walls around the passions of simple life. He shows here a real look into a frightening possibility of the way technology could affect every one of us. The idea of burning-books to me symbolizes the way media latched onto the artist and freethinker in all of us. It takes away from the beauty of really capturing a scene in a book that in some cases someone might never see in real life and it injects the fear that you might be blamed for this \\"instant gratification\\" that the book gives to you.I really loved the book and the way it took Montag on a journey to overpower his dedication to the claws of society and see past it's chains. He overcomes his enslavement to his boss and coworkers and begins to follow the path of the McClellans. With a little extra help from a friend he met beforehand Guy attacks the futuristic views and creates a full on war for freedom. Through fighting, and murders Montag ends his journies with the people he belongs with. He stumbles a bit along the way but ultimately ends with happiness in his heart.Anyone looking for a real eye-opener would enjoy this awesome fiction piece. It'll make you feel really lucky for the freedoms you have today, and look at the book you're holding in your hand in a whole new light. Aspects of family, and how cold family can be will shock you. Pick up Fahrenheit 451 you won\`t be disappointed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenheit 451 is the epidomy of Ray Bradbury books. This sci-fi book is a great description of a futuristic society. Guy Montag is your average guy, with an common job, he's a fireman. Though, in his society, books are banned and the fireman's job is to burn them. He lived a normal life, or so it was called, until a young lady opened his eyes to the past. In a desperate attempt to know more, he finds a professor. He finds then who he truly is and follows his destiny.Ray Bradbury is one of the best sci-fi authors, in my opinion. In this book he created a futuristic society down to its individual laws and customs. His descriptions of the flames are as if they are alive like you and I. In my own mind I could see the flames burning as if they were right in front of me. His descriptions of society are a great way to show how nave humans can be.Though I had some trouble understanding this book, it's plot was very drawn out and not always clear. Overall, I enjoyed this book over &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;, because at least this one had a single plot line and easily understandable themes. It is a must-read book for those of you who like sci-fi books that can change course in the blink of an eye."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is an amazing story about a man named Guy Montag, living in a dystopia. In this crazy world, books are not allowed, and instead of having firemen stop fires, they make them. Guy is a fireman who loves to burn books. But one day he meets a young 17 year old who seems insane. But after many long conversations, he realizes the horror of burning someone else's work of art, and his/her ideas. He then sets out on a mission to get the books back to the people. But all the while, Bradbury is able to weave amazing, but confusing, passages into his story. His crazy use of metaphors and his symbolism makes it hard to understand, but after reading it again, it creates images in your mind. This is the kind of book that you discuss with your friends. The complex theme and plot makes it a great read. Although this book may not be suitable for young children, this is a great story for people from 8th grade up.

However, I was confused bythe loaded metaphors and symbolism. Some createdvivid pictures, but others did not make any sense.

Ray Bradbury's use of similes and metaphors really related to what he was trying to explain. The fascinating circumstances about Farenheit 451 is very weird and exciting at the same time. The fact that Bradbury has taken the present time, when he wrote the book, and changed the roles of the people and firemen to which he believes the future will be like is so engaging. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I would have most likely never read Fahrenhiet 451 on my own accord.

Even now the book holds the same sort of problem to us as it did back when it was published. I can see our country heading down the same path as the country in the book did.Bradbury's use of metaphors, similes, and other &quot;smilely face tricks&quot; are very well written. For example, instead of using the word &quot;hose&quot;, Bradbury described the hose as a great black python.

Ray Bradbury made this book very interesting especially with his similies and metaphors. In order to get anything out of this book the reader really had to read closely to enderstand what Bradbury was trying to communicate to the reader. Also, the reader had to use their common sence to understand the story, because it is very different from our world today. The scary part of the story, was how it was written fifty years ago, but the reader can see how the society of today is becoming more and more like the book.Amagine a world were reading certain books ment that you were breaking the law, with possible punishment of death. This was the world Guy Montag lives in. He was a fireman that started fires. In the story's day and age this was a common job. Houses that contained books were houses that needed to be burnt down. Montage enjoyed his job because he did what he was told, and never had to think outside of the box. However, his thinking began when he met a girl, named Clarisse, who made him think outside of the box with three words.

Whether you hated it or loved it when you read it in high school, or even if you didn't read it in high school, it is an outstanding story and Bradbury's writing is as smooth and clean as always."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This slim little novella is a rollicking story about Guy Montag, a \\"firefighter\\" of the future who loves his job. His job is not to put out fires, but to set them. Montag and his comrades burn books for a living. It doesn't matter what type of books, they have all been targeted for incineration. Apparently, in the America of Guy's time, the people, and especially the government, have decided that books are a bad deal. Books make people think and agonize over choices, which is a bad thing. The real goal of society should be happiness for everyone. Since no one can be happy if they are always worrying about things they read, the solution is clear. Unfortunately, many people seem to have a problem with this, at least on a subconscious level. Suicides in Guy's world are sky high, so high that they have special teams of medics go around and suck pills and other nasty poisons out of the people who have decided they don't want to live anymore. The government does try to placate the masses through mind numbing television and radio shows (see Guy's wife, Mildred). People that refuse to go along with the program are sent away, or worse. Guy wakes up when he meets a young neighbor who turns him on to the way of experiencing life. Guy eventually rebels and ends up as part of a group who memorize books to preserve them for future generations.I'm leaving out lots of details to the book with this description. After all, I don't want to spoil the whole thing for you. What seems to be more important about this book is its value to today's world. Although written years ago, some of Bradbury's details are amazingly prescient. The omnipresence of television and other means of electronic control certainly ring true today. Also, the censoring of books continues unabated even now, with every type of group clamoring for some type of control over what the rest of us read. Certainly, burning books of every sort couldn't be far away. Since most people read nothing but pap these days anyway, I can imagine Plato and Milton going up in flames soon enough. Who wants to read that boring stuff when you can watch TV or go to a movie? Soon after this comes what Bradbury refers to as, \\"the tyranny of the masses.\\" If enough people don't want to do something, you better jump on the bandwagon too. Try going to work and speaking out against multiculturalism and see what happens. Throw out your TV set and tell people about doing so. You'll be branded a freak and avoided like the plague. People are cattle, plain and simple. Bradbury does seem to have some hope for our sorry condition, as can be seen at the end of the book. However, getting to that state will take some time, I'm afraid."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What would society be like if books were banned and burned? Eventually people would lose the ability to think for themselves and they would lose control of their own lives. I'm passive and a coward for the most part, but this book is a true call to arms to protect books at all costs if there is ever a movement to ban and burn. I liked Bradbury's style, this book was a pleasure to read and will be a treasure to share with others. After reading this, don't forget the lessons within. Books are vital, but as an avid reader you know that already. The key is to share the message with others. Happy reading...."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Many writers have been called ahead of their time. Raymond Bradbury is a prime example of this. His novel, Fahrenheit 451, is far and away the most original book this reviewer has ever read, not to mention one of the best written.Bradbury has a unique style which allows the reader to picture the story in their mind in the style of a David Fincher movie. Chuck Palahnuk, author of Fight Club, shares this same quality.The most striking aspect of Fahrenheit 451 is by far its plot: firefighters who burn houses, rather than put out the fires. (...) the novel itself becomes hard to put down. As the reader follows the movements and thoughts of Guy Montag, rogue firefighter who dares to read books, making him a hypocrite. Montag's progression from book burner to advocater of reading, to fugitive on the run from a world who decides that he has learned too much is as strange as it is heroic.Bradbury's unique take on the future is common only with the views of George Orwell, author of 1984. In both of these novels, the government decides that it has had enough of the uniqueness that makes America so great, so \\"Big Brother\\" must eliminate. Despite this similarity, Fahrenheit manages to distance itself with the use of censorship. Censorship as it is is out of control in the United States, and Bradbury's tale is hopefully not prophetic. Overall, few books are as captivating and original as Ray Bradbury's beautiful Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I hate science fiction books.So why am I giving this book 5 stars? Because it's simply wonderful, that's why. You won't get that feeling from the first couple pages, but if you stick with it, I swear, you will. The end of the book is best. The thoughts that Bradbury puts into his character's minds are so beautiful, sharp, and alive. I guess I like this book because even though it is supposively sci-fi, it's REAL too. The emotions are real, and even the setting &amp; society are familiar. It's wonderful. I started out hating it. Don't give up on it! Keep reading. I'm a sophomore in high school . . . but everyone, regardless of age should read this."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am currently reading this book for high school. This review is to all you kids out there aswell as parents and interested buyers. THIS BOOK IS ALOT BETTER THEN YOU THINK. Parents who are trying to get their kids to read this, tell them about my review. I agree with &quot;a reader from Washinton, USA&quot;. It is similar to the Giver. The book may start out slow in the beginning but as the story starts to unfold it becomes fast paced and fun to read. It has its &quot;whats going to happen next&quot; moments. Its about a Fireman named Guy Montag. He isnt the normal fireman. Now fireman are used to start fires. They burn books, but not only that, they burn the houses that they are in and people that they are with. Montag loves his job. He enjoys seeing the books go up in flames. But he meets a girl, his new neighbor, Clarisse McClellan. She is a strange girl with crazy ideas in her head. But he learns from her. He thinks. For once in many years he thinks. Montag steals a book from a house that he must burn. He now realizes burning is not the way.Ok. Recommend it as a school reading book, not as a free time reading book. That just wont work. Let your kid pick their own freetime reading book. They wont enjoy a book if their parents try to force them into reading it. I'm a kid so I would know, and please, dont try to argue. The book is a fun book to read as a school book for a book report, reading log, summer reading log or things like that."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"IN this story, moralist Ray Bradbury tells us about a country in which books are illegal to read or posses, and firemen aren't employed to save houses, but to burn books. Guy Montag a fireman, and the story's protagonist, enjoys coming home every night form the firehouse waiting for a call, playing poker and telling crude jokes to his companions (who all looked exactly like him). He also enjoys the destruction and burning of the books and he is constantly bathed in a perfume of kerosene. Coming home form work he would often feel as if someone had been on this one particular corner, waiting for him, but he never stopped and looked around. He was like all the other folks, in that he would just keep going ahead to where he was going, not looking at what he was walking past. Except one night he stopped and met a girl who taught him of the past where folks were allowed to think and to read and to have original ideas for themselves, and the ability to write them down and share them with others. As the story progresses we go deeper into the world of Guy Montag, meeting his drug-abusing wife and her \\"family\\" on the telescreens. We discover the ways that the society works, about how people are impersonal, not knowing their own neighbors, and how the television thinks for everyone so that they don't have to. This book parallels other books depicting futures where it is near impossible to be a free-thinking individual, such as 1984 and brave new world. Also it resembles present day America, even more so now then when it was originally written. Ray Bradbury's easy to read, yet descriptive text makes the story easy to read and hard to put down. The plot thickens, twists and sickens with every page. It is a warning that everyone, especially now in a world that grows more and more like Mr. Montag's, should heed to."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book in two days, and was focused throughout, inhaling Bradburys words and letting the book have its effect on my mind.What the book is missing in a THICK plot it gains in its writing style. Bradbury is simply a literary genius, and post-modern Marxist environments are his playground. The way that Bradbury depicts the forest which Montag enters after leaving the river is extremely surreal, if not surrealism in its nature.What I mean by &quot;What the book is missing in a THICK plot,&quot; is that Bradbury could have developed the story in a more progressive fashion, rather than leaving out some important aspects of Montag's world. The overall politics of the time in which this is supposed to take place are not even present in the novel. The way in which the society went from not being interested in books, to burning them also seems to be under-expressed.Criticizing an artist is something that I have a hard time doing, for when a writer writes, he writes, and that is all. Bradbury wrote, and this book is him, with its perceived flaws and all, I think that it is a masterpiece in a poetic sense, not in the sense that it has become a staple of highschool literature.I will put it this way, if you like the colorful environments of Allen Ginsbergs poetry, then you will surely enjoy at least the aesthetic qualities of Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Only Bradbury's prose, terrifying and lovely, could bring this story to its rightful place as a literary masterpiece. His narrative of Dystopian society, distressing in its reality, reflects not only the lunatic consumerism of Western nations but the fallacy of freedom in a democracy. The hero, Guy Montag, wanders from uneasy fireman to eventual pariah; the discovery of something larger than himself, the wisdom of centuries contained within the very books he doused with flame, ignites his drive to discover that the world has far more to offer than bread and circuses. Moving like a ghost through his own home, ignored by a self-focused wife addicted to narcotics and electronic stimulus, Montag is painfully aware of the void between himself and the masses. This loss of intimacy, both within one's personal life and again in that most intimate of contact -- reading another's thoughts from an open book -- is the harbinger of man's fall from enlightenment. The world of Guy Montag does not begin upon opening this dark wonder, and there is no prophecy in its pages. The story is alive, here, now, and has been since the onslaught of corporate propaganda and our apathetic acceptance of plastic culture. Bradbury's subject is not that we are advancing into intellectual oblivion; it is, instead, that mankind is complacent enough to let it happen."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; describes a society where knowledge is controlled by book-burning 'firemen'. This government-implemented censorship starts as 'political correctness' -- upset people deface controversial books. Then government decides to pacify society by simplifying education and eliminating books. Noncontroversial interactive televised plays replace books as entertainment, neighbors inform on neighbors possessing books, and firemen incinerate houses containing books.Guy Montag, a fireman, meets a young woman who chides him for living but not experiencing life. Guy examines his life. His relationship with his wife Mildred is remote and cold -- they have nothing in common. (Mildred spends *all* of her time in the 'living room', a room with an interactive television screen covering each of three walls. Mildred sleeps in a separate bed with 'seashell' radio earpieces in her ears.) During one firecall Guy observes a homeowner herself light the firemen's kerosene and then perish in the flames -- Guy cannot understand the woman's protest. And upon reflection Guy cannot understand why books must be burnt. His attitude alienates his fellow firemen, who threaten and then arrest him. Guy escapes and seeks refuge in the countryside.&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; somewhat resembles Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot; and George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;. &quot;Brave New World&quot; uses eugenic control and the drug 'soma' to pacify society. &quot;1984&quot; uses ever-present surveillance, propaganda and torture to pacify society. &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; simplifies education and bans books (i.e., eliminates controversial thinking and discussion), substitutes interactive television (e.g., video games and the Internet), and portrays neighbors as informants to be avoided -- everyone is isolated in their home. The &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; societal portrayal seems less sinister, but it is easier to implement and therefore more dangerous.There *are* many similarities between &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; society and today's United States urban society. And &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is a beautifully-written book suitable to read aloud. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This story is a warning against reliance on media and entertainment and government for information and leisure. The Parlors are symbolic of modern man's addiction to TV and the internet. The vapid importance of American Idol and such are lamented by Montag at the house party. When Montag is being chased by the hound, the network goes live to cover it - very much like today's coverage of police chases. As Neil Peart of Rush said; \\"Hidden camera coverage from the crime scene to the courtroom.\\" These warnings should still be heeded today."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I think his writings are amazing. I know many differ on that opinion but I truly enjoy his works. 451 is my favorite of his writings. I think it is fascinating to see how much the time influenced him. How so many things you see in the movie are now in creation like the wall tv (our flat screen now). This book was required reading in my youth and I feel it should be required today as well. It's a view of a world which could easily occur if we allow our rights to be flushed basically. How we could easily fall into a dystopian world if we become complacent and lack knowledge. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is a Great book. Should be a must read for anyone who thinks that the government should have more power. Don't take your freedoms for granted."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Montag is a fireman whose job it is to set fire to books.Montag roars out of his fire station in a wheeled flame thrower to burn the ever scarce book collections of nonconformist bookworms. One day he meets an odd girl who asks questions that force Montag to introspect and look beyond the limitations imposed by his job. The girl asks Montag whether he is happy and then disappears.The future wages war on the printed word to resist excessive thought. A long attention span it seems is the true enemy of the state. The euphoric electronic haze that society demands to keep happy ultimately serves the state's purpose. The war on books began not as a state mandate but as a devolution of the soul. The Bible has been banned and Jesus made into a peppermint colored advertising icon. First literary digests, pulp fiction, and then the ubiquitous interactive talking walls peopled with idiotic families opiated a population that wanted... indeed...demanded immediate gratification. The state has no problem exerting control after that.A woman chooses to be immolated with her books. The book pyre lights the dark recesses of Montag's kerosene soaked soul as he recounts the girl's question... are you happy Montag? Montag begins a journey of self discovery as he steals a book.As a fugitive, Montag sees his unfortunate double killed on TV as he seeks refuge with outcasts in the forests surrounding the city he has escaped. The show must go on and the networks demand a good ending no matter what the cost. Montag's wife betrays him after he confronts her and her friends with the question are you happy?The crumbling, oblivious society Montag protects is quickly flinging itself apart with suicide, abortion and mass ignorance about hostile foreign countries struggling with poverty. The introspective girl is run over by murderous joy riders...later Montag narrowly escapes the same fate. Ever passing jets hearken of an incipient war.It is remarkable how time can make a book even more prescient than it once was. As I commute to work in Germany, I see the isolated and lonely crouched over social media and muffled into oblivion by large headphones while rocking gently to the train. When Bradbury wrote this book society was struggling with the implications of a new medium called TV. Newton Minow,FCC commissioner during the sixties, called TV the vast \\"wasteland.\\" How true and yet how understated today. Social media is not only an opiate but it is a source of monitoring making it far more ominous than TV or pulp fiction.It seems that the short attention span Montag enforced with his flamethrower served the same purpose as the \\"newspeak\\"-truncated language- that Orwell's state in \\"1984\\" used to protect itself from accountability. The flamethrower state had it easy at the start, it just let the culture do the trick. The chatting idiotic wall families did the rest as Bradbury tells us in the book...P 53. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I admit I have never read this important book. Not even for school. Of course I knew what it was about because it is so iconic. A society where reading books is illegal and punishable. The way these criminal readers are punished? Burn not only their books, but their entire houses. Eeek.The story takes place mostly in the head of the main character Guy Montag. He is a fireman in a dystopian, alternate society. Fireman are responsible for burning things that are dangerous, case in point, books. But Guy has an awakening of conscience after meeting Clarissa, his teenage neighbor, who asks him questions that he is now forced to think about whether he likes it or not and after a woman decides to burn with her books.The story is a great deal of Montag's thoughts as he deals with his new views. They are written as a stream of conscience and there is very little container, although I could see the little house where he and his wife lived and his neighborhood and even the woods where he sought refuge. Some of the details were confusing to me at times, but they didn't take away from the context of the story.Bradbury's style is staccato and reminded me of the militant society in which the story took place. This made for powerful thoughts and ideas. It is emotional and sometimes just downright heartbreaking.The narrator is good, but I felt his voice and language a bit forced at times. I also think that for me, an audio book was the way to go for Fahrenheit 451. I'm not sure I would have been able to get out of it what I did had I been reading it myself.I can't say I enjoyed this book, but I'm glad I gave it a try. I find myself thinking about that alternate world, a world without books because different ideas are dangerous, because different views lead to trouble. Burn out anything that is politically incorrect or the least bit offensive and soon you have a sterile setting. In this world, only being entertained and pursuing pleasures are encouraged. The pursuit of philosophy will just make people unhappy because they will see how unfair life is.I like the character Clarissa, the young girl who had her mind and her eyes open. She is innocent and represents that in the way she asks questions and daydreams and wonders. I thought the wife Millie interesting because although it is apparent that she is unhappy, that she is aware something is wrong with this existence, she shuts it away and pretends everything is fine.I liked afterward by Bradbury who talks of editing and likens it to the reasons given in his book. He quotes \\"There is more than one way to burn a book.\\" He also wrote a play re-visiting the characters of F-451 and said the one who revealed the most is Baty, the Fire Chief. Baty, it turns out, in this play has thousands of books. BUT, he never reads them. The law states you cannot read them, but it doesn't state you cannot have them. He diabolically lets them die because they are never read.This wasn't the easiest book to get through for me, but it is an important one that everybody, especially book lovers, should give a try."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I've known the title for a while and with the recent death of the author decided to finally read the book; very glad I did. \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" explores a society without books - hard for me to imagine so I'm grateful that Bradbury did. On display is a war torn society where massive wall sized televisions take the place of reading and in-depth human engagement. A society populated with a disempowered citizenry, some unwilling to think for themselves, others unable not to. For me, the book is, at its core, a tale of resistance; demonstrated by Montag's instinctive urges to find out more about the history of book burning and the subsequent actions he undertakes to change things. If resistance is at the core, a collective unconsciousness and apathy are the rings that contain it. Throughout the novel Bradbury contends that the state of affairs is not something that was forced upon the people by a Big Brother apparatus; the people simply allowed it happen. They didn't put up much of a fight at all, being too distracted by the pursuit of happiness to realize the erosion of freedom. Collective memory and its importance in sustaining a viable future plays a large role in the novel and reinforces the notion that what we don't remember we're bound to repeat.\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a superb read; its classic status solid. I'm not sure if it remains on many high schools' reading lists but this is one that stands the test of time. Engaging, well written and aptly imagined; highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This was one of the only books I was forced to read as a child in school that I truly loved. I love to read but I find I often hated the books selected by schools for children to read. Considering how dull most of the literature is that children are made to read in high school it tends to make me wonder how I, and others, maintain our love of literature.But Ray Bradbury's world and his writing style kept me hooked and made me a fan over fifteen years ago and I am still a fan of his work now. I am saddened that he is gone now but his writing will love on forever as he was our generation's H. G. Wells.This book was surprisingly accurate to the world of today, to political correctness run rampant, to the opressiveness of censorshhip, and to our shallow obsession with better technology.

In a day when all houses are fire proof one must take different measures if they wish to get rid of things that the government bans. He and the fire department are in charge of making sure everyone follows the rules. This means no books, and those who have books must be punished. Guy Montag enjoys starting fires to burn the houses with books. He enjoys the heat, the smell of kerosine. He does not question the reason why he must burn the books he just does it, until he meets a 17 year old girl who moves in next door to him and a professor who no longer teaches but hides in fear like everyone else. The girl is different and she makes him think about the world around him and how it got to be the way it is.I really enjoyed listening to this the descriptions were amazing. There is nothing like a good book burning when described with such beauty. This is the first Ray Bradbury book I have heard/read. I have to admit I'm surprised I didn't find him sooner. Guy Montag is an interesting man who starts out just like everyone else in the book he doesn't think for himself. He doesn't love. He doesn't feel anything. The world Bradbury creates is so like our own yet so different. I wonder if we are moving towards a world like the one in Fahrenheit 451 or if books will survive in this area of immediate pleasure. The characters in here were vibrant and full of life until the very end. The mechanical hound with eight legs is such a strange hound we wonder how it can be a hound. The fire engine named after the mythical salamander that breathed fire is such an interesting image. I don't imagine wheels but legs that crawl down the roads to start the next fire and then back to the station.

Ray Bradbury does not describe the story very elaborate and and so e.g. it is very difficult to understand what the people are talking about.Furthermore, the tension the fireman acts with doesn't get clear in the description by Bradbury. This is a very bad style of telling a story and makes me think the author himself didn't like the story.The dialogues between the fireman, Montag, and the girl he meets on the street are forced and do not seem vivid.

It was basically don't watch TV, read books. The world will be lost without them! And the whole thing about the stupid Harvard degrees on the railroad tracks was cheesy and stupid. If you can memorize a piece of literature so easily, what's the point for books? I compared this book to Orwell's 1984, which I read last year, and there was no comparison. This book was not nearly as chilling and thought provoking and failed horribly in getting it's point across. With all the talk of firemen burning books, you were tempted to put a match to this one. I also disagree with a major point of the book that implies with the loss of literature comes the loss of morality. The book took place in the future but not that far in the future. I got the idea that it took place only one or two generations after it was written. The morality of the world could not be lost in that amount of time."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury in my opinion is extremely confusing and difficult to read. The setting is in a futuristic world, where books are banned and anyone who is caught with books are prosecuted. The main character, Montag, is a fireman whose job is to burn books. The world he lives in is plain and dull, and he becomes desperate for something exciting, so he begins to read the books that he burns. Once caught by his fellow fireman, Montag must flee from his home and run away to escape imprisonment or possibly death. In the book, some of the concepts are hard to understand, and the futuristic conceptions in the book may confuse the reader. The vocabulary isn't too difficult, but there are sections of the book that may set the reader off track. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone younger than the seventh grade level, and I would recommend this book to people who like science-fiction.

In a future world, books are banned and firemen actually set fires instead of extinguishing them. The state exercises a form of social control through controlling what sort of information people have access to. It turns out that not all books are banned, only those that we would today consider \\"great works\\" - Plato, Shakespeare, The Bible, Darwin, etc. For me one of the biggest surprises about Fahrenheit 451 was the rationale that was offered for the burning of those books. In a nutshell, they offended politically correct sensibilities and the authorities felt that they would undermine the social cohesion. This expunging of the classics from the culture has an uncanny resonance with the attempts over past few decades to expunge them from the undergraduate liberal arts curriculum. And rationale is also similar: these books are not \\"diverse\\" enough and may offend the sensibilities of an ever-increasing list of \\"minorities.\\" It is hard not to wonder if a milder, softer version of dystopian future that Bradbury was worried about in the early 1950s has not in fact arrived.Bradbury's writing and ideas are somewhere between those of George Orwell and Philip K. Dick. His style is very engaging, and even poetic. His writing is at its best when one of his characters engages in a prolonged monolog. However, the plot development could use some improvement. There is very little in terms of transition from one scene to the next, and most scenes are overly compressed. It is very hard to follow the plot developments at times. Nonetheless, Bradbury is a wonderful stylist and unlike much of science fiction this book is a pleasure to read on a purely literally level as well as for its sweeping ideas.As a last note, I found it incredibly ironic that I read this book on Kindle. Based on this alone I am fairly optimistic that reading and great books will not only survive but in fact thrive well into the 21st century."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"***This review may contain spoilers**Readers (including myself initially) have praised Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 (hereafter F451) as an uncannily prophetic depiction of our current society and its alarming (no pun intended) future. Of course it is; all futuristic novels ultimately are. With only the present as a frame of reference, science fiction writers almost always illustrate a future stunningly similar to what they are living in now, except for a few described technological, social, or legal \\"advances\\" purportedly made to keep society \\"happy\\". Bradbury is no exception. In his future, books are illegal, banned, and burned because they \\"confuse\\" people and make people \\"unhappy\\". However, F451 is not a simplistic treatise on how getting everyone to read again will automatically improve society. Professor Faber says as much to fireman-turned-protestor Guy Montag. In its way, F451 argues that creating a perfect personal utopia is an unrealistic and actually deleterious societal goal. Instead, I believe F451 argues that a continuous evolutionary improvement of society truly matters, and that can only occur with the perpetuation of thoughts and ideas.In Guy Montag's society, people seek blissfull. sedentary, entertainment as life's goal. Thinking, as exemplified through book readiing, threatens that goal. So firemen like Montag actually START fires at bibliophiles' residences to stop those purveyors of literary thought. But not everyone has been lulled into hedonistic trances, like Guy's \\"media zombie\\" wife Mildred. Clarisse McClellan wasn't. Neither was Professor Faber. Both iconoclasts help develop Guy's own latent dissatisfaction with society's anti-intellectualism and keep ideas alive. His opponents are technology itself (symbolized by the Mechanical Hound) and society itself (as embodied - a bit artificially in my opinion, but still effectively, by Captain Beatty, Guy's firehouse chief). Dangerous and seductive as these enemies are, somehow Guy resists their tempting entreaties to forget this snobbish foolishness and preserve the stable status quo, and remain a subversive protestor.Guy escapes the sterile but deadly city and barely escapes annihilation as war presumably wipes out mankind. In the country, he encounters a group of displaced intellectuals and artisans led by Granger. It is Granger that explains that despite the inevitable destruction of a society that refused to develop any further, it is up to individuals to think, discuss, and plan to keep society going and evolving. He alludes to the myth of the phoenix that burns itself up every 500 years but resurrects itself from the ashes a little wiser. Furthermore, Granger explains the difficult, counterintuitive requirement that conveyers of ideas - books and men - are not really important. Books and men can be burnt, but not ideas. Men must become ambulatory books so that they can pass the information on to a new generation. Fireproof ideas must go on.Personally, F451 is an affirmation of the indispensability of liberal arts. Many have often denounced liberal arts as impractical, unproductive, and unrewarding. F451 demonstrates that is certainly not the case, even through the dichotomy of fire. Fire ignorantly left unchecked symbolizes extinction. Fire carefully banked up, fed, and distributed properly (as the mythological Titan Prometheus found) symbolizes knowledge that keeps society alive and growing."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Received as a gift, the 50th anniversary edition has some very interesting extras including an afterword from Bradbury, a coda with additional comments from him, and a Q&A; with Del Rey. Ray Bradbury is definitely one of the sci-fi masters from the 50s, and his interviews 50 years after the book is written demonstrate how much he believes that original works reflect the timeframe and mindset in which it was written - and more importantly that they should not be tweaked or edited to reflect changing values and mores.I was amazed at how prophetic his novel is, for it is clear that for many readers nowadays, a graphic novel is the only form of \\"reading\\" they have time for. He has his own version of bluetooth, interactive videos, how consuming TV has become, the short attention span of the public looking for instant gratification, and the ability of the press to provide their version of the \\"truth\\".I think that reading this book again some 20 years after originally reading it has made this book even more memorable than when I was a teenager! Every sci-fi fan should do themselves a favor and read this classic again!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As Montag's fire captain tells him, \\"You ask why to a lot of things and you wind up very unhappy indeed.\\" An important difference between this futuristic society created in 1953 and George Orwell's world of 1984 is that Orwell's government was top-down while all the minorities (of every race, color and creed) in Bradbury's dystopia got together to burn everything that offended them. In this case, lack of tolerance for differing voices led to no voices at all--democracy has eaten itself by misunderstanding itself."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a marvelous example of cautionary literature, exploring a future that was possible in 1953 and that while not yet realized, has only grown more possible with the passage of time. The advent of incredible technology and the resulting loss of attention span, individualism, and creativity is the most frightening aspect of the book not only because it corresponds to modern life, but because it results in self-censorship out of insecurity and fear. There are many more themes and motifs packed in this novel--some subtle and frightening, others obvious but thought-provoking--all of which are communicated masterfully by Bradbury's prose and characterization.Bradbury packs a great deal of meaning into a relatively short book, and he explores many nuances of humanity from human nature itself to technology to knowledge to conformity. These themes are all interwoven such that they lose none of their potency; they coexist perfectly and build upon one another to form a haunting picture of humanity. Throughout the novel this occurs with the principal character, Guy Montag, serving as the \\"normal\\" human viewpoint, and his interactions showing how human nature conflicts with technology, conformity, and itself. As the novel progresses we see numerous aspects of human nature arise within this character: blind contentment, conformity, curiosity, rage, frustration, self-preservation, a desire to rebel, peace, realization, and introspection to name a few.The most prominent element of the novel, quite predictably, is fire; it is the focal point of the novel and the rope which ties all of the threads of theme and motif together. We are introduced to the story with a conflagration that enthralls Montag, then still a loyal fireman. Bradbury goes to great length to describe the beauty of fire's destructive power, in the literal sense of the bright, unpredictable flames and metaphorically with its ability to change whatever it touches. As we progress through the novel fire takes on a more malevolent character, stifling creativity and thought and destroying anything potentially offensive or differentiating by sending countless tomes filled with fantasy and philosophy to oblivion. Fire then turns upon its previous masters, burning the fire chief Beatty to death, destroying one of the nightmarish mechanical hounds, and blasting a city off the map. As the novel concludes the wandering scholars note that fire will cleanse the filth it created, and open the way for the return of critical thought and individualism.Structurally and stylistically the novel performs as wonderfully as it does thematically. Bradbury divided the novel into only three chapters, but each one is, as a result, more thematically consistent and the titles more representative of their content. \\"The Hearth and the Salamander\\" covers Montag's career, home life, and how his confrontation with Clarisse drastically changed both, \\"The Sieve and the Sand\\" shows how reading without thinking is akin to trying to hold and in a sieve, and \\"Burning Bright\\" likens humanity to a phoenix: we burn bright and quick, but are always reborn from the ashes. Each segment also corresponds to a different stage in Montag's development, with the first being his initial disbelief and curiosity, the second being anger and frustration, and the third being pity and realization. The style is fairly uniform throughout the novel, conveying a sense of futility and hopelessness until the final pages of the book, where it is noted that after the cleansing fire of war humanity has another chance to try and do things right.Fahrenheit 451 is undoubtedly a classic and Ray Bradbury a master of the written word and science fiction. His ingenuity in crafting a dystopian future and his ever present and painfully truthful themes keep the reader enthralled, and the style forces the reader to feel the weight of censorship and ignorance. In short, Fahrenheit 451 is a book that every person should read, not only for its merits as a novel, but for its applicability in our modern age of instant gratification.-Alicia, Dante, Kevin, Lucas, Sara"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature where paper combusts and is the perfect name for this classic tale where firemen don't put out fires but they set them! Guy Montag is such a fireman. In a world where book are banned to the point of burning all of them and people are fed what to believe through government controlled videos, we find all sorts of parallels to our current lives.Montag, the main focus of the story, meets a neighbor who has him questioning all he believes and yes, he finally steals a book from one of his burning gigs. It is the turning point in his life. (Reminds me of a cop who told me he read Lord of the Rings 'cuz all the hippies he busted had a copy.) Montag then reads some poetry to his wife's friends and she promptly turns him in! His subsequent race for freedom is quite revealing.I read this book more than 40 years ago, when it was not yet a classic. I found the book a little confusing as Bradbury can be at times, but a quick read with some outstanding images that still haunt me today. My terror as a young, voracious reader at the thought of no more books ever was overwhelming. The thought that the government would kill someone innocent just so the public would know it was impossible to run was stunning. But that wall size television? Boy do I want it, only I want it in the form of a computer.I give this book thumbs up for images. While the story may move a little slow in the beginning and may be a bit confusing, the overall book reads quickly. The writing is good and the characters are well done. This may not be a book to give to teenagers, but anyone with more experience in the world will find the book fascinating, not just for the story but for the foretelling of so much from the distant 1950's when it was first written."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"There really is not need to review this book as everyone pretty much knows what its about and there are so many other reviews. The reason I don't love this book is that really its more of an idea book. I mean its a book you read and think you're a bit smarter for reading it. And on many levels that would be enough because most books have nothing to offer. Only thing is, this book isn't so much fun to read. Its more of a book that should have just been a short story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a book written years ago, but one which still resonates today. Have you ever wondered what life would be like without books? Or with the distribution of power blown out of proportion by the few people who can control the words? This idea is one that Ray Bradbury explores in his science fiction story. Taking place in a future where books are banned, this book is written from the perspective of a fireman whose job is to burn books whenever they are reported, along with any uncooperative book owners. The fireman, Guy Montag is eventually confronted with the insanity of his society when he meets a teenage girl who vividly describes a time when people could read freely, and were unafraid of their own thoughts. When Montag then comes into contact with a professor, planning for a future where books would be allowed once again, Montag realizes and harnesses his desire to live in this future.Beatty, the fire chief, had just finished bombarding Montag with quotes from various books and poems that were unknown to the rest of the firemen. Montag's feelings are unsettled after this incident, \\"Montag's head whirled sickeningly. He felt beaten unmercifully on brow, eyes, nose, lips, chin, on shoulders, on upflailing arms. He wanted to yell, \\"No! Shut up, you're confusing things, stop it!\\" Beatty's graceful fingers thrust out to seize his wrist\\" (107). This quote demonstrates one major theme of the book - the power of words. Beatty, unlike the firemen of lower rank, has had the privilege to read many books containing knowledge -- and therefore power -- because of Beatty's ability to take the words out of context and make them support his own ideas. This theme also illustrates a tactic many leaders use to control and rule their followers - keeping the knowledge for themselves so that the followers are not think too much for themselves and possibly rebel.I connected with this book on several levels, including the plot and the deeper messages contained in the story. Bradbury's choice to use Montag -- the book burner -- as the protagonist helps the reader understand the step-by-step transformation from mindless compliance with authority to independent thought and finally to a proactive decision that his society needed change. At first, I was surprised and even a little disbelieving at the ignorance of the citizens in the town; but as the book progressed I became more captivated by the methods of the selfish and controlling leaders. In this way, Fahrenheit 451 reminds me of Animal Farm by George Orwell. In both books, the leaders have been granted surprising power by their submissive followers, a power that comes mainly from words. Both books also raise questions about how tyrannical leaders control their followers, as well as why and how followers might allow themselves to be controlled by these rulers. On a more simple level, Fahrenheit 451 is also a compelling story with strong characters and plot. In particular, Bradbury affected me with sensitive descriptions of Montag, including the relationship with his wife. This relationship was an effective method of personalizing Montage and giving dimension to his transformation from blind follower to a potential activist. Over the course of the book, we get to see just how much Montag has changed or perhaps we learn how different husband and wife always were.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed Animal Farm by George Orwell or The Book Thief by Markus Zusak because of the authors' similar abilities to blend powerful ideas, and set these themes inside strong plots."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Upon reading this book, it occurred to me just how much it gets quoted. The reasons for all the quoting is because of its continued relevance in spite of its age.The novel depicts a future filled with censorship and the \\"media\\" telling everyone what to worry about- and the worries which have absolutely no consequence. Sound familiar? A little too familiar. I dare say that we seem to be heading towards an age where ignorance is not merely bliss but that knowledge is loudly discouraged. I can only hope I'm wrong.A great dystopian and a much deserved classic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In the world presented by Mr. Bradbury, books are illegal and all books here are from older times, people now hide and hoard them, and if someone is caught with books, their house is set on fire by firemen - the very same people that once prevented fires instead of starting them. Spare time is spent watching TV instead of reading, and the TVs are huge, taking up an entire wall. Some people try to have a TV room (TVs on all walls) for total immersion, which is what the main character's wife wants even though they cannot afford it all. Rather eye-opening and a appropriate commentary on books vs TV."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"One of those rares books which you can read over and over again"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book brings up points about the control that our government could have over us if we let it.

Guy Montag is a fireman who actually starts fires instead of extinguishing them. 451 degrees is the temperature that paper burns and that number is patched on Guy Montags sleeve and on his helmet to let everyone know he is fireman. This book starts off really slow, and I had a lot of trouble staying focused and wanting to keep reading. Once the book picks up and gets into some of the more interesting parts, you actually want to keep reading more. I feel that is one of the only flaws to this book but if you have the patience to get through the beginning then I definitely say read this book. It really makes you think about what is actually happeningBFont"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you wish to read an Orwellian, dystopian novel set in the future, read the novels by George Orwell himself, 1984 and Animal Farm. Undoubtedly, Fahrenheit 451 is a classic and I guess required reading, if only for completenes, but it certainly failed to hold my interest. I found the writing to be a little more fluffy than what I find enjoyable and the plot is remarkably thin, unlike the richly constructed 1984 and the taut Animal Farm. I'm afraid I can't call myself a Bradbury fan just yet."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"fahrenheit 451 starts off well, but definately doesnt end that way. besides the fact the some characters seem unreal and are impossible to relate to, at one point in the book montag and his friend have an incredibly insightful talk and end it in an idiotic plan, but i won't go into that too much. the end is boring and close to impossible to get through. read it, but be prepared."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The story of Fahrenheit 451 is a complicated one that tries to explain the future in an odd way that is not often expressed. It brings you into the warped mind of a fireman, who burns books rather than puts fires out. This book proves to be very novel and is interesting at times, but at other points it just seems boring and outright ridiculous. When I read this novel it made me think of what the present day government might do behind our backs to censor certain materials, but the novel can be so confusing that it is hard to find the relationship. Despite these setbacks, it shows how a few wrong moves and decisions by humans today can end up in grave results in the future.In this story, the main character Montag begins to run into people that alter his mind and make him think about the ethics of his job, which of course is burning books. Montag used to live his life smelling of kerosene, ravaging people's houses, and setting books aflame, but he wants to know why he is doing these deeds in the first place. It is sort of difficult to see how books could be so horrible that they should be banned and burned. You learn later in the story, if you can read inbetween the lines of difficult language, that the government has put a ban on all books to prevent them from corrupting the minds of the people living at the time. Montag learns this and begins to live two lives; one as a fireman, and the other as a madman hiding books in the vents of his house. While this is happening a war is going on that is so hard to understand and so irrelevant that it should just be ignored. The book continues to become more confusing, and the end is just unimaginable and pointless.If you love books that are outdated and totally science fiction, then this is the novel for you. It is a great piece of work that was new and exciting when it was written, but to most people today it would just seem odd and nauseating at times. It is totally unbelievable, and it was difficult for me to sit down and read this story because it was so complex and involved. It takes a person with an extremely vivid imagination to read this novel. It was meant to show how people can not let the government get out of control because they will eventually corrupt and control the minds of every last person on the planet, but this point is lost somewhere amongst the many plots and twists. It tends to be very odd take on the subject, and I would not really recommend using your time to check it out."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Basically, Fahrenheit 451 is a let down. The drop off ending cuts off the futuristic plot's potential. There is much colorful vocabulary, but some metaphors are so elaborate and sudden that one hardly knows whether something is actually happening or if it's just a figment of the character's imagination. It is more confusing that challenging to read. The main character, Montag, has a fairly interesting conflict. The only problem is that it is not resolved enough by the end of the book to leave the reader satisfied! Plus, the only moral or meaning from the book is given away early on, leaving nothing to motivate the reader. I recommend this book to nobody, because they will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Personally, I found the background idea of this book very smart and &quot;appetizing&quot;:a world where books were forbidden and the fire-eaters were actually fire-blowers fighting in the name of mind-globalization against the dangers of reading and building your own way to think and to face life. Unfortunately I reckon that the style is weak, words are just thrown without explanesions in the pages, sentences are chopped in a way that often made me feel totally extraneous to the plot. A heavy atmosphere floats in this book and I had to fight hard to keep on reading. In simple words, I'd mark it 4 out of 5 for the subjects but only 2 out of 5 for the style."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you look at Farenheit 451 from the perspective of when it was written, you can be amazed at Bradbury's prophecy. I tried to keep that thought in mind when reading the book but I wasn't able to put myself into any type of Cold War paranoia mind frame and as a result, I kept coming back to my 2011 mindset and thinking, hey, we have bigger fish to fry, or bigger books to burn, nowadays.Anyway, that's just me.The idea of censorship and government control and general public apathy was interesting, and the idea of society possibly heading there, or already there if you want to think about the obsession with television, is frightening, but when I finished the book I'm sitting there thinking, That's it? That's all? So we suffer through all of this to find out that there's a group of people in the country who have memorized books? That's great, books and ideas and free thought live!, but then what in the world was the whole sense of Montag's story leading up to that great revelation?I thought Montag was a little wimpy and the whole chase at the end wasn't exciting. I found the writing a little difficult to read at times, very choppy and dull. I wouldn't recommend this book"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have Always preferred to hear an author read their own works because only they really know what was intended--until now. Mr. Bradbury has one tone and one tone only and that is carried out with a mush-mouth. It's just horrendous and painful to listen to. Go find another copy--trust me (I would quit but I'm trying to finish it for a book club). Mercifully @ 5 CDs it's pretty short.Amendment: So after finishing, I must say that the last CD is just an interview with the author and it's really very interesting. If you'd like to hear him talk about his life, the books genesis, etc., skip to the last CD. I did enjoy that and it's almost like a different person speaking.

At least the Martian Chronicles was creative, had an emotional core, kept me captivated. The only thing creative about Farenheit 451 is its title. It paints a blurry picture of a simply boring civilization. I found myself not really caring what happened to Guy and Mildred and all the rest. There is no real prophetic vision as there is in say, Huxley's Brave New World, which gives a vivid depiction of a fully-fleshed out and interesting futuristic world, unlike Bradbury's, which is quite similar to any modern town that would exist when the book was written. Also unlike Brave New World, F451 isn't even very compelling, as censorship nowadays is much less of an issue than the genetic engineering and other issues Huxley raises. Overall, a thorougly unsatisfying and overhyped novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a book about firemen burning books. The story is quite fascinating but the way Bradbury works it along is a little confusing. The storyline- Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books and is very proud of his job, that is until one day he meets a girl named Clarrisse and an old man. The story is basically what he decides to do in order to find out why books were banned and what is inside a book that leads people to love them or hate them. The confusing part of this book is that it leaves you thinking &quot;Ok, What just happened?&quot;. I recall that more than once I had to re-read a page 4 times and still couldn't figure out what happened. I'm guessing that the reason this book is so confusing is that it takes place in the future yet sometimes it seems so old (probably because it was written awhile ago). You sit there thinking &quot;Is this the real world (in the novel) or are they discussing the past, or are they discussing the future?&quot;.

I'm never touching this book again."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's 1953 novel Fahrenheit 451 is a science fiction classic that, somehow, I'd never read. With Bradbury's recent death, I decided it was time to remedy that. Unfortunately, I was severely underwhelmed by Fahrenheit 451, and found it lacking in many ways.Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian novel that, despite prominently featuring book-burning, posits dystopia-by-entertainment, like Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, as opposed to dystopia-by-oppression, like George Orwell's 1984 or Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale. The evil of the Fahrenheit 451 is not censorship, but television, which has made people so dumb and uninterested in the world that (almost) no one even cares that firemen now burn books, instead of putting out blazes.The main character is Guy Montag, one of these firemen, who, after a few chance conversations with a young girl next door, realizes he's doing bad things and that the world is a mess. This pushes him to start to consider reading the books he's supposed to be burning, and the novel moves on from there.Montag, and the other characters in the book, all seem flat. Part of this is that there's no real dialogue or conversations in the book. With the exception of Guy's horrid wife and her friends who basically say \\"Shut up, my shows are on!\\" all book, every time a character opens their mouth, it seems they launch into a diatribe - the protagonist and his allies for books, and the antagonists against them. There's no real debate of ideas, and the characters all seem like mouthpieces for Bradbury, either for his anti-technology position or straw men for the anti-book position.The idea of a dystopia brought on by entertaining the citizens into apathy is a perfectly good one, and Huxley did a fine job with it in Brave New World. However, I just couldn't buy Bradbury's take. As far as he's concerned, technology can only be used to placate the masses through their wall-sized TV's or proto-Walkmen. In Fahrenheit 451, the means of content creation still rest, as they did in the '50's, in the hands of the few. This fails to account for the way technology really played out. Sure, we all have huge HDTV's and smartphones with Bluetooth headphones, but we also use all this fantastic technology to connect with people around the world in ways never before possible, and we seek out alternate sources of information that could never have reached nearly as as many people. Sure, plenty of people just let TV rot their brains, but I'm not convinced that's any different today than the '50's, and the technology now has so many other fantastic and worthwhile uses Bradbury ignores or can't predict. Bradbury also ignores that a large percentage of books aren't any better than TV. Just because it's printed on a dead tree doesn't make it Plato or Dickens.Let me also say something about the end of the novel and the war background thread. All through the novel there's imminent threat of war, though - perhaps this is to reflect the characters' lack of concern - what the war is about, who it's with, or how it will be fought is never really addressed, until the end of the book. All of a sudden, it pops up in a major way, and then a page or two later the book's over. It's like Bradbury ran out of story and decided \\"Eh, I'll just toss in a mention or two of war earlier in the book, then let that take care of everything at the end.\\" Maybe this is related to the fact that Fahrenheit 451 started as a short story, was expanded to a novella, then expanded again to a novel. Maybe there just wasn't enough story to flesh the ideas out to that long a format. In any case, the war thread is a horrible deus ex machina (see 1984 for how to weave war into a dystopian story effectively), and the ending is almost a non-ending. I don't mind a grim or ambiguous ending, but Fahrenheit 451 can't even deliver in that way.The writing style also gave me problems. Bradbury goes on for paragraphs describing scenery in repetitive flowery language, then in a plain sentence or two you hardly notice, he slips in a major event with little emphasis. It's just uneven, tedious, and makes things hard to follow.I love golden age science fiction from Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein, so it's not that I don't enjoy the genre or the era. Yeah, 1950's science fiction has its issues these days, but I don't mind those too much, as writers like Asimov an Heinlein penned entertaining stories with lasting messages. I know Bradbury is looked at in a similar way, but from Fahrenheit 451, I just can't put him in the same class as Asimov or Heinlein.I listened to Harper Audio's 2001 production of Fahrenheit 451, ready by Ray Bradbury. I thought it would be interesting to hear the book as envisioned by the author. I was wrong. Bradbury was not an effective narrator. He has a single tone in which he reads. It can be hard to tell if he's narrating description or reading dialogue, or if he's reading dialogue, which character is speaking. Conversations (such as they are, see above) are horrible to try to follow. I just can't recommend anyone, even a hardcore Bradbury fan, listen to this production. There are other versions out there read by professional audio book readers. Get one of them. It has to be better. One other problem with the production are the track times. These are rarely worth mentioning for audio books, but in this case, they are. The tracks range from 1:37 to 28:37 in length, and for no apparent reason. Tracks aren't tied to chapters or anything else I could discern. They just vary wildly in how long they are, which makes it very hard to keep track of where in the book you are. There's no reason for this. The production includes a 2001 interview with Bradbury after the book itself. The entire production runs approximately 6 hours, and about an hour of that is the interview.I can't recommend Fahrenheit 451. Yes, it has an interesting premise, but Bradbury just isn't up to turning it into a compelling story. If you're looking for a good dystopian novel, you'd do better to read 1984, The Handmaid's Tale, or Brave New World. And if you still want to read Fahrenheit 451, do not under any circumstances listen to Bradbury's narration of it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is not Bradbury's best work. His forte is the science fiction short story. His novel is ponderous and slow moving--and will turn off more young people from sci-fi than it will attract. One wonders why so many high schools use it as a required reading in sci-fi when there is so much out there which is truly exciting and attractive to young people while being equal to or better than this particular piece in a literary sense. David Weber, Jack Campbell, Robert Jordan and a host of others come quickly to mind. Even Asimov, dated though he is, would be preferable as an introduction for young adults to sci-fi reading which offers rich literary content."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was surprised at how good of condition the book was in when i got it....I wouldnt mind ordering a few more from this vendor!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Purchased for my child who had a reading assignment.He doesn't like to read, but enjoyed reading this book.Purchase price very reasonable."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This has always been one of my favorite books after reading it when I was young, and it never gets old to read.

Given when it was written you must admit it has prophetic qualities, though the media people are addicted to these days are increasingly ones that Bradbury had not imagined. There are uncanny parallels between the 'family on the screen' in the book and the way many people relate to media like facebook. The reason why I don't give it a higher rating is because I personally think the style of writing feels a bit dated. The text contains many features that I myself would have edited away in my own writing. I wonder if a modern agent or publisher would have commented that the manuscript needs polishing before being publishable. It should be stressed that these are my private opinions and I am sure many don't agree with them. Read it and decide for yourself. This is a powerful story about being entertained to the point of loosing touch with everything that matters in life. Though our media landscape is not the product of an evil society there are many similarities between the way we and the characters in Bradbury's book live through the media."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is a futuristic novel in which history of the past as contained in books is forbidden.

It is a red flag warning about the ever-present encroachment of censorship in the world about us. It is not surprising that this book was indeed heavily &quot;edited&quot; when it was first published. The censors saw their own reflection! Fahrenheit 451 is a book, which sends a strong message we should all heed. &quot;Social criticism&quot; in the written form is all-important to improve our society and prevent our freedoms from being eroded. There are not many other books along this line, but I have found two very enjoyable books, which really do fit into the &quot;Fahrenheit 451 social critique/satire&quot; genre. They are both by the skilled author C.B. Don. One is entitled, &quot;MANAGEMENT BY VICE&quot;...it is a critical, hilarious satire on interactions of technical staff and managers in high-tech industry...and the other, &quot;ACCUSED BY FACET-EYES&quot;...is a fairytale-like science-fiction, which is heartwarming, yet with a sharp ecological message critical of our thoughtless polluting, human practices. Like the classical much recommended Fahrenheit 451, these two books are also our 21st Century must-reads, ideal for every student of satire/social critique! I enjoyed all three books and walked away thoroughly enlightened and with a new perspective on society and life!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's vision of a world without books is genius. However, I don't think he was able to convey all that he wanted to with this book. It could be that the almost-novella length left him without the option to fully develop the characters. I was vexed not knowing what happended to Clarisse, and I was intrigued by the idea of the literati outcasts who roamed the rails. I think that in and of itself would have made an interesting novel. I couldn't understand the reasoning behind the book burnings. Captain Beatty's explanations left me wondering if that was the full story? Humanity is flawed in the extreme,but this seems to suggest a reverse in evolution - human intelligence on a steady downward spiral. I hope that it would take a little more than the explanations given by Captain Beatty to inspire the world-wide destruction of books - especially in this manner. Wouldn't incinerators be much more effective at destroying books than torching houses and buildings? I realize that the book was written very quickly, and maybe Mr. Bradbury got caught up in the passion of writing it, at the expense of character development. But I rated this book 4 stars anyway, because I respect the brilliance of the idea, and Mr. Bradbury made a very bold statement by writing about a topic he felt strongly about. It makes you think, which is more than I can say about the vast majority of literature published."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 in my mind is a very well-written book by Ray Bradbury. Sometimes this book did get very weird, but it all had a purpose towards the end of the book. The author of this book had a very good idea for a story like this and he wrote it very well.Guy Montag has had his job for ten years as a fireman, but books were for burning and the houses in which they were hidden. This man goes out on midnight, runs and watches pages become inflamed in fire. Then he meets a professor that tells him in the future when people could think, and then he realizes what he has to do.I enjoyed this book quite a bit and I would recommend this book for you if you like Science Fiction."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to buy this book for school. At first when I was reading it, it seemed a little boring because it wasn't the type of book I usually enjoy reading. But after I got about 20 pages in, I couldn't put it down! I loved every description and foreshadowing, and how much of the technology was similar to today's, even though the book was written in the 1950's. I was so happy with it that yesterday I went out and bought another of Bradbury's books, The Martian Chronicles!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book had a good beginning that brought you right into the action of the story and showed you the view that the main character had. It had a captivating storyline that was able to keep you interested."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you have ever heard the saying \\"Don't judge a book by its cover\\", you'll notice how Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a perfect example of that. Since I was assigned this book to read, I didn't get that enthusiastic with it at first, especially with that title. I thought it was going to be a book were I had to struggle to keep myself awake to read it. After reading the first 4 or 5 pages though, I was proven totally wrong. I became engulfed in this book and couldn't stop reading it. The story felt so real that I could picture it happening in our society without a doubt in my head.I enjoyed reading about how Guy Montag's character unfolded throughout the story and how he realized that just because something was the law didn't mean that it was exactly right. It is good how he followed his beliefs and didn't let anyone tell him that he was wrong. A downside to this book though is that my favorite character, Clarisse, was run over by a car. I believe that Bradbury just added that part to just take her away. I believe if Clarisse would have lived, she would have been at Montag's side and the overall story could have been so much better.Also, I believe that Bradbury could have changed the ending a little. That was the least exciting point of the book. The jets flying by overhead and the city being destroyed was very exciting, but after that, the overall excitement of the book just died off. I am not going to be stereotypical and say that all of Bradbury's books have a dull ending (because I haven't read any other one), but I will say that he should have fixed this one up a little.All in all, Bradbury has written a good book. Not perfect, but good. I think that this is a book that few should be without reading because it can actually knock some sense into them to not be fools and stand up for what they believe in. The book portrays a world that could possibly be our own in a few years. The fate of this world though, will rest upon our own hands."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you are looking for mindless entertainment you might find Farenheit 451 a difficult or boring read, but if you are seeking a book that will make you think, or stimulate your own philosophical ponderings, then you are right on target.Like Huxley and Orwell, Bradbury expresses his concerns regarding the human condition through the dialouges of his characters. The language might seems a bit dry, but one must consider the time and environment in which it was written.This book is truely a classic, so grow yourself and those around you; Read this book and then share it with someone willing to discuss it with you. Or you can just watch TV!;)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A truly excellent book that spans the generations since it's 1953 debut. This book is along the same lines as Brave New World and 1984 in the sense that it creates a futuristic society (not unlike our own in many ways) in which control has shifted toward an entity other than the will of the people. A certain amount of propaganda and coersion, mainly propogated through television, has transformed the populace into a sick and backwards culture without substance. All the wonderful knowledge found in literature has been abandoned, and burned, while the people have become so unaware that they don't even know that the ashes they are choking on are the ashes of books that used to live on their shelves. Essentially, the ashes of value, and morality. One of the things I liked best about the book was that it highlights the control people have over their life in reguards to books. You always have the power of choice, whether it be in the subject matter of what you read, or the choice of chosing not to read at all. You can put down a book whenever you wish, but in contrast, the television has control over what you see, and what your exposed to. So, kill your TV, and read this book. It is a great story reminiscent of some of our past, and possibly of things to come. It is also very well written."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is the number one banned book in the world.

It reminds us in enormous sharp signs that books will only maintain an importance in our lives if we keep them actively alive by relating them to our present society. Montag is like many of us, going through every day life and responding to things in the correct way. When one day he receives a kind of wake up call. Revived to life he struggles with his moral sensibility over whether to abandon his home or remain in a life clustered in routine mindlessness. Clarisse is the beacon of hope in our lives. She is our belief that a common sense will prevail in the wake of senselessness. The depictions of our society as media-drenched placid reflections of ourselves is indeed accurate. In almost every creation Mr Bradbury made in this novel a direct parallel can be found in our society such as Montag's wife's television family where a popular computer game today is call The Sims where you create your own families. The statements he makes aren't much more complicated than that, but it is a powerful message indeed and a highly creative and entertaining story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In a world where imagination and fantasy are shunned upon, there isn't much room for Clarisse McClellan...the young teenage neighbor of Guy Montag. Montag is a fireman unlike the ones today...his group is employed to burn the books the radicals conceal. Ray Bradbury's prediction of the future shows a world in which questions and ideas are damaging, and the only information you are given are minor details. The books are burned for this very reason, Fire Captain Beatty explains this best, \`...and the books say nothing! Nothing you can teach or believe. They're about nonexistent people, figments of imaginations, if they're fiction. And if they're nonfiction, its worse, one professor calling another an idiot...you come away lost.' Clarisse McClellan is Montag's guide to see the way life was. Enjoying the finer things we see and take for granted, like picking dandelions and skipping on the sidewalk. Simple pleasures have become insignificant, and Montag realizes he's part of the problem. After Clarisse mysteriously disappears, Montag begins to hide books in his house, beginning to regain what he never knew he lost. At home he's not alone. In fact he's married and living with his wife Mildred. Mildred is a constant reminder of the pathetic not-so distant future that lies ahead. She spends most of her time with her \`television family', a collection of three large walls in which you interact with the sets. As Montag begins to learn about the past, Mildred gets suspicious and turns him in. The end may surprise you when Montag realizes what he's supposed to do... This book portrayed a hazy, gray picture of the future, much like the book 1984. Although, it did not emphasize key points of the books with any tension or suspense. Overall, this book laid an important lesson upon me, and that is to take this book not as a lesson, but a warning."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This masterful work of future prevention as Bradbury furvently declares it speaks volumes about the ease in which even a society such as our own (especially a society such as our own) can censor the voices of freedom that speak through books.

They are dislike because Montag's life changes mostly because of outside influence that he could have stopped.

Although Montag follows the wishes of his commanding officer he decides to do away with being a fireman and to do what is right and educate his society on books but his wife Mildred turns Montag in because she is scared of what the fireman will do to her if she is caught with the books in her house. After Montags house is burnt to the ground he decides to run and hide from the police until he meets up with the book people. When he meets up with the book people he tells them that he used to be a fireman and that he has changed and now the police and the fireman are after him.

It's a short read. Short, poignant, and scarily accurate for today's world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is the fourth time I've read this book, though the first time in over 15 years. It's a science fiction classic about firemen who burn books in a not too distant and far too dystopian future. Bradbury is a great storyteller and weaves an amazingly lyrical narrative. It first grabbed me in childhood as an exciting adventure with a very vivid portrayal of the life of Guy Montag, fireman turned rebel.One of the delightful things I discovered in this re-reading was the idea of the proper relationship to books. The government represented by the firemen sees books as a hazard that causes both inequality (reading books makes people think they're better than others) and rancor (people may disapprove of how they (as minorities) are depicted in books). The citizens have fallen away from reading and are constantly plugged in to their living rooms, which are now nothing other than parlors with wall-sized TVs on every wall. Montag's wife wants them to buy a fourth wall TV to complete the room. If she isn't watching TV, she's listening to audio programs on little seashell devices in her ears. Books don't even register as reality for her; when Montag brings them into the house she is filled with horror at what they mean. Not that they contain horrible ideas, but that their house will be burned down if they are discovered. It's as if the government had already won their point.On the other hand, Montag learns to appreciate books, first by meeting Clarisse. She's the seventeen-year old neighbor with the funny family (her uncle was once arrested for driving too slowly at 40 miles an hour). She is interested in nature and people. She has real conversations with Montag about things that matter. She is a catalyst for Montag to explore the forbidden fruit he has been roasting for so long.Like any amateur, he makes a bit of a mess in how he handles things. He tries to convince his wife's friends that they should listen to books but they all recoil in horror. He tries to play cat-and-mouse with his boss at the firehouse but he is not up to the challenge. He eventually has to flee for his life.He falls in with a group of people who have been memorizing books, to preserve them for the time when the culture is ready. Interestingly, they constantly tell themselves that they are not more important or better than others for what they are doing. They are keeping a trust for civilization. In one scene, Montag is talking to Faber, a former professor who has been keeping a low profile though is in touch with the book people. Faber explains the difference between four-wall TVs and books:.\\"..you can't argue with the four-wall televisor. Why? The televisor is 'real.' It is immediate, it has dimension. It tells you what to think and blasts it in. It must be right. It seems so right. It rushes you on so quickly to its own conclusions your mind hasn't time to protest, 'What nonsense!'\\"[Montag:]\\"Only the 'family' is 'people.'\\"\\"I beg pardon?\\"\\"My wife says books aren't 'real.'\\"\\"Thanks God for that. You can shut them, say, 'Hold on a moment.' You play God to it. But who has ever torn himself from the claw that encloses you when you drop a seed in a TV parlor? It grows you any shape it wishes! It is an environment as real as the world. It becomes and is truth. Books can be beaten down with reason. But with all my knowledge and skepticism, I have never been able to argue with a one-hundred-piece symphony orchestra, full color, three dimensions, and being in and part of those incredible parlors.\\"The difference is between what's engaging and what's overwhelming. Books are a help in understanding reality, not a substitute for it or a way to tune reality out (though certainly some have used books that way). They help the reader to understand other people, other times, other places. But they don't force you to agree with them. The proper attitude toward books is not one of hostility or fear or submission. It's of wonder and learning and growing.The book is definitely worth reading and worth re-reading. Bradbury's death a few months ago really is a great loss.Hear some better commentary on A Good Story is Hard to Find, which is what inspired me to re-read the book. And now I am finally starting Jane Eyre, which they discussed quite a while ago."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This gripping dystopian classic hooks you from the start and thrills as the narrative moves eerily forward. Bradbury's ephemeral writing style may not be instantly accessible to some, but readers can lessen the distance they might feel between the Fahrenheit 451 world and characters by simply diving into the text and enjoying the surreal ride while not getting caught up in specific verbiage. Censorship remains a relevant topic and all those interested in science fiction and socio-political trends will find this tale fascinating."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This has been a classic all my adult life, and, given its topic, I'm somewhat embarrassed that I haven't read it before. While I knew the story, I wanted to see how the metaphor was developed and I was also curious about how this 1953 work held up.The message holds up. There are still censors (TX will not teach higher order thinking skills) and proverbial book burners. Bradbury showed that people, by general disinterest can abet censorship. Not all the police state defenders are \\"sold\\". Citizens find it in their interest to speak out about how books can make you unhappy, cause divisiveness, etc. Beatty, a leader of the censorship fire troops, spouts classical literature and poetry in much the way today's family values politicians exhibit their cognitive dissonance.The text is wordy. The \\"50th Anniversary\\" paperback edition has an interview with Bradbury at the end. He said this was originally a 25,000 word story that he later doubled in size for a novel. The stretching clearly shows.After 58 years, while the theme holds up reasonably well, but the particulars are dated and may be more so as years go on. The main characters are all white men. The two main females are stereotypes: the bored housewife and the ingenue. Many cigarettes are lit. Many Millennials would probably not recognize Beatty's literary references and the literature noted as being preserved is probably not what would be the choices of today.Some of Bradbury's future has arrived. The wall has come to us as Skype, with real people. The Hound is the drone. The seashell phone is now the cell phone. The TV style viewer is the I-Pad. It seems the Freedom to Read issues are settled (but the access issues are not).Bradbury gets 5 stars for the metaphor, but, unfortunately, its development suffers by padding a short story into a novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is part of the troika of great dystopian novels of the 20th century, along with \\"1984\\" and \\"Brave New World.\\" What makes this book even more disturbing is the seemingly voluntary oppression of ignorance of a fun-seeking society turning fascist from within. Ray Bradbury considered this his only work of science-fiction, where he defines the genre as something that would at some point become possible. Contrary to expectations of self-preventing prophecies, these books are at least as relevant today as they were 50 years ago. We are faced with questions of personal freedom where it interferes with national security. Social media changed and continue to change our private life in a way that lets a handful of companies monitor our every move already. We can find almost any information on the internet which may just cover up the relevant and confirmed facts in favor of those that are spread the fastest - we're happy as long as we are entertained (whatever that means).This book is a great piece of literature that will keep you thinking for a long time after putting it down. There is an afterword and a coda to the story which reveals a little more of Ray Bradbury's own thoughts. For me, this was probably the most controversial part where I was missing a clear distinction between censorship and an editing process. I don't think that minorities threaten the liberty of arts - nor should they - when it comes to civil rights and equality."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Despite not being that familiar with Sci-Fi literature, I am learning to love it.

She makes Montage think for the first time. She asks him the most simple question, that can also be the most difficult. &quot;Are you happy&quot;.

And that he has to light the match.Montage goes through many stages in this book. He starts like a new born baby, not used to the world that he is in. He grows as the book goes along.

Just exploring the world, and startign to make a change."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Each piece of Utopian literature provides a different perspective on how and why society became no more than a living nightmare. \\"Farenheit 451\\" is no different. Whereas \\"1984\\" implies that the downfall of the elements of language and pure animal instincts led to the degredation of society and \\"Brave New World\\" argues that beauty and truth are essential, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" places its claim on the existence of literature. This fast-paced novel transports the reader to a world where firemen don't put out fires, they start them, and where philosophers and lovers of books don't have a place in a college classroom, but rather as bums on the streets. With descriptive passages and thought-provoking characterizations, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a delightful novel.However, I was slightly disappointed in the lack of depth it contains. I am an avid fan of Utopian literature, but I found it difficult to get swept up in the emotions of the novel. Without a doubt, it was pleasant to read, but if you're looking for a deep and enriching book that will make you laugh and cry and bring to light new perspectives on life and society, this isn't the most suitable novel for you."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Well, it's not a bad book. Actually it should not be considered a book though, it is, rather, a short story. The ideas expressed are all very valable but there isn't much of a story and the science behind it laughable. Bradbury makes good points and argues well, it's just that if you're reading this book (or any book for that matter) it probably implies that you already like reading and value books pretty high. So Bradbury is preaching to the converted. This book makes a great reading list though, many names are dropped and books are quoted from. Instead of reading this book you should read any of the books mentioned in it. Or just as a reminder of why you love to read so much."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This was a great book. It is very thought provoking and powerful.The future world he proposed gets more likely every year. It's message gets more important.Even if you don't like sci-fi or Ray Bradbury, this book is worth it just for the insights he makes."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I thought about the rating of this book (for my taste personally) overnight. I really liked this book, but I felt cheated. Why isn't there more? I wished Ray Bradbury would have kept going with this book. The reason why I wanted more was because I wanted to know what else would happen with Montag when he returned to the ruined city.Ray Bradbury ushered many feelings when I read this book. I was scared of that Hound. I was angry at Millie's friends and Millie. I was kind of impatient with Clarisse. I was confused whenever Beatty was speaking. When it came to Montag, I thought he was not only &quot;foolish&quot;, but smart, too.This futuristic look of the world is quite imaginative, but it could be real. Fire fighters starting fires instead of putting them out. No one able to read without losing their livelihood. Living in the fear of war and dying without knowing a real reason why. Being caught in the world of visual entertainment that entails walls as televisions, and the weirdest part, people caring more about the television &quot;family&quot; more so than their own flesh and blood. It is a possible future, but one man's vision is not necessarily the truth of this world.I liked this book, but I just wished there was more.Joy."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I enjoyed many things while reading the novel Fahrenheit 451. I especially liked how the society that Ray Bradbury created was an exaggeration but this exaggeration was not so distorted that it seemed unrealistic. In the novel Bradbury states that its cars go normally 100 miles per hour, an every day thing for woman is to have an abortion, inside the peoples' homes there are television walls and he also describes other futuristic ways of life.There also were not really any emotions in the book, which was another part about the novel that I enjoyed. For instance, the way Guy felt about Clarisse. You knew throughout the entire novel the effects she had on him and she is thought about, but never really talked about. I liked how even though this novel was written about fifty years ago, you can see it the events that Mr. Bradford described happening to our society. It hits you right at home and Ray Bradbury does a good job of warning us what the future might possibly be like.Another thing I also enjoyed about the book was how fire was constantly used and how it was always used as destruction and bad thing until the end. Whenever Bradbury describes the camp fire that was warming and welcoming because the Montag escaped the society and met up with other people that wanted to bring books back. These people were around that campfire and it was not threatening or anything.There were very many good parts to this book, however there were also some parts of the novel that I did not particularly like. In the beginning of the novel, I think Ray Bradbury goes into too much detail with the description about Guy's pleasurable experiences while on the job. I do not feel that it is relevant to the novel for him to include such information. I think that it started out very slow. During the slow beginning, there was a lot of symbolism and allusions to literature in the novel. I was not very familiar with these uses of symbolism and allusions so I did not pick up on that particular part of the novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag's world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on &quot;Seashell Radio&quot; sets attached to their ears.Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan , who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literatur. The woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that a speeding car has killed Clarisse.Montag's dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent. When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it's normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place.According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other &quot;minorities&quot; objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society, as a whole, decided to simply burn books rather than permit a conflicting opinion."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Hello People,I thought that Fahrenheit 451 was a good book. I wouldn't say that it was the best book in the world but it was definetly a good book and you should read it. It isn't your average book that you're used to, it's a little diffrent. Bradbury writes really well and you can follow the story, but sometimes he would just say something and you would have no clue what he's talking about. So then you have to go back and read a couple pages just to figure out whats going on. But above all I would say that it is a good book and even though it's a little diffrent, it's good to give diffrent things a try. :)Peace-out and enjoy the book!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In this book Ray Bradbury, one of my favorite authors, did not become Nostradamus. His story did not account for the internet. Therefore, many of the political ideas simply won't appeal to the internet generation, where information is only a fingertip away.On the other hand there are valid points regarding the \\"opiates\\" of life. Unfortunately, when you are young you look at it and say \\"look at what they are doing to us\\", which is what our protagonist does. As you become wiser you begin to see that the statement is really \\"look at what we have done to ourselves\\", which is what he finally discovers when he joins the band of scholars.This is an all time classic, but the reverse is happening in our society. There is too much information and no filters/censorship. So we need to be more alert for misinformation and propaganda, than we have ever needed to before.Own the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was a quality book. At the beginning of the book it was kind of boring but when it got close to the climax I couldn't put it down. It kept me on the edge of my seat. The story goes something like this. Guy Montage was a fireman and so was his dad, and his dad and so on. One day he met a 17 year old girl and talked to her about everything and that is when he started questioning himself and what he did. He burnt books for a living. Books that told our past and what we have learned. If we burn our past we will kept making the same mistakes we've already made. One day he took a book from the house they were burning down. Once he read it he felt that all the books should be saved and he revealed that he had about 20 books hide in the cieling. The government made it illegal to read and own books. Montage wanted to let the world know what was in the books and share the knowlege they possesed. He was going to get help from an old man who's books they have already burnt. His name was Faber. One day at the fire house they got a call in that a house had books in it. When they got there it was Montag's house and his wife was leaving him. They made him burn all his own books and possesions. When he was done he went and burned his boss and other work members with the fire torch. The fire department had a machanical dog that chased him. The dog had a neddle in its mouth and bit him in the leg but not enough that he couldn't get away and burn the dog as well. He ran around back and got his books that he had hide in the garden and ran to Fabers house. There he got some clothes and watched the pursuit on tv. They got a new dog and started tracking him down. He told Faber to burn everything he touched and spray down the side walk to get rid of his sent. He headed for the river and then jumped in and threw off the tracking team and the dog. They ended up putting the crime on some innocent guy that was just walking down the street. Montage got onto the bank and walked into the woods where he met some other outlaws like him- self. I realy liked the book toward the end and I thought that it was probably one of the best books I've ever read. The tension is unbearable and the catch phrases are great. If any body likes a good book that won't bore you this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"People in our reality spend time watching TV.

In &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, he once again shows his literary genius. Proving points such as &quot;knowledge is thy strength, fear is not thine strength&quot;. He shows the importance of the written word and the dangers of censorship. This book made me think, which is contrary to this book. It made me think about how much we take for granted, even if it is just thinking. As they say, an oldie, but goodie.

But any reader who's at all awake has to respect him. His style is quite idiosyncratic, and so much the better. I consider him a master of what might be called the extended parable, and &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; seems to fit that description. It would be sad indeed to imagine American literature without &quot;Fahrenheit 451,&quot; especially since it reflects the tenor of the time in which it was written, the era of Senator McCarthy, when anti-intellectualism was, again, rampant in the U.S"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury create the book about one of the variant of future,and I want to hope , this variant will not become reality.Read more....Thank"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Many people have already read and reviewed this novel.

Let's hope the social side keeps far away from our societies"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A classic of Ray Bradbury's, this book, like all of his books, is a product of a fantastic imagination. However, I found that the fantastic I expected from this Bradbury book was not as fantastic as I found in his other novels.The book storyline itself is very interesting. Indeed, Bradbury gets his point across. At first, the book seems Orwellian, as if there is a tyrant or Stalinist leader in America. But this is not true, and the actual reason _why_ the books are burned is very interesting. The reason was a completely new concept I never really thought of.Bradbury makes you think.This novel tends to reflect heavily on Bradbury's fear of &quot;the bomb&quot; and of course, the opression of book reading (as does his other classic, &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;).There has been much critical review about Bradbury's treatment of one of the main characters, Clarisse. Her ending tends to be unanswered and incomplete; however, this should not have an effect on your choice of reading the novel.Overall, the book should _definitly_ be read. I cannot necessarily agree with Bradbury's perhaps-paranoid version of the future, but his point is well taken and well respected."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Irony without imagination and the will to think for yourself.You're just a mindless zombie, a puppet for people to control you.

Our Hero, who sneaked some books and has been secretly reading them, shows us just why the faceless Authority burns all books at Fahrenheit 451. The future has a strong emphasis on interactive television (hey, it covers the four living room walls), and literacy seems to be at the bottom of the heap. Dossiers are kept on all individuals who show an intellectual spark. Such individuals are swatted out of existence, though there seems to be no shortage of those willing to covertly buck the Authority. Plenty of backstabbing neighbors lead to the climax of the novel.With the emphasis today on television and computer skills, and less emphasis on the basic reading skills (just look at reading scores), one can imagine our future, just 4 generations from now, subtly turning into the extremist future world of Fahrenheit 451. A recommended read for any wishing to extol the virtues of more reading and less television; for those wanting a glimpse of a future where technology has suppressed the creative spark; and for those wishing to learn exactly what censorship does to a society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's classic &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; seems to become more true all the time (although it was not intended as a prediction) for example, one of the characters mentions students shooting eachother as if it was an everyday occurence.Beyond that, the plot of &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; is intriguing, poignant, and fun to read.Anyone who has not yet read this classic should pick it up."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbruy creates a world of censorship and what is supposed to be simplistic and fun.

His job is to destroy books, but he soon realizes that there is more to the world than what is told to him. With the help of some very interesting supporting characters Montag's life is drastically changed. This is a really quick read under 200 pages. It was definantly thought provoking and the whole message fits in any time period."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I first read this book, I was so incredibly lost. It was the first Bradbury book I'd ever read, and I guess I just wasn't used to his style. There were so many times I would have to reread 5 or 6 pages 3 or 4 times because I was so confused about what was going on. The characters were strange, and I couldn't ever tell what side they were on;it was really unpredictable. It's one of those books where you need to sit down and read it in a quiet atmosphere and focus on Bradbury's symbolism all throughout the book. If you miss the symbolism, you won't get much out of the book. I think it's hard for people under 13 to really understand some of the symbolism that's in the book, so there's really no purpose in them reading the book, since they won't understand it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is an excellent book dealing with the ever prominent debate of censorship. Fahrenheit 451 is extremely well-written and organized and in an age where outrage is frowned upon very, very timely.

Thumbs up to Mr. Bradbury!!!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Did anyone see the Washington Post article a few days ago about more and more people choosing not to read books anymore for pleasure? It's frightening: in Bradbury's novel, this situation was the precursor to the banning of books!I was so moved at the end of the book that I was overwhelmed with tears. What an astounding book! I'm so embarrassed that I never read this important book before now.To all of the reviewers out there decrying it as too hard to read: Yes, the language is a little difficult to get through and interpret at times, but isn't that what reading is all about? Part of the joy and challenge of reading is figuring out what the author is trying to say. It's not supposed to be easy!

I mean the guy is GOOD!! He's got the smarts, he's got the talent and he proves it with every single novel he has published. But I'm not the only one holding such an opinion, after all Disney studios could have had any of ther scripting staff do a screenplay of &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; but nooo. They had the smarts (a very rare and scarce thing in Hollywood) to ask Mr.Bradbury himself to write a screenplay of his own work. According to my memory Mr.Bradbury in a TV plug said that &quot;about 80% of what went onscreen&quot; was his work. Now there's writing that commands respect, and rightly so, when such little cinematic licence as only 20% is taken in filming a given screenplay. Makes a person curious as to how much of Stephen King's own efforts went into, say, &quot;Creepshow&quot; or &quot;Silver Bullet&quot;. I tell ya people Mr.Bradbury has got what it takes!! Go out, read his stuff for yourselves and see if I'm wrong! I mean hey, you all got minds of your own, whatta ya need me telling you what's worth reading for?

Thus, it is a widely read novel. That fact taken in stride, it's sad that it's message hasn't been more widely transmitted. Fahrenheit 451 depicts a future (definitely a not-too-distant one) in which books are illegal and society is forced to take everything as it is, without questioning &quot;why?&quot; The ironic thing about this is that in subsequent printings, this book has been edited, changed around-.... Parts were taken out of it frequently, and it frequently shows up on banned book lists. What does this say about our society? Nothing too great, I'm afraid. Pull yourself away from the meaningless masses, read this book, take it's message to heart, and try to prevent the future depicted in this book from ever coming into fruitition, and maybe we can take a detour from this headlong-forward trainwreck our society is currently apathetically riding on. As Bradbury himself has said, &quot;I'm not interested in predicting the future, I'm interested in PREVENTING it.&quot; Let's help him."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is a very interesting book. This book touches on the subject of censorship, and the damages that censorship can have in our society. While some forms of censorship are good such as keeping kids out of movies that they shouldn't be seeing, there is another side to it. Censorship, as shown by Bradbury can be a very damaging thing.In this book, fireman were required to start fires, not put them out. They started Fires by finding people who owned books, and then burning their houses down with the books inside of them. In our society today this would seem a proposterous idea, but somewhere down the line, who knows, anything is possible.The story line in this book is very interesting as well. It is fast reading, easy to understand, and has a great story with believable characters in it as well. I fully enjoyed this book, I actually read it from cover to cover without putting it down because I continually wanted to know what was going to happen to the main character. My advise to those who are interested in this book is to definitely buy it, you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I recently read a series of letters-to-the-editor in my local newspaper from a group of middle schoolers who had just read Fahrenheit 451. 8 out of 10 didn't like the book because it &quot;encouraged burning books.&quot; Ahem, did they ACTUALLY read the book or just the back cover? Also many of them were pro-cencorship....I don't know what it is about that class, but I also read this in 8th grade (I am a senior in h.s. now) and I loved it. No one that age should have trouble grasping that the book is ANTI-censorship. Bradbury's style is a little hard to follow at first, but I quickly got used to it and found it fascinating. It is still one of my favorite books, and it gets better every time that I read it (probably because I get older).

And the world is full of people running about with lit matches.&quot; -Ray Bradbury (Coda, Fahrenheit 451)This book is outstanding! It is a book for people who love books. It is a testament to the power of books and the importance of the knowledge they hold.It reminded me a lot of 1984 and Brave New World. If you liked either of these two novels, you will like Fahrenheit 451. Guy Montag, the fireman turned fugitive, is a lot like Winston Smith in Orwell's 1984 because he is forced to hide from an organization that wishes to destroy him. He is also like John Savage in Huxley's Brave New World because they both come to see the importance of literature, art, and beauty in the world. All three men are trapped in societies that are all about a quick fix, the easy way out.Fahrenheit 451 offers everything: action, drama, suspense, inner struggle, inspiration, faith. There's isn't really any romance, but the connection between Montag and his young neighbor Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the world around him, is one of the best I've read.Bradbury makes it clear that this novel is anti-science science fiction. Technology is not important in the great scheme of things.

So much more than a cry against censorship, this book is a rallying cry for us to wake up and see what is happening all around us. From the video walls to the relationships of children and parents, Bradbury is eerily prophetic in his predictions. I can see why some readers today would feel uncomfortable with this book; the truth not only hurts, but sometimes it can be downright damning.P.S. This is not a young adult book. The levels of symbolism and prophecy make this a read much more appropriate to an older, more mature audence."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Anyone who thinks that this book is boring and has no value, should simply watch TV.

Ray Bradbury made this book very interesting especially with his similies and metaphors. In order to get anything out of this book you really had to read closely to enderstand what Bradbury was trying to communicate to the reader. Also, the reader had to use their common sence to understand the story, because it is very different from our world today. The scary part of the story, was how it was written fifty years ago, but the reader can see how the society of today is becoming more and more like the book.Amagine a world were reading certain books ment that you were breaking the law, with possible punishment of death. This was the world Guy Montag lives in. He was a fireman that started fires. In the story's day and age this was a common job. Houses that contained books were houses that needed to be burnt down. Montage enjoyed his job because he did what he was told, and never thought outside of the box.

As other books that I would group into this general genre (such as &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;On the Beach&quot;), it projects a frightening future in which firemen don't put fires out, they start them--in the homes of people who are reported to possess books. As a raging bibliophile, this is one of the most frightening scenarios I can imagine.Ray Bradbury is a masterful writer who commands your attention like few I have read before. He succinctly depicts the struggle of Guy Montag, the main character and a fireman, as he slowly begins to realize that perhaps his job is not as spectacular and wonderful as it once was. He lives in a climate of violence, where people driving run over pedestrians for sport, and wars come and go as frequently as the change in tides. And, most of all, it is a world where books are viewed as a waste of time, considering TV shows have been condensed to five minutes long and billboards are two hundred feet long so that drivers may see them as they drive by at breakneck speeds. Bradbury paints quite a grim picture of the future, along with his contemporaries, Nevil Shute and George Orwell, that seems frighteningly near. Haven't we heard the news stories about how the younger generation doesn't read? And Montag's wife, Mildred, interacts with her &quot;family&quot; on wall-sized TVs in the parlor...an interactive &quot;reality&quot; show that seems like it may be drawing closer by the second with the advent of all the reality shows in the past year. Rather than having her own life, Mildred seems to live her life in conjunction with these characters on the screens.Bradbury gives us an ominous warning about what may be in the future. We should definitely all pay close attention.This book is more pertinent than ever, and I hope they're continuing to teach it in the schools. It is important that we read these books, so that when things begin looking eerily familiar, we can stop it before it gets to this point."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The premises of Fahrenheit 451 are promising: the ever looming &quot;this-could-happen&quot; is enacted out in the form of Guy Montag and his little world where people desire only 4 screen televisions in their parlour, where advertising reigns supreme, etc. A vast majority of books are illegal because they inspire conflict (the Koran and the Bible, Wealth of Nations and The Communist Manifesto) with conflicting ideas. Who would want that? The human race might actually get somewhere.It's a fantastic concept, and should lead to a great book. However, I've read this three times and each time I get the same general feeling: this could have been so much better. So, read it, just for the sake of reading it, but don't expect a huge masterpiece."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is by far one of my favorite books ever, along with Lord of the Flies. It starts out where Guy Montag is a happy, yet braindead fireman who seems to love his job. Which is burning houses that contain any books. Set in the future, everything seems backwards. Television seems to run their lives. No one reads. People on the street drive more than eighty miles an hour, which causes them to knock people over. And no one seems to care when someone dies. They just drive around knocking people over. Montag's wife Mildred (if memory serves) is just as braindead and likes to watch &quot;the family&quot; and that terrible clown show where the clown gets run over by a train in the walls, which are like giant TV screens that completely surroud her and engulf her. But Montag meets a girl who shows him the beauty of life outside their brainless conformaties. She tells him that, long ago, firemen put fires out, not started them. And he starts to wonder why there are no more porches or decks for people to sit on and talk. He wonders why there are people who love books so much that they would be willing to be burnt with their books. And he wonders what is really in the books.... So while he is reading (illegally) Mildred and her friends are sitting around watching the walls and talking about how many abortions or husbands they've had like it's nothing at all. Montag tries to get Mildred to read with him, but she thinks it's wrong and leaves. All the while, Captain Beatty, a chief at the fire station where Montag works is suspicious of Montag owning books, but he can't prove anything. Until the night Mildred leaves Montag and pulls the alarm that let's the firemen know someone has books in their house. Montag is shocked to have to burn his own house to the ground. He kills Beatty and the other two firemen with the flamethrower and runs away. The police are pursuing him but he eventually gets away, with the help of an old man who used to be a professor. In the end the city blows up. It is kind of a representation of the terrible lives the people there were living and how our society could someday end up like their's. It is a really beautiful book, science fiction at it's finest. Ray Bradbury did an amazing job with this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" a metaphor on the freedom of speech. It is not in literary terms that knowledge can be controlled by burning books; there are other ways to accomplish that. As the world is full of people; running with lit matches. Ray Bradbury is basing his attack on every editor; censor; lobbyist; government that see themselves as the caretaker of knowledge and literature; and they control by shackle the words of an author who dare to speak out.The question is very relevant to present times. The news is splattered with stories of doctored intelligence documents; on the bases of which dreaded events occurred."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Reading over the other reviews, they basically sum up how fantastic this book is. I just wanted to add that when I read this book in my seventh grade English class, although it used a huge amount of symbolism and metaphors that would normally be hard for a younger people to understand, the majority of my reading group was able to decipher the book and take a great deal out of reading it. We worked together to figure out a few very difficult things but in general this book was not impossible for a young person. So, to anyone that wants to enrich themselves and really take a deeper look at the horrors of instant gratification, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I first heard of the basic plot in which Firemen burn books rather than putting out fires I was a little skeptical. I was most definitely mistaken. This prophetic short story was engrossing. There is nothing I can say which hasn't been said before. Yes the underlying themes aren't so underlying but they are multilayered and provide a buffet of ideas to feast upon."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In an age where most authors write tomes of 400+ pages, this classic by Bradbury says more about humanity, freedom, and the risk of opression from the state (and society) than just about any other book ever written. For anyone who loves books, this is a must-read. Even if you don't consider yourself a &quot;science fiction&quot; fan, this book is an essential - like _Brave New World_, _1984_ etc that should be read by any biliophile. And the story is exciting and entertaining enough that it more than earns its place among the truly classic literature of any time."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. It's a really amazing story of how the world could be one day if we are all corrupted by the government"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fireman Guy Montag is happy with his work--burning books--until he runs into a teenaged neighbor who really talks to him, questions him, and starts his mind working in directions that don't feel comfortable and that lead him to question his entire existance. In Ray Bradbury's futuristic dystopia, books are illegal and wall-sized television sets, constantly babeling and even allowing user interactivity, rule the world. But, as we learn from the story, this isn't the result of harsh government sanctions, but of popular consensus only supported by the government when books were already almost extinct.Author Ray Bradbury is a powerful and effective writer. His use of the language adds color to a straightforward, if fascinating plot about a man's struggle to come to terms with himself in a world where comfort and 'happiness' are deemed more important than questioning and thought. Like George Orwell's 1984, FAHRENHEIT 451 survives because of its eternal message, its strong writing, and its insights into the future--a future that Bradbury might recognize as something similar to our own present. In an era where book reading declines each year, and where a greater and greater percentage of those books sold are best-sellers by a few favorite writers, Bradbury's message is certainly worth another look.Two characters make this novel--Guy Montag, with his doubts but also his hopes for the future, and fire chief Captain Beatty. Beatty knows the truth, knows more about books than Montag or even most intellectuals, and is willing to argue against them--but does so using arguments from the books themselves. Beatty's arguments are subtle and definitely worth stopping and thinking about--only if we are willing to pay Beatty's price can intellectual freedom survive and Beatty is right--few are really willing to pay.Although most reviewers focus on the book burning and anti-intellectualism that Bradbury describes in FAHRENHEIT 451, there is also a strong anti-war message that runs through this novel and much of Bradbury's early work. As in our own era, wars are expected to be easy and cheap, at least for the Americans. Bradbury argues that expectations don't always make the truth."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I loved this book. As a well-rounded citizen who has been subject to almost everything, I thought this book was well written and well thought out. Like most of the other readers of this book I had to read this in school, but I was immediately drawn in by Bradbury's estimations of what the future will be like (note this book was written in the early 1950's). His imagination and creativity were so real; some of the devices in the book have since been invented. What a cool thing for Bradbury to more-or-less guess what the future is going to be like and then have some of his guesses come true. I would deeply encourage all literate people to read this book; who knows how close Bradbury's other ideas of the future are?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This novel is truly a work of art. It has mastered the art of allusion and metaphor. We had to read this book for College Prep. English (10th grade) and I was very disappointed at first. Then I went back and started over and read it slowly so I would understand it fully. As I read back through the pages, it seemed like a totally different book. I hung on the natural similies and metaphors, and couldn't believe how correct Bradbury was in placing our future. To those who &quot;just don't get it&quot; I say I'm dreadfully sorry. It's a pity that you wasted your time, not actually reading the best book ever written! I hope that you will give it another chance and that you will understand that this is a literary work of art!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was definitely a decent novel. The loose ends left by Bradbury were overwhelmed by the extraordinary content and fascinating prophecies. While Bradbury wrote this novel in the early 50's, he was still able to capture the essence of what would seem to be our misfortune in the future. Although he could have spent more time developing the characters, Bradbury does a wonderful job of establishing the plot. It was not hard to picture the details and the setting in this story, as they seemed to come alive. The suspense in the book was tremendous and managed to keep you on your toes throughout the book. For all of these reasons, we believe that 451 is definitely worth reading and will stay a classroom favorite for years to come."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"trulely one of the most fantastic books ever written. it pulls you into the book like no other. i could not put it down.if you havent read any ray bradbury, start with this one. but read the others too."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book I read this quarter is called Fahrenheit 451. The author of the book is Ray Bradbury. The book takes place in the future. Some of the environments include: Montag's house, the fire house, and Faber's house. In my oponion, the city and the river were the most important sites in the book. The city is were Montag was chased, and the river is important because this is where Montag finally dodged the city officials. I think that Fahrenheit 451 would best be classified as a science fiction. It is this genre because it is set in the future. Also, it is make believe because firefighters don't burn books in our society. Ray Bradbury has written many short stories, novels, plays, and poems. At 12, he wrote his first short story. He has produced two of his own plays, made two musicals, and helped with an animated film. In 1962 Icarcs Mantgolfer was nomanated for an academy award. Ray Bradbury has had his own television show, named the Ray Bradbury Theater has won many different cable awards. The book is about a firefighter named Guy Montag. His job is not to put out fires, but to set books ablaze. As the story goes along he starts to question many things about his job and the books he burns. About this time Guy starts stealing books. He made many attempts to read them, but he didn't understand them. Guy then contacted Faber, a retired professor, to help him interpret the books. Then Beatty, the fire chief, suspected Guy of burning books. Because this was aganist the law, Bettay went to Guy's house to burn his books. At that time Bettay placed Montag under arrest. Fearing he might be killed, Guy flees from city officals. He finally loses them when he hides in the river. When Guy emerges he meets a group of retired professors and teachers. They helped Guy escape and they recite to him as they travel. That is where the book ended. . The main character of the book is Guy Montag. He is a firefighter. Montag was not very educated, but he was \\"programed\\" to set books on fire. Guy is important to the book because if he wasn't there then there would be no book. He is also important because he is the olny person with the drive needed to change the laws of owning books. He is married to Mildred Moontag. Another improtant character of the book is Faber. He is a retired professor who quit when the college where he taught closed. Faber, a very well educated man, had been illegally reading books very discreetly. Faber is improtant to the book because without Faber's help Montag never would have escaped. Faber is also the person who coached Montag whenever he was in trouble. I think the theme of the book is that we shouldn't take books forgranted. I think Farheniet 451 is saying that books are very important resources and that slowly with technology thay are becomming more and more obsolete. Overall I liked most of the book. There were many dead spots in the book that left me lost. At the begenning I really didn't catch on and understand the it. But, when it picked up, it was a very good and interesting book. This is why I would reccomend it to a friend."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"So far, Bradbury is a great decriber, i thought this book would be stupid, [A book about buring books] but by the end of the first paragraph i was amazed by the detail he gets to and how he describes Clariesse and how &quot;Crazy&quot; she is to the books society.Also his forshadowing is great [the vent grille]. i admire him, as a young writer i see what i'll have to do to make a book so popular as this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The sense of doom was so overwhelming as I slowly examined the book.

I am somewhat amazed at how prophetic some of those books were. This book, written now almost 50 years ago, is a sociological treatise of things to come; and unfortunately - it has come to fruition. I am equally amazed how accurate Bradbury's predictions were. How did he know? What insights did he have? Is he truly a seer? Was this written as a fanciful warning, or of what our society WOULD be? The televised helicopter chase scenes; being more familiar and comfortable with our television families - than our own flesh and bloods. A society composed of Mildreds. No critical thinking - just having FUN. Don't disturb us with thoughts and ideas. We're happy, and we intend to stay that way - at the expense of all else. The banning and the burning of books. The revising and shredding of ideas being performed not by the government -- but by pressures from the minorities, the majorities, the intellectuals, special interest freaks, 2nd rate entertainers. Political Correctness. This book should be required reading for all young people. If you find this book DISTURBING -- then you are already a Mildred. You have lost.

Anyway, i was amazed that they had cliff's notes for it, until i read some of these reviews...its sad really.If you go into every book thinking that you are being FORCED to read it and FORCED to think about it, you won't like it. At least that's my explanation for all the one star reviews.Equally disturbing/humorous are those who say that this book should be burned. That makes me laugh.

No offense or anything."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In summary, this is not a plot book. It has the sole purpose of convaying a message, it's theme. Throughout the book, Bradbury says that books are made for people to think and without this ability to think, people are a mass of &quot;happy&quot; that care nothing of responsibility or consequence.This novel had a profound effect on me, even if I am only 16. I do not want to criticize, but there is some ignorance in the other reviews. People want this book to be exciting, like a TV show. Montag seems to prophisize this in his book. He says people like to be led and not think by a TV, rather than lead and think by a book. I guess it is sad that people think this. Montag's prophicy of a psuedo-happy world may realize. It seems to be leaning that way.If you think while you read, this book is excellent. It is a theme book, not plot. I enjoyed it greatly and it has given me a new outlook on life (as a book should).

If you can get past all the abstract adjectives the reading is fairly quick. Enjoy this book, and keep an open mind. It is not politically correct!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is an anti-censorship novel by Ray Bradbury, in which a world is presented that could very easily be our own. Its protagonist, Guy Montag, is a fireman whose job is to burn books, but one night on the job he has a change of heart. He realizes how wrong it is to limit people's minds, and in this moment Bradbury makes the reader reflect about the importance of freedom and humanity. Montag reveals to his wife where he has hidden over twenty of the forbidden novels, and from that point on he finds himself being persecuted by the ignorance and coldness of the world around him. Montag's main antagonist is his former fire chief, Captain Beatty. Over the couse of the book he presents the reader with disturbingly realistic monologues concerning mankind's eventual decline into ignorance. The most alarming part of this decline is, as Beatty points out, that it was the people's choice. This ignorance is not only what leads to the burning of books, but also to a fear of their fellow man which made their world cold and unfeeling. Chilling in its realty, Fahrenheit 451 is just as relevant today as it was when first written."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The major complaint against this book, as far as I can see, is from elementary school students who resent being forced to read works they don't understand.

Occasionally, I reread those books, and some of them still flare up my imagination. F451 is one of those. There is a misconception that scifi authors must predict the future in minute detail, the more so if they deal with social issues, lest their work becomes &quot;dated&quot;. Not so; good authors write about the present. If one chooses to select current trends and extrapolate them, it's irrelevant how accurate a prophet one is. It matters not whether or not firemen will ever go from firefighters to firesetters. What matters is that Bradbury foresaw, and denounced, a society drowned in entertainment - worse still, &quot;infotainment&quot; -, assailed by a barrage of GUIs, emoticons, acronyms, shoot-'em-down, trigger-happy computer games, &quot;educational&quot; software that is none other than, &quot;interactive&quot; TV shows plastered on wall-sized screens, complete with FX and surround sound ... And never a moment to be alone with ourselves and just plain think. From readers'comments, I garner F451 is being given as an assignment to 7th and 8th graders. Too little, too late.

I recalled enjoying the book a lot when I first read it around the age of 17 - I recently recommended it to my daughter, age 14, and she thought it was one of the best books she ever read. My attitude now towards the subject of potential loss of freedom combined with mass culture, although much more down-to-earth than it was in my teens, is still pretty much the same: respect and appreciation of human freedom of expression. Bradbury is very clear in his fight for freedom, the extreme fictional situation he devised is now more real than ever - true we are not prohibited from keeping books (in this country anyway), but we are offered enough mass culture that most people will spend hours in front of the TV rather than reading books or visiting museums (I do that a lot too).

First of all, his writing is CLEAR! It's none of this wordy, incomprehensible Charles Dickens or wimpy, disgustingly melodramatic James Herriot. Bradbury gets straight to the point without dilly-dallying and remains extremely entertaining throughout. When I say he's entertaining, I don't mean that this book is a comedy. Far from it. The censorship issues brought up by the book-burning is a very serious topic. However, Bradbury's masterful words make it truly enjoyable to read. I couldn't put it down until I was done. A must-read!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Reading all these reviews it seems as though many people, and I dont mean to offend anyone, have become too preoccupied with the need for every book that is part of the sci-fi genre to adhere to some sort of science base and to have a plot that could conceivably happen. Literature and sci-fi in particular should be the exploration of ideas, encouraging some form of though amongst its readers. The situation create in the novel is perhaps not plausible, but it is merely an exagerrated form of our world today and what it may become more like. To think it ever could become so bare is indeed unlikely, but the need to be aware of the trend is there, hence the book is there.The plot too may be lacking, and I sometimes found the writers prose clunky and disjointed. This can be explained by the short period of time in which the book was written and the fact that in general it is written as such to convey the turmoil the central charcter is feeling when his entire world suddenly seems to lack any meaning or purpose.I would recommend this bok to anyone who can be bothered to think about a book as they read it. It is not the easily accesible thrillers that fill the bestseller lists, John Grisham et al, but it is abook that is both chilling in its prediction and thought provoking.The only criticism would be that the story may have worked better as a short-story and Ray Bradbury's proseis better suited to the shorter form.ps Anyone who found the book boring and the setting devoid of life and colour.

There's just something about Mr. Bradbury's writing style that makes his books hard to read. It's the language that confuses me. This book could have been good if the language had more clarity.

Both of them have nothing to do with the story, and Ray Bradbury babbles on and on about his past and how he came up with the ideas for other books that NO ONE CARES ABOUT! I almost fell asleep during the forword, I dont know how I survived the book. The book drags on and one at a painfully slow pace. As for Ray Bradbury himself, he states in the introduction that in his eyes, Hitler burning and brutally killing people is on the same level as the burning of a book.

I like fantastically created worlds and futures, but when they're dry and brittle like this, you simply long for the pages of the book itself to burn bitterly...."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I never received the product in the mail.

I swear thats what the book is about and I know it makes no sense I didnt understand it either. Why is he a fireman? I DONT KNOW! NOBODY KNOWS!But the real problems started when I returned this book to my local library and now they say I did not return it at all even though I did and it was in a pile of other books which! I returned all at the same time together so I know. But now they say I owe the library $7 for a new book even though it was used. Whatever.My advice: this book is cursed or something because everything about it gets lost even a review OF THE BOOK THAT I ALREADY WROTE. I am going to go back to the library next week and I bet its back on the shelf laughing at me with my $7 in its hand.I hate this book but to be fair it rates TWO STARS because I guess it is okay if you like stories about firemen which I do."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"it is impossible to keep reading this...it is very hard to understand and most parts don't make any sense...it is very hard to understand."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"To put it simply: this book sucked. Although this is a very juvenile way of putting it, it fits perfectly. This book was so boring, that all the description Bradbury puts in couldn't possibly describe how slowly it moves.

The book is about Guy Montag who is a fireman from three or four hundred years in the future where firemen cause fires instead of putting them out. The book mentions people Montag meets and is friends with and about his failing relationship with his wife. There are many 'futuristic' objects in this book which keeps you thinking and confused.

Guy is a fireman that burns books and sets houses on fire instead of the normal fireman that puts out the flames. During the course of the book Montag goes through many different phases. The most important phase is where he starts wondering about books. Since all his life he has been taught that books are bad and only to burn them, he is curious what books are about. During the time that he is going through his mysterious phases he meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens her eyes to the emptiness of his life. Montag met this girl one night when he was taking a walk at about midnight. Montag also meets a very important character named Faber. Faber is an old English professor that likes books and knows a lot about them. Over the story Montag has Faber set him up with a retired publisher, to help publish books. At the time that Montag is trying to publish books the fireman are chasing him, because his wife turned him in.Guy Montag is a fireman who suddenly realizes the emptiness of his life and starts to search for meaning in the books he is supposed to be burning. He quickly forms unusually strong bonds with anyone who seems to have true friendship with him. His biggest regret in life is not having a better relationship with his wife. And because he didn't have a very good relationship with his wife that is why she turned him in to the fireman and got there house burned.The way that Ray Bradbury makes this book seem is incredible. He has a special talent that lets him really involve and capture the reader's attention. while I read this book I felt as if I was a silent observer that stood next to Guy Montag every where he went.

First of all, the story was way too jumpy. It started slow, and then randomly got fast. It had absolutly no suspense to it. I found myself forcing myself to read! I couldn't relate to any of the characters! For instance, some of the characters were too boring. Maybe if I read this book in this book in ten years I would have a different opinion. Another reason why I didn't like this book, is because the characters weren't seen enough. They were all just thrown in at different times. You didn't feel like you got to know them very well and I hate that. I would not recommend this book. I think that Ray Bradbury needs to rethink his book ideas! I do not want to be critical of Ray Bradbury, but really I couldn't stand this book. It had no meaning to me. It also, had a poor plot and setting. For instance, it was plotted in the future yet it was no different than today.

I really liked how the main character had ethics change as the story went on and how he turned around and made sure that he not only stopped burning books himself, but that he brought justice to those who wanted this done. I also liked the idea the author painted of the value of books. His characters actually ran away to a far place, where they could each memorize a book and retain that knowledge. The scary thing about this book is that hiding of knowledge is actually being done right now. Maybe not by burning books, but by degrading them and making the population so dumb by drugging the, we no longer retain knowledge as a culture. It's a little different than now, but it's exposing what happens when people are not allowed to learn and know things.

It belongs to the kind of sci-fi, which is really imbued with meaning and consequence. Thus I would group it with other great, litterary accepted, sci-fi novels, like \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" or \\"Brave New World\\". I was quite surprised about the abrupt ending of the novel. I think it's too short. It's kind of like a novella.

As a fireman, Montag has the job of burning books. However, Montag starts to question what he is doing after he befriends Clarisse McClellan who is not afraid of firemen. Montag is also influenced by Professor Faber who believes that books are important for three reasons: 1) they provide quality and texture of information, 2) they provide leisure time, and 3) the right to carry out actions based on what we learn from the interaction of the first two. With the help of Professor Faber, Montag starts to challenge the status quo and eventually becomes a fugitive. This is a thought-provoking, alarming, and suspenseful book about what happens when people become too sensitive about what is printed in books and when the public stops reading of its own accord."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most famous works of science fiction, and with \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"1984\\" represents one of the most memorable and haunting dystopias. In a future world, books are banned and firemen actually set fires instead of extinguishing them. The state exercises a form of social control through controlling what sort of information people have access to. It turns out that not all books are banned, only those that we would today consider \\"great works\\" - Plato, Shakespeare, The Bible, Darwin, etc. For me one of the biggest surprises about Fahrenheit 451 was the rationale that was offered for the burning of those books. In a nutshell, they offended politically correct sensibilities and the authorities felt that they would undermine the social cohesion. This expunging of the classics from the culture has an uncanny resonance with the attempts over past few decades to expunge them from the undergraduate liberal arts curriculum. And rationale is also similar: these books are not \\"diverse\\" enough and may offend the sensibilities of an ever-increasing list of \\"minorities.\\" It is hard not to wonder if a milder, softer version of dystopian future that Bradbury was worried about in the early 1950s has not in fact arrived.Bradbury's writing and ideas are somewhere between those of George Orwell and Philip K. Dick. His style is very engaging, and even poetic. His writing is at its best when one of his characters engages in a prolonged monolog. However, the plot development could use some improvement. There is very little in terms of transition from one scene to the next, and most scenes are overly compressed. It is very hard to follow the plot developments at times. Nonetheless, Bradbury is a wonderful stylist and unlike much of science fiction this book is a pleasure to read on a purely literally level as well as for its sweeping ideas.As a last note, I found it incredibly ironic that I read this book on Kindle. Based on this alone I am fairly optimistic that reading and great books will not only survive but in fact thrive well into the 21st century."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The lessons learned from good authors are timeless. Reading this book today one wonders how a writer 50 years ago could have so much insight into the society we live in today.Yes its about censorship, but its also about today's media and advertising culture. People are fed the news and told what opinion they should have about it... why bother thinking yourself?The parts of the book about television and how the media ties into law enforcement are chilling, in light of the new &quot;Amber Alerts&quot; adopted across the country.Good books make you think about your world, and this one makes you wonder how Bradbury could have known.The afterward (or coda) was priceless, and its comments on censorship and &quot;editing&quot; are far more frightening than people showing up to burn your books.&quot;I will not go gently onto a shelf, degutted, to become a non-book.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book points out while at the absolute extreme mind you what the negative effects of censoring books can be. It is Ironic that this book is on the list of top 100 books challenged between 1990 and 2000. Besides being a great social commentary/civil liberties book, it is an exciting book. If you are in the mood just for a good page turner, read the book, if you are in the mood for a good social commentary, read the book.The story is basically about a man with an empty life who's job is to go around burning the homes of people who own books. A very good example of how empty a person's life can be without being able to exercise their mind. I think anyone who likes to read, will like this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's been a long time since I've read a book that I was so totally engrossed by. Fahrenheit 451 could have been written yesterday in as much as it relates heavily to todays world. When you read about this society in which people spend their lives glued to giant televisions, in which books, intellectual thought and art are forbidden, you can visualize it so perfectly in your mind that it's scary. This is not one of those simple books you pick up, read, and put back down. This is one that you will read again and that will stay in your mind as you ponder the meaning of the world around you and appreciate the fact that you are allowed to read at all."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This novel by Ray Bradbury is a very interesting book. Fahrenheit 451 is one of those books that you just can't put down. It's hard to say why, but you pick it up saying to yourself, \\"I'll just read a few pages,\\" and you end up reading for an hor or two because of the way it puls you in. The conflict starts imddediately, solving the problem of a slow beginning that some novels have. The very first few paragraphs show Guy Montag's love for fire that eventually becomes his personal struggle as well as the struggle of the world throughout the novel. There is alot of foreshadowing that you don't really recognize until you see what it's lead to, such as how Beatty doesn't run out of the kerosene-filled house as the others, but walks slowly almost delaying when the old lady pulls out a match. In leads into something very strange later on, but I don't want to give it away. This novel plays off the old concept of how you never really know how valuable something is until its taken away, playing on something as important as making books not only rare but illegal in the future. It also shows how destructive the world has and will become, with wars lasting technically 48 hours, and are decided in less time than it takes to blink. All and all it is a very interesting and entertaining book, and I would recommend Fahrenheith 451 to anyone, whehter they are heavy readers or not so heavy readers, such as myself."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a very interesting book.

The style is very good and it's loaded with phrases and metaphors for you to figure out well into the night. Nevertheless, I loved it and it's one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"FAHRENHEIT 451 is a grim yet thought-provoking novel of a dystopian future. Other novels that show a bleak future--1984 and BRAVE NEW WORLD come to mind--focus on what their authors see as the root cause of the implosion of human values. Ray Bradbury envisions this implosion as a gradual process of extreme cultural homogenization that, in the words of the novel's antagonist, Fire Captain Beatty, reduces 'everyone to the consistency of paste pudding.' Whatever it is that stamps one individual as different from another, the society of FAHRENHEIT 451 ruthlessly if not mindlessly grinds down and out that uniqueness that once marked a creative thinker.Guy Montag is a fireman who likes his job, which is to start fires and not extinguish them. He burns books to ashes, and then burns the ashes, as his firemen's slogan boasts. He sees nothing wrong with that, and at the start of the book, he is not unlike nearly everyone else in his acceptance of the Way of Things. Yet, Bradbury hints early on that Montag's mind and soul are ripe for a literary infection that is just as contagious as the Black Plague ever was. He meets a young girl Clarisse, who insists on asking him questions whose apparent nonsensical purpose is really meant to probe the paper thin layer of protection that Montag had built up over the years. She asks him if he is happy. She asks him if he has ever looked at the moon. With these seemingly innocuous questions, she infects Montag with the forbidden desire to know the 'why' of things. By the end of their first meeting, Montag now knows that his life has been a cotton candy lie. For the first time in his life, he can see that the society in which he lives is dedicated to the ultimate communistic ideal: each citizen is encouraged to reach only to a preordained level. To attempt to reach beyond that lies the swift punishment of the flamethrowers and the Mechanical Hounds. After only a few days, Montag is now stealing and reading forbidden books. The plot is not what sells the book or what has made it required reading on most college and high school campuses. The lure of FAHRENHEIT 451 is the manner in which Bradbury weaves the threads of present day trends of soap operas and quiz shows into a quilt whose collective and stifling weight crushes individualism just as surely as Orwell's Big Brother does in 1984. Bradbury uses a number of symbols (fire, books, the salamander, the Phoenix) which allow the reader to view a troika of social elements that contained within themselves the promise of death to the Thinking Man. Bradbury creates a triangle of public school education, technology, and interpersonal relations, all of which are perverted to create a society whose primary function is to use one's brains as minimally as possible for unthinking personal pleasure. The school system drills learning by rote in children's minds. No books are need for that. Technology provides huge televisions so that the stars of these shows interact with an audience to the extent that true human relations are shunted aside for a fake television 'family.' Personal relations of family and friends are then limited to inane conversations of the type that we here in the real world see on our tv commercials. Montag sees his wife Mildred as bad off as any of her equally brain-dead friends. He tries to infect her and them with the same teasing questions about the Meaning of Life that Clarisse used on him so successfully. To his horror, Montag learns that they are immune to the germ of curiosity. He cannot change his society, though he tries mightily by plotting with a former college professor named Faber to plant forbidden books in the homes of firemen. He learns that since he cannot change society, he must leave it.One of the best parts of the book is the cat and mouse game that Fire Captain Beatty plays with Montag. Beatty is seen as a man who once had been infected with the bug of individualism, but had since 'cured' himself and now is determined to cure Montag. Their extended dialogue is one of the great literary dialogues between oppressor and oppressed. Beatty explains how his society came to be and Montag learns that somewhere along the line, the process went horribly wrong. By the novel's end, the reader can only hope that the literary virus of infection will never meet its cure. For Ray Bradbury, this cure was not very far away. For Guy Montag, the cure was even closer."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This one of those books that are like no others that I have read.

I love reading but this book really made me think about how some of my friends despise reading. Now, it doesn't seem like much, but in Guy Montag's society, the main character, reading and just owning books was a crime. I started thinking about how much knowledge can be attained through books, and this book made me think about what books offer. That is because this book offers so much to the reader. The only thing I didn't like about this book was that it had no closing to the story. I personally like closings but some people like to imagine the end and it always works for teachers to have a finish the book kind of project.

Montag remains bothered by his event for a long time. He is unable to go on with his daily routine as he did before. After meeting with professor Faber, an old friend of Montag's, he receives a book from the professor and takes it home and begins to read.

Montag escapes the law and finds a group of people much like himself. Together they cultivate the knowledge they have gathered over the years and await a time in which they will be able to share the knowledge.Fahrenheit 451 is a well-written novel that invokes thoughts and questions in the reader's mind.

D. work on loneliness. Censorship certainly is the main theme, but another aspect of the book really touched my and might increasingly become critical for the 90s: I mean the feeling of being mentally isolated from a civilization that seeks nothing but distraction and variety - perfectly supplied by superficious media. Compared to this tendency, books might resemble dinosaurs, they require concentration, tranquility and a reader who is willing to think about the content. Every time I think of Guy Montag, I feel a little bit lonelier in this hasty culture. Unlike the end of the story, you shouldn't wait for collective self-destruction, from an individual point of view it will never be too late to re-discover the quality of slowliness in life, the taste of a conversation with somebody listening and understanding..."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Twenty years ago I had to read Fahrenheit 451 as part of my required reading in the ninth grade.

Nothing about the book stayed with me, just the title.Now twenty years later, I have reread Fahrenheit 451 and know, without a doubt, why the book stayed with me.Imagine a world where books are burned. A world where firemen no longer come to the rescue to put out fires but come to burn your house down if you are caught with books. They no longer wield water hoses, but flamethrowers. That is the world that Guy Montag lives in. He is a fireman, and for years he's rejoiced in the destruction that his flamethrower produces, burning the hated nonsensical books of the past. And you know what the ironic thing about that is, books are illegal, yet not because of our government, oh no, because the citizens of our country made it so! It was the peoples choice to turn their backs on books. Life is not happy when you can think and criticize, form opinions, argue points. It complicates things. So what do they do? They dispense with anything that will allow for that type of communication.But then one night after work as Montag is walking home he encounters a young girl, Clarisse. She is a strange one. But why is she strange? She is strange because she actually talks and listens and looks and observes the things around her. And Montag is fascinated by that quality. He begins to question his job, his life. And then to further tempt his questioning curiosity about books and the reason they are so hated, a job comes in. Another burning is to be done. But this time the lady whose house is the next victim of the torch, sets herslef on fire along with her books. She cannot bare to be witness to the destruction and still live. But before the bonfire begins, Montag secretly snatches one of her books. Disturbed and unstable, Montag goes home and we learn that that is not the first book that Montag has lifted from a burn site. He has collected many books over the last year, secretly wanting to learn what the big deal is about reading and books. His life is not happy like it is supposed to be. Everyone is supposed to be happy without books. Without needing to think, to question, to wonder. He wonders what life was like before life became \\"simple\\". But in reality, the simplicity of life is not the outcome from life without books. With murders and suicides and violence and life at high speed, life is very much complicated. People have only brainwashed themselves into thinking that life is simple and happy, because they no longer think for themselves.I read this book just in time for banned book week. I find it very interesting the reasons people choose to ban this book or that book. Religious content, political views, profanity, nudity, sexually explicit, homosexuality. And you know what I gather from those reasons, the people making the fuss are simply insecure individuals. Each one of those reasons are part of our everyday life. If you are secure in who you are, then you would not feel threatened by its content. But you know, this whole thing with banning books due to content actually promotes the non-thinking, non-opinionated aspects of the society in Fahenheit 451 from happening. When a book is banned or is labeled controversial, it makes people wonder. It piques curiosity to learn what is within those pages that someone finds offensive. Take The DaVinci Code for instance. 80 million copies sold in 6 years! 80 million! That is a staggering number, especially in the short amount of time it's been in print. Now if you took away the controversy, and no one made a fuss, how many copies do you think would have sold? I doubt that many! So I say fuss over books, it brings them to light to some one who may not have known about it otherwise. It promotes critical thinking, opinions, and who are we without our opinions and thoughts? I don't agree with banning books, just because the content is written down doesn't mean it's going to become part of society, because you know what, it already is! So who cares if it's written. People do do drugs. People do have sex. People do say bad words. People are homosexual. And yes, people do have different religious beliefs. Just because you ban a book, doesn't make those things go away. We are individuals. We are who we are. And no one should be able to take that away by saying we cannot write this or that."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is one of his finest works. It was first published in October of 1953, and then serialized in the March - May issues of Playboy magazine. The novel originally began as a short story \\"Bright Phoenix\\", though that was not published until 1963, and from there it was lengthened into the novelette \\"The Fireman\\" which was published in February of 1951 in \\"Galaxy Magazine\\". It is a novel of a dystopian society, and stands along with George Orwell's \\"1984\\" and Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" as the best early examples of that type of work.Though it is easy to find similarities between \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and the other two books, there are some key differences between them. In the earlier two works, the State appears to be the controlling force. We see this in the education centers in \\"Brave New World\\" and every aspect of the society in \\"1984\\", but in this work the society seems to have evolved from this through a change in social norms. People are judged by the number of wall sized televisions they have; books and intellectuals are spurned and eventually considered harmful to society. One should be happy, so news of the war is all in the background, and even the attempted suicide, or someone's death are mentioned in only in passing quickly and then the focus is back on happier subjects. People spend more time being entertained by a program called \\"My Family\\" then they spend interacting with their actual family, and for some children are a nuisance, so they are either not had, or if one has them they are sent off and only seen for short periods.One of the most effective parts of this short novel is the way he incorporates the feel of the society into his writing style. One of the key descriptions of the life which the hero, Fireman Guy Montag, is living is noise. He can't think, because of the noise of the televisions his wife has on, and it is apparent that he didn't even notice this until he met Clarisse McClellan, a free-spirited teenager who has moved in next door with her parents and her uncle. His conversations with her are different, they require thought, and there is time for him to think because they happen outside of the noise of life. This noise continues and gets worse when Clarisse disappears from his life, but she has helped bring forward his natural curiosity. The noise continues, and as Guy deals with his wife, her friends, his boss, the mechanical hound, the other firemen, the signs of war, an old professor acquaintance, etc. This noise is felt by the reader two, as Bradbury throws this mix together, though leaves it clear enough that the reader picks up on what is really going on.This noise is there through the first two sections of the book, and into the third section where at last Guy is pushed over the edge and commits the most desperate of acts, and by doing so he frees his mind. From then on, Guy is able to focus on the situation at hand, his being hunted, his escape, and his desire to save the thoughts and words of the books he has been destroying for so many years. He is able to discuss and think about the war and about Clarisse, his wife Mildred, and his actions; even though those are mostly sad and disturbing thoughts. The reader also feels the noise pressure is lifted, though he is certainly in danger.This is a tremendous book, though very short as far as novels go. It is not simply a rewrite of \\"Brave New World\\" or \\"1984\\". Those works were produced first, and those authors are often given more literary merit while Bradbury is too often thought of as a writer of speculative fiction. Those works teach us to be wary of the government becoming too powerful, while this work teaches us to be wary of our own laziness and the anti-intellectual movement of our society through entertainment such as television. This work also teaches us to be tolerant of those who are not like everyone else. This work was selected to receive the Retro Hugo in 2004 for novels written in the year 1953."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"&quot;Fahrenheit 451,&quot; a book in which the future is a scary place. In the beginning, however, it doesn't seem that way. Guy Montag is a fireman. His job is to create fires, not stop them. He burns books. Books, in this day and age, are illegal. Why? Because books promote thinking, and thinking creates ideas, and the leaders of the world don't want people thinking anymore.Montag steals one book, and then another, and another. He becomes fascinated with them so much, that he kills his superior officer when he finds out Montag has books.This book, although calm through most of the story, is a frightening look into the future. People don't think, so therefore, when someone gets killed, no one cares. There is a huge war going on, but no one knows why, and still no one cares.Bradbury really took the name of science fiction and put it to work, creating a book that was so unique it stretches your imagination beyond all belief."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; begins as an unremarkable piece of writing that makes you wish you had read it in Jr. High school when it would have seemed wondrous by virtue of the &quot;big ideas&quot; it contains. However, half-way through, author Ray Bradbury's dull prose suddenly turns pleasingly lyrical and, in terms of skill and style, catches up to the grandiose theme.The story takes place in a future where firemen no longer put out fires, they set fires - specifically, they set fires to books. The society in which this takes place is one where most people have become so deadened by the vacuous mass media television which pervades their existence, that they don't notice the absence of genuine thoughts or emotions in their lives. They are so numb that even their acts of suicide are committed absentmindedly.The novel follows fireman Guy Montag, who has an emotional epiphany when he meets one person who actually connects with his humanity in a life otherwise devoid of feeling. Feeling sets him to thinking and it's all downhill from there. While there are sections in the book where characters give majestic, pontificating soliloquies about the theme of book-burning which verge on Ayn Rand's literary bludgeonings in &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; there is plenty of suspense and action to offset the grandstanding.Bradbury, known for his futuristic novels is actually more adept here at rendering beautiful descriptions of nature than he is at depicting a three-dimensional futuristic world. When Montag views the destruction of his city by atomic blast, it is less compelling that the simultaneous image of him smelling the leaves and dirt in the forest from where he watches.In some ways &quot;Fahrenheit 451,&quot; chosen by Los Angeles Mayor Kenneth Hahn, as the first selection for that city's participation in the &quot;One Book, One City&quot; reading promotion, was an odd one. The book is, in many ways, a running indictment of the cavernously empty entertainments that many local residents produce on a daily basis. But it's okay, they won't have time to read the book anyway. They're too busy making &quot;reality&quot; shows about adulterous couples on cruiseships which are surprisingly like the stupefying television shows depicted in the book. Maybe someone did read this after all."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I was in high School many moons ago, there were three books about the future that were required reading. Brave New World, 1984, and Fahrenheit 451. All three novels were dark looks at the future of a society that had lost its way. Fahrenhiet 451 is an a dark tale about the problems of modern life and how normal things taken for granted can be turned inside out. Bradbury's hero Montag, is a firemean that has the job of actually setting fires to burn books. For those of you who do not know, Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature that paper catches fire. His world is about modern convenience and the lack of intimacy that society had developed over time. His chance meeting with another leads Montag down a path from book burner to exile on the run trying to save what he once destroyed. Bradbury tells a tale of the redemption of a man and the hope of society by learning what is important. It is an excellent read and very thought provoking. For those of you who do not think that books can ever be burned, I named this review what I did because this book is on an official banned book list in the United States. What do those who want to ban books to our children fear from this book? Makes one wonder."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Play the man, Master Ridley; we shall this day light such a candle, by God's grace, in England as I trust shall never be put out. -Hugh LatimerGuy Montag is a Fireman, but in the future envisioned by Ray Bradbury, firemen don't put out fires, they start them. Firemen are responsible for burning books; all of which are banned, so that the people of this dystopia will not be troubled by difficult thoughts. Instead of reading, they watch endless soap operas on large screen TV's and the government provides for all their needs. Guy has had some qualms about his job, but he's never really thought through exactly what it is he's doing. But then, in short order, he meets an odd young neighborhood girl named Clarisse McClellan, his wife nearly kills herself with sleeping pills and, finally, when the firemen are called to an old woman's house, she refuses to leave:Montag placed his hand on the woman's elbow. &quot;You can come with me,&quot;&quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;Thank you, anyway.&quot;&quot;I'm counting to ten,&quot; said Beatty. &quot;One. Two.&quot;&quot;Please,&quot; said Montag.&quot;Go on,&quot; said the woman.&quot;Three. Four.&quot;&quot;Here.&quot; Montag pulled at the woman.The woman relied quietly, &quot;I want to stay here.&quot;&quot;Five. Six.&quot;&quot;You can stop counting,&quot; she said. She opened the fingers of one hand slightly and in the palm of the hand was a single slender object.An ordinary kitchen match.And before they can light the fire, she lights it herself and Guy is forced to consider what it is about books that would make a person do such a thing. As he tells his wife:Last night I thought about all the kerosene I've used in the past ten years. And I though about books. And for the first time I realized that a man was behind each one of the books. A man had to think them up. A man had to take a long time to put them down on paper. And I'd never thought of that before.As it turns out, the old woman has, like Hugh Latimore, lit a fire that will change the world, because Guy joins the nascent resistance to the book-burning government.He remembers meeting an old man named Faber in a park some time earlier and the hunch he had that the man had a book. Indeed, when Guy tracks him down, it turns out that Faber was a professor and he explains to Guy why books are of value:Number one, ... quality of information. Number two: leisure to digest it. And number three: the right to carry out actions based on what we learn from the interaction of the first two.Each bolstering the other's confidence, Guy and Faber set out to resist the system and, ultimately, Guy escapes to the wilderness beyond the city, where wandering bands of men are preserving great texts in memory, against the day when the knowledge is needed and learning is again valued.While not quite in a league with Orwell or Koestler, Bradbury's classic tale is an important treatment of the central themes of the century (of every century). His vision of a society where people have traded freedom for security had a particular resonance during the Cold War, but it should continue to be read as a cautionary tale. We head to the new millennium in the midst of the most spectacular flowering of Freedom that the world has ever known, but there is a continual tension in the species, between those who value that freedom, whatever its costs, and those who would choose the security offered by a controlled society and those who are afraid of uncomfortable ideas. freedom has the upper hand, but the struggle continues...GRADE: A-"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 depicts the futuristic world that we all fear: One in which freedom of thought and speech are gone; a world where personal communication is cut down to a minimum, and machines and technology are considered friends. In this fictional (but possibly realistic world), pedestrians are few and far between, and firemen actually create fires rather than put them out. Fahrenheit 451 depicts the story of a fireman, Guy Montag, who is a typical twenty-first century citizen; self centered, obsessed with technology, and too busy to appreciate the simple things in life. After meeting a young lady named Clarisse, Montag engages in deep conversations with her, in which he learns to like the small things. Eventually, she even gets him to like the very things that he burns: Books. Meeting this girl also makes him realize how dull and boring his friends and family are, especially his wife. In a climactic ending, Montag escapes from his city after killing the fire-chief and running away with several books. He arrives at a small village of people who each have memorized one book, so as to keep the stories alive (whether or not they physically exist). This book is right next to 'The Martian Chronicles' as far as the best sci-fi books go. As is the case with all of his books, Bradbury paints a picture of a society which has much in common with ours today. He points out the various flaws in our world, but also shows us that there is still hope yet. This book is a must read for anyone, young or old, so go buy it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is an ordinary fireman, if you consider a book burning, flame-thrower wielding zealot to be just that.Ray Bradbury(author of The Martian Chronicles and Something Wicked This Way Comes)tells the story of a society so frightened by its own intellectual and creative potential that &quot;book learning&quot; becomes a criminal offense.Montag, along with his equally ambitious coworkers, burns the home of any man or woman unfortunate enough to be hiding printed literature. But when one woman refuses to leave her home and then stoicly burns beside her collection of books, Montag dares to wonder if all books are so dangerous as the government has trained him to believe.Of course, I can't forget to mention Clarisse, a young woman who seems interested in helping Montag decide for himself whether or not his line of work is justified or foolishly cruel.Fahrenheit 451 is about censorship and the lengths that a future government might go to to restrict the public's ability to access past knowledge. Orwell's 1984 was a slightly better example of this kind of story, but that doesn't take away from the satisfaction of Mr. Bradbury's finely written classic. The book's pace becomes incredibly exciting as Montag learns of his mistakes and decides to go against the common will. The fugitive chase and scholarly transients who keep passages of important texts in their memories(the Bible seems a popular choice of Bradbury)is a near perfect final touch.Go ahead, read this book. It has a lot to say about an important and complex subject and easily keeps your attention throughout."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am writing an essay for my 8th grade AP English class about this book. This is definitely one of the more thought provoking books I have ever read in my 13 years on this earth. Considering that it was written nearly 30 years ago, it is quite remarkable in its prophecy. Just look at what's happening in this country today - countless numbers of mindless chatterboxes on every one of our 325 or so cable stations babbling on about Monica Lewinsky or OJ Simpson or George Bush's alleged cocaine use, or some other utterly senseless topic. And just look at all of these old fools in congress and the senate with nothing better to do than talking about Monica Lewinsky and preaching morality to all of us while they're all sleeping around on their own wives. I think the time is already here. There is no desire in this country for any meaningful ruminations of philosophy or history or the meaning of life. We have become that nation of vain, selfish dullards with no other goal in life except to make ourselves happy with our big screen tv sets and our armies of idiot babblers to tell us what to think. Mr. Bradbury, please write another book to help snap us back into real life."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Looks like I'm in the minority here, but I tried and just couldn't get through this book. Perhaps I needed a teacher to help me get the symbolism!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The world the book depicts is so far from reality that it was a good distraction. I'm sure there were many times in the past, history could have taken a wrong turn & many many books could have been lost. I am certainly glad that didn't really happen. I had an experience once in which I checked out a book titled \\"Paganism\\". I was just curious. All throught the book someone had written in pen that whoever reads the book is working w/the devil. I thought, \\"isn't that special\\". someone ruined a perfectly good book because of their religious beliefs. I showed the book to the librarian and she said she would use white out to fix it or order another book on Paganism."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I love a good dystopian novel, so I bought this book with great enthusiasm. Was I disappointed? Kinda. The novel didn't really feel organic, and I felt that there wasn't a very strong sense of urgency. It was a fun enough read, but I simply didn't feel it was on par with some other dystopian novels (Brave New World and 1984 for example)Everyone praises this book for its anti censorship message, but when you learn the history, Ray Bradbury was only doing two things when he wrote this 1)Telling the negative effects he thought television would have on our future (source: [...]/) and 2)Make money (Not criticizing him for that goal).Bottom Line: I didn't love it, but you might."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I finally got around to this classic young adult novel. I figured since I'm in the young adult literature class for my MLIS, I might as well catch up. I never read the book because I was dryly bored by all of Ray Bradbury's work. I just can't seem to feel any passion for science fiction.Not that Fahrenheit 451 is scifi. There is a strong presence of metaphor in this book; too heavy a presence for my reading delight, though the idea is cute. Firemen ignites fires to destroy knowledge aka power. 1984 with an arson's twist. But the conclusion was so obvious from the start that I thought, why read what's in between?Written during an era of Cold War fear, I can see the appeal of his plot. But I wish Bradbury had either revved up the scifi and gave me an all out apocalypse or gave up on the robotic dogs and let the political hounds do more communist hunting."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The author starts out with a very interesting approach to the problem of censorship, but eventually falls flat. What would have made for a nice magazine sized story, doesn't have the ability to fill out a novel. The book is is mercifully short, but the story is at times dull and pointless and full of dull and pointless characters. The only character of interest is killed off after a couple pages. Its not an entirely fair comparison, but 1984 and Brave New World were orders of magnitude better than 451. The ending is completely unsatisfying and the author's vision of the future, both hopes and fears, do not ring true. Overall its an interesting read just for the concept involved, but keep your expectations low."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have always liked this book to read so I thought I would get it on CD.

Someone needs to re-make the CD's."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm not one for long reviews so.... I was kind of disappointed with the novel. I expected the greatness of 1984 and better writing. Loved the characters though. The ending, I feel, was a let down and not as well written as the first half.

But with Fahrenheit 451, I somewhat admire the genre to some degree. More than anything of course, i admire the novel, which is truly a work of genius and creativity. It took me less than 3 or 4 hours to read it because it was that good! While reading it you can't help but feel a sense of so much irony because of the haunting aspect of a society and of a world where books are burned into ashes. But it's also enlightening that yet, in that world, people like the inspiring Clarisse McClellan, Professor Faber, the \\"Book People\\", Granger and other hopeful outcasts of society, as well as our hero, Guy Montag, can still have that hope and ambition to still keep that curiosity and passion for learning, not only from books, but from life in general. Reading this book overwhelmed me with all those allussions to Shakespeare, Plato, Plato's Republic, Einstein, etc., which embodied the foundation of our conscience in the history of world literature. This book is a quick read, and also an insightful book into a world that has to some extent become our modern society. You can have many twists to looking at this novel yourself. At the end, it's so worth reading the WHOLE thing, and seeing it in different views to make you appreciate more in the power of literature."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The message of this book is that you always need books, no matter if you have internet, TV or whatever, you always will need a book, this message is written in a book of almost 200 pages, so if someone that doesn't like to read reads this book that person will never read again no matter the message, this book goes out of the story so many times that you almost forget that story, maybe the only book who needs to be burnt is this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"when i read Farenheit 451, my first impression was that this book is so screwed up. i mean like who would want to not read a book. thats just so wrong. the one thing i did like about the book was Guy's wife, Mildred. i liked her alot because she said that the t.v was her family. she was a little crazy though. i also liked the part where she called the firemen and told them that Guy had books. then she walked out on him. i also liked the mechanical dog. that was something very original. i gave the book 2 stars because i really thought that it was a waste of time to read it. but you know, that is only my impression of the book.Writen By:Jessica C."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Honestly? It's not that great. I'm giving it four stars because it must have had some incredible super-meta-meaning back in the 1950's. I hate to dock it points due to poor translation to modern times.I read Farenheit 451 as a student, back in the 1970's. Afte all these years, I didn't remember the book too well, but I did remember thinking it was incredibly deep and insightful. I picked it up a few weeks ago, looking to re-engage with a classic. I found it interesting, but tedious. The book is both intriguingly written and poorly written. It is a somewhat impressionistic book, with awkward sentences that work much better after a few glasses of wine or other substance of choice. To the 1970s eye (including mine, at the time) the writing style seemed imaginative and inspired; to the 2011 eye, it seems tiring and perhaps self-indulgent.There's no doubt that Bradbury was a visionary who saw a lot of things coming before they actually came. That said, he nearly missed the point of it all. He saw a future of coerced conformity (in which people would be compelled to give up their books). The more advanced insight might've been that in a bleak future, people would happily give up their freedoms. They wouldn't need firemen to burn books, because they'd voluntarily participate in their own enslavement. The incentive would be, simply, comfort. There are other writers, both fiction and non-fiction, who came a lot closer to this realization. They'd just need an IV filled with state benefits and handouts, in return for which they'd acquiesce in their own serfdom.It deserves the four stars, simply for being a famous classic.

But the concept is old hat in this day where it's a regular affair. It's simply no longer the system shock it once was.

In this story Ray Bradbury portrays censorship in a way that only some one who thinks outside the box can. In this alternate future firemen are paid to burn books. Guy Montag is a fireman that is undecided. Every other fireman thinks only of the great blaze and wicked joy that comes from burning books. But Guy is the only one undecided. When he sets books ablaze he wonders whether this is right. One night while he was walking home from the latest book raid the awful stench of kerosene still in his hair he meets a strange girl who makes him think. What if books were not meant to burn? This question as he knew could endanger him and his wife. So he decided that he would forget about the queer girl. He soon found that it was nigh impossible to forget her. But the next day he was called in for another book raid. This time during the raid he thought about the girl and her strange thought of him saving a book for her. As Guy and his fellow firemen sprayed on the gallons upon gallons of kerosene on the books he saw a sentence of a book he would always remember. He had only a second to think about the sentence because someone reminded him to set the blaze with his salamander engraved lighter. After that he saw one helpless book try to escape the blaze. Like a bird's final push the book went up and down. Through out the book Guy Montag constantly battles with himself what is right and what is wrong."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"First published in 1953, when the hysterical Red Scares of McCarthyism were near their peak, Fahrenheit 451 is set in a world where books are all but banned and critical thought is suppressed. Nonetheless, the author, Ray Bradbury, received from President George, and Laura, Bush, the National Medal of Arts. This was on November 17, 2004, as the attack on \\"scientism\\" was getting into high gear, and the USA Patriot Act allowed the government to compel librarians to release their patrons' borrowing records.The work was originally published in the second issue of Galaxy Science Fiction magazine. In an interview on the DVD, available separately, Bradbury claims that Fahrenheit 451 was his only work of science fiction. The central character, Guy Montag, is a \\"fireman.\\" In this disturbing vision of the future, firemen burn books. Books are all but banned by the government because they have \\"conflicting ideas\\" in them. Those ideas can make people feel bad. It is the government's job to keep people happy, with drugs, television, and other entertainment. Does anyone still remember the term \\"Happy Talk News? Let's keep it positive.The novel plays on the concerns of the time when it was written. Censorship and suppression of thought, mainly through intimidation, was being exercised in the United States. The intimidation was being done by radio and newspaper columnists, who supported McCarthy, who were as rude and ruthless as, say, Bill O'Reilly, on Fox News. The book burnings by Nazis, which started in Germany in 1933 and continued until the end of World War II, were still in living memory. And the world was still reeling from the horrible pictures of the explosions of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as implications of the mass production of nuclear weapons.When the novel was released in book form, the publisher released a censored version that eliminated the words \\"hell\\" and \\"damn\\" for sales to schools. When Bradbury found out about it, he wrote an epilogue describing the censorship and his thoughts on \\"well-meaning\\" revisionism. The epilogue was published in some later editions.And I am sure that somewhere in Kansas, or Ohio, there is a school board that will not allow the novel in the library because of \\"those words.\\"Like Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, describes a hedonist world, where the people need not think. I'll have my Valium now. And I have cable, so there must be something to watch. Maybe a rerun of Jerry Springer."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Having read this novel a few years ago when I was younger, I was hoping now that I would have developed an appreciation for this futuristic experience in words, but I did not. I shall reference specific aspects for my review and explain why this science fiction story still does not appeal to my personal reading preferences.The overall plot includes a fireman named Guy Montag who burns books because they are considered evil now since they make people think and question. The people in this weird society do not read books or think independently. They all watch an overabundance of television on wall size sets and listen to \\"Seashell Radio\\" sets attached to their ears. Montag enlists the help of a retired English professor, Faber, to help him understand the value of books, and why they are in a world with no reminders of history.The \\"normal\\" character in the novel is Clarisse McClellan. If it is assumed that Guy Montag is the protagonist, she is the antithesis of anyone he has met before. She talks with him about the world's beauty and meaning topics which make her an outcast from this society. She makes him curious about the contents of the books he burns. Guy's wife, Mildred, is obsessed with the interactive television programs. She is a shell of a human being without substance whose \\"family\\" attachment is in a soap opera she watches constantly. She is a morbid, complex person who eventually betrays him. The antagonist in this novel seems to be society in general, but also Montag's boss, Captain Beatty. He calls books \\"treacherous weapons,\\" but he clearly uses his knowledge from reading to manipulate Montag without feelings or pity.Guy Montag is a fireman, who burns books and starts fires, rather than put them out, a far stretch of my imagination. After his encounter with Clarisse, he begins to question his empty life, his profession and society. In his intense and reckless pursuit to envision his life and direction, he often blunders and is easily swayed and manipulated by others. The violence and killings throughout the story were not to my liking and interest. The use of the Mechanical Hounds seemed silly and not necessary. In the end, when he joins the \\"Book People,\\" a final war begins, with bombs falling upon the city. This seems to me to be a great start for another novel, one that would appeal to my reading taste."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Written by Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451 is about a fireman whose job is not to put out fires, but to start fires. Guy Montag was a fireman and he enjoyed setting books, and the houses where the books were hidden, on fire. He never questioned the law that said that books were illegal; he just excepted it. It was not until Montag met a young girl who told him about a time when books were legal and people enjoyed reading them that he began to wonder how the world came to be the way that it was. He wondered why people were afraid of books, and he also wondered why some people risk the chance of having their house burnt down in order to own a book. He wanted to learn why the world was the way that it was. He then met a retired professor that helped him to learn and to understand what society used to be like and what the future was going to be like. After hearing this, Montag knew what he had to do, but he was not exactly sure of how he was going to do it.One night walking home from work, Montag met a young girl, Clarisse. This chance encounter with this girl is one of the most significant moments of the book when the idea of the world being different in the past occurred to Montag for the first time. \\"They walked still farther and the girl said, \`Is it true that long ago firemen put fires out instead of going to start them?'\`No. Houses have always been fireproof, take my word for it.'\`Strange. I heard once that a long time ago houses used to burn by accident and they needed firemen to stop the flames.'\\" After this conversation, Montag begins to think. He begins to wonder if this girl who he just met is telling the truth and if he can believe her. This moment stages the rest of the entire novel, and Montag continually comes back to his conversations with Clarisse, like this one, that made him look at society and the past differently.Bradbury's unique ability to create worlds, address important universal themes, and evoke an emotional response in his readers makes him one of the best science fiction writers of our time. For Bradbury each sentence is an important building block that supports his creation without extraneous words and unnecessary frills. For example, note how completely Bradbury conveys the character's mood to the reader with his tight prose in the following quote: \\"I'm numb, he thought. When did the numbness really begin, in my face? In my body? The night I kicked the pill bottle in the dark, like kicking a buried mine.\\" (p. 77)In particular, I recommend Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 which explores the theme of censorship, a topic no less important today than it was in 1953 when the book was first published. Although the setting is ambiguous, one can easily understand that Bradbury is making a statement about the perils we face, if we let ourselves be thoughtlessly censored. If you were at all interested in understanding human nature, political propaganda, or the human thirst for knowledge, I would recommend you read Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"While some authors may have ruined this book by hammering the central theme of the novel with hackneyed phrases and over the top situations, Bradbury succeeds in twisting a tale that manages to nudge the reader towards his point of view. Brilliantly crafted and downright cunning, Bradbury proves to be one of the greatest writers of his, or any generation."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A quick read with a big font, and only 170 pages, yet it was so good.A terrific story of a fireman who doesn't fit in with the rest of the group and then goes a stray.If the book has multiple introductions, prefaces or whatever only read one, (preferably the longest one) otherwise its just repetitive, though somewhat interesting."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I recommend this book to people so that they can finally see whats happening to our society. They can't keep taking things away from us, or this is how we'll end up. We have to be allowed to think for ourselves, not told what we should think."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"\\"The whole culture's shot through. The skeleton needs melting and reshaping. Good God, it isn't just as simple as picking up a book you laid down half a century ago. Remember, the firemen are rarely necessary. The public itself stopped reading of its own accord.\\"--Faber to Montag in Fahrenheit 451Montag is a fireman, but not in the sense we understand. In Bradbury's bleak vision of the future, houses are fireproof, freeing firemen from their traditional roles. Instead, firemen burn books, which have been banned by an oppressive government. A fireman for ten years, Montag takes great pride in his work, but has always harbored curiosity about the objects he destroys.Montag's life is changed by a chance meeting with his new neighbor, a young girl named Clarisse. At the end of their initial encounter, Clarisse asks him if he's happy. The question reverberates in Montag's consciousness, causing him to question his ideas and attitudes, especially on the subject of books. Simply put, Montag's life and psyche are transformed by an idea. At novel's end, he has become a fugitive from justice, but he's happier than he has ever been, for he has discovered the power of the written word.Bradbury's classic novel has only improved with age. Reading the book, you have to be impressed by his prescience in predicting the advent of political correctness, teen violence, the ascendancy of television, the sound bite, and the general decline of our society. You'll also be impressed by his economy with words--in less than 200 pages, Bradbury conveys a powerful, moving message about overwhelming social problems. If you have read it before, it's time to reread it. If you've not yet had the pleasure, you'll get to enjoy a sublime reading experience."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is such a classic, and sadly, I had never read it. Now that I have, I can see why it's a classic and can see why it will always remain one and remain relevant. This was a very powerful book. Picture a world engaged in war, a world full of censorship, a world where there is no speed limit, a world where people do not engage with each other, but rather engage with the walls. This is the world that Ray Bradbury has created in Fahrenheit 451.451 is the number that the firemen wear on their uniforms. The jobs of the firemen are not to put out fires, but rather, start them. Books are banned in Bradbury's world. Books are seen as not real, silly, impersonal, influential, propaganda and will not be tolerated by the government. So it is that the job of the firemen is to burn every book in existence and to imprison the owner of the books. Quite a scary thing. One of the firemen, Montag (the central character) has kept some books of his own. Upon reading them, he finds that books should exist, and you can see the dilemma that this could cause. That's all I'll say so as not to ruin the story for those who have never read this.This is also my first Bradbury work, and I'm very happy that I've finally discovered him. He is Orson Scott Card's favorite author, so I figured he had to be a pretty damn good writer...and he is! I look forward to reading more of his work. I have Something Wicked This Way Comes sitting on my shelf, so that'll be the next Bradbury. I also have a short story by the name of The Homecoming illustrated by Dave McKean.It's very ironic that this book has been banned seeing as the book is about books being banned and censorship. My thoughts on why it may be banned is because of Montag's challenge of authority. This is shown as a good thing in this book and he is the hero, and it's generally not well taken in our society when one goes up against the government or any form of authority. I think it's ridiculous to ban this book though. This book speaks volumes about power in the wrong hands, ignorance, and many other themes that I could go on forever about. Bottom line is that this is a wonderful book and although it has been banned in some places, I'm glad to see that it is required reading in so many other places."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The reason I chose to read Fahrenheit 451 was because my teachers and my group chose it for me.. It wasn't a book I knew much about in the beginning. Some of my peers and friends throughout my school had already read it and the reviews by them would have probably been a bit more harsh than mine. Despite persuasion and influence by my peers, I still think it is an excellent book that is definitely worth reading. After I finished Fahrenheit 451 I discovered it is a very controversial and inspirational book.It's a book that is understandably controversial. It didn't surprise me that it was. The book is based around a main character named Guy Montag who was a fireman but not just your normal fireman. Firemen in this book actually make fires. They make fires to burn books. The society in Fahrenheit 451 believes that books are wrong. They think that it is filling your brain with nonsense. A lot of characters in this book aren't very intellectual; they don't have very deep thoughts, and seem to all have a very short attention span. This was the same for Montag until a teenage girl named Clarisse comes into his life. Clarisse is a deep thinking character that had a great influence on Montag. Montag was persuaded to question everything including his job of burning books, which he never had a problem with before. He realizes the truth about books and about being intellectual. He decides to take actionn.This book is not an easy read in my opinion. It uses a lot of rhetoric throughout the book. It contains many metaphors and a lot of the times the sections you are reading mean much more than what it might appear. I had to read these parts several times to understand them. It's not a book that you can skim or really read in one night with ease. It really causes the reader to think. It really helped that it was a group project in my class. That way I could get someone else's opinion on what a certain section really meant or I could get someone else to explain it to me in a better way than I could explain it to myself. It's a really superb book if the reader has someone to discuss the book with and here other opinions to influence the reader's opinions on what a section or area really means.Fahrenheit 451 is a very interesting, inspirational, and controversial book. It shows how a character changes from calling out other people for \\"thinking to many things\\" to a character that is very intellectual and begins to go into deep thoughts such as \\"The sun burnt every day. It burnt Time . . . Time was busy burning the years and the people anyway, without any help from him. So if he burnt things with the firemen and the sun burnt Time, that meant that everything burnt!\\" This quote proves how Montag progresses through the book but it also shows how the book can be analyzed to get a better understanding of the book. Overall this is an exceptional book. It isn't a book anyone should read if they do not have the time, because of this I would recommend buying it to allow the reader to have unlimited time to read and analyze every aspect of the book. It is an inspirational and controversial book about many meanings, such as censorship and rising against unjust leadership and despite Fahrenheit 451 being a difficult book to read, I would still recommend it give it four out of five stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a frightful vision of what the future may have in store for us. The novel follows a fireman, not just any ordinary fireman that puts out fires and rescues people. This fireman, Guy Montag, creates fires. They are required by law to destroy all books and the houses that contain the books. Weird, I know! Montag's society believes books bring harm and destruction to people mentally and even physically. However, Guy soon begins to realize that all the ideas he once believed in were all morally incorrect and he begins to embark on a quest to cease this destruction and find true meaning in himself and in society.I chose this book for an independent reading assignment for school and I first thought, \\"Wow, this is gunna suck!\\" However, like they always say dont judge a book by its cover. This novel gave way to a new way of thinking about how the future may end up. It was realistic and I guess that's why I enjoyed it. I do recommend this book to anyone that likes easy reading and realistic fiction, though I dont recommend doing four seperate essays afterword for a test grade!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is just a short review of the audio book of this great classic read by the author. The rendition is just terrible. It may be interesting to listen to the author's voice, but he is clearly no professional reader (and of course he should not expected to be!!), his voice is hoarse, and the rendition overall very very unpleasant to listen to, to the point that I ended up stopping listening to the CDs after a short while. I love audio books, but this one cannot be recommended at all, unless you have a special interest in getting acquainted with Bradbury's voice. If you want to listen to a good author who's also an accomplished reader of his own stories, try Neil Gaiman!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a read rich with a delicious story and social commentary. Guy Montag lives in a world made ironic because of the stark contrast to the way we wish our society was today. Firemen don't keep people safe from fires, they bust into houses starting fires. Scholars and professors live on the outside of society because of their love for books, philosophy, and sociology where in our world professors are on the inside and the ignorant majority are on the outside because of their lack of interest for the said disciplines.Literature is correctly portrayed by the leaders of Montag's twisted Earth as a tool that helps people keep in touch with their government and the reality of the world in which they live. This realization by the government lead to a life in which people are encouraged to live \`within' the television. Not literally within the television, but completely enamored by a world of entertainment, visual images, and trivial information symbolized by the television. I have a feeling this society isn't hooked to the Discovery Channel.Some go as far as to suggest that our world today is headed towards being like the world of Fahrenheit 451. The explosion of television, fashion, cinema, video games, and the internet certainly suggest that our society is very much interested in entertainment, and probably at the expense of intuitive thought. However entertainment is not a crime, as we all enjoy being entertained. The publishing business is thriving, and so are newspapers, blogs, and other sources of text. It will be interesting to see how far our Earth will progress towards the world of Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was at the Foreign Language Bookstore on Yanan Road here in Hangzhou when I saw this classic on the shelf. Would you believe I'd never read it? We read some Bradbury in school about 25 or 30 years ago, and he didn't make much of an impression on me. I can't remember why. But knowing the fault could've been mine, I gave him another shot. Books are cheap here, and hey, it's famous, right?Well, folks, it's famous for a damn good reason. Many, in fact. Fifty years old, and it is perhaps more relevant than ever. But so what? Is it good writing? Does it entertain? Does it have real characters? Is it more than just an oh-so-correct theme dressed up as a novel? Oh, yes it is! It's absolutely fantastic and I just plain can't recommend it enough.If you love sci-fi, great. If not, it doesn't matter. I can say \\"transcends the genre\\" with a straight face. Yes I can. I'll be reading this one again, folks. I didn't write it and I'm just sick with jealousy about it, okay?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's hard to write a review for this book that is different from all of the others.All I can say is this is a classic story of censorship and and government intrusion in our lives. This is the 50th anniversary edition and I really enjoyed the author notes in the back. Over the years, Ray had been asked by many people asking to modify his work so it's slightly less offensive, something specifically talked about in this book!Certainly makes you think."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What would it be like to live in a world where firemen go around burning books to \\"protect\\" citizens from thinking? What book would you be if you could be a book? This is one of my favorite thought-provoking dystopias about freedom of the press. A companion book for discussion could be God's Smuggler which talks about smuggling Bibles (a forbidden book) behind the Iron Curtain. Both books are age appropriate for teens and adults."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I just finished reading this book for the third time and it simply gets better with age, like a vintage wine. How can we picture a world where there are no books, particularly novels?Like most of us on Amazon, I'm a voracious reader and have been since I was in elementary school. Books transport us to another world and allow us to have insight into lives, situations other countries that we may never otherwise experience. Good books pose tough questions about ethics, coping with adversity, and dealing with loss, sorrow or facing hard choices -- for example, Sophie's Choice, when she had to choose between which one of her children she would save from the Nazis.When I was 19 and I first read this book, I thought it was just about banning books. I didn't fully comprehend the depth of mind control that would be involved in restricting information, and consequently creating a reality that is so sanitized that it bears no resemblance to real life. No wonder people were glued to the flatscreen TVs and hooked on mood altering substances to get through the day.As always, Ray Bradbury does a fantastic job of making us think long and hard after we put this book down. The video version is also quite good, but I sometimes had trouble making out people's accents, and it was created in the days before subtitles were available. Altogether, a terrific read that bears rereading over the decades."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is set in a dystopian society that any book-lover would loathe. Firemen don't put out fires, they start them. They burn books, all books, for the safety of society. Guy is a fireman who is content with the world around him, until he starts reading a contraband books.Censorship, freedom of speech and the idea that knowledge is dangerous are at the forefront of this novel. Even today, people are still banning books and trying to stop certain ideas from infecting the minds of the populace. The books relevance has clearly stood the test of time, but perhaps that's more a problem with society than praise for this book.While the premise is scary and all too possible, the writing itself is dull. Fahrenheit 451 is a short book full of description. In this case, being overly descriptive isn't a good thing. The wording is choppy and the only time you can really get into the flow of the book is when Bradbury goes on a rambling tangent.The concept is sure to outrage and book-lovers will easily become enthralled with Guy as he embraces the knowledge and power books provide. Fahrenheit 451 is a good book, but it is written in a way that aggravating and distracting. I don't think it deserves the gushing praise that's heaped upon it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was probably 13 and I have loved it every since. It truly is an amazing book and one you can never forget. Randomly during a regular conversation even 10 years after reading this book I find myself connecting coversations to things in the book. A book everyone should read. I can't wait to have my daughter read it in a few years!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most famous works of science fiction, and with \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"1984\\" represents one of the most memorable and haunting dystopias. In a future world, books are banned and firemen actually set fires instead of extinguishing them. The state exercises a form of social control through controlling what sort of information people have access to. It turns out that not all books are banned, only those that we would today consider \\"great works\\" - Plato, Shakespeare, The Bible, Darwin, etc. For me one of the biggest surprises about Fahrenheit 451 was the rationale that was offered for the burning of those books. In a nutshell, they offended politically correct sensibilities and the authorities felt that they would undermine the social cohesion. This expunging of the classics from the culture has an uncanny resonance with the attempts over past few decades to expunge them from the undergraduate liberal arts curriculum. And rationale is also similar: these books are not \\"diverse\\" enough and may offend the sensibilities of an ever-increasing list of \\"minorities.\\" It is hard not to wonder if a milder, softer version of dystopian future that Bradbury was worried about in the early 1950s has not in fact arrived.Bradbury's writing and ideas are somewhere between those of George Orwell and Philip K. Dick. His style is very engaging, and even poetic. His writing is at its best when one of his characters engages in a prolonged monolog. However, the plot development could use some improvement. There is very little in terms of transition from one scene to the next, and most scenes are overly compressed. It is very hard to follow the plot developments at times. Nonetheless, Bradbury is a wonderful stylist and unlike much of science fiction this book is a pleasure to read on a purely literally level as well as for its sweeping ideas.As a last note, I found it incredibly ironic that I read this book on Kindle. Based on this alone I am fairly optimistic that reading and great books will not only survive but in fact thrive well into the 21st century."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Wonderful story.

He reports that the book is of exceptional quality and very easy to use. I would recommend this book based on his comments. I have read this book in hardback, and it is a very good book by Ray Bradbury."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Simply put, society has always been caught up in the pursuit of happiness. And after so much time, we of the modern world have almost achieved it. The only thing that holds us back is the incessant racket caused by thinkers, and all the time we spend pondering their works, to gain no \\"fun\\" out of it all! Better than, that we ignore {or even burn!} their holier-than-thou books and live blissfully in our ignorance {or should we say pure euphoria?}. Analyzation and thought have only ever given us misery...That Bradbury can create a world so perfectly grasped by this reasoning is an incredible literary feet. This argument has slithered into every mind to the point where you can hardly resist believing it yourself as the novel seamlessly flows from page to page.Guy Montag himself composes the perfect vessel through which to traverse Fahrenheit 451's future. He is wracked with doubts and utterly shaken by his fears... that he is the only person in the entire world who notices its paramount shift towards the abandonment of all the lessons we have learned. Bradbury's writing style impeccably mirrors Montag's convoluted thoughts, his words whipping back and forth along every end of the emotional spectrum, capturing every nuance of Montag's terror, rage, anguish, and sheer morbid indifference to his environs......Those environs that perfectly mirror the [...] of our society. At first glance the book might take place in the modern America in which it was written, building a sense of unconscious connection with the reader... A connection which is soon brutally shattered by the seamless integration of nightmarish facets of our [...]: from fire men who \\"protect\\" with kerosene and a match to massive atomic wars constantly shattering the sky. The way these are injected into the story makes them seem almost fitting, as if our society has already fallen so much as to welcome such things. This cruel betrayal of the reader's thoughts is a powerful wake-up call, and will stir strong emotions within you.Fahrenheit 451 is an unbelievable journey through the future. The world conjured up by the work is as perfectly woven as it is terrifying. Its extreme and twisted inhabitants guide you briskly through the tale, and convincingly complete one of the greatest books I have ever read!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Read this book years ago but in having a conversation with my friend's 16-year-old nephew, i thought i would hope on and give a review to a profoundly impactful book. i tossed bradbury my friend's nephew's way when i heard it was not required reading (i read in high school). the reason being: \\"it's too controversial\\" how sad and yet indicative of the very issues bradbury warns us of in his book. having survived the embarassment of the bush admin. and the perversions to thought and liberty (issues bradbury writes on)i can only hope this book experiences a resurgence in class room reading lists."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit gives me a new appreciation of future based plots, it tells of a futuristic world where people have no love of art or creativity, and their lives consist mostly of TV viewing and speeding. Guy Montag, is a firefighter in this strange world, and instead of putting out fires, his job is to start them and to burn all books because they are not wanted because of how they make people think and consider things. This puts us in a place of a heartless society that is, in many ways, like our modern day society.The book is written in an eerie manner that makes you feel uncomfortable about the art deprived world that is being portrayed from the book, which is entirely a good thing. When Montag comes to realize that the world he lives in and the world he has been destroying could be a great place, he decides to stop his work and attempt to create a better world. He finds himself heading through a well detailed journey to create a world with free spirits rather than ignorant drones. The writing of the book is not cryptic however it still has a lost and ghostly feel to it, that really makes you think about our modern day society. For a book written in the 1950's, the idea still applies to today and how our society is in ways heading towards the deprived society that is portrayed in Fahrenheit 451. Bradbury creates a timeless point of how reading, art, and nature are the most important elements of someone's life."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I usually don't like books that look into the future, but Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is an exception to this. I like how the author vividly describes the future. He makes you feel like you are there when the firefighters light the houses on fire. Firefighters of the future don't put out fires but start fires.People of the future wanted to only be happy. They felt that books make you sad and weren't real. Books were made illegal and if you were caught with a book your house was burned and you were put in jail or burned with the house. I like the main character, Guy Montag. Montag is a firefighter with the numbers 451 on his helmet. He takes great pleasure in seeing the bright orange flames that engulf the books and the house were the books were found. The smell, the excitement is all that he needs to be happy. That is until the day he meets up with the \\"crazy girl\\".The story gets more interesting when he listens to the girl who asks too many questions and she was curious about everything. She opened his eyes to other things around him and he is amused by her curiosity. He becomes more interested in books the day when the old lady gets burned in her house. Montag tries to get her out but all she does is chant about books she has read. She makes him realize that books must be important if she was willing to end her life for them. Then a book falls into his hands and a page opens and he reads a few lines. This is the beginning of his interest of books. He wants to learn more and read more but it would be suicide. He's willing to take the chance.I recommend this book because it has a different perspective of the future. It is very interesting and exciting. Some parts are a little slow but once you get past those the rest is good. There is an unexpected twist at the end that adds to the book. Fahrenheit 451 makes you stop and think about the impact that books have on our lives."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What makes an excellent story? Many people have their own thoughts and opinions on this subject. But, what makes a book a bestseller? How does Romeo and Juliet, Animal Farm, Lord of the Flies, and other legendary titles sell? Some of the reasons might be that the titles makes the reader comprehend their thoughts. Another reason could be that the story might make the reader gain knowledge of a life lessons or it might just make the reader emotional towards the story. Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury does all three of those things. Fahrenheit 451 is a tremendous read because it makes the reader comprehend their thought about the consequences of their actions, gain knowledge about life lessons on how to be human, and makes the reader feel emotion through out the story.Bradbury does a superior job in his book Fahrenheit 451 on making the reader think through their thoughts about the actions they take through out life. He introduces a confused and semi-depressed main character into his book named Guy Montag. Guy works for fire department in future America not putting out fire, but making fire to burn books. Right away one sees that Guy is not satisfied with his life at all. He is very puzzled about where he should go in life. Guy sees the pain and agony he brings to people because of his job. One day when he burns a women who would rather be burned with her books then die without them, Guy begins to reflect on why does he do what he does. The reader also starts to think about ones actions towards life. The reader begin to see that Guy has made the wrong choice in becoming a firefighter for it brings to much pain towards others and himself. The viewing of Guy's unhappiness forces the reader think about how ones own actions affect not only other people but one's self too. Seeing how one's actions affect one's self and other people is not the only thing that Fahrenheit 451 shows, it also show simply how to be human.Reading through out the book the reader sees that Guy has tons of choices to make. Guy seeing that since people are prepared to die for their books there has to be something amazingly special about them. Guy starts to hide books for future reading. He has a choice to make. He can read the book and jeopardize his life or he can keep on living depressed, with out looking for answers on how to get better. He makes the choice to read the books so he might learn how to live. The reader can see that Guy made the choice to be human, to risk his life so that he might live life to the fullest. The reader picks up that in order to live life too, one will have to take risks also. Guy finds that poetry helps him become less angry and irritated when he reads it. Not everyone in his life thinks the same things. His wife and her friends think that literature is pointless and when he reads it to them, some go to complain. Through this the reader can see that making the right choice to live like one thinks a human should live doesn't always agree with everyone. The reader starts to feel emotion for Guy. What should guy do about this situation? The book does another victories job on making the reader feel for the book and the outcome.Bradbury hooks the reader into the story by forcing one to be emotionally attached to the story. Guy is a character that everyone feels for because somehow one can relate to him. One can relate to Guy by knowing how hard it is to make risky choices, being depressed about life, having a job, or even not knowing what to do about certain situations. Guy has gone through all of those situations and more. After Guy's wife's friends turns him in, he goes back to his job and burns the book he was reading. Right after that the firemen gets called to go out to burn books. Guy finds out that he has to burn his own house. Guy can't stand this fact and kills the firemen and escapes from the law. The reader starts to get even more emotionally attached to the book by the suspension of if Guy will get caught or not. The book does a stupendous job of keeping the reader in the story the whole time. This is the best reason for why the book is not just a ordinary book but fanatic tale of a man who chooses to live rather then to die.From getting emotionally evolved with the book, to learning how to be human, and even making the reader comprehend their actions, Fahrenheit 451 is an extraordinary book. The novel desires not only to be on being on the bestseller list of all time but deserves to be on every shelf of every house. For this book is not just a book but a masterpiece of art."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I taught &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; as the example of a dsytopian novel in my Science Fiction class, although it is certainly one of the most atypical of that particular type of narrative discourse. Compared to such heavyweight examples as George Orwell's &quot;1984,&quot; Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World,&quot; Yevgeny Zamiatin's &quot;We,&quot; Ray Bradbury's imaginative meditation on censorship seems like light reading. But the delicious irony of a world in which firemen start fires remains postent and the idea of people memorizing books so they will be preserved for future generations is compelling. Of course, there have been more documented cases of &quot;book burning,&quot; albeit in less literal forms, since &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; was first published in 1953, so an argument can be made that while all the public debate was over how close we were the Orwellian future envisioned in &quot;1984,&quot; it is Bradbury's little parable that may well be more realistic (especially in terms of the effects of television).The novel is based on a short story, &quot;The Fireman,&quot; that Bradbury published in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; in 1951 and then expanded into &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; two years later. However, those who have studied Bradbury's writings caw trace key elements back to a 1948 story &quot;Pillar of Fire&quot; and the &quot;Usher II&quot; story from his 1950 work &quot;The Martian Chronicles.&quot; Beyond that, there is the historical record of the Nazis burning books in 1933. The story is of a future world in which everyone understands that books are for burning, along with the houses in which they were hidden. Guy Montage is a fireman who has been happy in his work for ten years, but suddenly finds himself asking questions when he meets a teenage girl and an old professor.&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is not only about censorship, but also about the inherent tension in advanced societies between knowledge and ignorance. Reading this novel again I am reminded about Pat Paulsen's editorial on the old &quot;Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; (a series well acquainted with the perils of censorship) about how we might enjoy freedom of speech in this country but we do not enjoy freedom of hearing because &quot;there is always the danger of something being said.&quot; Censorship, in practical terms, is the effort of those who do not want others to hear what they find offensive, for whatever reasons, basically because it leads to people thinking thoughts they do not want them to be thinking. Through the rambling diatribes of Captain Beatty, Bradbury makes this point quite clear to his readers.Even though this is essentially a novella, Bradbury's work retains the charm of a short story. The recurring use of animal imagery throughout the story, the use of the mythic ideas of the salamander and the phoenix, make &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; more poetic than any other dystopian work. Even if it is predominantly a one note argument regarding censorship, it is impossible to deny that Bradbury makes a clear and convincing case for his position. Besides, there is something to be said for any work that insures that beyond the point at which water freezes the only other recognizable number on the Fahrenheit scale is the point at which book paper starts to burn."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's true: A lot of what Bradbury predicted for us when he wrote his classic Fahrenheit 451 about 50 years ago is becoming more and more eminent in today's world. Scary, yes?Books are on the decline, especially in our younger generation. Although a total ban/burning seems a little farfetched and unlikely, it is possible the public will lose interest in books year after year until there are no books being bought anymore... a sad day that will be.People are relying more and more on TV and other forms of &quot;entertainment&quot; ... some are filling, but most are rather empty. Are we destined to become mindless and frivolous like Mildred and Co.? If we keep on going at this rate, yes.&quot;Cliffsnotes&quot;, although they seem innocent enough, are on the rise. You can see cliffsnotes *replace* the good ol' classics in the classroom today, unfortunately (&quot;learn this classic in five minutes!!&quot;) A lot of today's kids are missing out on the great classics by reading only the material that leaves no room for their own personal interpretation...Children are killing each other, as Clarisse points out (&quot;I'm afraid of children my own age. They kill each other.&quot;) We have our fair share of adolescents murdering their own peers in the . How would Bradbury have known?Seashell radios - aka cd players, perhaps? People don't listen anymore because they're immersed in their own world of music. Not a good thing.All these (and more) got my eyebrow raising. Books that open your eyes and mind are rare gems. Although Bradbury's style might take some time to get used to - it took me a ton of rereadings and highlights to understand - this is very riveting, and I recommend picking up this book. Like my teacher said, your mind will not think the same after reading this classic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have owned this book for a very long time and have read it more than once. In this day of computers and a near-paperless society, it would be tragic indeed if, for some reason, books were not only banned, but special &quot;fireman&quot; would come to collect and burn them, not to mention the prosecution and punishment of the book-loving individual. This work by Bradbury is among my other favorite sci-fi works, old and new: &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Puppet Masters&quot;, &quot;Foundation&quot;, &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Ringworld&quot;, all the &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; books, as well as books as new to the genre as &quot;Advent of the Corps&quot; and others."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was a good book. There were some good aspects but also a few bad. The first aspect of the novel is how futuristic it is. It was hard to follow in some places. One example is &quot;And the uncles, the aunts, the cousins, the nieces, the nephews, that lived in those walls,&quot; (pg. 44). This is talking about a tv family that Mildred watches but she talks about them like they are her real family.Also Bradbury discribes some things in a way that is difficult to understand. For example, when he describes the stomach pump used on Mildred, &quot;One of them slid down into your stomach like a black cobra down an echoing well looking for all the old water and the old time gathered there. It drank up the green matter that flowed to the top in a slow boil&quot; (pg. 14). This was hard to understand. I had to look at Sparknotes to figure out what he was talking about in some of the parts.Bradbury is very descriptive, which allows you to picture the novel while you read. &quot;With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history,&quot; (pg. 3). This really describes how he burns books in great detail. You can picture it in your mind what he is doing and how he is doing it.&quot;Her head was half bent to watch her shoes stir the circling leaves. Her face was slender and milk-white,and in it was a kind of gentle hunger that touched over everything with tireless curiosity. It was a look, almost, of pale surprise; the dark eyes were so fixed to the world that no move escaped them. Her dress was white and it whispered,&quot; (pg. 5). This shows how he describes his characters in great detail. He uses character developement so that you get a feeling for all of the characters. He also doesn't have so many characters that you get lost.The book as a whole is very good. The meaning behind it about the society could happen in the future. One day society could get as bad as it is in Fahrenheit 451. They tried to make everyone happy but there was still war and death which make people sad. They were hiding people from the truth of the world by not letting them read books. I think this is a good book and I would recommend it; just be aware of how futuristic it is."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I first began to read the book I was excited at the idea of a fireman's job was to burn books, not read them. As I read more I realized that this is what is happening to today's society but not to the same level of watching TV and not reading as much. People watch more TV than ever before and read less. You can ask anyone about any TV show and they probably have seen it. Reading books has become a inferior form of entertainment since the invention of TV and radios and other forms of entertainment.Montag, the main character in Fahrenheit 451, is a fireman who doesn't any longer put out fires, but starts the fires. The job of the fireman is to burn all books because they are illegal and not wanted in society. People have turned to wall TV's or parlor walls and seashell radios that fit in your ear for entertainment and pleasure and enjoyment so they don't have to have feelings and choose between right and wrong. People no longer care about their government or even their on children. Montag thinks that everyone is happy with their chosen society but he meets a girl named Clarisse who is a teenager that moved in next door to him. She talks to Montag about what firemen used to do and Montag couldn't believe what she was telling him. She asked him questions that made him think which he didn't like. She confused him but he listened to what she had to say and walked home from work with her everyday.A few things that changed Montag's views of their so called happy society was when he found his wife lying on her bed having overdosed on her sleeping pills which could have killed her. These men came in to help her by cleaning out her stomach and purifying her blood stream and then they were on their way. Montag realized that this was an everyday event for these men and many people have tried this suicide attempt. Montag understands that the people may enjoy their entertainment but they are still unhappy. He and his wife were even unhappy and he was going to change this. A second reason was when they were called on duty to burn some old ladies books. The police usually would come and arrest the person committing the crimes but they had not come yet and the old lady wouldn't let them burn her books. The firemen covered the illegal books in kerosene and the lady actually lit the match that burnt her and her house down because she didn't want to live without her books. Montag didn't understand why someone would die for their books. What was so good about them? He got fired from his job for having books and ran away to try to change society. He met up with other men who used to be professors at a college and they decided to leave their city and try to start again somewhere else. As they left a bomb was dropped on their city and they saw the remains of the city and turned around to go and start their new society.I really liked this book because I can relate to it. People in our society are reading less and enjoy the entertainment of television and radios just having fun in life. I don't think it will ever get as extreme as written in the novel but is closely related to it. I really enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I thought that Fahrenheit 451 was an ok book at best. I did think that the plot was very creative, but very far-fetched at the same time. While the fact that I am not a big fan of fiction books that stretch the truth may have some say in my decision, I was still disappointed with other things. I thought that the author did a poor job of mixing up his vocabulary as well as using very little detail to describe things. If the author wants to write a book about the future, he needs to do a good job of telling us what he wants or thinks it will be like. I had heard a lot of good things about this book and that is the reason I decided to read it. In the end I was very disappointed with the book and wouldn't recommend it to most people. There were some things in the book that I enjoyed though such as certain quotes. Here is one quote that I enjoyed: \\"Only the \`family' is people.\\"(Page 84). I believe that this means that only people are real, books are not.So in conclusion, I believe that those people who get into crazy future books may enjoy it, but I personally was disappointed. My expectations may have been too high, but either way its only my opinion."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A book to sit side by side with '1984' and 'Brave New World,' Bradbury's classic on censorship is less bleak in execution than 1984 and more focused than 'Brave New World,' resulting in a thoroughly readable tome that remains as relevant today as it was years ago. Not as good as '1984,' nor as overrated as 'Brave New World,' F451 is a pleasing mix of warning, cynicism, and pure future paranoia. Very nice.As always with Bradbury, expect a steady pacing to his prose with an almost melodic rhythm. Bradbury reads well, especially aloud, and rewards readers who allow themselves to sink into the pace of the book.You'll note, 9 out of 10 bad reviews of this book on Amazon come from disgruntled high school students who found Bradbury's phrasings too unwieldy or the story to be too &quot;slow.&quot; (i.e., not action-packed enough). Not unexpected, and rather ironic, when looked at from a certain point of view, as these narrow-minded children would live quite well in Bradbury's fictional future. Bradbury's warnings ring true.Bradbury readers should pick this up without pause. Those who enjoy bleak stories of potential futures, too, should explore this important work."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is not only about censorship and government control but is also about mankind's denial to confront the very things that make us human. Control is a good thing in society however to much control can make you paranoid and a threat not only to yourself but to society. This book is very relevant to even today's time when we seek to censor not only books but anyhting we deem harmful. This book is even being censored as I write. Such cnesorship has its basis within a lack of understanding and puts our society on the path of retrogression.This is book is probably best for those who are just beginning to tapp into their conscious mind and examine the world around them. I recommend this book for a mature, discerning mind"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I believe that the book Fahrenheit 451 was very well written and very interesting. Mr. Bradbury made the book have a lot of good vocabulary for a 12 year old to learn. This book is one of the better books that I have had to read in school. Prior to reading this book I never really liked science fiction books. This book has changed that dramatically. It also taught me fun facts like (before reading this i didn't know) paper burns at 451 degrees. WOW if a book can just do that, i don't even know why people would ban them in the future. LOL :)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I heard about this book from noticing it cropping up on listmania lists on this website as a very \\"literary\\" book, meaning pretentious and boring. Now i've read it, i can almost not see why its there - true, the book is artistic - bradbury lists every adjectival detail of his narrative, at times painstakingly - if you like prose where if there's smoke, its wispy and curling and dissipating, instead of being able to imagine what it looks like - then Ray Bradbury is for you. At times this style of writing feels laboured, and many recognise it as simple artistic. I happen to feel that a true artist knows when to linger and when to stride forward and get straight to the point. I could argue that Bradbury fits into this category. In fact, his story of Montag, a \\"fireman\\" in a futuristic state where books have become the enemies and need to be destroyed - is quite an action based piece which set the tone for much successive science fiction. Of course, Bradbury was not the founder of this genre, though i don't know much about it, i think George Orwell's 1984 and Huxley's Brave New World preceded it. It is old - about 1950 i think, but it doesn't feel old. I thought Bradbury's nervous fear of the advent of television in the 40's was funny, but has ended up being quite prophetic - TV has indeed come to be quite a maniupulative medium.If you love a book which is big on story as well as being big on ideas, if you love a nostalgic adjective-packed prose, if you love science fiction - and if you don't, just damn well read 1984 and then maybe some Phillip K Dick like i did, and you'll see what all the fuss is about - and btw, science fiction isn't really science, its ABOUT science, or the fantasy of science, what science can do to us, the thirst for knowledge and advancement - but its really about people struggling against a system. Actually, strike all that, SF is about story. In fact, its one of the best genres for telling ideas through story.In Fahrenheit 451, the idea is censorship, freedom of thought, and the repression of it by the state - and its told through the involving story of Montag, the officer of repression who finds himself in a bit of a pickle when he accidentally spies a line of prose on a page he's been ordered to burn, and wonders what the big mystery is.Plus, its short - only about 150 pages - so you can eat it up over a couple of long train rides if time is a factor.For me, though, only 3 out of 5 because i started struggling about half way b.c of the profusion of adjectives. But for some people, its a plus - if you have trouble imagining novels, then Bradbury gives you all the info, almost like on a movie screen.B.P"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a portrait of civilization in collapse.Bruno Bettelheim once gave a lecture in which he said that modern mass-society displays a manic and unhealthy preoccupation with speed and motion, and that this preoccupation betrays the inner emptiness of \\"a hollow man\\". \\"Instead of asking where we are [inwardly] we just jump into the car and say, 'Let's get going'.\\" Like Mike Judge's satiric filmIdiocracy, Ray Bradbury's novel Fahrenheit 451 develops the idea of a fallen modernity to its logical conclusion. But unlike Idiocracy, Fahrenheit 451 is no satire. It is serious social criticism without a glimmer of humor. Bradbury's fictional world is a fascist state built on what NeoCon Philip Zelikow calls \\"public presumption\\", \\"public myth\\" --- shared ideas assumed to be true but not known to be true. In other words, reality is what a government says it is. Bradbury's fictional world shares much, therefore, in common with George Orwell's novel 1984.The plot is built around the awaking conscience of a government employee, a firefighter who has always accepted public presumption as truth. The awakening is not pretty. Guy Montag, the protagonist, begins to question his culture: Mindless entertainment, disrespect for life, constant motion. In Guy Montag's culture, the public presumption is that books are a potential terrorist threat. The job of firefighters, therefore, is to seek out and burn books. Given recent developments in US politics and society, Fahrenheit 451 --- like Orwell's 1984 --- has become more trenchant with each passing year. Bradbury explores the longterm moral and social implications of our present Zeitgeist."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a story about a sick and twisted future in which books are forbidden by a Totalitarian Regime. The concept of this story originates from the time of WWII in which Hitler's Regime was burning libraries across Europe in an attempt to prevent the distribution of knowledge and other negative ideas that could affect his rise to power. This book is an exciting tale about a world in which firemen no longer extinguish fires, but instead start them. The firemen in this world burn all the books and the houses in which they are contained.We feel that this store, despite its dark tone, is a well-written modern day classic that makes the reader better respect books and not take them for granted. I highly recommend this book to anyone that wishes to read a thought-provoking story that provides insight into our future. An interesting aspect of this novel is how well it connects with our world today. Our society is becoming more and more reliant on technology and is becoming less interested in education, which sadly enough, is the same story in Fahrenheit 451. Could this be a reality for our world in the near future?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The world of tomorrow, where no one knows what could happen next. Everyone has their opinion, and Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is a great example of a realistic future. This book is a cautionary story. The message is that we should consider the dangers of electronics, if we don't, people will start to forget the value of books, reading, and learning. I really enjoyed this book and reading what the author thinks the future holds.Fahrenheit 451 is based in the 24th century where electronics and television are valued more than school, learning, and books. Reading is considered a crime. Firemen are now used to destroy books. Guy Montag is one of those firemen. After meeting a neighbor, Clarisse McClellan, he is left wondering about his world and what it has come to. Upon Clarisse's death, Montag considers books and what is going on. He starts stealing and reading books. Montag says in part 1, \\"There must be something in books, things we can't imagine, to make a woman stay in a burning house; there must be something there. You don't stay for nothing.\\" Turned in by his wife, Mildred, Montag finds himself having to destroy his house and getting arrested. He manages to escape by murdering his chief. While hiding from the police, Montag meets a group of men hiding for the same reason. In the end, Montag leaves his city as it is being bombed and a war has begun.Fahrenheit 451 teaches us that we need to realize the value of books, reading, and thinking. Also, it's showing us the dangers of electronics. Every day some new technology comes along and people tend to rely on it way too much. This book is trying to tell us that we should realize and understand how addicting electronics can be, and that we need to always value books, reading, and learning.Fahrenheit 451 is very good and I really enjoyed reading it. It was very suspenseful and you always wanted to keep reading to find out what happens next. It isn't a very hard book to read, and it also isn't very long. It only has a couple flaws. It felt very rushed in the beginning, and it didn't give a good description of the characters. However, people should read this book because not only is it a very interesting story, but it also cautions us about the future. I give it 4 stars out of 5. If you enjoy this story, some other books like it are: \\"1984\\" by George Orwell, \\"A Brave New World\\" by Aldous Huxley, and \\"The Caves of Steel\\" by Isaac Asimov.Fahrenheit 451 has great messages about how we should consider the dangers of electronics and TV. Other messages include how valuable books, reading, and thinking really are. I definitely think that others should read it as well. I can't wait to try reading other books that are similar to this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury wrote the novel Fahrenheit 451 in the spring of 1950, while living with his family in California. At the time that Bradbury was writing the novel, the surrounding society began to read condensed versions of books, not wanting to bother with thinking too much about the actual full-lengthed book. This little bit of information found its way into Fahrenheit 451 and is part of one of its larger themes that deal with ignorance and censorship.In Fahrenheit 451, Bradbury builds a futuristic environment in which books are degraded by burning, a method which enables society to achieve equality. The title is significantly chosen because it represents the temperature at which books ignite. The majority of the members of this revolutionary society do not want books destroying their equality; they hate to feel inferior to others who have read more books and have obtained more knowledge.One of the key elements that Bradbury stresses in this novel is \\"knowledge versus ignorance.\\" In a society with no books, there is a better chance of equality among the people. If all the books are banned and then thrown into an incinerator, the envy and jealously of knowledge stops, which in turn makes society content. Because of this lack of knowledge and experience with books, the general public becomes consumed with technological advances, such as \\"Seashells\\" which are described as electronic devices, situated in the ear, that speak directly to the user. Books are burned in answer to differing opinions. If no one reads books, then no one can be offended by what the books have printed in them. It is all a systematically planned structure to endorse \\"sameness\\" among the members of society.Montag enjoys burning books until he meets his neighbor, Clarisse McClellan, who gives Montag a shove towards a new way of believing. She does not fall victim to the censored society norms and views the world from a different perspective, playing a key role in enhancing the plot. She is described as having \\"odd habits\\" which often times included nature, spending time by herself, and asking questions; all activities which were frowned upon by other members of the community. Clarisse tragically gets hit by a high-speed car and dies, only encouraging the idea that Montag's life needed rearranging. After all, Clarisse was the first one to ask if Montag was really happy in life and only after her tragic death does he realize how unhappy he has become.Truth is what one has faith in. Montag begins to have faith in books and the knowledge that he gains from them, and so he commences to find his inner truth. Bradbury devotes a small section of the novel to the discussion of truths in the chapter entitled \\"The Sieve and The Sand.\\" While Montag is struggling over what the books offer to him and what he reads, he has a flashback to a time when he was on the beach attempting to fill a sieve with sand to win a dime. With this task came frustration because no matter how hard he tried, he could not fill the sieve up with the sand. A similar situation arises with Montag in his present state; he knows that something good will come out of the books, but he just has a hard time \\"filling up the sieve,\\" or figuring out what that something is. In a theological sense, the sand can come to symbolize the concrete truth that Montag desperately tries to find, while the sieve represents the intellect seeking a truth that is much greater, indefinable, and impossible to seize.Throughout the novel, Montag increasingly becomes estranged from his wife, his co-workers, and society as a whole. As he becomes more interested in books, he loses the common beliefs that tie him to the society in which he lives. No longer is he victim to the violent overthrow of nature, knowledge, and books. Montag is able to fight against his doubts and separate himself against the others in hopes of a better tomorrow.Montag stumbles upon a group of men sitting around a campfire, a fire which is comforting and inviting; a stark contrast to the fire that Montag is used to. Granger, the leader of the group, quickly welcomes Montag and describes the group as the \\"Book People.\\" The group is part of a nation-wide network of people devoted to saving books. Each member memorizes a book and waits until the opportune time to tell the retained knowledge. Montag is given a title to remember and recite and thus is initiated into the book society. The novel ends with Montag's spiritual revitalization - own intellectual journey - and the complete destruction of the city due to the war that very few citizens were aware of. Bradbury leaves Montag and the \\"Book People\\" to revive the city and with hopes of a new society where books will flourish.The \\"Book People\\" are alienated from society in that their ideas and theories are different from the accepted beliefs of the city dwellers. Instead of burning books, the \\"Book People\\" acknowledge a book's worth and capture the words of wisdom in their memories. The members of this elite group live outside the city, on the outskirts of the woods or wherever the path of knowledge leads them, thus separating them from civilization.The futuristic environment created by Bradbury may have been influenced by society at the time, however, society may actually be slowly slipping towards this censored environment. Just like in the novel, modern governments now censor news and media to influence the opinion of its people. Internet sites like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter are just a few examples. By promoting censorship and \\"sameness\\" you limit societies progression that is gained the knowledge included in reading. If this trend continues we may all change our names to Guy Montag and hope for the phoenix to rise from the ashes of our destructed society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"im in highschool right now and had to read this book for summer homework. normally i find reading books for class to be strenuous, but i really enjoyed this book. being the first time i read a piece of bradbury's work, i definently came away impressed with his unique writing style. it makes you re-think how we use technology in our daily lives and offers a future that is frightening to consider. a really good story to top it off, this book is well worth a read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was the first book I had to read for school that I actually liked, and was therefore to a large extent responsible for keeping my love of reading alive into adulthood. That was nearly two decades ago, and rereading it now has been an equally delightful experience. It is a truly great novel, and this is even easier to appreciate after having read the earlier versions \\"The Fireman\\" and \\"Long After Midnight\\", which by comparison and contrast serve to highlight the structure, the richness of descriptive detail, the astonishing variations in metaphors about heat and fire (and their opposites) throughout, and more. Even apparently trivial lines of dialogue are laden with layers of meaning, as when Montag's wife tells him, \\"You don't look so hot yourself.\\"It is also fairly philosophically sophisticated. While the novel is about a fireman who burns books, and Bradbury is clearly enamored of books, they are just a symbol: \\"It's not books you need, it's some of the things that once were in books. The same things could be in the 'parlour families' today. The same infinite detail and awareness could be projected through the radios and televisors, but are not. No, no, it's not books at all you're looking for! Take it where you can find it, in old phonograph records, old motion pictures, and in old friends; look for it in nature and look for it in yourself. Books were only one type of receptacle where we stored a lot of things we were afraid we might forget. There is nothing magical in them at all. The magic is only in what books say, how they stitched the patches of the universe together into one garment for us.\\"And it is not just about one political program versus another, or even about the individual versus the state, but about independence in the moral sphere, thinking and feeling for oneself: \\"I took the others on faith!...I don't want to change sides and just be *told* what to do. There's no reason to change if I do that.\\"He even abstracts from books to the nature of creative activity in general: \\"It doesn't matter what you do,...so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that's like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching.... The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.\\"And there's so much more that's absolutely wonderful in this book that I can't even touch on here. Bradbury isn't always entirely consistent and the book has some other minor flaws, but they are insignificant compared to its virtues. Four and a half stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When Ray Bradbury died on June 5, 2012, his classic novel \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was sitting on my bedstand. I had picked up the 50th anniversary edition while romancing a quaint, quality bookstore (yes, some still exist) in Montpelier, Vermont. (Sorry, Amazon, it was just a fling, but oh what an affair.) It was a book that I had somehow neglected to read up to this point in my life and thought it high time that I did so.Published in 1953, the story takes place in an American city several decades in the future (which would be, I guess, about now). Bradbury depicts a society in which the state picks up where the public left off: having largely abandoned the written word, people live to be mesmerized by music, by moving pictures, by all manner of electronic stimulation. The state simply completes the migration by banning books altogether; books, the state asserts, cause people only confusion and unhappiness. Fire departments, rather than putting out fires, now burn down houses containing books. (Houses had been made fireproof, so there was no need to put out fires; on the other hand, it takes a lot of fire department-provided kerosene to get them burning.) In the background of the story, the U.S. is also on the verge of nuclear war with some unnamed country; bomber jets forebodingly streak across the sky at supersonic speeds. The message of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is transparent: electronic media is fast becoming the opiate of the masses, who have become so numbed by electronic sound, image and color that they pay little heed to their potential annihilation.Guy Montag is a fireman (in the new sense) who, having long been secretly intrigued by books, now finds that he is inflamed with the desire to protect them. His wife, who is nearly always either zoned out with a \\"seashell\\"--an iPod-like device--in her ear, or transfixed by the three-wall-sized 3D color television, is frightened by her husband's illicit bibliophilia. Lonely, Guy makes a series of impulsive, dangerous moves that he cannot walk back.The novel moves fairly briskly, and at about 165 pages, one can burn through it more-or-less quickly. Bradbury's language is surprisingly literary, though; the result is a pulp fiction story written in highbrow style. Sometimes his language sings, sometimes it comes off as merely prolix or high flown. I was also struck by how like 1950s television teleplays parts of the novel read: characters talk to each other in articulate mini-speeches, or they erupt in emotional ejaculations: \\"You're mad!\\" \\"Why would I be mad!\\" \\"Because!\\" Think \\"Playhouse 90.\\"Bradbury was prescient about both the miniaturization of electronics (the seashell earbud radio) and its extreme opposite (super large-screen, 3D color television). But he either didn't think of e-books, or perhaps dismissed the possibility as simply a stage towards the utter elimination of books.What Bradbury seemed less able to do was to think beyond the social norms of his own time: besides a sylph who serves as the catalyst for Montag's later actions, the only other intelligent, thoughtful characters are male. Bradbury belittles this line of criticism in the coda to his book (pp. 177-78, e.g., \\"For it is a mad world and it will get madder if we allow the minorities...to interfere with aesthetics\\"), but I don't think he gets off quite that easily. The point is not that there aren't women in the book, it's that almost all of them are nitwits and, perhaps for that reason, they don't appear at all among the story's intelligentsia. At one point, for instance, a group of people who all have memorized books gather round, and not one woman among them. Really, Ray?What of his central point about the rise of electronic media and the decline of books? How relevant is the story to today's reader? To my mind, Bradbury's story continues to be insightful about social trends, just not quite with the same sense of dread. Smart phones and e-tablets proliferate. Bookstores are disappearing and fewer books are being read by fewer people. According to a 2007 study by the National Endowment for the Arts, \\"On average, Americans ages 15 to 24 spend almost two hours a day watching TV, and only seven minutes of their daily leisure time on reading.\\" But do people care? In \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" the sense of dread is heightened by apocalyptic notes of imminent atomic war. Would there be greater concern over the slow death of reading for pleasure if there were a renewed sense of doom in our society?In short, Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a thought-provoking novel about a dystopian future. It's excellent material for a book club, if there are still any left."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A standard in the dystopian utopia that Brave New World and 1984 also capture, this is the third in a triad of phenomenal dystopian books written that everyone should read. While banned in some jurisdictions, the idea of book burning and reading being illegal is still a serious issue. We ban books in our library systems, and in our schools. While we do not burn books on a regular basis, the vision timeliness of this book still has not faded since it first came out in print.The book centers on a \\"fireman\\" Guy Montage and how he has to adjust his beliefs in line with the people around him that he meets, especially the Professor and the teen-age girl that provide an interesting counterpoint to the vacant wife that he lives with. Books are dangerous, and in the society here, even more so as books are burned, and the newspaper is reduced to a comic strip without words. As he looks around the environment that he lives in and compares his needs to the way that the world is going, supervisors, wife, and friends all notice that he is pulling back from long held beliefs. This is the problem, and the reason that the book works so well. While the society is not constantly monitored like in other books, friends and family eventually have a major impact on where Guy goes, and what Guy does throughout the course of this book. It is almost like he has no control or purpose outside of what others think, say, watch, or do.This is probably the best Bradbury book written, and should be on everyone's bookshelf. Five of Five stars, the more copies in the house the better."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"True FictionThough this book [Faremhieght 451] is a piece science fiction, it relates in its own little ways to the way the world is today. I, for one, can see this world of ours turning into a world with the same basis and same ideals that make up this book Farenhieght 451; a world which trys to keep everyone happy and careless about everything to the point of making people seemingly mindless, and in the process of doing so they destroy everything that brings people feeling and a individual way of thinking. Farenhieght 451 is a must read for anyone who likes a good philosophical novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am a few years out of college and most people are shocked to find out that I have never read \\"Fahrenheit 451.\\" Given how much of an avid reader I am, it is rather shocking that I had never read this. I was never assigned this in High School, though in retrospect I would have rather read this than the books I read in High School, such as John Steinbeck novels, my arch nemesis. I was also shocked to see that as I'm writing this 79 people gave this book a rating of one star. Clearly these people do not know what is out there; this book is not that bad. Granted I have some misgivings about the book, but it brings up some excellent concepts and I can't help but feel these people lack the education level to go beyond what the book is about. Maybe I am simply thinking on this level because I am older and can no longer truly identify with the High School mentality, but I don't think I ever did. There is this factor and the fact that their reviews were quite poorly written for the most part, so they clearly lacked literary prowess and their reviews do not hold much weight.Either way you look at it this book is now considered quite the classic. It is usually lumped together with Orwell's \\"1984\\" and I do agree with others that \\"1984\\" was the better story. Orwell created a much more vibrant and tangible world, Bradbury on the other hand did not succeed nearly as well. I can't help but think that Bradbury likely had read \\"1984\\" and thought of a slightly different worldview and thus did not feel the need to flesh his ideas out nearly as much. Whatever was the motivation for this, it was not a great move. This book starts off fairly slowly and ends on a rather sour note making the reader want to know what happened after.Essentially the reader is thrust into a futuristic world where it is illegal to read or own books. Thus most of the population is borderline mentally challenged and gets most of its information through news blips on their television screens or these radio earbud things. (Strangely we have earbud headphones now that are quite popular.) During this technological advancement they also made houses fireproof and thus no longer needed firemen, but they eventually developed a new job for them... burning books. Guy Montag, a fireman, is our protagonist throughout the story and after meeting a young girl that sends his mind reeling he ends up unconsciously working against this perverted society. He starts to slowly figure out that his wife is essentially a zombie to this society and she doesn't have any substance to her person. The book focuses more on his emotional responses to learning all of these things, and thus in heightened emotional states he doesn't make very great decisions. Although, his Fire Chief, Beatty, is the main antagonist and pursues Montag after he figures out what is really going on with his employee. Beatty was probably one of my favorite characters because he was so eloquently spoken. Unfortunately Montag was no real match for such a man's intellect and there was never a real battle of wits between them. Eventually Montag's disgust for society grows to paramount levels and he naturally becomes the outlaw of the land. Naturally, I couldn't help but see the parallel to 1984's characters. A great fugitive chase takes place and his chased by a robot dog, which is pretty much the only major weak part of this futuristic world, mostly due to the fact it's a goofy idea. Anyway, Montag covers his scent, though I can't help but think this is unrealistic even for this novel knowing what I do about genetics, pheromones and computer systems. Technically a robot dog primarily used for its olfactory sense should be able to detect him no matter what, because on a molecular level you still emit your scent.I don't want to give too much away, but suffice to say the book eventually abruptly ends. I felt like it was rather lacking at this point because I wanted to know what happened afterwards. I can't really give away the ending of the book because there really wasn't an ending. Of which, I left a ton of stuff out here and never even explained what actually happened in full, so don't feel cheated out of the adventure of the book. Once you get into this book the middle section is great and moves along quite briskly, but it trails off eventually.The book is important from a literary perspective because it really shows some of the major dangers in censorship. It even outlines things that are done now. How about the part of this book that points out that it all started off catering to the minorities... how often is that done today. We need to accommodate the small groups so that everyone is happy, it doesn't matter if it's wrong? This is happening more and more in the world today, like if a child has problems learning then it's not the parents fault, it's the schools fault, or it's some obscure genetic related fault, thus it is no the child's responsibility to learn anything anymore. How about making books abridged today to bolster a High Schoolers interest in getting to read a classic? Snip off a few words here, a few words there. Obviously they wouldn't find these books interesting so we have to dumb them down to their intellectual level. Naturally this will help progress society?That's how it all starts, and then people start to wonder why they need the full text at all, why not a paragraph summary? Why not a single sentence? Bradbury spells it out plainly for us in this book that that is exactly what happened in his imagined future. How long before simplicity replaces completeness in our society? Now we learn today that blurbs mean everything and people get a major amount of information from quick blurbs to feed our fast paced society, so they just write clever headlines and people think they have the news. It's progressively happening more and more. People don't want to take the time to read, so they get Cliff Notes. They don't desire to comprehend on their own half the time, so they watch a movie about it where there is less internal struggle to see from the characters. People who think that the problems this novel portrays aren't happening today aren't living in the same world the rest of the intellectual community is living. Those people are living in Orwell's world, in Bradbury's world. And pretty soon they will be the ones making decisions for everyone else in this world when they are the ones who eventually come into power because they are the best at writing clever headlines for two bit readers."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenheit 451 deals with the anti-intellectual society that is America. How everyone distracts themselved with materialistic values and doesn't take ahold of education as well as they should. This book was released ahead of it's time and is beautifully written.

All I will say is this book is one of the best I have read in a while. The scary thing is, it isn't to far from the truth as well.People who don't like reading SHOULD read this book. It will make you think, and it only takes a few hours to read. So why not read it?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a futuristic fantasy set in an America in which reading is forbidden, firemen burn books and everyone rushes without taking time to \\"stop and smell the flowers.\\" I believe that the people who compare this work to McCarthyism and Nazism are missing the point. It depicts a world in which reading has fallen out of favor, people watch television constantly, engage in shallow conversations and are in incessant rushes to get somewhere. Funerals are banned because they bring sadness and people have forgotten to appreciate nature, contemplate beauty and love one another.The principal action of this book occurs when a seventeen year old neighbor introduces the protagonist, Montag, to the world of nature. The book progresses as Montag gradually changes into a person more to our ideal.Although set in the future, this book contains much that is familiar. Portions remind the reader of Lost Horizon. More moving than that are factors which we see in our own world. Have we arrived in a world in which television has decreased reading and shortened attention spans? Is our literature and discourse made blander because minorities and special interest groups demand protection from anything which may hurt their feelings? Do we try to equalize the weak by weakening the strong? I am afraid that we see much of this future world in our own. Fahrenheit 451 provides, not only a pleasant read, but also a wake up call for all who are concerned about our culture."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is one of those books that leaves you thinking after reading it, one of those that would have been destroyed in Bradbury's story. A tale of a future where books are burnt so that people don't have to think. They're only allowed to watch TV, especially sports and soaps. Does it sound you familiar?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Simply a classic piece of literature, there is no possible way you can read this book and not take something valuable from it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"So everyone else seems to praise Bradbury's cultural observations and what-if scenario that man is eventually destined for, which I appreciate, a lot, but you can read about in other reviews.When it comes down to it the writing of the book isn't entirely great. Bradbury intentionally made the characters childlike and naive, and the writing had the same feel. I want to think this was on purpose, but it was probably more because it was easy.Why is it in great novels where the world has become a giant conspiracy that there is always only one or two random, seemingly normal people that figure it out. \\"1984\\" and \\"Brave New World\\" also do this and it drives me nuts. There's no real reason why it all of a sudden dawned on the character that the world that has been presented to them is flawed. Why is it only one person ever realizes it, and for no real apparent reason. They just wake up and say \\"wait a minute...\\".I also wish these books went 1. more into the reasons why the society got to the way it is and 2. more into how the character reconciles the truth of the situation and carries on for a better world. The plot is too simple of a line. Society is dumb, man realizes society is dumb, man calls it out, society tries to shut man up, society does something dumb to itself, man says \\"ha, i told you so\\".As far as a thought proviking warning to our culture and framing a plausible future to teach our kids with, this books succeeds. As far as being a well written literary masterpiece this book is overly simplified. But then again, that could be what truly sets it apart. :)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 was a very good book about Guy Montag who is a fireman. In his world fireman start fires instead of putting them out because the government had banned books so the population doesn't over come the Executive branch.Montag meets Clarisse who changes his life, he see's interesting books can be.My favorite part in the book was when Montag started to run from the police. He had got very mad at the firemen and went crazy. He burned the fire chief with his flame thrower then ran to try to get out of town. The whole city was looking for him and the government even had a mechanical hound that \\"never failed\\" when it came to chasing and finding someone. Well I guess the hound could fail because Montag jumped into a river as he goes out of the town. He wound up on a railroad track with a bunch of other tramps. They would read books and remember them. They were the only library in this world.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a very exciting book that draws you in and you'll never want to put down. Fahrenheit 451 kept me reading it till I finished. It has a lot of action and has a really creative story line. It is scary how realistic it is. I wish Ray Bradbury had made a sequel to this book to see what happens to Montage once he followed the train tracks.

It is much better, and deserves its status as a classic unlike this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is the story of a man who rediscovers his humanity in a future where there is no genuine thought, no intimitate contact, no passionate emotion. His premise is interesting enough, especially in light of the present state of our culture, however his execution is embarrassingly bad.The plot is predictable and hoaky, the characters are boringly flat, and the dialogue--perhaps the biggest drawback of the book--is wooden and unrealistic. Interspersed throughout all of this soap opera melodrama are dreary, quodlibetic references to Shakespeare, Bacon, Milton...you get the picture.It dawned on me as I was nearing the end of this book that Bradbury could easily have been the child of Ayn Rand and Jacques Barzun. Hamfisted, cardboard fiction from mommy, and tired pedantry from daddy. To be fair, there are a few well-penned lines, and he definitely has a point. But if you're interested in nightmarish visions of a futuristic dystopia, check out Orwell or Huxley. Bradbury basically took their stories and mashed them together anyway.Again, I can't stress enough the importance of this book's message. Nevertheless, this book, as vehicle for that message, definitely has a flat tire."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you are looking for a story about a dystopian society in which the government censors people's entire lives to the point where citizens aren't even allowed to read, then Fahrenheit 451 the perfect book for you. In the book, Guy Montag is a fireman who burns down houses with books hidden within them. He starts out really dedicated to the job, but then he meets a girl one night walking home from the fire station that really gets him thinking about how he is living his life. Guy begins to rethink everything he does and decides to fight the system. The idea of the story is fantastic; however the writing is not the greatest. The way Ray Bradbury writes is highly confusing. He uses metaphors, symbolism and similes like there is no tomorrow. He also has a tendency to jump from one topic to the next, one time to the next and one mood to the next. When he is talking about the Salamander when going out on a call to look for, and burn books, he describes the Salamander in great detail and then just switches to talking about the house, at which they have just arrived, without saying anything about the house until after the explanation of the house. So while the reader thinks Bradbury is still describing the Salamander he has actually gone into talking about a house instead. All in all, the book had a great point being that if someone challenges you; challenge them in return for what you believe to be right and just. However the style of writing just didn't agree with the way my mind thinks. But if you are someone who enjoys metaphors and jumpy writing, this would be a good choice for you to look in to reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In my humble opinion, I find it is riduculous that eBooks cost more than books printed with ink and paper."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenheit 451 is written by Ray Bradbury.This book was kind of wierd and hard to follow in the beginning.The book got more exciting and exhilarating as it went on.Bradbury's concept of firemen burning books is really a cool idea.Ray Bradbury had an endless imagination to have come up the ideas he used in his story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is much deeper than you owuld think at first glance.

Bradbury goes on for pages of poetic nonsense that many don't and wouldn't want to understand. The book has a wonderful message and I am disappointed in Bradbury for this horrible representation of such a wonderful theme. Too many questions left unanswered for the mind to ponder. I mean who doesn't like thinking about a book?? Well I certainly do but there are just too many loose ends. And the characters aren't elaborated on enough. They are almost all left as flat charachters which doesn't make for a most enjoyable book. Many have read and many have been disappointed.

You could understand that the main character was not happy, but nothing told you why clearly. I found it very boring because of the way they went from one event to another without really tying them together. Also,the way the author compared the characters thoughts to real life examples most of the time didn't make very much sense and sometimes you couldn't tell the difference between something really happening or if it was all in their mind. From the start it did not seem to be going anywhere. I would not suggest this book to anyone of my age or anyone interested in adventure books, because this isn't.

The city is a dystopia in a utopia.Guy Montag, firemen who finds out that he isn't happy once he has multiple conversations with a spontaneous adolescent girl named Clarisse. Clarisse doesn't thrive in the dystopia like everyone else. She does not accept that books are bad. She late affects the train of thought for Montag. Mildred, Montag's wife is happy with her life. She accepts the thought of books being bad. She agrees that destroying books brings happiness. She spends most of her time watching T.V. all day. Faber is an old man who enjoys books, but he is terrified of the firemen. He's a smart coward. Captain Beatty reads books from time to time, but he doesn't believe anything he reads.The common theme for the book the collective loss of memory, history, and the outside world in a society will result in an easy psychological manipulation of mankind by a government ultimately leading to dehumanization of the people. This is the theme because they are erasing history in an effort to achieve happiness. The common characteristics used in the book are relying on physical and somewhat psychological torture to maintain order. They threaten to burn books and houses if you're caught with books. The society the government runs thought to be an utopia but is far from it, the government basically runs and controls everything.Fahrenheit 451 really unfolds when Montag begins to take books for himself. His wife is terrified that he wants to keep the books. She is afraid that her house will be burned by the firemen, but Montag is a fireman, but does this make him able to read books?

Clarisse is a free thinking spirit, who surprises him with her genuine curiosity about life, she questions things instead of just accepting blind answers. She and Montag become friends and she talks to him about the past, when firefighters actually fought fires instead of burning books.When Montag goes home that night, he finds his wife, Mildred, has overdosed on sleeping pills. He calls the medics and Mildred is saved. But Montag begins to begins to question his own way of life and his happiness.One night while on call, Montag arrives at a womans house to burn her books. The woman refuses to leave, and instead dies that night in her burning home. Montag is greatly distressed over this and begins to have second thoughts about his way of life. While he was at the womans home, he grabbed a book to sneak out with him. It turns out Montag has been collecting and hiding books in his house for some time. He tells his wife this and shows her his collection, but she is so brainwashed that she doesn't care about the books and wants him to burn them too. So he decides to look up a retired English professor who he knows has books stashed in his house, a man named Faber.

So when I went to my local library and stumbled upon this book, I grabbed it off the shelf and figured i'd give it a go. I am so glad I did, it is a great read. I was hooked from page one. The storyline was really good, I found it to be creepy the way society was brainwashed and how they lived in an oppressed world without books. I liked Montag very much. It's almost like he was sleeping all that time, then finally woke up and snapped out of it.Mildred creeped me out, especially the way she spoke, it was very disjointed, she makes offhand remarks, almost like she's drugged.I think most off all, I enjoyed this one so much because I like books that are about books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 written in the 1950's describes a future to which we still may be on our way. The book follows main character ,Guy Montag a fireman, though as ordinary as this sounds his job is to burn books. Books are burnt in this society because they don't want people to have thought or ideas. Montag goes through everyday life and does not question it until he meets the first character that changes him. A young girl, Clarisse speaks of books and the world and makes Montag begin to think until one day she suddenly disappears. Pushing Montag with temptation until he takes a book. He must keep it secret so his life remains safe. Faber, an old English scholar helps guide Montag on his journey of self-awareness. Eventually, Mildred his wife turns him in for possession of a book, he is called to burn books though they bring him to burn his own house. His struggle for survival begins as the war does and he flees the city.Bradbury puts so much, into a quick read. This novel talking about censorship, defiance, and self thought is woven beautifully into the pages. The twists and turns with misleading plots and the underlying meanings makes you read things once or twice before the true meaning is found. You begin to realize his predictions of massive \\"wall televisions\\" which people spend all day watching came true. Overall the book is well written, well condensed, and has a great theme."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It was pretty good, gets to the point were sometimes there was too much description."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This disturbing classic by Ray Bradbury (born 1920) grabs the reader with its chilling tone. Guy Montag is a fireman in a society where fire fighters don't extinguish flames but set fire to books because books are considered a threat by the powers that be. After meeting a free-thinking neighbor and seeing his sick wife mistreated, Montag begins to question his values and the values of a society that burns books. In time he becomes a rebel, flees from the authorities, and meets a group of vagabonds that memorize the books and then burn them (to destroy the evidence). Finally war breaks out, and despite much destruction there is hope that a new society will be rebult from the ashes.Bradbury hits a number of themes in this compelling novel, penned in 1951. Censorship is one, but so is a sense of increasing automation, the dumbing down of society, disdain for independent thinking, and probably McCarthyism. The dialog is snappy with many slang expressions that perhaps were more relevant in 1951 than today. The result, of course, is a somewhat eerie but gripping classic. Readers might also enjoy THE PEDESTRIAN and THE FLYING MACHINE, two Bradbury short stories that present similar themes."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a classic that should be reread from time to time and pondered. It is interesting and its message is significant. It is a sermon that few clergy would dare make.I read the story as a parable that denounces the ancient but still existing wrong-headed notion that it is better, far better, for people to be ignorant.Governmental leaders and thinkers have known since the beginning of time that most people are constitutionally unable to understand many truths. Several ways were developed to manage the masses. One, discussed even by Plato in the fourth century BCE, was to reveal complex real truths only to intellectuals, but to teach the general population only \\"essential truths,\\" essential to keep them safe, but not really true.An example is the false notion that God becomes angry when he sees people sinning. This is wrong. A superior dispassionate all-knowing God would never become angry. Anger is a human not a divine emotion. God has no emotions. But clerics teach their congregants that God becomes angry because it helps control the otherwise uncontrollable masses who, if they did not fear God's anger and punishment, would rob, steal, kill and commit other wrongs.A second way of handling these people is stop them from learning the truths about the world. This is why the ancient Roman Catholic Church kept people from knowing the Bible, why they fought against translations other than in Latin, which non-clergy did not understand. This is why Europe existed, if we could use a word suggesting life, in the \\"Dark Ages,\\" in ignorance, like zombies, like cattle munching grass in the fields, until they awakened when they smelt the fresh air of the enlightenment. This is why books were censored and burned during the middle ages. This is why people, human books, were burned during inquisitions.Having this terrible dehumanizing notion in mind, the leadership of the future world in Fahrenheit 451 believed that people would be able to live a better life without books because books, they were convinced, cause wrong ideas, disharmony, confusion and unhappiness.Guy Montag was a government fireman whose job was to burn books. He didn't need to stop fires because homes were fireproof. Burning books seemed right to Montag. It seemed natural and rational. He knew nothing else. This is what he was taught by those who were much smarter than him.But one day a girl woke him up. She was like the child in another parable who was able to see that the king was naked. She told him that people once read books, learnt from them and improved themselves and society. She told him that people could think for themselves and did not need others to tell them what to think.Is the book outdated? Have people finally learned that they are closing their minds? Unfortunately people still need the message of Fahrenheit 451. Most people are still convinced that God becomes angry and, what is worse, far worse, they are still burning books today when they ignore new ideas."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman. But he doesn't fight fires. He starts them. And he starts them to burn books. Already a bit disillusioned about his job, he meets an almost seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse, whose nonconformist views on life are a breath of fresh air. He secrets away some books. He fights with his wife, whose overdose on pills can neither be categorized with certainty as intentional or accidental. He defies his boss, a walking book of quotes from famous novels. He makes some potentially deadly choices in turning away from the expected behavior of the masses: mindless, ad nauseam TV watching. Short, splendid sci-fi on the subject of censorship. Also good: The Book Thief by Markus Zusak, and Planet of the Apes by Pierre Boulle."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A literary classic and must read! The ongoing struggle with ignorance in our society, which leads to a whole host of ugly things, censorship among them. We are closer to this than one may think. Might be fiction, but we had better be careful. Read the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This novel is Ray Bradbury's1984 (Signet Classics)orBrave New World (P.S.). It speaks of a society which has rotted underneath through a loss of one of the most important devices ever created by man: the book. In this modern day \\"burst culture\\" of Blackberry's, Wi-Fi, 24/7 TV, and countless mindless entertainment outlets this book could not be more relevant. The story is a short read about a fireman living in a world where his job is not to save but to destroy. He burns books and by doing so destroys ideas. Today as the library becomes more antiquated, and reading and writing skills become increasing less sharpened by the education system, the story reminds us of the dangers in letting such fundamental skills going uncultured in the next generation. This book should be required reading for all students in elementary or middle school, for (like other Bradbury tales)it stretches the imagination beyond the status quo."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 gives readers the shock of a world where literature becomes irrelevant to the world around them. The world of Guy Montag was a macrocosm of the growing society as seen by Bradbury during the mid-twentieth century. Its symbolism continues to fit in with modern-day society more and more. As civilization continues to modernize, the end that is Fahrenheit 451 continues to become more possible.As a fifteen year-old living in the United States, I am well acquainted with technology and modern gadgets. After reading this book, it was hard to not see that Bradbury was showing his readers that the new forms of media are replacing the art of literature. As the book pulled me in further, the world began to match that of Guy Montag, as books and the love of reading is quickly replaced by television and radio. Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent thriller that questions the reader: what will happen when books are no longer relevant to anything? The stereotypic reader of a book that is set into the future often thinks, \\"this will never happen in real life.\\" With Fahrenheit 451, I had to really think about that question. With the world as it is-television becoming more prominent, society's youth becoming less and less interested with books-why couldn't this happen? Bradbury does an excellent job at reminding his readers that literature is the basis of knowledge, and knowledge is the basis for a successful society.For any reader looking for a read that will challenge both your mind and your heart, I highly recommend reading this unbelievable book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"reading to be against the law?In this classic book, Ray Bradbury paints a picture of a future society where it is actually a crime to read. Before you laugh at the thought, seriously think of how, in many ways, reading is actually becoming more and more discouraged. Every day you read where in school libraries certain books are considered as being \\"unfit\\" reading material for young adults. Books are becoming more and more a thing of the past. Have you gone into a library lately? Just 20 years ago, when I was in my late teens, libraries used to be filled with people and now they look like ghost towns. A lot of libraries across the country have been closed down.In the book the firemen do not put out fires, they start them. 451 degrees Fahrenheit is the temperature that book paper burns. That is an actual fact. The protagonist of the story, is fireman Guy Montag who is at a point in his life where he is really beginning to question what he does for a living. He really doesn't know why books are being burned, he just does it. Sounds like a lot of us, doesn't it? Sometimes we find ourselves doing things or believing things not because we have personally investigated the matter, but we do it because everyone else is doing it, or because we don't feel that we have a choice in the matter. I tell you this, and this may be a little difficult for some of you people to hear, but in every situation we are in, we always have a choice.What are we choosing to do when we hear that schools are banning certain books? What are we choosing to do when libraries are being shut down? What are we choosing to do when other forms of media are taking over reading? I have a couple of friends who are in their late 30s, early 40s, who actually admitted to me recently that they do not like to read. I found it completely appalling.Without our knowing it, we are gradually making it easier and easier for the \\"authorities\\" to decide for us; this book isn't just a piece of fiction, it's a warning. A lot of things in this book have already come true. I'm not going to tell you what they are because I want you to read the book, but it's almost kind of frightening that we, as a supposedly \\"advanced\\" society have allowed these things to come to pass.When we let others tell us what to believe, how to believe, what to read, how to think, we give away our original power. One must become a \\"soul-rebel\\". One must learn to protect those things that rightfully ours to express. We cannot let others do our thinking. We cannot let others tell us what to believe. We cannot let \\"authorities\\" decide what we are to read. Make no mistake about it; this is an extremely dangerous book. I suggest you read it before it, too, is gone from sight."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I sat down to read this book a bit listlessly. I was reading it, not for pleasure, but for school. We had to pick a novel to read, and Fahrenheit 451 is the one my mom suggested. As soon as I'd finished the first two or three pages, I was hooked. Fahrenheit 451 had perpetual tension at every turn. I could never wait to find out what would happen next.Ray Bradbury wove a vision of a future civilization that burned books and the houses in which they were hidden. As The New York Times put it, \\"Bradbury's account of this insane world, which bears many alarming resemblances to our own, is fascinating.\\" And they are absolutely right. Of all the characters in the book, the one I saw most clearly was Guy Montag, a fireman whose job it was to start fires. Guy is the main character in this story. He agonizes over what life to choose: the ignorant one as a fireman or the life on the run. In the end, he must make a choice.Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most provocative and interesting books I've ever read. All things accounted for; I would say that this novel is one of the most amazing novels of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is a book that I had been yearning to read for a long time. A friend of mine had been reading it and I borrowed it one day in class to fill up my free time. I was immediatly sucked in after reading the first chapter.Once I picked up the book a second time, I realized that it gets very confusing past the first couple of chapters. The story turns into more of a portal through which you can read Bradbury's thoughts and ideas of what the future might be like, and what he would do about it. There are many different issues brought up and many ideas conveyed through the story of a fireman whose purpose is to burn books.I picked up the presence of a lot of anger while reading this book. Anger towards authority, anger towards the society that Bradbury envisioned. And all this anger was channeled into Mr. Montag's (the main character) story.Everything within this book captivated me, and definately made me think a lot. It takes a mature mind to read and then understand this book, and I know I'm not fully there. I'm still not sure I received the message Bradbury might have been trying to send. Maybe there isn't one. But this is the kind of book that you would want to read more than once in your life. I know that the next time I read it, I will understand just a little bit more, and learn a little bit more."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Imagine this:The world no longer reads. Instead, they sit around for hours and watch giant screens at home, viewing mind-numbing programming with no real intellectual value. Then, they get in the car and drive 90+ mph, not even for a second thinking about the danger that they put themselves in. People no longer care about anything really. They no longer think for themselves. They have no ideas that make them unique individuals.Sound familiar? It can be honestly said that today, the TV has replaced reading as the number one mode of aquiring information for the majority of people in our nation. They have their minds filled overflowing with ideas that the program presents. And this is how people shape their worldview today. After all, all \\"normal\\" women look like Cindy Crawford or Halle Berry, right? All kids have sex before marriage, right? Everyone has to look like they do on TV, and be like the \\"normal\\" families portrayed on TV...right?In the year 2004, the vast majority of what is seen on TV is absolute garbage. No? Well, OK.

The Bill of Rights ensures that in the corner of the world in which we live, we have the freedom to ignore the \\"idiot box\\" and read a good book, or newspaper, or magazine, or whatever we want to read without fear of arrest or intimidation.In the \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" world, books are illegal. Since everyone got their dose of enlightenment from the big screen and didn't care about reading anymore, the government said, \\"Since no one reads anymore, why do we need books?\\" and promptly banned all of them. Those fortunate ones who manage to hang on to a few tomes for their enjoyment are paid a visit by the fire department.The \\"firemen\\" in this story, unlike their real-world counterparts, start fires, instead of extinguish them. Kerosene shoots out of their hoses instead of water. The FD (with the number \\"451\\" on their uniforms, indicating the temperature in which paper burns) is dispatched to the \\"criminal's\\" home, and not only sets the books ablaze, but also the home in which they are hidden. After all, they have to set an example to the rest of the community that books are bad and if you are caught with them, your books and your home are toast...literally.The central character in the book, named Montag, is one of these firemen. For years, he has done his job setting fires, and he does it well. But after a run-in with a girl who's a free thinker, and a professor who remembers the days when books were taken for granted, he begins to question why the firemen have to burn the books at all.Though written over half a century ago, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is no longer considered science fiction. It is a glimpse of the future to come, and a warning of what the future could hold for us."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I personally enjoyed Fahrenheit 451 very much. I do think that Bradbury's writing style is unique and packs a lot into a small amount of space, but I disagree that the aesthetic qualities are the highlight of his writing. I think that the ideas behind the story are what makes the book so compelling.I also disagree that the book is lacking due to a missing thick plot. I think that the lack of petty details about how exactly the society is set up or functions helps both the author and the reader to remain focused on the ideas. I think that there is a clear enough explanation for the way in which the society went from not being interested in books to burning them. As time passed more advanced forms of technology replaced reading as the mainstream form of entertainment, and people were less attached to books. Then the government that is in place at the time the story is told takes over, and decides to have all books burned. Not all people in the novel burn books, only the firefighters, and the whole thing is very regulated by the government. The government makes this decision to get rid of the possibility of people gaining knowledge pertaining to ideas about revolutions, and better ways of life. This way the people will blindly accept the government, and be content even though their lives lack any real relationships.The story is an exaggeration of problems Bradbury sees in society and of fears of what could happen in the future. It forces the reader to think about how we spend our time, how much we really know or don't know, and how much is within our control."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In this book i found it very interesting how the book just progresses through every thing in an instant im a matter of a snap of the fingers and nothing else in the story matters but Guy Montag himself.

Guy Montag, a &quot;fireman,&quot; struggles with his everyday life of burning books, and the life that the next-door neighbor, seventeen-year-old Clarisse, introduces into his mind. Captain Beatty, the fire chief, tries to convince Montag that the life of burning books is the only way to go, that is until Montag meets another &quot;book saver&quot;, a retired college professor, who helps him decide what is right. Bradbury's conflicts between wrong and right are those that have been handed down over generations and will be for generations to come.

From adventurous chases to confidential meetings, this book will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very last page."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury takes place far in the future in the suburbs of a big city. The name of the main character is Guy Montag and he is a fireman, but instead of putting out fires he lights them. In his society books are banned. If anyone is found to be keeping these illegal objects, their houses are burned down. Montag meets a girl named Clarisse, and she makes him question what he does every day. The main conflict begins when Montag begins to steal books and hide them in his house. He realizes how important they are and what the government is hiding from its people. He is immediately motivated to do something about this. He seeks the help of Faber, a book-keeper who Montag knows about but never reported. Faber is not at all hopeful, but he agrees to help Montag preserve books. Together they read books and store the words in their minds, saving the information for later.In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury describes things by gshowingh instead of gtellingh. On page 75, Bradbury describes being inside the virtual parlor, which is surrounded by video screens. gHe was a victim of concussion. When it was all over he felt like a man who had been thrown from a cliff, whirled in a centrifuge and spat out over a waterfall that fell and fell into emptiness and emptiness and never-quite-touched-bottom-no-never-never-quite touched bottom. The thunder faded. The music died.h This is a very interesting book, but most of it is fairly depressing. It is all about the government controlling what people think. gfWhatfs going on?f Montag had rarely seen that many house lights. eOh, just my mother and father and uncle sitting around, talking. Itfs like being a pedestrian, only rarer. My uncle was arrested another timedid I tell you?for being a pedestrian. Oh, wefre most peculiar.f eBut what do you talk about?fh This quote shows how deprived the society is of anything that actually means something. This book was written on experiences that Ray Bradbury had like actually being stopped by the police for walking. The one thing that makes this book different from other science fiction is that the plot of Fahrenheit 451 is so believable that it seems like we are in danger of it happening.Fahrenheit 451 carries some valuable lessons. The largest message in the book is that we should not let books become obsolete. Even if we use the Internet and watch TV more and more, we should still read books and value them because, as Faber says, gBooks donft tell things, they tell the meaning of things.h He also says that books are not important, but that they are just a receptacle for things we are afraid we might forget.

In those days we were probably most concerned with censorship from the right. Now, the liberals who advocated free speech at Berkeley have taken up the cause to tell us what we can say, so as not to offend anyone. So the First Amendment risks assault from both ends. One way to solve the problem is for us all to develop thick skins. If somebody calls me a bad name, why should I spend my time complaining and give the impression that my ego is a basket case? (Now physical assault is another thing. No First Amendment protection there.)Ray Bradbury's Coda is at the end of newer editions of his book. This is a valuable addition that gives specifics on some of the problems mentioned above.But there is something lacking in the newer editions. When Ballantine published the first edition in 1953, they included two short stories at the end, &quot;The Playground&quot; and &quot;And The Rock Cried Out.&quot; These have since been excluded and are not easily found elsewhere. They are excellent stories, and I hope that someday Del Rey will consider reinstating them.

Killing his fellow firefighter, Beatty, caused him to see that he wanted to die. Quote: \\"...In the middle of the crying Montag knew it for the truth. Beatty had wanted to die. He had just stood there, not really trying to save himself, just stood there joking, needling, thought Montag, and the thought was enough to stifle his sobbing and let him pause for air.\\" He wanted to be free, instead of being confined within rules of the ordinary."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This was a great book because it shows they world where you can not think on your own and decide on your own.

During the time that he is going through his mysterious phases he meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens her eyes to the emptiness of his life. Montag met this girl one night when he was taking a walk at about midnight. Montag also meets a very important character named Faber.

The detail and the wording was unlike anything I've read before. There were some phrases that were hard to follow, but most of them were amazing detail with some extravagant crosses nightmarish. I've read one other poem of Ray Bradbury's and that too was very nightmarish. Both though were incredible pieces of writing.The basic plot is that is the world is in a futuristic state where the cars go over 100's of mph, about everything is electronic, there are TV programs that you play a character in a soap, and firemen don't put out fires. Yes, that is right firemen don't put out fires they start them, and they start them by igniting books. The only way to describe what having books in the book is like if someone in our society was to murder someone. In the book if you have a book it is considered a felony and firemen come and burn books. Not only do they burn the books the person who is caught with them are sent to jail. The reason these books are being burnt is because they figure that the root cause of anger and prejudice so if there was a book that was controversial then bam it's gone, and eventually all the books were ruled against. Guy Montag a normal man for his job skin slightly burnt with black smudges, fairly large, with the fireman look. He had never questioned his jobs or what he was supposed to do. Until one day when he meets Clarisse McClellan a seventeen-year old girl; who tells him about what United States was before, and what the job of firemen were before the book burning era. Montag's life takes a dramatic change from the point when Clarisse enters. Clarisse talks about living a life and looking around and smelling flowers and opening you mouth and catching raindrops in your mouth. Montag first thought Clarisse was absurd and crazy to do all these things because doing these things were no accustom to this generation, it was fun to be with the \\"family\\" this family isn't the traditional family it's a soap opera where the person plays a part in it. Montag learns the truth of what firemen use to do before the book burning age. Montag thinks it's total nonsense but soon learns better. Clarisse disappears one day, and Montag can't find out why she is gone then his wife tells him that last week she had died, and her family had left. Montag then remembers the only other person he had ever met that was like Clarisse was Faber. Faber is a retired professor; there is no need for professors because there are no books. Faber is willing to help Montag, because Montag is the only one who recognizes that there is a problem, and the only one who wants to make a difference. Montag takes what Faber has called alternate brain and puts it in his ear and can hear Faber's voice. Montag headed to the station, Montag had just settled in when they got a call that would change his life forever.This was on of the most amazing books that I've ever read and all of the twists and great action kept me reading until the very end.

I thought it was wonderful and honest. The emotional, and some times totally unemotional, conversations are so close to true speech. I think it was probably easier to understand that in the audiobook format. The version that I checked out from the library had an afterword written by Mr. Bradbury, after looking at the story over 30 yrs after he wrote it. In it, he addressed some of the feedback he has received over the years about this book. He also stated, in no uncertain terms, exactly his views on censoring of books and even of opinions.I REALLY enjoyed this book and some of the conversations it has sparked with my husband and friends about the subject matter. I highly recommend it. Especially to those who think there is nothing wrong with the empty entertainment that is pressed upon us today.

It's up to Montag to dispose the new future, that could be tomorrow, where burning a building gets him into big mess.

It has been referenced to in many other books, TV shows, and movies since its publication in 1953. Ray Bradbury does an amazing job of writing the novel, with numerous twists and turns. It had me on the edge of my seat while reading the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury does an amazing job at creating a wonderful tale. Reading this as a 14 year old, I think it we be much more enjoyed by an older crowd. It is a great book. It is very interesting in my opinion how one can completely turn around all his beliefs so quickly... a wonderful story for everyone above the age of 8."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a classic science fiction novel written by Ray Bradbury and published in 1953. This book has followed in the purpose for which the genre of science fiction was created; to predict and speculate about what will happen to humans in the future--and especially--to warn readers away from the less desirable futures. So much of what is written in this book has already or may come to pass that readers may find it disturbing to read.One aspect of Fahrenheit 451 that I thought was particularly well done is its realistic portrayal of human behavior. One instance where this was displayed occurs right after Guy Montag had turned traitor and started both reading and trying to save the books he was supposed to be burning. The very firehouse he worked for programmed a mechanical hound, called simply, the \\"Hound\\" to search for and destroy his DNA code. As the media built up feelings of antipathy and hatred of Guy, the public responded by growing increasingly excited and exultant about seeing him caught and killed, even to the point of following the media's suggestion that everyone check to see if Guy is outside of their house. This, to me, sounds like an accurate representation of human responses to the media's stimuli.Another aspect of Fahrenheit 451 I liked was that the main characters are given backgrounds and histories to make it possible to understand their actions, opinions, beliefs, and morals. For example, the book describes an occasion in Guy Montag's childhood when power was down for an evening and he and his mother used candles instead of electric lights, and talked, instead of watching TV, which helps to explain Guys rationalizations for preferring real people and hating the characters on the three-dimensional TV. Also, Clarisse, one of the supporting characters has a very rich past that is highly developed. In her case, this takes on the form of her father and uncle, who greatly influence her opinion and provide the background and embodiment for most of her convictions. They never actually appear in the book, but Clarisse's descriptions of them and constant references to them make them seem almost like characters themselves.One of the things for which this book is the most renowned--and, in my opinion, is its most valuable feature is its philosophy. No matter which opinion is being portrayed, the dialogue and explanation of that philosophy is passionate and convincing. For example, when Guy first goes to the retired Professor Faber, Faber describes three things which men need if humanity is to be truly free. The first is, a wealth of information, the second, time to analyze this information, and the third, the right and ability to act on this information.I have given this book a five-star rating because I consider it to be one of the finest literary works of this century, because not only did he right it with fine character development, but also with a unique plot and profound philosophies."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A great story to pass the time during travel, such as on a plane or in car, because it should only take 2-and-a-half Hours to read. It starts with Guy Montag, a fireman whose job is to actually start fires, primarily to burn books and their owner's houses. After being encountered by a strange 17-year old girl who asks not only \\"what\\" things are about but \\"why\\", and witnessing a woman commit suicide by lighting her house (bearing books) on fire rather than let the Firemen do it themselves, he decides there must be something else to books than just words and paper. The story is about his struggles to revive the book world and save it from certain destruction."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, the setting is a place in the near future in which reading books is prohibited and being caught with them is punishable. The book begins with Guy Montag, whose job in life is to go around and set fires to houses in which books are being kept. When a woman sets fire to her herself and her house rather then give up her books, Guy starts to question what exactly he is doing. At first he does not believe this is wrong, but when he takes a few books home one day, he is enlightened and realizes that the burning of such great works would be preposterous and their loss monumental. As soon as he has this awakening, he comes under danger due to it.This book is not only about censorship as although it may seem this way. This book portrays an eerie depiction about what the world would be like without some individual freedoms. No one wants to offend anybody in the city that is the setting for the book. Because of this, freedom of speech is limited. The book makes you dig deep into your own mind and really makes you think about how the world could be different.There were many strong points to this book. The first is the interesting and thought provoking plot. Through much excitement in the novel, it keeps you interested until you turn the last page. Another great strong point is the great details. I could truly sense that I was in the book and it played similar to a movie in my head. There is more then enough detail to give you exactly what the author wants you to see, while leaving some to the imagination as well. The only weakness of the book that I found was it starts off a little slow in the beginning, but other then that is an amazing readFahrenheit 451 is a pleasure to read and leaves you wanting more. The book is an instant classic and I suggest anyone who has any interest in science fiction to read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's books are insightful and thought-provoking because he writes fictional short stories and novels about the future, with a common theme on how society uses technology. In particular, Bradbury's book, Fahrenheit 451, discusses relevant concerns about applying technology to teaching. In the back of the 50th Anniversary Edition published by Del Rey Books, there is a recent interview with Bradbury where he discusses his concerns about using radio and television in the classroom as a replacement for sound traditional teaching methodologies. When Bradbury wrote the book in the 1950's, he imagines a society where reading is no longer taught. In his recent book interview, Bradbury expresses that he is still concerned about the quality of education today and believes that there is a current problem in the educational system, with less emphasis placed on quality in comparison to when he attended school back in 1926.Many readers feel that the book is about censorship but it actually focuses more specifically upon the idea of freedom. Bradbury says in the interview that he does not regard censorship as a problem within the United States and feels that there are many diverse groups who provide voices for various interests; yet, he considers television, including local news, as a culprit towards ignorance. In Fahrenheit 451, Bradbury attributes intelligence to free thinking and expresses that books are merely an agent towards learning and not a magical device to create intelligence. In a subtle way, Bradbury points out that wisdom comes from trial-and-error types of experiences and intellectual growth comes from making real-life decisions, albeit not always correct choices, but nonetheless, independent thinking is an important part of the learning process. In a democratic society, both freedom and independent choices are vital for keeping its structure sound.The story goes something like this: there exists a dysfunctional, sick society where \\"thinking\\" is no longer valued and education is censored. Through the advent of radio and television, information is absorbed but there is no longer reflection or judgment over the validity of the source. Book burning becomes fashionable because \\"truth\\" is too disturbing. Firemen are used to keep social order and to maintain majority group satisfaction. In this time frame, religion exits but only serves to function as a media tool used for commercialism. The main character, Montag, is a fireman who sets fires to the homes where books are stored illegally. Over time, Montag is plagued by many questions, such as, why people are willing to die for books and why are the qualities of independent thinking not valued in his society? At the beginning of Fahrenheit 451, he meets a teenage girl who asks him numerous questions about how the society is structured and what would happen if things were to change. He is particularly bothered with her question as to whether he is happy. This specific question brings an important issue to light; what constitutes freedom. What would happen if academic freedom became outlawed? As Montag grows sympathetic with the rebellious cause over intellectual freedom, he discovers the history behind why his culture became dysfunctional and what future scenario has to happen in order to change it. Reading is more than an action of digesting words but requires reflection and a foundation set towards higher thinking.Overall Fahrenheit 451 provides intriguing concepts and a very interesting story line, although Bradbury finishes with a very weak ending. There is more than one way to change society, and not necessarily through the 1950's notion that an atomic bomb has to rip through social fabric in order to create new thinking. Yet perhaps, atomic war can serve as a powerful symbolic weapon to the destruction ignorance does to society and its people. His final advice to teachers is also useful: assess the quality of what is taught and encourage students to become independent thinkers.In Bradbury's interview, he expresses that his concern with radio and television is over its application to learning. Even though he doesn't show how radio and television can be used in education or explains the definition of quality media, Bradbury does not dismiss the idea that electronic transmissions can be used effectively. In Fahrenheit 451, Montag is told directly by Professor Faber that books do not create learning but that they are merely vehicles to describe thoughts. Montag, however, is still bothered about the role of books and education because he recognizes that men spend their entire lives to record thoughts and experiences, and Montag believes that society can learn from this type of wisdom. In fact, at the moment when Montag begins to question his social structure, it leads him into independent thought and freedom. Furthermore, because Montag is able to discern between authors who contribute greatly to social thinking and writers who produce work for entertainment purposes, he is willing eventually to put his own life at risk for knowledge.Yet, whether radio, television, or books are used for teaching, the point is clear, it is the way that they are used and the values which are placed upon the medium that makes a difference in learning. A page from a book can be just as meaningless as a television commercial that is tuned out by the listener. How teachers reach students is a very critical issue in Bradbury's Farenheit 451. Montag becomes the next teacher and leader in his dysfunctional society, and as observers, we too can learn from Montag about our future roles in determining social values. This book is small enough to read within a few evenings but has enough material to \\"think\\" about for a long time."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Ray Bradbury's science-fiction story Fahrenheit 451, he tells of a world set in the future when it's illegal to own books. The main character, Guy Montag, works for the fire department setting fires in homes occupied by literature. Guy Montag, unhappy at home, is surrounded by technology that he feels is unimportant. Guy Montag soon realizes that burning the books would ruin years of writing and history, when he takes home a handful of books he is put in danger. The setting is believable, unknown, and familiar all at the same time. It has a lot of similar issues as today's world does, but with a futuristic spin on them. Fahrenheit 451 is a fast paced, fascinating read; I would recommend it to anybody who likes sci-fi thrillers."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"My favorite book. Excellent piece of dystopian literature. Read it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury has created a shockingly realistic future for us, where the desire to be happy overrules the need to be informed. The most frightening part, perhaps, is that this style of censorship is practiced in high schools across the country. As a high school senior, I have witnessed several instances of attempted &quot;book bannings&quot; from school libraries, mostly led by misinformed parents who could not see through the 4-letter words or &quot;disturbing&quot; situations to the true worth of the novel. Unlike 1984 or Brave New World before him, Bradbury's world is closer to ours, and much more attainable.The theme of Fahrenheit 451 is seeing through the clutter and propaganda to what is truly important. Not necessarily books in particular, but the essence of life which they capture and present in sometimes startling ways. Guy Montag, Clarisse McClellan, Faber, and few others can see that butterfly in a landfill essence of truth, and their contrast against the rest of the world shocks the most disillusioned reader into realizing that, in literature, there is truth. In a world where science and technology are increasingly more important, Fahrenheit 451 is a far-sighted message from the past telling us, indeed, the arts are what puts us above the primates."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This isn't exactly a review. I don't enjoy writing reviews for books that already have so many reviews written for them, because what's the point? And a classic like this has already been described so many times, who needs another person to repeat the same synopsis again? But two days ago, after a kid ran into my Science class screaming that Ray Bradbury had died, I knew I had to write something about this book.As said before, I won't describe this book, since if you're reading this, you probably know already. When I first read this book two years ago, I was enthralled. For me at the time, classics were overrated, boring, and way too old to be relevant. Then came Fahrenheit 451. After finding out that it was published relatively recently by an author who had not yet died, I whined in my head, 'But then it's not a _true_ classic.' Eventually, and miraculously, I managed to discipline myself to read it-and I LOVED it. It was so original, and actually SUSPENSEFUL-all of a sudden, my view on classics were changed. I realized I was stupid for not thinking that before, and how childish I was (fine, I was in middle school, but still). Soon I will have to read Fahrenheit 451 for high school, and I actually feel quite happy about that.I'm writing this in honor of Ray Bradbury, in a way. He died on the fifth of June, 2012. I would just like to say, Mr. Bradbury, that your book was truly a masterpiece, and changed my life in more ways than one. I hope that you rest in peace. And wherever you are now, I hope you died knowing that your book would soon become a true classic.--written by a teenager."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Give Fahrenheit 451 a read. It describes a world where people are sucked into tv/media and become drones of the state. If you've ever seen Fight Club or opposed censorship you'll enjoy it. The author Ray Bradbury passed last night, he was 91."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I feel almost guilty giving this book a review like this, it is hailed as a classic and usually when I read books that are considered classics I can see the many strong qualities that put them on the 'classic' pedestal. But I must be honest, I'm not going to make this book sound better then I thought it was simply because it is considered a classic. The only redeeming quality this book really has is the overall idea and like many reviewers have already pointed out - the idea is good, the execution of said idea is quite lacking.This story follows Guy Montag, a fireman. Unlike the firemen of today, these firemen burn books rather than put out fires. The world has become a dystopian society that favors pleasure over reality. We almost have a 'stepford-society' of sorts. Critical thinking is said to create sadness and conflict so something must be done about it. The books must be burned.In Fahrenheit 451 Montag has an epiphany after talking with his light-hearted neighbor Clarisse. Clarisse represents the very thing this society is trying to rid. Guy Montags wife represents the opposite. You can already see the conflict here, so what is Guy to do?I'll admit the first 40 pages or so really had me going. The story was unique and the message was interesting. I did notice right away that Bradbury likes to be overly-poetic in some parts, and a straight-shooter in others. His writing is a little inconsistent but I was able to look past that. At first I really hated Montags wife (a good thing, when books conjure up these types of feelings then they are doing their job) and I really felt empathetic towards Guy. The problem is that this book really started becoming silly. The characters really become forced and the plot as a whole takes an eye-rolling turn for the worst. The ending is one of the most forced endings I've ever read. This book could have been written a million different ways and Bradbury chose a really silly path. I had to force myself to finish the book and I started to lose my feelings towards the main characters, I just started to not care anymore. It's almost as if Bradbury had a good idea for a short-story one day and forced it into a novel.In the end I would give this book a 2.5/5. There are some interesting ideas and some of the writing is pretty good, though it is inconsistent. Unfortunately I can't give half-stars so it's either a 2 or a 3. Tough choice but ultimately this book was more on the disappointing end of the spectrum for me."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"You've heard about the title, so you know this is a book in which books are burned. That is, indeed the most symbolic aspect of the novel. But the novel's richness comes not so much from the scenes and fact of book burnings, as the daily life of mind-numbing television and prescription drugs. As our narrator notes, \\"the firemen are rarely necessary.\\" Most people simply lost themselves in \\"wall televisions,\\" joy rides, advertising, shopping, and--above all--infotainment. This dystopian society is not unlike our own: people often prefer to have others do their thinking, machines do their walking, corporations to make their meals, pundits (\\"televisors\\") to do their political thinking, TVs to do their childcare, and televangelists to do their religion.This America offers a Bible-free, guilt-free, effort-free Christianity. It offers hedonism, sports, and the lowest common denominator. Who wants books in a society committed to individual ease?Books then, are not a magic bullet: this future America has been so dumbed down and has become so lazy that a mere book won't change a thing: no more than a recording of Mozart. What has been lost is a way of life--an integrated, critical, self-examining, strenuous life. This whole has been chopped up and swept away by a society obsessed with products and leisure.The narration is often overly blunt or even exaggerated. It's as if Bradbury doesn't trust that we'll get it: so he lays it on, thick and plain. This is not a subtle book. It's not great literature, but it is an important work of fiction. It is particularly a good book for the young reader.For all of these reasons, I think that Fahrenheit 451 should be canonized for high school. It's short, simple, direct, and relevant. And its well worth reading for anyone who lives in a society more obsessed with consumerism than the pleasure of a campfire, the look of a daisy, or the pleasure of a book as good as this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was well on my way to dropping out of high school due to sheer boredom when my English II teacher assigned this book. It read like it was written just months before, illustrating the sinkholes modern society had been slowly hollowing out in the 20th (and now 21st) Century. Always pertient and on topic, it's the kind of story that never looses its edge and becomes more true every time you read it. Sometimes we're Mildred, sometime's we're Guy, sometime's we're Clarisse. Always, 451 assures that humanity will make it somehow. All we've got to do is follow the tracks."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is one of those books that will never show its age. Ray Bradbury wrote it in 1953 but it feels contemporary even today and its warnings are as applicable (if not more applicable) to today's society as society in the 50's. Like George Orwell's 1984, it comments on humanity by imagining its hypothetical future; a dysfunctional society conditioning itself into thinking that everything is OK when it really is not. Unlike George Orwell's 1984, however, Fahrenheit 451 is a fairly easy read, and can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone. This is definitely a good thing, though, because many casual readers would be turned off by Orwell's long philosophical passages questioning what defines reality. Fahrenheit 451 stands among 1984, Brave New World, and The Handmaid's Tale because of its significance, but because of its less technical and easier-to-read format appeals to a wider audience than any of these other books--giving it a distinct advantage for casual readers who still wonder where mankind might be headed.As far as plot goes, the book follows its main character, Guy Montag, through a short period of time in his life. Montag is a fireman in the unspecified future--but it's far enough in the future that the meaning of the word \\"fireman\\" has changed. In Montag's world, instead of putting fires out, firemen start fires. In this future, reading books is illegal for purposes of mass censorship and anyone caught with books has their fireproof house burned clean of their contraband libraries. Montag lives a happy life with a happy wife and enjoys his job until one day a young girl named Clarisse teaches him to ask questions--something the government does not want its citizens to do. Ultimately, this causes him to \\"wake up\\" and see everything that is wrong with his life.He is not in love with his wife (in fact, he can not even remember where he met her), his job is to ruin other people's lives, and he doesn't even know what happiness really means. Happiness to the masses is mindlessness; staring at wall-sized television screens in-between work and sleep. Obviously this pacification is no substitute for true happiness, and when Montag becomes aware of this and the fact that everyone else in the nation thinks they are happy as unthinking sheep, he feels the need to change it. He decides to read some books to find out how, effectively becoming a criminal.The main reason this is a great book is because its implications are very important to our society. However, it is also just a well-written book. It doesn't get stuck at any part of the story with too much of Montag's thoughts and not enough action, but it doesn't leave out the thought-provoking parts, either; it's a careful balance that keeps you interested enough to want to keep reading and intrigued enough to want to think. The book also has great character development, as most of its main characters go through drastic changes over the course of the story. When Montag first talks to Clarisse it is obvious though the dialogue and narration that she really annoys him. Slowly, though, as he talks to her more, his opinion changes, and eventually, even though he is offended by her, he has taken a liking to her.Still, what keeps this book important is what it means. In modern society many of Bradbury's predictions have come true--TV screens get bigger and clearer as people walk around with iPod earbuds blaring, ignoring one another completely. Reading may not be illegal, but the entertainment industry has a pretty strong grip on a huge portion of the population through television, discouraging reading by encouraging watching. The main thing Bradbury is promoting here is thought--the downfall of man in the book is ultimately attributed to losing interest in thinking. Which is why Clarisse has such a profound impact on Montag while doing something as simple as making him think.And who knows? If you watch a lot of reality TV, this book may do to you what Clarisse did to Montag. That's right--turn you into a fugitive. Oh, and it might make you think, too. Hopefully it will do that instead of making you a fugitive. Fahrenheit 451 is a very interesting, enjoyable, and important book for modern-day readers to read. Even if you read it, end up disliking it, and find yourself wanting to set it on fire, at least that would somehow be ironically appropriate. Because Fahrenheit 451 is a very quick and easy read, you have nothing to lose by reading it, and if what it predicts is true, you may have everything to lose by not reading it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"With great prescience, Ray Bradbury wrote Fahrenheit 451 over fifty years ago. Today, this story is no longer prescient but instead insightful of the situation of the West as it stands. Pluralism which was celebrated in the past has become a prison against plurality, destroying freedom of speech because of political correctness. Materialism (both practical and philosophical) has driven us in two different directions: (1) Absolute obsession with making money at all costs. (2) Absolute obsession with not working at all costs. These two factors appear in different quantities in the population, creating workaholics who destroy their lives (both by means of work and the escape from it) as well as those who merely play games with the world.Bradbury foresaw the rise of these forces in his day and astutely analyzed them to their ultimate end. This perfect storm of ideals has brought us to the edge of a cultural collapse, a collapse which is highlighted in Fahrenheit 451 and enacted in its fully decadence in the plot of the story. For Bradbury, materialism ultimately ends with the destruction of work ethic and the true pursuit of knowledge (and hence the Truth). Life becomes a game, without serious ramifications, for life without the Truth is nothing more than a masquerade. Bradbury's tale teaches, however, that all masquerades end, all masks fall off, when the Truth blankly stares us in the eye, making us realize the piteous state to which our closed minds have led us. This end is, for Bradbury, only possible when carried out to the full collapse, a collapse which is quickly coming to the entirety of Western Civilization.I highly recommend this book for its analysis as well as its very engrossing style. In a day when true knowledge is not looked for over the din of iPods, Fahrenheit 451 stands as a stern wakeup call to a culture in the throes of death."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Compared to many books that I have read Fahrenheit 451 was enlightening, imaginative and illustrative. Today, people now are glued to the television and they seem to take no interest in being active. Although Bradbury's novel seemed out of the ordinary, it is somewhat close to the society that we are in today.In Ray Bradbury's novel Guy Montag has been a fireman for 10 years and never questioned anything in his life until he met this young woman named Clarisse Mclellan. Clarisse was an eccentric young girl, she was happy, thoughtful, and questioned many things around her. The people around her were busy watching TV on walls, listening to seashells, and driving dangerously fast. When she met Montag, she knew he was different. He looked at her when she talked, he followed things that she said and was intrigued by her personality. Clarisse touched Montag's life in many ways, which triggered him to realize that life wasn't just about burning books, it is about discovery and thinking. Shortly, after Clarisse's death Montag became confused and began to seek for an old friend named Professor Faber. When he saw Montag again, he was afraid he had come to burn his books instead Montag had come to Faber for answers. After speaking with Faber, Montag had realized what a fool he had been and knew that something needed to be done.Ray Bradbury's novel is very close to unveiling the truth of what our society might become if there is no longer a use for intelligence, individuality, and knowledge. Television networks come up with reality TV shows, competitive shows, comedies, and mysteries to keep viewers interested in what the electric box has to offer. With people attached to the television all day the information that is offered out there will become obsolete."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Upon first thinking of the book burning concept, I thought to myself, \\"That's unrealistic. It would never get that far.\\" After reading Fahrenheit 451, however, I've come to realize that the creep towards censorship is insidious, and the American society is closer than I had previously realized. With the several groups, races, sects, and organizations complaining and protesting over every word that offends their fragile egos, with political correctness rewriting books and documentation even as I write this review, Bradbury was much closer to predicting the future than even he had probably imagined.Guy Montag is a fire fighter in the new world, a world where firemen start fires rather than douse the blazes. He travels from house to house, totally incinerating any location that dares possess and read books that do not fit the very limited list that has become acceptable. Regardless of families, livelihoods, or other considerations, if the occupant owns books, the house will be set ablaze. Montag's job, however, has started to make him consider the consequences and reasons his job exists.Montag meets a teenage girl named Clarisse in his neighborhood with an odd aura about her. She causes him to think deeply, to consider that which he had previously taken for granted. Her entire way of life, her family atmosphere, it all takes him by surprise, and eventually invigorates him with life he hadn't felt in quite some time. The daily monotony of his life, his marriage, and his job had Montag quite melancholy, and the new perspective brought on by the young girl with an odd wisdom becomes the catalyst for life changes.What follows is a brilliantly described story, where the details fly off the pages in colorful and lively metaphors. Bradbury's style allows each reader to clearly and easily see the images of Montag's world, a world in which Montag must now make a decision to continue living his life, or to follow his heart and mind into a new and dangerous journey.In the end it's a story about the dangers of groupthink and the loss of freedom. It's a prophetic warning, showing how seemingly minor forms of censorship could eventually lead to a society without the basic freedoms of individual thought, self-expression, or self-growth.I can't recommend this book highly enough, and it should be required reading for every school across the nation."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I liked the symbolism Ray Bradbury used in this book.

Other than that i really liked this book.Shoutz to 8-4 at Holy Angels!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I first started reading this book in my Language Arts class, I honestly didn't like it at all. It was very complicated and confusing, but Ms. O., my teacher, helped explain the book. All of the metaphors and similes symbolized something. All of the symbolism in this book was so amazing once you understood it. Light and dark, symbolizing good and bad, was used often in Fahrenheit 451. I loved this book once I understood all of the symbolism. Fahrenheit 451 was written 50 years ago, but is supposed to take place in the 24th century. It's funny, because some things are reversed. The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman, but not the kind of fireman you're thinking of, a fireman in the future. They go around lighting peoples' houses on fire if they have books. You're not allowed to read in the future, because the government knows that books create curiosity and cause you to think. The future government doesn't want anyone to believe in anything else except what they want the society to believe. You have a speed minimum, and if you drive slower then the speed minimum, you get a ticket. The whole world just rushes from place to place. The government knows that if people don't rush around, it might give them time to think. No one talks to each other, and it seems as if no one loves each other. Teenagers kill each other for \\"fun.\\" In some ways I see our society turning into this, and I probably wouldn't be very surprised if it was like this in the 24th century. It's just horrible to think that our world might turn into a mindless, hypnotized world. This book makes you think, and it makes you realize how wrong censorship is. It was written in 1953, and that's a little while after World War II, so Ray Bradbury, the author, probably got some of his inspiration to write this book from Hitler. If Hitler ended up winning World War II, I could DEFINATLY see our world turn into Ray Bradbury's \\"future world.\\" Guy Montag's big internal conflict starts when he meets Clarisse, a crazy-17-year-old. She's different from everyone else, because her family talks to each other at night instead of watching TV. She asks Montag if he's happy, and that one question starts everything. He realizes that he isn't happy, and he becomes curious about books. There is no book like Fahrenheit 451. Its constant metaphors, similes, and symbolism cause you to think about things that you would never begin to think about.-->Gabby**Holy Angels Class of '04!!!**"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was a very strange and different book.

It is not only a good story with a strong message regarding freedom of speech. It is beautifully written and very easy to read. The words flow, and each character is perfect in their contribution to the story. This book is pretty short. I think it is a must read for anyone. I'm not going to say more, because you have to read it for yourself!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"One of the signs of a great book, in my opinion, is that it disturbs you - twists with your emotions and never leaves you. More importantly, that it makes you think.Farenheit 451 does this and more. As I read it, it horrified me how much it applies to today's society. People are always offended about one thing, or they want you to delete that. Some people detest reading at all and are content to spend their days watching sitcoms - most of which are not funny and have no point to them whatsoever. These days, people seem to be longing for an easy, brainless, sacchrine happiness and existence. Farenheit 451 shows what happens when those people get their wish.A must-read for anybody of any age - five stars from me! If you like it, and haven't already read other books of this genre (dystopias and such) - may I also recommend 1984 by George Orwell, Anthem by Ayn Rand, and The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The real purpose of burning the books is clearly explained by Montag's boss himself. Those books present opinions that might upset different social, racial, etc. groups. Look at our society where polical correctness so oftent replaces the facts, the truth, and just plain common sense. False sense of social stability achieved this way is the same fallacy that is so brilliantly explored in this book. Extremely relevant."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This, I'm sad to say, was the first time I'd taken the time to read a Bradbury novel. I had no idea what I was missing! This book deserves the status of a classic, all right. It has memorable characters, vivid sentences and scenes, and holds a mirror to the errors of society. Though fifty years old, the book is surprisingly modern in its perceptions.The story follows Guy Montag, a fireman. His job is to start fires, rather than put them out. When the station receives calls about homes that harbor books, the Salamander fire engine races out with kerosene hoses to douse the residence and destroy the threatening pages.What is really under attack in Montag's world is thought, intellectualism, connection between people. The effects of TV and useless trivia, the conflict between art and entertainment, are highlighted here in the flames of Montag's burning. When Montag turns the corner, deciding to combat this world gone mad, he faces deep and long-lasting consequences. And the world will never be the same.Bradbury succeeds in writing a very personal, yet very global tale. The heat of this novel still emanates today. Pick up this book--at the risk of feeling the heat!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"this book is so great it makes me want to read more, it inspired me to read because its about about not being able to read books and fighting for the right to do so"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I liked the book Fahrenheit 451. This book takes place in a futuristic American city. In the book, the main character, Guy Montag, works for a fire station. But instead of putting out fires, they start them. The book is about this group of firemen who find people that own books, go to their house, and burn them. Guys wife, Mildred, is a completely opposite character. She is a woman with absolutly no life at all, she prefers to watch tv in their parlor room all day, and listen to the radio in her &quot;seeshell radio&quot;, that is attached to her ear. Mildred seems to be a completely empty person, and doesnt even realize it when she tries to commit suicide. Beatty, Montags fire chief, is the leader of this group that burn books. As he notices that Guy is starting to realize what books have to offer, Beatty gets more and more curious as to what Guy is really doing on his days off. These two turn out to be enemies towards the end of the book, because of Guys new love of books. In the beginning of the book, Guy meets a seventeen year old girl, named Clarise. Clarise is a different kind of girl for her age in this society. She is more in touch with herself and nature and the people around her. Everyone in this society is completely opposite of that, and consider Clarise an outsider. A few days after Guy meets Clarise, she is killed by a speeding car. When Guys love for books exceeds his passion to burn them, Guy sees an old english professor for help. When Beatty finds out what Guy is up to, he sends the fire department to Guys house. Beatty forces Guy to burn his own house down because of having the books, then places Guy under arrest. Guy takes the flamethrower and burns Beatty to ashes, and knocks out the rest of the members of the fire department. His last obsticle is the Mechanical Hound, which is a machine set to find people that have escaped from the police and fire department. Before Beatty was killed, he had set the hound to find Guy. After Guy is done with the fire department, the Hound finds Guy. The Hound leaps at Guy and injects anesthetic into Guys leg, to get him to stop running. Guy manages to burn the hound and get away. Guy meets a group of people like himself, runaways from the city who enjoy books. The point of this book I think is a possibility of what computers might do to civilization. With the ever expanding computer technololgy we have, books are starting to phase themselves out. They portrayed this in the book by saying that books were written to offend people and had to be rid of. This was a good yet different interpretation of what the future of our society can become."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a great book about the world in the future. This book really made me think about how the world would really be. Will there ever be a time when books will not be allowed? Will there ever be a time when people do not care for other people, or for the small things in life? This is a great book to read and it really makes you think.Fahrenheit 451 is about a time when books are banned from the world. Anyone with books will get their house burned down by the fire department. The cars are really fast and everyone cares only about themselves. Montag, the main character in the book, is on the fire department. He likes to burn books, until he reads a few. Then he starts to like the books and decides he wants to bring books back into the world. Will he succeed?Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent book to read. It also has a good story line and a moral that is outstanding."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If it's written by Bradbury, its got to be good.

Once you read such an awkward book by the master author of science fiction, Ray Bradbury, youre' bound to be memerized by the proceedings. This slightly short book sometimes made me ill at ease, or uncomfortable, because the book is self-conscious in a way. Bradbury's book is almost a conspiracy theory in many accounts, because it deals with the banning of books in an almost non-existent world.The basic premise is that reading a book in this \\"world\\" is against the law, where the penalties are hugely severe. The heroes, or anti-heroes in my book, are the fireman. Instead of their priorties of saving human lives, the fireman are hired basically to burn books. When a unhappily married fireman named Guy Montag questions the burning of books, his view becomes to deepen more and more. He soons to appearicate books, yet his wife and collegues soon mark him as a lawbreaker. Montag soon becomes a fugitive, and details his found use of books toward other intelligent minds who also are fond of books as well.I love Bradbury's interesting vision of the world his book. His beliefs in the future world are almost uncanny to today. But his future world is frightening and paranoid as well. I read the book twice, and I have become found of the characters and terrific and knowlegeable storyline. Yet, I feel FAHRENHEIT 451 should be taken not so lightly. The theme of this book feels so close to home, I feel like Bradbury's \\"world\\" might become our society in the years to come."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a science fiction novel written by Ray Bradbury. The title represents the temperature at which paper burns. The author describes a future society where censorship becomes so severe, that the job of the town's firemen is not to put out fires, but rather to start them by burning books. The government tries to prevent its citizens from learning their own or independent ideas. The main character is Guy Montag. He is one of the firemen. His job is to burn the books. At first he does his job, but later he meets Clarissa, a ghostly image that could represent his conscience, and begins to question his duties. He has an internal conflict because on one hand he wants to do his job, but on the other he doesn't like burning the books any longer. Mr. Montag begins to accept books as a good thing. He starts to store them in his house, but his wife turns him in to the law and they confiscate his library. He escapes and joins an outlaw society that keep the contents of books memorized so that they could be written at a later time when such action is permitted by law. Mr. Bradbury's goal is clearly to show us the extreme to which censors could control a society simply by controlling what we read. This is a great book -- read it!

The story hopes to show that humans are moving to an era of faster, louder, stronger lives and giving up thinking. Force feeding the people information and opinions and expecting no opposition is the goal of the government and the people feel good about their lives. But, in this world there is no happiness. In fact, the only emotions left are negative or false. I think everyone should read this book once and see if it opens your eyes. The story is a little futuristic and does get a little difficult at times but is still worth the effort. And if 200 pages is too much for you, then the future is coming sooner then we think - rent the movie."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is about a community that has banned and outlawed the viewing and reading of books.

Montag's neighbor, a young girl named Clarisse, is excited by the ideas of reading books. He then decides to hide a stash of books in his home.I found this book to be really strange. It is ironic to see how Bradbury was basically able to predict how the world and society is now. It was interesting to see how this book developed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury has a vision for the future; firemen don't put out fires-they start them in order to burn books. Inthis society trivial information is good and knowledge and ideas are bad. Guy Montag is a book burning fireman undergoing a crisis of faith. People around him and his job cause this crisis. His wife spends all day watching her TV and being sucked into the fake reality of the world. She wants a room full of T.V.'s so she can just be connected to society. His next door neighbor Clarisse, is the one who I think starts Montag's thinking about society and what kind of knowledge and ideas are in books. Clarisse is more interested in what she can see in the world around her than in the mindless T.V. This book is a good representation of our society today. The TV and music are affecting our lives a lot more than reading books. These days we are constantly being bombarded by flashes of images and sounds. This is a good book for those who think outside the box and want to look at a different perspective of information these days and what we are really affected by."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451I like the thought that the world could be a completely different place if we did not have books. Before I read this book, I always used to think that it would be cool and a lot better if books did not exist in the world. However, I realized that without books nobody would have their own views on certain subjects, and everyone would be dull like Montag's wife. This fantasy no longer appeals to me, because I hate talking to people like Mildred. Everyone would live in their virtual world and the television would tell them what to think. I like the fact that Montag is forced to think about what he is doing, and he steals books because he has a desire to learn. I feel that I would have done the same thing in his situation, and I feel that I am a lot like him because I like to go with the flow but I don't agree with everything, and I question what I feel is wrong. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who feels the world would be a better place without books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 was one of the best books that I have ever read. I am one of those people who don't read often and don't enjoy books, so having said that is amazing enough for me. What astounds me is that this book was written in the 1950's and the author was able to make some predictions about the future. Now we may not be quite where this book takes place time wise, but some of the technology that is mentioned in this book is not too distant in our future. This book really caught my attention because some of the ideas were ones that I too have thought about. The main reason they burned the books was because they didn't like anything that was fiction, or were unsure it was true. They saw that there was no point in discussing such matters of scientific or religious nature if they could not be proved, but that's just my theory. If you end up reading this book, than you might come up with your own. I recommend this book to anyone who is willing to have an open mind."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I began teaching three years ago, I was required to teach this book. Having never read it before, I began reading it just before our winter break. As I soaked up the story of the book, I realized my students were already living it. They begged me daily, &quot;Ms. Hill, why do we have to read this stupid book? Can't we just watch the movie?&quot; As I got deeper and deeper into the book, I grew increasingly depressed about the future of the world.Then I realized: Bradbury has given me a picture of what might be, if we are not careful. His book written nearly fifty years ago peers just twenty minutes into the future now. Technological developments he had no name for then are very real today. For example, his seashell radio is clearly the walkman many of us see pressed in the ears of teenagers daily. TV screens are growing larger and larger and flat screens with HDTV are on the market now. The next step is clearly the full wall television of Mildred's parlor. Robot dogs like Aibo are just a hop skip and a jump away from the dreaded hound.But this is a future preventable. Maybe. But if popular culture is constantly valued above thoughtful consideration and education, we'll march right into a land of burning books and intellectualism on the run.Bradbury's book made me feel defiant. They could never take my books from me. They could burn me with them if they want, but that's what it'll take before I give up my freedom to think for myself.And as for my students, they remind me every day what an uphill battle I have been sent to fight."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is absolutely amazing. It describes a time in the future where censorship prevails and minds are caged. Nobody has original thoughts; with the abolishing of books creativity was lost as well. Guy Montag, the protagonist, is a fireman (firemen burn books in this story) who has to fight to pull himself from the grip of an overpowering government and tradition, only to see that it is all useless (why teach to people who can't understand?). The novel shows what censorship can do to a society, and why individuals must not accept the norm without questioning its integrity and implications. Overall, read this book immediately and apply what you learn from it into everyday life.By the way, ignore all of the reviewers that gave the book a low score because they could not understand the plot and symbolism. Their comments are similar to saying Shakespeare's works are poorly written because he uses odd vocabulary and the plot is too complex. Unfortunately, these people make of the mass of society, which is why these reviews are commonplace. (The funny thing is, the novel specifically targets these kind of people...)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a simply great book. Yes, it's quite distressing and unpleasant to read - because what Bradbury describes is much closer to truth than we'd like it to be. And that is precisely what makes the reality of the book so alike our own - it's more pleasant not to think about such things, and therefore one can merely say the book doesn't suit one's taste and go 'get entertained' in front of the TV.The disturbing thing about the book is that, unlike many other books that deal with the distant future, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" (written in 1953) hasn't been proved wrong simply by time itself. Not at all. Actually, what is shocking to realize is that we've come quite close to the society Bradbury writes about. Perhaps books haven't been banned yet, but it is indeed the entertainment industry that controls people's minds, the political correctness has reached ridiculous levels, there are ads everywhere and now we even have Segways so that we don't have to walk anywhere... And, of course, we can get a thousand page long classics shortened to a hundred pages - or, better yet, simply watch the movie.The book also has other qualities besides making one think (which is, judging by some other reviews, one of its biggest downsides). One cannot but admire the brilliant way Bradbury uses absurd and creates a completely surreal feeling by using the methods of expressionism to describe the feelings and thoughts of the main character.Bradbury sure had things to write about - and that can be proved by even something as simple as the fact I've spent the last half an hour writing a review on the Internet rather than reading a good book or looking at the world..."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book about 18 months ago, but I am writing a review now because the book came up during a mealtime conversation. We talked about how prophetic a very good science fiction writer can be. This is definitely the case in Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. Guy Montag lives in a world that represses freedom of speech, creativity, and the core of human spirit. People, including his estranged wife, are drones glued to these pseudo realities in television. It describes senseless trivia shows (can anyone say \\"Who wants to be a millionaire?\\") and awfully realistic soap operas that his wife affectionatly refers to as the \\"family.\\"What is most disturbing is that as televisions and technology become more \\"artificially intelligent\\" we will face some of the brainless drivel (we already do) that the major media networks provide us.As a fireman, Guy Montag starts fires with books as the culprit - rather than putting them out. The idea is that books can make some people feel bad and as a result we should get rid of them - in other words books can be controversial and our country does not need disputes. The enforcer is a mechanical dog (which I found a little unrealistic and distracting) that injects a lethal poison into any opponents. Despite the silliness of the mechanical dog - the underlying theme is fantastic - open your mind and save the beauty of spontaneity and creativity of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It was a pleasure to burn. So begins, with this absolutely perfect opening line, Ray Bradbury's celebrated exposition of the dangers of censorship. Everybody knows that Fahrenheit 451 is a novel about book-burning, but this story goes much deeper than those not having read it may suspect. Its message truly does become even more germane and prophetic with every passing day. The skeleton of the plot is rather basic, really. Guy Montag is a fireman whose job it is to burn books and the houses in which these dangerous manifestations of inane scribbling reside - usually hidden. No one even remembers a time when firemen actually put out fires. We join Guy's life as he enters into a cusp of uncertainty. He has dared to pilfer a book here and there and stash them in his house, a most dangerous crime indeed. He soon meets a free-spirited teenager who breathes life into his state of uncertainty and opens his mind to brand new thoughts and possibilities. When she makes him admit that he is not happy, his life is changed forever. He can't take the lack of substance all around him, the wife who thinks of nothing but \\"the family\\" (a type of interactive programming that dominates the living room), the impending war which everyone essentially ignores. He knows there must be something else in life, and he comes to believe that the enlightenment he is after must surely be contained in books. Montag's conversations with his Fire Chief on this subject are quite astounding and revealing, and between this and Montag's friendship with an old former professor, we learn how Montag's world came to be this way.The government did not simply ban books overnight. Censorship started slowly and at low levels. Some minority group complained about this - deleted; another group complained about that - gone; these fellows over here object to so-and-so - zip. So many little pieces of books were removed that, over time, the very essence of books was destroyed. While the government has now come to insist that reading books is a crime, the horrible truth of the matter is that the society itself, in its fractious ways, is the party responsible for this tragic state of affairs. Can there be a more timely topic for our own time? We continually see history books being rewritten, \\"objectionable\\" words, phrases, and (horror of horrors) ideas removed from novels and poems so that no one can possibly be offended by anything under the sun. Censorship is a cancer on society, and the world needs visionaries such as Ray Bradbury to forcefully draw attention to the cold hard facts that a majority of the population seems to ignore or fails to acknowledge. Once the true meaning has been chopped out of the books lining our shelves, it will be too late to reverse the momentum without the aid of some kind of miracle. Fahrenheit 451's message is one that all people should be exposed to, and this novel is such a quick (but powerful) read that everyone really should read it. As horrible as it is to envision, I fear that this type of censorship could indeed happen here."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am teaching &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; as the example of a dsytopian novel in my Science Fiction class, although it is certainly one of the most atypical of that particular type of narrative discourse. Compared to such heavy weight examples as George Orwell's &quot;1984,&quot; Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World,&quot; Yevgeny Zamiatin's &quot;We,&quot; Ray Bradbury's imaginative meditation on censorship seems like light reading. But the delicious irony of a world in which firemen start fires remains postent and the idea of people memorizing books so they will be preserved for future generations is compelling. Of course, there have been more documented cases of &quot;book burning,&quot; albeit in less literal forms, since &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; was first published in 1953, so an argument can be made that while all the public debate was over how close we were the Orwellian future envisioned in &quot;1984,&quot; it is Bradbury's little parable that may well be more realistic (especially in terms of the effects of television).The novel is based on a short story, &quot;The Fireman,&quot; that Bradbury published in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; in 1951 and then expanded into &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; two years later. However, those who have studied Bradbury's writings caw trace key elements back to a 1948 story &quot;Pillar of Fire&quot; and the &quot;Usher II&quot; story from his 1950 work &quot;The Martian Chronicles.&quot; Beyond that, there is the historical record of the Nazis burning books in 1933. The story is of a future world in which everyone understands that books are for burning, along with the houses in which they were hidden. Guy Montage is a fireman who has been happy in his work for ten years, but suddenly finds himself asking questions when he meets a teenage girl and an old professor.&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is not only about censorship, but also about the inherent tension in advanced societies between knowledge and ignorance. Reading this novel again I am reminded about Pat Paulsen's editorial on the old &quot;Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; (a series well acquainted with the perils of censorship) about how we might enjoy freedom of speech in this country but we do not enjoy freedom of hearing because &quot;there is always the danger of something being said.&quot; Censorship, in practical terms, is the effort of those who do not want others to hear what they find offensive, for whatever reasons, basically because it leads to people thinking thoughts they do not want them to be thinking. Through the rambling diatribes of Captain Beatty, Bradbury makes this point quite clear to his readers.Even though this is essentially a novella, Bradbury's work retains the charm of a short story. The recurring use of animal imagery throughout the story, the use of the mythic ideas of the salamander and the phoenix, make &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; more poetic than any other dystopian work. Even if it is predominantly a one note argument regarding censorship, it is impossible to deny that Bradbury makes a clear and convincing case for his position. Besides, there is something to be said for any work that insures that beyond the point at which water freezes the only other recognizable number on the Fahrenheit scale is the point at which book paper starts to burn."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"\\"The good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies.\\" Thus says FAHRENHEIT 451's Professor Faber in explaining to Guy Montag the importance of the \\"telling detail\\" of books. Montag is ready to hear these words, his job as a book burner in this twisted society of Ray Bradbury's invention no longer makes sense to him.Books are illegal in the world of FAHRENHEIT 451. So is driving under 55 m.p.h. Faster is always considered better. Montag's society doesn't want anyone to stop and reflect, because it realizes that if people stop and think about things, they'll get restless. As Montag's fire captain tells him, \\"You ask why to a lot of things and you wind up very unhappy indeed.\\" An important difference between this futuristic society created in 1953 and George Orwell's world of 1984 is that Orwell's government was top-down while all the minorities (of every race, color and creed) in Bradbury's dystopia got together to burn everything that offended them. In this case, lack of tolerance for differing voices led to no voices at all--democracy has eaten itself by misunderstanding itself. Problems aren't faced; they are burned. This is the world Guy Montag rebels against; how deeply it reflects our own world is something to think about along the way.Ray Bradbury is a good writer, one who encourages people to ask the question &quot;why&quot;. He wants everyone to have a voice and to be able to express himself or herself, but not in such a way that they drown out other voices--the best ideas, he seems to believe, will naturally come to the fore. A short book of under 180 pages, FAHRENHEIT 451 is often assigned to middle school students. For those--like myself--who missed it in school, it still stands as an important work for all lovers of reading, freedom, and ideas for their own sake."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Sometime in the not-so-distant future, the world will change severely. Soon people's homes will be completely fireproofed, leaving no use for firemen as they are thought of today. But they will not be out of work; their role will simply change. In an ever increasingly television oriented society where yesterday's classics are now thought of as censurable tripe, firemen will be starting fires, not stopping them. Their new role will be of a secret police that search out the hated books and raise their temperature to the level at which books burn, Fahrenheit 451. This is the premise of Ray Bradbury's novel. Bradbury's story is an ominous look into where he fears society is presently headed. It is in many ways a warning against existing increasing rates of demoralization, drug use, addiction to non thought-provoking activities, and illiteracy. He easily communicates how such simple trends could evolve into societal brainwashing and individuals who say they are happy, think they are 'social,' and simply spend all their time in their parlors (the ultimate in new television technology). One of the self-proclaimed 'odd' people of this book went decidedly against the norm in saying, &quot;But I don't think it's social to get a bunch of people together and then not let them talk, do you?&quot; However, this book is not solidly a story of doom and gloom. The main character is a fireman named Montag and he ends up providing hope for the reader. While he is not a godlike hero, made up of courage and thew, he does fit the quixotic template in that he is a sad classicist in a new and frightening time. After only a small jolt of reality from an imaginative child, he realizes the world could be made of truth and beauty, rather than the contemporary cheap thrills and insatiable cupidity. Furthermore, this tale has much in common with two other critically acclaimed classics. Montag's government is merely interested in controlling the people while waging war with other super powers, much like the opression in George Orwell's 1984. Additionally, individuals hold very little sacred, no one cares for human life and everyone is looking for a cheap (often-dangerous) thrill. This is a public where men who handle drug overdoses are not concerned that such matters happen &quot;nine or ten a night,&quot; all of this general apathy is mirrored in the novel Brave New World. But, again, Bradbury is a creative author, and his visions of the future are not nearly as hopeless as 1984, or so alien and drug based as Brave New World. Fahrenheit 451's point is twofold. While it warns against where society is headed, it also shows that it only takes good people like Montag to bring society back from the brink of ruination. This faith in the goodness of the common man does not falter and shows optimism that is not always part of such works. Upbeat themes can be hard to find in such otherwise bleak forewarnings, and even in most normal classics it is hard to find a purely happy ending and/or main point. Seeing as this book was published over forty years ago one would assume that it is out of date, but this is not true. It is a science-fiction book without any unbelievable differences between this projected world and our own. Also, Fahrenheit 451 is easily read. The book communicates its point in a mere 160 pages, none of which are filled with incomprehensible vocabulary. It contains enough action for those who like it, and plenty of Montag's self-realizations for readers interested in seeing characters delve into their own mind's inner recesses. This book should be a joy to anyone who chooses to pick it up. Conversely, this easily enjoyed book carries with it some strong meaning. Montag's experiences are a warning to people who would get so used to their impersonal lifestyle that they would become desensitized to many of the world's horrors. Upon finishing the book, one is sure to be more guarded against choosing an easy path, and therefore becoming less of a human. Bradbury did well in bringing the way life became more and more impersonal and barbaric. &quot;I put up with (my children) when they come home three days a month; it's not bad at all. You heave them into the 'parlor' and turn on the switch. It's like washing clothes.&quot; In likening children to annoying creatures which deserve as much attention as laundry, the character who made this statement both disgusts the audience and says the statement as if it were only natural. The author has a talent for letting his audience see situations both as they normally would and as the characters do. Even through the opening we see some of the book's many themes played out in Montag."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, written by Ray Bradbury, is the chilling, prophetic, science fiction novel of the future. About censorship, it portrays a world where books are outlawed by a totalitarian goverenment, it shows how society's only goal is to achieve &quot;pleasure&quot; through the senses. It tells of a world where petty facts are more valued than knowledge and ideas; a place and time where no one questions what they are doing and why, but just doing it by rote. Guy Montag is a fireman of the future. Ironically, his job is to start fires, to burn everything, especially &quot;corrupt&quot; books that contradict the government, and society's way of life; books that make people think and learn to question things. Like all others, he doesn't ask questions, and enjoys his job, enjoys burning things, because &quot;fire is bright and fire is clean.&quot; He lives oblivious to the frightening realities of life until his next-door neighbor, Clarisse, a young girl of seventeen, teaches him to ponder what might be behind the books that he burns, to learn to ask the question &quot;why?&quot; This causes him to undergo a &quot;crisis of fiath.&quot; Examining his life for the first time, he sees how empty and meaningless it is. His wife cares for nothing else than her &quot;television family&quot; and is sucked into a world of endless chatter, movement, and moving images. He realizes the terrible horror of what society is doing; watching the tube, &quot;oohing&quot; and &quot;aahing&quot; but not really talking nor communicating with one another. Montag grows to recognize what a corrupt society he is living in. When clarisse mysteriously disappears, Montag is motivated to make some changes in his life. During nighttime &quot;calls,&quot; he starts hoarding books away in his home, determined to understand what is behind those pages. Montag also tries to ignore Captain Beatty who tries to confuse him in his search for the meaning of books. Pondering the questions of life, his futile search for the ultimate &quot;truth&quot; leads him to Faber, a retired English professor. With Faber's help, Montag finds the road to justice and restoring the &quot;past&quot; where people are not afraid. Written in third-person, this book is an excellent portrayal of human nature; the good, the bad, and the in-between. Ray Bradbury, the author, paints a vivid picture of a future with no books, and makes the reader realize that without books, creativity and thought would be stifled. Literary devices such as similes, metaphors, and rich symbolism (example: &quot;seashells&quot; are the future generation's discmans) are used by the author to enrich the story. There are many types of conflicts shown in &quot;Fahrenheit 451;&quot; person vs. self, person vs. society, and person vs. person. Montag struggles with himself and tries to distinguish between right and wrong. He also battles with the society around him, and tries to make them realize that books are not to be feared, but worshipped. This is evident when he reads the poem to Mildred and her friends while they are in the &quot;parlor&quot; watching the &quot;walls.&quot; But becuase of their lack of understanding and depth, they do not udnerstand the purpose and meaning behind the poem and regards Montag as being &quot;crazy.&quot; Montag'ss struggles with Captain Beatty is the person vs. person conflict represented in the book. Since the world declining to conditions recounted in the book is hgihly possible, the novel has an &quot;aura of chilling prophecy,&quot; which I like. A sense of the &quot;not so distant future,&quot; with fantastic magical realism such as &quot;spacecrafts&quot;are common in all of Ray Bradbury's work, such as the &quot;Illustrated Man&quot; and &quot;Fahrenheit 451.&quot; I enjoyed reading this &quot;thought-provoking novel,&quot; about the future and censorship. It is no small wonder why there are over four and a half million copies in print all over the world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Several reviews on here have given Fahrenheit 451 a low score because they thought the premise was too far-fetched. These reviewers aren't aware of the situations that exist in certain theocracies around the world. Afghanistan under the Taliban outlawed television and women were not allowed to read or educate themselves. In several Middle East countries, merely speaking up against the government makes you a target.Bradbury looked at different phenomena in our society- the desire to not offend anyone, the dumbing-down of a society in love with television, etc., and simply extrapolated these until he reached an end very similar to the conditions that existed under the Taliban.Part of the point of science fiction is to be far-fetched, but good science fiction uses those far-fetched ideas to warn us of the dangers of the present, in this case the dangers of censorship, of political correctness, of television, and anyone who thinks those dangers are not real, that this book doesn't have relevant warnings, hasn't studied the real world enough.Everyone should read this book. It's an entertaining and easy read but also has a lot of idealogical depth behind it for those who are willing to think and read at the same time. If you don't want to think about what you read, well, go watch TV and be done with it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"My daughter has to read this for her 10th grade english class and I decided to check it out myself. It is not as well written or as compelling as 1984 but it is still a very good read. The author makes a number of excellent points. To me it felt like film noir mixed up with some comic book qualities in my imagination. Still, a very good read with lessons to share."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is a classic,a must read.A little sci-fi and a little eerie future reality of censorship in the extreme."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is one of those books that you see pieces of in all kinds of other books and movies."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Great book. Scary look into a possible future if the censors get their way. One of several books assigned to high school students which intrigued me. Several selections in the high school cannon are introspective of the human character. The value of this theme is obvious considering the carefree attitude most of the youth have today. The afterword and the Coda point out some interesting things about rewriting books to include everyone. We don't have to be politically correct ALL the time, especially if it is read it in the historical context it was written. Look at Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but the story line was a little different then I had expected it to be.

Saw the film a few years ago and it remained in my mind."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a great book that should not be taken in a literal sense, as it is jam packed with symbolism. In this futuristic setting, nobody seems to be concerned with anything but their own happiness. These people spend majority of their time on frivolous things like fast cars, large televisions, and a type of ear-piece radio. All of the books in the city are to be burned because they create conflicting views amongst the people, ultimately resulting in fighting and unhappiness. Majority of the people are unable to form their own independent thoughts, as the schools are even changed in a way that students only learn facts and not problem solving, logic, reason, or other philosophical subjects. The main character, Montag, is a firefighter that has always done his job (burning books) without questioning. However, after a strange series of events, he slowly begins to develop his own thoughts, and starts questioning the society he lives in."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Generally my favorite Bradbury illustrator is Ray's compadre Joe Mugnani, but Steadman's crazed, violent visions sharpen the edge on this book and help you see just how frightening Bradbury's dystopia really is.

Guy meets a girl who turns his whole world upside down. She opens the doors to his mind and changes his whole perspective on life. She changes everything he ever knew.I enjoyed this book. I learned that you might not know people or even yourself as well as you thought. I also learned that you don't really know what you have until you have it ripped away from you.Some parts in this book made me want to keep reading because it was so interesting. Other times the reading was harder and it went slower. A lot of the little questions went unanswered; however the big ones were answered and basically laid out for you. It wasn't that hard of a book to understand. It didn't skip around too much. It stayed with Montag until the end."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"One of my all time favorite books. Montag lives in a world where books are burned and firemen actually set fires instead of putting them out. It's hard to imagine what Montag had to go through to make such a change in his life and go against all social norms, to be one of the most revered in society (a fireman) to an outcast. It's also very interesting to see the correlations to today's lifestyle."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's way of writing forces you to think about how non-sensical the world is becoming. While throwing in a couple of other ideas, he builds up to describing the horrors of censorship. It seems ridiculous that the could actually become that crazy, but if we tried to make the world perfect-it would leave many people unhappy. And if we destroy books, we're destroying a person's valuable opinion containing the key to the past."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read this book for schoool.

I strongly reccomend this book to people. The ending was especially great."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's chilling and well-written vision of an all-too-possible future is absolutely timeless. It succeeds in its purpose of encouraging readers to take a second look at their own society, values and beliefs.

To any other reader, student or otherwise, I say this: View reading this book as a privilege. The very fact that we as a society can peruse this outstanding work and form our own opinions about it ensures that Bradbury's dire prediction of the future will remain only fiction."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's chilling and well-written vision of an all-too-possible future is absolutely timeless.

Well, i recomend this book 105% to anyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book, &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; by Ray Bradbury, is an exceptional telling of a future that might have been, and might still be. The story is of a young man, a &quot;fireman&quot;, in a future where information and knowledge come from television. Books are banned, and owning a book is punishable by death. The fireman becomes fascinated with why people would be willing to risk death in order to own something the state says is bad for them. He steals a book and reads it. Then he steals another book and another and another. Eventually he becomes exactly what he has been trained to eradicate. Finally he is turned in, by his wife, who doesn't understand his change in attitude and must answer a call to come to his own house...where his stolen collection of books are burned. He runs away and goes into hiding, until he eventually comes upon a group of people living outside the city without luxury of television. The people in this group have solved the problem of not being allowed to own books. Each person selects a book and then commits it to memory...in effect they become the book. If they are searched, they have no books and cannot be punished. They have become the receptacles for all the world's great literature and for their own future; a future that someday may permit books. This is a brilliant story, which has many parallels to America today, and not just Nazi Germany in the 30's. Less than 50% of Americans read newspapers; the idea of functional illiteracy has become commonplace; and an entire generation doesn't know anything that didn't come out of the television. As Howard Beale says in the movie Network, &quot;You dress like the tube, you talk like the tube, you raise your children like the tube...My God, you maniacs...you are the real thing, we are the illusion.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book, though possibly confusing in some places, is a wonderful look at a world where Firemen are paid to burn books. It describes a world where all the masterpieces of classical literature are &quot;simplified&quot; and &quot;toned down&quot; into tasteless TV episodes.

It's a fiction book, interlinked with a remarkable similarity to our society. It could be catologed as a satire to the world we live in. One in which our minds have little time to think on thier own, and are guided by false entertainment. It takes place in the future (written around 1950) and the heart change a fireman has towards his career.

The scary part is how close we are. The sea shell radio can be portrayed as teenagers and their headphones. Mildred and the gals might as well be the stereotypical women who are having a tough relationship week; the ones who watch chick flicks with a tub of ice cream all week end. If you are interested in seeing what people from the seventies though about the future then this book is a good fit. Also, if you are interested in the future and sci-fi this is also a good book because their are some inventions not yet invented that are mentioned. I was required to read this book for my 9th grade year and I probably won't be reading it again because its just not one of those books.

A book that can be referred to by one name by a couple of generations. If your going to start with Bradbury (May he Rest in Peace hopefully in Green Town Illinois) this is the place: Fahrenheit 451 (the temperature at which paper ignites--\\"It was a pleasure to burn.\\").Fahrenheit has been called dystopian, a clssification that can be applied I suppose, but in reality Bradbury is just extending trends he saw back in the late \`50s and early \`6os. The book is a story of what we ultimately would do to ourselves, so it's not so shocking in the plugged in soceity that we have become with our reality televisiohn, our big screan T.V.s and our playtime phones, and of course, this web of disinformation and nonsense that I am using. Sometimes I wonder if CEOs didn't just read Bradbury's nightmare and say, \\"hey, here's the way we can turn everyone into mindless, easily manipulated, slugs. It's more terrifying than 1984 with all the overtones of Stalanism and what you want to call the psycho patyhology of the Nazis, because the tyrrany in Fahrenheit is self inflicted and quite normal in a wayThe coversion of Montague the fireman and the main character, is Bradbury's optimism coming through and is the character hook that drags the reader through the tale. At least there are people who just keep the faith of intelligence and inspiration, the book people who are a threat to the dystopian society just by quietly reading and remembering.If you start here with Fahrenheit the _Martian Chronicles_ should come next, because even though its science is now quaint, there is a moral tale in that episodic compilation and one begins to see Bradbury's syle emerge. Just as with Wells in _War of the Worlds_ the message is more powerful than the factual underpinings. That's why calling anything \\"High Teck SciFi\\" just means tha it's up to date with the science of the moment and the we can ask with the Martian in one of the episodes \\"whose to say I'm not the future and your the past.\\" Who knows? long after we are all gone where may be goldened eyed Martians, living in chess piece cities beside wine dark canals.We see no one of Bardbury's ilke until we go back to the 19th century. In _Dandelion Wine_, that golden elixer, and _Something Wicked this Way Comes_, both of which can hardly be called SciFi, we see that sytyle mature into the trope of the remembered past.But to go down that road it is best to start at Fahrenheit."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"bought this for a siblings course requirement. does what it needs too. this was a good purchase at a reasonable price."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I recently read this remarkable novel and felt that the other commentaries were correct in stating that regardless of cowardly, bitchy, and psyco immigrants we should not censor ANYTHING just because they are offended.

Never before had I read a book about the banning of books and using &quot;firemen&quot; to get rid of them. At times there were some lulls and some confusing parts, but overall Bradbury's unique style is what made the book worthwhile for me to read. I believe that Montag was at times a flat character that could use a little spice, but his growth throughout the novel seemed to counteract the deterioration within his own surrounding society. To think that one day our own society could be like Montag's; burning books and stifling creativity; is absolutely frightening to me and this book does not try to supress that notion. It actually amplifies it, but it can be used as a reference for our future generations so they would never reach that low point that Montag's society reached."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenheit 451 is a wonderful book, though slow at times.

I must admit that there were some facts and happenings in this book that I did not necessarily understand completely, or a line of events that seemed out of order or somewhat confusing.

As we see in other books like &quot;Brave New World&quot;, the primary characters in &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; may appear to be naieve or even stupid, at times. But, one doesn't have to look very far or very hard to see examples of blind acceptance of ideas and leaders. To intelligent, critical minds, this acceptance is often ludicrous. Look back 60 or 70 years and you see a whole nation succumbing to stupid ideas - and 6 million people died.&quot;Farenheit 451&quot; is a prime example of what science fiction can often do better than any other type of fiction - give us parables or lessons of those things that are best and worst in ALL of us"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury tells a bizarre tale of a world were firemen burnbooks, books are banned, and vidio media rules.

For some reason, this was not part of my high school's curriculum and it has evaded me until now. However, with Mr. Bradbury's recent passing and in his honor, I decided now was the time. This is a book that has fairly embedded itself in American popular culture so, despite not having read it and having seen bits and pieces of the 1966 film starring Oskar Werner, I was already familiar with its basic premise and themes. And as they say, the book is better than the movie!As is the case with great science fiction, it continues to be as relevant today as it was at the time of original publication. Especially relevant is Bradbury's emphasis on electronic media's usurpation of peoples' attention. Everyone has a \\"Wall\\" (i.e. big screen television) that spews mindless entertainment. Everyone interacts with a disembodied \\"family,\\" which might be like the Internet-based social networks of today. With the addiction to these media, people stop knowing or caring about what's going on around them to the point where they even begin to forget why they do what they do or even how they met their spouses. Superficial interactions supplant true human intimacy. Most significantly, they lose their capacity for critical thought because their society has promoted the idea that individualism leads to conflict and avoiding conflict is paramount even if it results in a society of conformists. Ignorance, as they say, is bliss. The irony is, while Americans may not be fighting amongst themselves, they are fighting with the rest of the world. Their abdication of critical thought keeps them placid and easily tractable, but provides no salvation.If you're trying to understand why you should read this book, the reason is basically this: It's a parable about what happens when people don't read at all."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Awesome book!

It matches the novel perfectly and allowed us to stop and discuss often!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is a controversial book that takes place in the future. It revolves around a firefighter named Guy Montag, but is very unlike firefighters of our time. In Fahrenheit 451, the job of firefighters is to burn books and houses where they are kept, even if that means burning the people in the homes. The people of authority believe that books are bad for society because they cause conflict between groups of people. They also make people think more than necessary, which always causes trouble. Because of the censorship in society, the citizens have become no more than robots; the few people who refuse to conform are killed by the government. Montag finally sees the truth to the life that he has been blindly living for thirty years and decides that there is need for reform in society, and that he can help to change it.The main characters of this book are Montag, Mildred, Clarrise and Fire Captain Beatty. Montag is a fireman from the third generation that burns books. He is not often aware of the actions that he takes. But when he meets Clarisse he opens his eyes and starts to realize the true meaning of books and life. Mildred is Montag's sick wife. She is suicidal and her only life is with her fake \\"family\\" within the walls of her parlor. Mildred doesn't care about Montag, nor does she understand him. Clarisse is an intelligent and adventurous seventeen year old girl who becomes friends with Montag. She introduces him to the meaning and beauty of life. Clarisse is very different from other because she \\"ask's \`why' rather than \`how'\\". Captain Beatty is perhaps one of the most interesting characters of the story because he is the enlightened man who has given up because it is simply easier to lose than to fight.The main themes are censorship, ignorance, and redemption. Censorship is shown in destruction and fear because authoritative figures burn houses down that have books and other material that is harmful to the community; books, magazines, and anything that is educational that might cause someone to question the community that they live in. For example, the firefighters burned an elderly ladies' house because she questioned the community. The leadership is so corrupt that they end up burning the old lady as well because she wanted to stay with her books and they didn't feel like trying to get her to leave. Montag shows ignorance when Clarisse starts sharing her ideas with him and he thinks that she is crazy even though almost everything she says is completely true. Eventually he starts to question his own actions about burning houses. He redeems his ignorance by listening to her and finally by having a paradigm shift and fighting back against his own fellow firefighters and society's structure.One of the strengths of the book was a strong use of imagery. One example being what Montag said about his wife Mildred: \\"If only someone else's flesh and brain and memory. If only they could have taken her mind along to the dry cleaner's and emptied the pockets and steamed and cleansed it and reblocked it and brought it back in the morning.\\" In this small passage you could imagine the picture your head and live the scene. Ray Bradbury used strong imagery to enhance the story and make it seem more real. Another strength of the book is the use of symbols, such as Montag, which is the name of a paper manufacturer. Some of the weaknesses are that some of the characters, mainly Mildred and Clarrise, did not play a big enough role in the story. They made short appearances and then left or died, but they were two of the most interesting characters. One final weakness of this story was that the end came so suddenly and it felt as though we had been ripped off because the whole story led up to an unexciting end. In conclusion, the book was a good book it was very interesting and had some meaning in it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Timeless work on a futuristic society completely and utterly ignorant of any reality except their corporate jingles, giant TV's, and fake families. A look into a shallow desensitized self censored society where intellectuals are targeted as criminals, books are outlawed, and those who refuse to submit are tracked down by the mechanical hound.Fahrenheit 451 is a frightening look inside of a corporate dystopian hell where there is no \`We the People' just \`we the market' and the State is omnipotent. Out on the fringes of the state's control remains a remnant of society, mostly hobos, who are dedicated to preserving the words that many will never read. A classic example when people stop thinking for themselves."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's story of how he wrote this genius book in the UCLA basement on a manual typewriter at 10-cents an hour is such a perfect start. The nine days in dimes that he spent came to so much good. This is a classic because it is science-fiction that predicts our world today. If you look closely, you'll see ipods and cell phones and flatscreen TVs in Bradbury's artistic vision. The message is obvious but insidious. We know that books are the knowledge of our anscestors, that writing is ideas and that without them we would be vapid, yet we still don't actually get it. Bradbury has created a world with evil every bit as tempting as our own, then turns it all around into a greater good. It's magic!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The reviewer who said there are frightening similarities between the book and what we see happening today is bang on the money.I first read the book in highschool, then reread it several times when I became an adult. I hope they still give this book to high school students to read. It's written clearly and cleanly and is easily digestible. Much like brave new world, we should be shocked at the society portrayed in the book. But if you look carefully around you we are more like that society that we care to admit. I have a friend, a university grad, who refuses to read any books because she thinks they are geeky and dry. She prefers the world of TV and glossy magazines with few words. How different is she from the main characters wife?It's an excellent book you will read quickly but think about for ever."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I've always had trouble reading but when I read this book for my English 2 class I loved it.

Bradbury has made a gigantic prophecy ! And finally this novel makes it clear how to survive among all these chaotic forces which want to destroy the mankind : BOOKS .

His dealing with censorship was absolutley amazing. Most of the futuristic things in this story have become true since the 1950's when Bradbury wrote this book. Even if you don't like science fiction you'll love this book, I hate Science Fiction and I loved this book. You've got to read it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I first read this book after my mother, a senior english teacher, was getting ready to have her students read Farenheit 451. I immediately fell in love with the book. In the almost 10 years since I fist read the book, I have read it over and over again. While in college, I wrote a paper for a Lit class showing the how Bradbury's science fiction is slowly becoming science fact (i.e. seashells= walkman. Its scary to see how a book written in 1953, as a work of fiction, is becoming reality. If you want to know what I mean, then read &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; and see for yourself. It is a definite eye opener that sends chills thorugh my body everytime I read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The sheer poetry of Ray Bradbury's words in F451 is absolutely amazing. Not only that, but he also gives a chilling look into a very possible future, were books are burned. And it shows how insignifigant and stupid people become without books. Bradbury is a 1st-rate writer, and Farenheit 451 is no exception. This and Dandelion Wine are his two best books EVER. A compelling, chilling story, and a must read for those who like futuristic stories, Bradbury stories, and poetic stories."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What a treat to re-read this book with the added bonus of the Coda at the end and the Conversation with Ray Bradbury.In my memory 451 was about book burning, but it is actually about the death of thinking and conversation and culture. Anyone who watches TV today knows we are certainly headed in that direction with the dumbed down shows and news casts. We are certainly not supposed to question authority. Our library checkouts and bookstore purchases can be monitored for daring to read outside the boundries of correctness.Dare to read this book and think about what Ray Bradbury foretold."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have to be honest and confess that my rating is really three stars + one star for the historic value. This is the novel that 7th grade English teachers across the US recommend to teach children the value of books-- I guess that that fact alone earns it a star.Bradbury creates a vision of a world where Firemen burn books when they're found instead of putting out fires. People have wall-sized interactive television which has taken the place of family life. Teenagers are encouraged to drive as quickly as possible when bored, and bearing children is officially nearly forbidden. One fireman, spurred on by a non-conformist neighbor, begins to question his task and becomes alive to the value in books.While some of the messages certainly are still relevant, the book is not as strong of an effort of other Bradbury novels. The tone and the heavy message focus date the book and tend to say more to someone interested in the concerns of the 50s then they really appeal to modern readers.Difficult not to recommend, all things considered, but don't expect too much."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ignore the people who claim this book is boring, horrible, or even offensive-this is one of the best books written, and paints a future that sometimes doesn't seem that far off. A book worth reading again and again."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Ray Bradbury's Fahenheit 451, we get to look at a futuristic world where books are banned and reading is prohibited. The narrator is a firefighter named Montag and unlike the firefighters of out modern society the firefighters of Montag's world start fires to burn books as opposed to extingushing fires to help citizens. Through the novel, we see how the government controls society by watching the citizens everymove and controlling what they may see or hear by using their own propaganda. This can be seen through Montag's wife, who is a drug using zombie addicted to watching government TV twenty four hours a day. Montag eventually becomes a victim when becomes interested in the books he is hired to destroy, steals them and hides them in his home. Through Montag's experiences we get a close look at how individuals in his world have no control of their destiny. However, when it seems most bleak and Montag is close to being discovered, Bradbury introduces some savior like characters. Fleeing from the law, Montag finally discovers the Book People living in the forest. These people memorize books and then they repeat the book to others so that books will live on forever in their memory even though they are being destroyed by the government. Although Bradbury builds a complex plot, the message is simple, when a society tries to control peoples basic freedoms so that they can manipulate them with their own propaganda, its time to start heading for the woods."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is a classic story of censorship, in an overprotective society. Stories are told of people's happiness, newly found after learning from the many banned works of classic authors such as Shakespeare. This distopic society uses feigned happiness to mask the true meaning of life. They are overwhelmed by external stimuli to prevent them from learning anything new from within.This is an excellent book, and I reccommend that anybody who has had any experience with censorship read this. Anybody who has already read Fahrenheit 451 should read it again, and again, to see how society has changed to, or away from this form."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's classic is another look at how the world could be headed for literary distruction. In his own thoughts at the end of this novel he compares the actual burning of books to the figurative slow burning of books by abridging. He believes that every book should be left in it's original text as the auther so intended; every verb, adjective and comma.This book is a must read for all appreciaters of any type of literature. It reinforced my forgotten belief of a book's true value.So throw down that remote and pick up a good novel, unless of course there's a good episode of Seinfeld on ... or a good movie... and of course you have to watch the world series, and every other sports playoffs .... ahhhh forget books they take up to much time anyway. That didn't last long, did it?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was to discriptive in some of the sceens and others had barly anything. The author never said anywhere what the time/date it was. It was really hard to understand. Sometimes I know what was going on, it din't stay in one place very long to catch up."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read this book for my 8th grade reading class. I'm not much of a reader, in fact I don't read at all unless I have to. I thought this was a good book, but could have been better without all the elaboration. Every little thing that he talked about whether it was the firehouse or the match he described it to the nth degree. Overall I thought it was a fairly good book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"My youngest daughter is an avid reader and loves re-reading books she was assigned in English class. In fact, she is a collector of these required assigned readings such as Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This was a fantastic book. Felt like the quality and price were fair as well. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"An excellent novel, but terrifying due to its plausibility. Not only, in today's society, does the story created by Bradbury seem possible, but it seems as if it could occur shortly. It does give one ideas to consider, especially about the mores of our society. Other than the underlying themes, this is wholly a good book. The plot is entertaining and fast-paced, and the characters are wonderfully developed. The humorous, futuristic household items, and some of the characters' attitudes lighten the mood and keep the book from becoming too cynical. Overall, this is an excellent book worth reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's classic vision of a prophetic destruction of society is beautifully addressed in Fahrenheit 451. It shows how the incineration of books, symbols for intelligence and wisdom, lead to nothing but ignorance and collectivist states of society that will eventually destroy mankind. The protagonist, Montag, is however an individualist in this futuristic society who stands for his own beliefs and does not conform to his destructive surroundings. This is a very powerful novel, however Ray Bradbury may have been inspired by other writers with the original idea of literature devoted to individualism. It was written in 1951, around the same time that George Orwell's 1984 was written. However the genius with this original and very revolutionary idea of incorporating individualism into literature is Ayn Rand, who wrote the classic novelette, Anthem, in 1937. Anyone who enjoyed Fahrenheit 451 will enjoy Anthem even more."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have enjoyed reading this book. everyone will enjoy it after the first reading. It may be slighlty difficult in the beginning but if you continue to read you will find this book to be very deep, and compelling. I feel as if the more you read it, the more you will enjoy it because you will absorb more information that you may have missed on the first reading. Go Montag!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"&quot;Fahrenheit 451,&quot; by Ray Bradbury, shows the theme of men and women not thinking for themselves, but letting others make decisions for them. Many want a perfect world, where everything goes right, but when people gain knowledge of something it causes segregation of beliefs resulting in problems. Bradbury acknowledges this, but tries to convey the message that, with knowledge of the past, we can understand the reason for mistakes made and prevent them from happening again. Another message that is presented is that the people are afraid of knowing things: thinking scares them. They let others think for them, in this case the government.&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is full of metaphors that, when understood, compliment the theme. One metaphor is the mechanical hound. It is a computerized animal used as the government's way of punishing its enemies. The hound shows the power dictatorship has the power the government has to enforce. The seashells which people listen to are used to promote the policies of the government. The seashells can be thought as to help, &quot;drift these people off to sea,&quot; as seashells would drift out to sea. Finally fire is used often as a subject of metaphors. Burning the books is a way to make them non-existent. The government doesn't want the books because the knowledge in the books contradicts the governmental policy. They burn them, like one would burn a piece of trash if they didn't want it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Part of the appeal of this sort of book, books like '1984' or 'Brave New World' is that we can look at them retrospectively. Written mostly in the earlier part of the last century, they predicted just what sort of messes we would have created for ourselves in the next. The ideas their authors came up with were always just possible; in many cases some of the things the authors dreamed up came true, or almost so. It's chilling to consider that these books were written as 'worst case scenarios' of the time in which we now live.So it is with Fahrenheit 451 - much of the appeal of this book is it's consideration of just how far the TV craze would go, and how dumbed down the western world would become. The book is set not very far into our future, possibly this decade - how close are we to the sort of censorship Bradbury imagined? How much has our sense of community disappeared? How dumb are we?The interest for me, lay in these questions. I wouldn't consider 'Fahrenheit 451' great literature. I didn't think the writing was particularly skillful, or the plot incredibly suspensful. But the ideas Bradbury writes about make this book great. It really is one of those modern classics you should bother to read, especially if you enjoy Dystopian fiction like 'The Handmaid's Tale, 'Brave New world', or '1984)' or science fiction of any sort. Another one that, although it may seem like light reading or pulp as you are reading it, will stay with you for a good few days after you've put it aside and moved onto the next book....."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It was another great work by Bradbury. I like reading scifi books and this was the perfect book for me. I was reading it for a class in high school. I had to do a report and it was the perfect book for it. The fireman went off the hook because his mind went crazy after he heard the his boss killed a girl. I was not his fault. I would have do the same if that happened to me. I recomened the book to the scifi types. You will enjoy the fireman's journy through life of fun until murder. You'll love it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This excellent book captures a society unlike any other. In this world, books are outlawed. If you are caught with them, you are jailed and the books are burned. Guy Montag, who is the protaginist of the story, is a firefighter. However, instead of putting out fires, he starts them. He never questions the laws of this society until he meets a seventeen year old girl. She places all of these wierd thoughts and ideas into his head. From then on he questions everything. This winds up getting him in trouble. However, in the end this works out for the best. We definitely recommend this book for anyone who wants to burn their brain. For under six bucks, you can get a great thriller."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was neither good, nor was it bad. I admit, it was a difficult read...it was very slow paced...but the story had a frightening realism to it. It depicts a society where books are burned and knowledge is, in essence, controlled by a government out of control. The premise was very interesting, but the paistagging detail in which everything was described left me fairly bored with it. It has a nice moral...if you can stick out the bordom."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I think that the vision of Fahreneit 451 of the future is too pessimistic, but it can be an exaggeration of the present. The people are not interested anymore in reading books, but they prefer to watch movies. The books during these last years have lost a lot of importance, and the tecnologies have been more important for the human beings. I don\`t think that our future is the same as the one in the book, but it can be a warning for everybody who loves the smell of books, touching their pages, holding them. The author I think tried to tell us that we are not going to miss the books until we have lost them."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This books is interesting. It's about a man named Montag who is a fireman but instead of putting out the fire, he starts them by burning the books he finds in other people's houses. In my own opinion I think this book is about reality, because even though we are no burning books a lot of people are losing interest in reading them. Peolpe would rather watch T.V.,play Nintendo,get on the computer and do everything from there than going through a book. So you will probably like to read this book.You will understand the importance of books and you will appreciate them more."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I LOVED this book. For me, it gave a jolt of fear on the possibility of a world like that one, though ours is not too far away. I've read two other books of Bradbury's but I'd have to say this is my favorite. I would recommend it to anyone who has a passion for books and reading, for it caters to them. I would read it just for Beatty's dream about his quoting battle with Montag, but I guess you'll have to read it..."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This has become probably my favorite book. The language that Bradbury uses in this novel is odd but very well used. It is like stream of conciousness, flitting from one thing to the next. It works because that's how thoughts (mine at least) tend to run through the mind. I doubt the future described in this book will ever be fully realized, but mindless generations now being raised, that haven't enough imagination for reading, may lead us in that direction. I love this book, I recommend it to anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Seriously, it is. I could never imagine a world without books. That is like a world without oxygen. Okay maybe not that bad. However, the story line of this book is excellent. It is also fast paced and short. It is the ultimate book on censorship."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is an interesting novel filled with lots of hidden meaning and excellent in depth characters. The story takes place in a futuristic American city where censorship runs wild. Books are banned and firemen no longer put out fires, in this city they start the fires. Burning books is a way to control the population and stop people from having original thoughts of their own. With an overwhelming entertainment industry controlling every aspect of people's lives, the people feel content being ignorant and have a false sense of happiness. Guy Montag is the main character in the story. He is a fireman by trade and burns books to stop people from questioning their surroundings and to \\"keep everybody happy.\\" He never questions his job or his marriage until he meets Clarisse McClellan. She is a young girl of seventeen and is different from the rest of the people. She questions the world and book burning and this is what starts to sway Montag into questioning his world. Soon Montag realizes his wife Mildred Montag is just a hollow shell that does not love him, actually she loves nobody and cares only for a family that only exists on television.With this realization Mantag sets out to change things if not on a large scale maybe just for himself. Meeting professor Faber teaches Montag about the meaning and purpose books. Montag decides to no longer burn books, instead he decides to preserve them. He does this with the help of some hobo's he meets outside the city after fleeing from prosecution for protecting the written word.Clarisse is a character I can definitely relate to. Her outlook on life and the small quirks that make us wise and happy are the things she notices instead of the mass entertainment that envelops us all. By accepting the role of an outcast and continuing her intellectual quest to better the world, she displays her huge will power. With such will power the majority of the people could find peace in whom they are, instead of always conforming.I enjoyed the meaning of this book but found that the author used far too much symbolism. The imagery hid the plot and story line of the book. I thoroughly enjoyed the parts where he rebelled against the system, especially the part in which he recites poetry to the hollow beings on television destroying their happiness by shattering what keeps them happy and content. He used a type of a \\"mirror\\" to show them their terrible faults. After hearing the poem they realized that their actions have been unforgivable and become consumed by guilt and tears. If I could, I would increase the action of the story by making Montag act in defiance of the system in more places in the book. This would give his actions a sense of great accomplishment instead of just another try at what had been tried and failed so many times.This is a good book to teach the value and wealth of knowledge contained in books and arts. Without literature and the arts we can't record the feeling or motives of the present and the future cannot benefit from the great trials and tribulations that the human spirit endures every second of every day."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I originally picked up Farenheit 451 for a summer reading book but in being touched deeply by this book and the realization that the book wasn't on my summer reading list I realized it was much more than just a quick read. I love reading but this book really made me think about how some of my friends despise reading. Now, it doesn't seem like much, but in Guy Montag's society, the main character, reading and just owning books was a crime. I started thinking about how much knowledge can be attained through books, and this book made me think about what books offer. That is because this book offers so much to the reader. The only thing I didn't like about this book was that it had no closing to the story. I personally like closings but some people like to imagine the end and it always works for teachers to have a finish the book kind of project. But anyway, this is a truly great book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury writes in 1951 of a future America that is somewhat of a caricature of present day America, where shallowness prevails. In this America book reading is both unpopular and forbidden - and a house containing books is burnt down.Bradbury writes out of love for knowledge and human potential, and out of total disdain for shallowness and mediocracy. Writing in 1951, his ideas leave out the important achievements of non-White civilizations, but this does not take away from the power of his message.I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and found it very stimulating. The language is not merely used to convey ideas ot events - it has a life and beauty of its own.I recommend it to anyone who loves to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The novel Fahrenheit 451 is a great Sci-Fi written by Ray Bradbury .that is about censorship. It is revolves around a man named guy Montag he is a firemen. In that time books are illegal they are against the law to own book and more so to read them. Firemen don't stop fires they start them by burning the books that people have illegally. Liked doing his job until one day a women killed her self for the books she owned. After that Montag plays seesaw from being a fireman or a rebel reading books.Fahrenheit 451 is one of the greatest sci-fi novels I read so far. Ray Bradbury did excellent in this book. His writing is so good that you can see what he is thinking about the pitcher is so vivid that it is like watching a real movie. He also had a great scene of the future he explained every thing well he didn't leave you guessing how the stuff worked. He is truly the greatest book that he is written .The best part of the book is how much information he gives about his character. You can image how Montag would be if he was real.An excellent part of the book is the ending it lives you guessing what is going to happen to him. I think that the author did this so the reader makes the ending whatever you wanted to be. Over the entire book are five stars. This is the best science fiction book I ever read.Fahrenheit is great for the kids that say that books never have anything good in them. It is also good for science fiction readers, it is a great sci-fi book. This is also good for people that believe that the government is controlling us. Or the people that don't like censorship."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is one of my favorite books. It's a great tale about utopia, censorship, and decline of our collective culture into a mass of visual goo. It's Bradbury at his best. He kind of cheats a little with the ending, but the overall quality and message of the book makes it one of the finest pieces of literature out there."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The novel Fahrenheit 451 tells us about a time in the future in which books are illegal to read or posses, and firemen aren't employed to save houses (because they are virtually fire resistant), but to burn books. Guy Montag, a fireman, and the story's main character, enjoys the destruction and burning of the books and he is constantly soaked in the smell of kerosene. Montag had a weird feeling about things, but wasn't quite sure what it was. He was like all the other people, in that he would just keep going ahead to where he was going, not looking at what he was walking past or paying much attention to things. Except one night he stopped and met a girl who told him of the past where people were allowed to think, to read, and to have original ideas for themselves, and the ability to write them down and share them with others.As the story goes on, it deals with his drug-abusing wife and her weird friends. Also there are crews of people that are out to save people that try to committee suicide due to the high suicide rate. The reader discovers the ways that the society works, about how people are not unique, not knowing their own neighbors, and how the television thinks for everyone so that they don't have to.This book shows a future where it is nearly impossible to be a freethinking individual. Ray Bradbury's descriptive writing makes the story easy to read and hard to put down. The story thickens, twists, and curves with every page as Montag is forced to go on the run from a mechanical hound whose only mission is to destroy Montag. It is a book that everyone should try to read. It really makes the reader think about how our future may turn out like this someday."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"this was the first bradbury that i have tackled, so i am not entirely sure if bradbury's style is always so greyfor this book however, the splashing about in the language was a good thing, and fit the material.rather scary how closely the world here resmebles our own, with the mass of the public simply too enveloped in their own ignorance, and happy about it.fairly quick read, and worthwhile."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book was weird, but it had good points to it.

Most of the literiture that I've come across has had ideas that come from other books, but Bradury's idea was clearly original, especially if this was written in the 50's. The language is of the kind Shakespeare couldn't think of. I don't think that even George Lucas could think up such a world. Within the first three sentences I was entranced. The suspense was of the kind that kept me awake, even at 3 A.M., and reading by flashlight. This book will help society be more careful about the future. Bradbury's wonderful creation deserves no less than 5 stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This novel intricately portrayed what Guy was experiencing, if you read this book in one sitting and allow yourself to absorb what is happening, you can feel the choas and indecision that ravages Montag's pyche.

But I had to read Fahrenheit 451 for a class and actually enjoyed it.

I hope not, though, Amazon would lose even more money than they are now."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"F. 451 was an excellent book beacuse it was above and beyond beyond all other books. The world it portrayed was fantastic, as well as horrific, in it's implimentation. The book gives you a view of human nature: good, bad, and lazy. It also shows how these attributtes can alter the way we live. Among the many subtle meanings in F.451 is they strving for happiness, not pleasure. Montag, the main character, strives for happiness-- a sense of pride in learining and accomplishment-- while his wife easily recieves passive pleasure by watching the electronic 'walls' F.451 is a thought provoking book you will never forget."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I give Fahrenheit 451 41/2 stars because the ook keeps the reader on edge.

Ray Bradbury\`s classis story is a sure bet for good reading.I deducted 1 star because the book was sometimes hard to follow but don\`t let that deter you from reading it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's novel of censorship in a post-war future is a novel of many contrasts. It is about a future with no books or free thoughts and how humanity has been outstripped by our technology. The books plot and teachings are very important now since our technologies and inventions are being created and upgraded at amazing speeds. The book is also very well-written, with great comparisons and a defining language. The ending, however, is unfulfilling, especially after the incredible suspense the book builds up. On the other hand, a person with other tastes might view this book as a waste of time and money. This is not a book for everyone and the plot and writing might seem just as atrocious as it is excellent to almost anybody. Though by no means a must-read, this book is a source of insight on our ever changing world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I simply love this book. Let me tell you the story between me and te book. I had yo read it as part of my finnish classes and compare it to the Hitchiker's guide to the galaxy by Douglas Adams. not an easy job. anyway, i went to get the book from library on my lunch break and started reading it on my fyscis class (not recommeded to do that). I had finished the book in the same night. It was just so facinating, iteresting, so well written and it made me really think. I simply loved that book and amazingly you can say that it has something common with the guide, they both question the truth we have learned to keep as the thruths. And forgive me all my typos."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have not read the book, but I am doing a report on it in my english class. I am sure it would be a good book if I were ever to read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I really liked the way Montag challenged his own beliefs during the novel. It seemed like the chief firefighter, Beatty could have been in the same position, but he fell victim to society either by choice or because he thought it would benefit society. These people didn't know the difference between a &quot;normal&quot; society and a totalitarian society. So to us, the reader, he looked like the hero, but he looked like an antagonist in the society he was living. If we turn the tables around and put Montag into our present day society, and he challenged our present-day society, he would look like the opponent, or the radical right-winged activist. I know I don't agree with those kinds of people, so I probably would not have agreed with Montag if I were in that society because that is the safe way out. That is a safe way of thinking. I think Bradbury is trying to say that most of us take the safe way out when it comes to activism. I'm sure if I acted as Montag did in opposite in this present day and age, I would be looked down upon too. At the end, Montag and his friends try to make a difference in society no matter how hard the path in front of them would be. Maybe Bradbury is making the point that we should make a difference in our own society by taking an activist standpoint in the media, and standing for our beliefs, no matter how radical they might be. Because without that voice of difference, there would not be an active and working society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As a high school junior, I was recently made to read Farenheit 451. Unlike the typical high school student, reading is one of my most cherished activities. Thus I was pleased to find that we would be reading 'heavy' novels and were expected to do some thinking beyond the usual confines of teen thought. I was shocked at the way most of my peers responded to the novel and the assignment itself. Most hated the novel and were disgruntled to find that we were (gasp) supposed to think? The very idea! It was actually quite ironic to find that the very ideas of lax thought and caring that Mr. Bradbury was trying to convey were precisely what I found in my classmates. It was also a disturbing discovery for me to make. Farenheit 451 was an excellent novel although I believe it was written far in advance of its time. Had it been published just recently, perhaps more people would understand the troubles it predicts, which are indeed staring us in the face. The most interesting part of the novel is that it came in a time when the Guy Montags of the world were frowned upon, as were individualism and self-expression. The struggles which Guy faces are a perfect example of today's struggles. There are some of us in the world who refuse to conform and think exactly like the government wants or society decrees. It makes one truly think about how close we have come to slipping into Guy's society. Look at Hitler and WW II. Look at genetic engineering and euthansia. Mr. Bradbury's novel gives a chilling and striking depeiction of what the world would be like without a few individualists. I recommend this novel to anyone who likes Kate Chopin or Ross Perot."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I first started reading this book, I realized it was just another quirky scifi book, that would end up with somebody killing somebody, and that would be the end.

This book completely changed my opinion about the contrast between literature and entertainment, censorship, and society in general."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is one of the best books I have ever read. For all of the people who thought it was stupid, what Bradbury is talking about has already happened to you! At 14, I do not find this book at all confusing, unless to you confusing means that it actually makes you think (The horrors!!). It made me realize how lucky we are to be free to read whatever we want to read and think whatever we want to think. It inspired me to work to change things so that what Montags society has come to will never, EVER have to happen to us. I can not imagine a world where great classics like this book could not be read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A future in which books are burnt, teenagers are violent, and free thinking has been destroyed. The few free thinkers that are left are killed, and yet, one man saves a book and reads it, making him a wanted criminal. Guy Montag, the hero, is this man, the rebel, the fireman whose job it is to burn books. This is a classic about censorship, that is now more important than before. Be sure to read this one, along with Orwell's 1984, and you'll get a clear view on what the future can be. And remember, at 451 degrees Fahrenheit is the temperature at which books burn."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"it is more like poetry than normal novel;first time would be hard to get through (my friends told me that)but it's worth of that!!!!and more you read more you like it;it'll get better every time you read it, maybe you'll find more views too...you'd have this in your own &quot;homelibrary&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I recently read Bradbury's work &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; for a book report in a class. I am a junior in high school and quite frankly hate to read. It's very difficult for me to get interested in a book. This book, however, caught my attention. Maybe I just like books about the future. It's an entertaining novel discussing the struggle between Conformity and Individuality. Montag acts just as his society intends him to until he meets some very important people that show him a more interesting and exciting life filled with knowledge. Of course, his brainwashed wife, Millie, continues to acts as one of the androids that society has made her to be. This is a very important work about censorship and the dull lives that it would inflict on us if we lost our freedom of speech, our freedom of the press, and even the freedom to the written word."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This was a great book especially the ending of it.

A dystopian novel, Ray Bradburyhas excelled in painting a scene where books are burned ona daily basis, and people haven't a care in the world, contentwith spending their time listening to media devices to learn the barefacts of...well, anything. This book really makes one reflect onpresent day youth losing interest in literature, and whatpossibilities that may bring for the future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book, venerable in literature, gives tidings of a possible future where man destroys anything volatile to human ego or ideal.

I must say, that it was amazing. My teacher had pressured me to read it, saying I needed to read something beyond the hum drum of my regular readings to challenge myself.

A must read for anyone. With this book, also look into The Martian Chronicles.Also, RIP Bradbury, the world lost one of its best science fiction writers."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I would recommened this book for anyone ages 13 and up. It's a hard read, but has a strong theme and interesting characters. I enjoyed the whole book until the ending. I didn't like the ending because it was a little bit confusing and sad.

Instead of giving you a synopsis of the book as many other readers have done, I found it interesting how the entire premise of book banning has even resurfaced in recent years. The entire Harry Potter series has received significant press as to whether the books are appropriate for younger readers. Bradbury's observations are not very far off those seen today."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was a very good book. The detail was very good. You could just picture the story. My favorite thing about the book was that you had to infer what happened to Clarisse. Was she killed, OR did she go to the railroad. I really think that the author Ray Bradbury is a great author because he puts the best similes in the the right places. For one example of a good simile is on page 3 of the book , \\"With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python sitting its venomous kerosene upon the world...\\" This talks about the nozzle that Montag uses to light the fires that burns the books. This book is a good book and I would recomend this book to anyone who wants to read it. It is filled with everything you could ask for in a book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman who job it is to start fires instead of stoping the. In this backwards world of his he burns books and the houses that they are hidden in. In this future world reading a book is against the law because it gives peoples ideas. Guy never qustioned his job until he actually thinks what it would be like to read a book.....I never never really thought what our world would be like with no books, but now that I think about it I can't believe how monotonous and boring it would be. Now that I think about it I am glad I dont live in a world like Guy Montag's.This book has become on of my favorites and I highly recomend you read it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Imagine a future where books are illegal, and the purpose of firemen isn't to put out fires, but to start them. The main character is one such fireman, his job to burn books(from where the book gets it's title---fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which paper burns), and doesn't think twice about it. But gradually, he meets people he finds perplexing, a girl who talks about rain tasting like wine, a woman who stays with her books until she is burned alive. His life is transformed when he hides a book, and opens it...Very engaging, but at times, so deep it makes your head spin."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is very intriguing both in what its theme is and also in how much the main character changes throughout the course of the story. It has great discriptions even if they are abstract and also a great development of characters within an action plot. I would have to say that my favorite character in the entire book was Clarisse. She seemed so soft, so fresh, so new, and so likeable, especially compared with some of the other characters in the book. She was so full of life and the joys she could find in it that I really enjoyed her character and I was very sad when she dies. This book always kept me interested with its implications and its deep meanings and because of that it always kept me thinking. I would have to stop for a few minutes to think about what I had just read but that is a good thing and it made me feel like I became more familiar with the book becuase of it. Overall I think that it is a very well written book in every aspect. The main character though not very likeable in the beginning becomes someone you can and want to cheer for as the book progresses. I really enjoyed reading this book and am glad that I did pick this book to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I keep coming back to science fiction written in the 50's and 60's. This novel is a perfect example of why I do this.I've read this a few times now, and it's always a pleasure to do so. It may not be the best written, but since it was one of Bradbury's first novels, I'm prepared to be tolerant of the writing style.The ideas presented here are still fresh and relevant today, and most certainly set the ground work for many of those which followed. It's influence can be seen in King's 'Running Man'(the original Bachman book, not the screenplay), and Ira Levin's 'This Perfect Day'.The central theme of the state imposing what the masses may/may not have access to, and that above all &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot;, can be seen in today's society to some extent.This is undoubtedly a single-sitting novel. Whenever I pick it up to read it, I find that it's easier to read to the end than attempt to put it down and come back to it later when I'm half way through. It is easy to read, and the story flows beautifully from beginning to end. A perfect book for a wet sunday afternoon."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In the book Fahrenheit 451 the main character is a fireman named Guy Montag. Guy is a fireman that burns books and sets houses on fire instead of the normal fireman that puts out the flames. During the course of the book Montag goes through many different phases. The most important phase is where he starts wondering about books. Since all his life he has been taught that books are bad and only to burn them, he is curious what books are about. During the time that he is going through his mysterious phases he meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens her eyes to the emptiness of his life. Montag met this girl one night when he was taking a walk at about midnight. Montag also meets a very important character named Faber. Faber is an old English professor that likes books and knows a lot about them. Over the story Montag has Faber set him up with a retired publisher, to help publish books. At the time that Montag is trying to publish books the fireman are chasing him.Guy Montag is a fireman who suddenly realizes the emptiness of his life and starts to search for meaning in the books he is supposed to be burning. He quickly forms unusually strong bonds with anyone who seems to have true friendship with him. His biggest regret in life is not having a better relationship with his wife. And because he didn't have a very good relationship with his wife that is why she turned him in to the fireman and got there house burned.The way that Ray Bradbury makes this book seem is incredible. He has a special talent that lets him really involve and capture the reader's attention. while I read this book I felt as if I was a silent observer that stood next to Guy Montag every where he went. I loved this book, and would definitely recommend this book to anybody who loves a great adventure and thrill."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":".... this is definitively one of the most philisophically and emotionally charged short novels I have ever read. Bradbury's paints a perfect picture of a future in which we are consumed by mass media. Yet more now than ever it rings true with our consuming obsession with TV and Internet (not that I'm a luddite, but I am constantly torn between the path we're careening off of, and exciting future ahead of us), which is probably one of the most terrifying aspects of the book. The only thing I could possibly think about complaining about is Bradbury's writing style; it's not confusing, but it definitely keeps you on your toes, and can be very unforgiving if you're full attention isn't devoted to it; nonetheless I found myself re-reading some parts, not to better comprehend it but rather to simply admire the deep and insightful observations and allegories Bradbury has created. My father and my step-dad both read this when they were in high school, and I get the impression it's either hit-or-miss, because they are split on whether it was confusing and boring, or if it was absolutely brilliant. I know I dissed Ray's writing style, and it is very spartan and may not suit some, but I also found it had a poetic flowing quality to it (not Dante or anything, but it is still very beautiful). My view is htat it is unquestionably a great work of philosophy, a far cut above most Grishams or novel you pick up ...; so put down that copy of Republic for a moment, and take a little time to read this masterpiece of a novella."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I thought this book was ok. The book is about a firefighter who has to make a decision that could possibly change his life. The firemen have to burn all the books because it is illegal to read. It's interesting that in the future books would actually be banned from reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I've just finished reading this book and although the premise behind it is intriguing, the books feels unfinished and rushed...Also, Bradbury's elegant and descriptive style of writing feels like a shroud that covers the rather poor character development and lack of interesting characters. This book also needs a large section (that should basically precede the book as it stands now) dedicated towards describing the overall setting and government climate in order to set the proper mood.....Therefore I cannot recommend this title."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Now, don't get me wrong: I thought 'Fahrenheit 451' was a pretty good book, but I was very unimpressed by the number of mistakes found in the 165 pages. The name Montag was spelled wrong on several occasions, there are words oftentimes missing from dialogue--or the wrong ones all together--and quotes either missing or in the wrong places, making it oftentimes confusing to read. Editing was either skipped altogether or done by a blind man...one of the two.Overall, though, 'Fahrenheit 451' is an average book. I did not feel connected with any of the characters, and could've cared less what happened to Montag. Clarisse disappeared too early without much reason as to why--I assumed her being hit by a car was false, but apparently not--and the future looks bland to me. Luckily, though, I won't be around to see it.(Also, the &quot;war&quot; seemed tacked on without any real reason as to its existence in the story, save for maybe wiping out the human race so we could start over.)Not a great book. I'm hoping Bradbury has written by stories than this apparent &quot;classic&quot;."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is boring. Unless you are interested in science fiction or Ray Bradbury's work you probably wont like it. This book takes place in the future in a world where all books are banned. People spend a lot of time watching television. Montag, the main character is a firefighter who burns books. The story of the book is ok but it gets boring and there is no excitement. The book is easy to read and there isn't any very hard vocabulary. Don't read this book if you are in fourth grade or younger because it might be to hard to read, just stick to the movie if you are interested in this topic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"-I saw the way things were going, a long time back.

Those deeply passionate about reading and literature will be greatly disturbed (and even devastated) by the bleak world Bradbury depicts in this novel, a world in which books are illegal and burned.I loved that this book gives us pause to think about what books mean to each of us and what their role and purpose is in society and to humanity as a whole. A small tome, it is rife with provocative and serious questions that could lead to many lively discussions. There's a lot of great symbolism running throughout, and is very meaty intellectually speaking.However, there were a few things about the novel that were somewhat regretable, in my opinion. First, the book felt very dated to me; without knowing when exactly it had been published, I was able to identify the decade based on the prose. Also, I generally did not respond to Bradbury's writing, which I found to be folksy and inelegant. I do not think that this book is considered a classic because of the magnificance of the author's writing, that's for sure!Ultimately, this is an important book that everyone ought to read and discuss. It will probably have the greatest impact if you read it as a teen, but if you missed out on it during your high school years, as I did, better to read it late than never. It's a shame about the actual writing, but the issues it examines transcend the weak prose."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A wonderful read. A commentary borne from the risidual fears from WWII. Belongs in the same category of Orwell's 1984. I like to write short reviews that get to the point, and not ramble on. Read it!

They mentioned how the title was taken from this book, and it mentioned how this book is about how in the future, firemen burn houses instead of put out fires. It mentioned about this fireman, Guy Montag, who meets a girl but then she vanishes. And in this day of age, their tv parlour, is his wife's family. I was pretty interested in the book and bought it soon after.A week after, and ive completed the short novel based on three short stories. I really liked it a lot, and there are lots of things which, even though this was written in 1953, that are similar to whats going on these days. There was one paragraph, where Montag says about America attacking countries for no reason. Now what does that remind you of? The whole book is Montag journey in discovering what books really are, how much of an inpact they have on people, and the truth.Overall, i would recommend this book. Its a very deep book, that makes you think about whats going on these days."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"1984 and Fahrenheit 451 are 2 books I've been wanting to read for a long time. The ideas behind them certainly interest me, and I've heard them hailed many times as masterpieces. I'm currently reading 1984 right now, and I can tell you right from the beginning that it's a better choice.That isn't to say, of course, that Fahrenheit 451 is a bad book. Far from it, the characters are, for the most part, well developed, and the idea behind the book is an interesting one. Ray Bradbury's idea of a censored future where war is a constant, yet supressed, issue is interesting, yet borrows heavily from 1984.My two major problems with the book, though, are the character interactions and the ending.Perhaps it's just Ray Bradbury's way of character development, but by the way the characters talk you would think they were all deeply mentally disturbed. They talk for pages and pages, constantly changing the subjects on a whim. It gives you the idea of a future where people never dwell too long on anything, but it also makes the book uninteresting. Oftentimes you can't tell the distinction between a character's ramblings in their own mind and a character's actions. I had to double-take a couple times just to make sure something really happened and the character wasn't just thinking about it.My second problem is the ending. It almost seems like Bradbury ran out of steam and couldn't think of anything else to put in the book, so he decided to nuke the city. Yes, it was a suprising ending and an interesting way to conclude the book, but it seemed like a rushed afterthought. Bradbury could have done so much with the characters after Montag left the city, but he decided to end it right there.If you're interested in this kind of book, I'd suggest it. It kept me captivated at times, even if in the end it was less than what it was made out to me. If you have to choose between 1984 and 451, go for 1984. If you can pick up both, do so."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I first read this book in my L.A. class at school. This book has many meanings tied into it.

The author of this book was brillant to make up a world like this. The main character Montag was great I could realt to him and put myself in his shoes that's what I like so much about this book. If I didn't read this book in class I probably would never read it.Hi Ms. O!!!!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a science fiction book that is a very different type of book, and at sometimes confusing. No matter when you read it in you are able to imagine the future. The plot was complex and was suspenseful. And the characters in the book were not the same as some of the other characters you may have read about in other books. Montag the main character in the story was a fireman and his job was to make fire and burn books and not put fires out. Most of the people in the book seemed the same and rather dull, but there was one character that was different from all of the rest. Clarisse was a seventeen year old girl who was not as dull and flat as some of the other characters that you would read about. She would always be thinking about things others thought were foolish and strange. And when Montag meets her he begins to change. Books in this story was a danger to their society and mad people \\"unhappy\\" as the government would say. The style of the book was confusing and difficult, and it was also easy at other times. Parts of the vocabulary was difficult but it helped the story. The sentences described a lot and helped to create images of the near future. I would recommend this book to all science fiction lovers and also people who like to use their imaginations. This is because when you read the story it is very scientific and hard. If you don't like to read these types of books I would not recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 is an exiting book filled with suspense, you are always waiting to read what happens next. You can hardly put it down! Though it is not the style of book that I normally read, I liked it a lot, enough to read others like it. This was a good book, yet the vocabulary was lacking, and I have preferred other science fiction books, like Enders Game. I would definitely suggest this book to a wide variety of readers, including those who do not read science fiction books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 is a mediocre quality book. It is rather easy to read (7th grade level) and is also easy to follow. The writing style is different because the culture is very different from anywhere today. The plot is also different due to books are banned in this world. This book is recommended to people who dislike books because this book shows the world without them, so those people may reconsider their opinions."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Being in 7th grade I found this story to be a little confusing. The story took place in the future, when firemen start fires and not put them out. The plot involves a fireman named Montag who begins to question the way of society. At some points the plot got very confusing because the book would jump from scene to scene and from concept to concept. Ray Bradbury used many advanced words and metaphors and these contributed to the story getting confusing. Overall I enjoyed the book, and I would recommend this book to anyone after 8th grade because of confusion in the plot."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I just finished Fahrenheit 451 and feel like I did when someone gave me a shareware version of a video game. I learned the moves, became someone addicted, cleared the third level and found that I needed a code to get the rest of the game. Only Ray didn't give away the code to 451!This is clearly a fantastic story, horribly well written. I have wish listed several more of his books for future reading. Unfortunately 451 is long enough that you suspend some of the caveats used when reading short stories. With a book this long, I want developed characters to be resolved. Several characters just go away, which left me lacking at the end. Sometimes this is intended, and strong. In this case, it seemed thoughtless and abrubt.Don't miss the afterword and coda at the end. Very nice additions."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It truly is. Ray Bradbury's masturfully told story of censorship in the future show us what we may become: A civilization of mindless people who are so bent on being PC and &quot;happy&quot; that they end up burning all books. While that is a rough description, I don't wish to give too much away. Bradbury's characters all act realistically (something im a stickler for) and I love the way he writes, using metaphors constantly he achieves an amazing level of description while still leaving some things for the reader to figure out. People have told me that the beginning is confusing; while I don't feel that is true, if you do kepp reading because the last 100 pages (out of only around 200) will rivet your eyes to the pages. Personally, I love Ray Bradbury and feel that this is his greatest work, or one of them. But you don't have to like Bradbury to like this novel; if you want a great book that will truly make you think, and just a great read, by all means pick this one up. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is one of the finest books I have ever read, and certainly high in my ranking of Bradbury's novels. Bradbury paints a picture, in his very colorful way, of a completely governmentally-controlled society in which books are outlawed and television reigns over all. Guy Montag, a fireman (whose job description now involves burning illegal books), finds himself stuck in this mixed-up world, and eventually make a decision between what he knows and what he believes in, illustrating Bradbury's almost universal theme of conflict versus change. This novel is very applicable in today's society, even though it was written nearly fifty years ago, dealing with topics that are still active in the present. Bradbury provides a moral of sorts within this novel which conveys many of his deep-set beliefs, such disdain for television, hatred for censorship, and Bradbury's undeterrable love for books and the printed word. Very enlightening, reading this book will definitely cause one to think twice about many of today's common practices. A very thought-provoking and well-written novel; this book should be read by any fan of science fiction, if not everyone!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Could we end up like this in our future? What would the world be like without books?? This story gives us some insight into what it might be like... and it's pretty scary. It is definitely food for thought regarding censorship.The book paints a dim and scary picture of a future society where all books have been banned. Firemen no longer fight fires, the set them to destroy houses found to have books. With the removal of books, people have turned their attentions to TV and as a result the general population is unable to think for themselves and their minds have turned to mush. The main character begins to challenge these concepts of censorship after meeting a young teen-ager who stirs his curiousity. The more he thinks about and challenges the 'norms' of society his world is turned upside down.This book really makes you think about censorship and where it can lead. The book is very relevant to the debate going on about censoring today's music (as well as books, tv and movies). You can't put limits on creativity and self expression without limiting the society as a whole."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The amazing thing about this book, is that it was written so long ago, yet it predicted many technological things that have happened recently. What makes it ironic is, is that the plot is basically about book burning, and banning and the absurdity of it all. YET it is a banned book itself. Could it have predicted this? Maybe. But, basically, this book has a great story and plot, on whatever level you read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Amazingly, I just read this book for the first time, although I've heard about it for years. While reading, I found myself constantly rechecking the copyright page to verify that Ray Bradbury did indeed write this book in 1953, almost 50 years ago. Back then he somehow knew what was coming; so much of what he writes in the book is actually happening to us today. We want things faster and faster, and fewer and fewer people are reading. I often talk with my students about reading; many say they just don't have the time, while others would rather see the movie. Bradbury even predicted the increase in violence in our schools.While reading the book, I shared the story with my ten-year-old. He was intrigued with the story of Guy Montag, the renegade fireman. So intrigued that he is going to have his literature circle at school read the book. I think this book should be required reading for everyone. There is so much we can learn from it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Having read '1984' and 'Brave New World', I was expecting this novel to be of the same quality, especially as it features on umpteen Books You Should Read lists.It's moderately interesting, but lack of character development means you don't really care what happens to Guy Montag as he breaks away from authority. Will the Mechanical Hound get him? Or not? Whatever...And as the far-fetched ending occurs - a bomb that flattens the city but appears to leave the free-thinking hobos, just a few miles away, untouched, I found myself curiously unmoved.Despite its feeling at times like a book written for a teen audience, Bradbury DOES give us something to think about. Although inspired by the 1950s world of McCarthyism and restriction of books, it has become relevant in a new way to 21st century readers: our society too is in danger of 'dumbing down' with endless entertainment and meaningless chat (witness everyone texting or tuned in to an IPod as they walk along, paying no attention to the world around them); angry young people kill for kicks just like Mildred Montag:'I always like to drive fast when I feel that way...It's fun out in the country. You hit rabbits, sometimes you hit dogs.'Interesting message but not a great book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's last published book is a great thought provoking fantasy. What if we lived in a world where books were considered dangerous contraband and firemen weren't hired to put out but to start fires? We're already starting to experience news in shorter segments and everything's being reduced to soundbites. Will our attention span start to deteriorate to the extent that it is normal to only be able to focus for a few short minutes?Guy Montag is one such fireman whose wife subconsciously tries to commit suicide, and who after meeting a young neighbor, Clarisse, starts to think and question the world in which he lives. When he starts to steal and hide books in the walls of his house, he meets an old professor with whom he tries to formulate a plan to change the ruling regime who instill the fear of books among the population. But someone knows about his secret and soon Guy is on the run as a fugitive."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This was a great book for intermediary readers. Purchased for daughters class read. She enjoyed it. Would recommend it to anyone ."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The world is ruled by a warring totalitarian regime that outlaws reading and the spreading of knowledge, but the sad thing is that people stopped growing and learning on their own long before.Guy Montag is a firefighter who is hired to burn books, but one day, after seeing how the government deals with free thinking people, he just can't do it anymore.Many of the professorial drifters in the Fahrenheit 451 world are like the folks of today who cherish free thought and expression and reading, they are alone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This novel still has, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest opening sentences and paragraphs in print. Ray Bradbury'sFahrenheit 451: A Novelis the tale of a future where books are deemed to be too dangerous for public utilization, and therefore illegal. In this future world, firemen no longer extinguish flames, but rather they douse piles of parchment and binding in kerosene before setting them ablaze, effectively exterminating not only the physical objects themselves, but also the potentially subversive ideas contained therein. Published in 1953, but as fresh today as it has ever been, it follows the plight of fireman Montag as he discovers the power of the words he has been unquestioningly eradicating. Armed with that knowledge, he gets drawn into a resistance movement.Half a century before they became realities, this visionary work predicted the rise and widespread deployment of security cameras, flat-screen televisions that cover a whole wall, and interactive reality TV. Bradbury's imagination and heart were boundless and on display nowhere more than inFahrenheit 451: A Novel- his best-known and best work. Let it be a primer for a further exploration of this prolific writer's work."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I picked up this book because I was just in need of something to read. Once I began, I could not put it down! Farenheit 451 is set in a not so far away distopian future where media rules and books are illegal. In this place, firemen start fires on books rather than put fires out. Guy Montag is fireman who begins to see the truth in books. When this is discovered though, he has to run for his life. This is a great book for pretty much everyone, but there is aare heavy phycological thoughs throughout the whole book, and sparce mild language. Overall, if you want a great book to read, choode this!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this out loud with my high school student. It was her assigned summer reading. I remembered reading this a long time ago or watching the movie. One remarkable thing about the book is how Bradbury describes the future where we are locked in houses and tied to a community of media devices. Because it was written at the dawn of television, I find it facinating that Bradbury would predict a world so similar to life now.The language in the book is very dynamic. It is a great book to read out loud. There is wonderful tension in the plot as the fireman turned rebel tries to escape the nazi-like government.This is the book about book burning. I was in Split, Croatia last summer and our guide pointed out where the Nazis burned the books in the town square. It sent shivers up my spine. You will feel that when you read this book, a book that cautions us about totalitarianism and social isolation."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury is my favorite sci fi author. The book is full of poetic imagery, and thoughtful commentary of the direction he saw society heading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is important because the readers need to know what happens when the government seizes upon cultural rot to take control of all information in a society. That Montag has no understanding of what is happening around him, but that he becomes curious is the catalyst for the events that happen.Even his own wife and loved ones turn on him, when the government decided to withhold its television based nightmare. Socially, I think this novel is one that all people can grasp today. What would happen today if the NFL or Baseball or College Football were interrupted? That is why presidents, and not just Obama, use those things as stages for their political events.Why is the government so intent on perpetuating things like political correctness in our society? That is because if you control the information, you control the people. If there are only a few actually curious people, then the government can marginalize them and destroy them. A whole society of curious people is not what the power brokers want. They don't want to answer questions, and they sure don't want people to insist on personal freedom as a point of personal identity.Fahrenheit 451 deals with all these. From the mysterious death of Clarisse McKenzie, to Montag's ironic job. And the punishment in the hyper-managed society is reserved for those who want to seek out knowledge. The metaphor put forward by Faber is also salient to our current time, by the time we meet him we find that the class of intellectuals will be bullied out of existence. Our constitutional republic cannot be saved by looking to the educated professors to save us, as they are all cowards. It is the people, the populace at large who needs to be educated. And remember, the country will keep itself ignorant because that is what the government class wants. They know, you don't need to. \\"Trust Us.\\" is what they will say. It should make us recoil. The most dangerous words in the world: \\"I'm from the government and I'm here to help.\\" They never do. And the people still sit by and let them destroy our nation.We need to teach this novel to all children. They need to know that their freedom depends not on the guarantee by the government but on their own initiative and their complete skepticism every time a government agent tells them they will take care of it. That includes teachers and school administrators. How far down the road to being Mildreds are we? I'd say farther than anyone would like to think."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I bought this book after Ray Bradbury died because the obituaries said that this was his best work. I did not know what to expect.The book is about a future in which [almost] everyone live vicariously through the lives of others delivered via technology. The system prohibits independent thinking or feeling and actually used the fire department to burn up anyone that is a 'problem'.As I see more people (myself included) using their cell phones, social media, and on-line entertainment, I see our society moving in this direction. It is amazing to me that Bradbury created this dystopian vision many years in advance of the current technology that almost makes it possible today."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to wait until age 38 but it was worth the wait. It touches on some issues that are quite relevant today - espeically the state of our educational system.It was a very quick read, but thoroughly entertaining. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Really, the story itself ends on page 165. This is a fascinating book, but it left me wanting more. You probably already know that the book is about censorship and book burning in the future, but you also see a little of the political correctness and revisionist history that led up to this future. There is not much more told about how this society evolved.It seems pretty far-fetched, but you can also see some similarities to today... fast, loud, shallow \\"reality\\" TV; hints that the rest of the world despises an arrogant, prosperous U.S.A; and Americans that are too distracted to pay much attention to a war they know little about...Another odd thing is that nobody is WRITING. The firemen are still tracking down stashes of old books, but there is no mention of anyone being caught writing anything new. With all the talk of how important books are, you would think some rebellious soul would want to create something new. On the other hand, characters who also happen to be writers can be such a clich&eacute;. Bradbury managed to write a book about books, and not include a single writer among the characters."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"For the past few years, I've been reading a lot of \\"classics\\" (everything from ancient epics/mythologies/Arthurian legend/Matter of France to Chaucer/Shakespeare to Kant/Hegel/Kierkegaard to the 19th-Century Russian novels to Borges, Joyce, Woolf, Kundera, etc.), so I approached this work from a very literary perspective and with a reasonably solid foundation in literature. That being said, I am not entirely sure why this is considered a modern \\"masterpiece.\\" The concept is okay despite being derivative of earlier novels (of which, as has been said elsewhere, \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"1984\\" are prime examples, though I think he owes a fair amount to Kafka as well (and, given the relatively prevalent fear of totalitarianism/tyranny throughout history, probably many others as well)), but the execution is unexceptional to say--er, type--the least.I find the writing to be sophomoric and unpredictable: sometimes flowery metaphors or analogies are used without real purpose, and there are several unimpressive \\"paradoxes\\" (x is on fire yet x is also cold, y is living but y is also dead, etc.) producing the illusion of depth. What makes such rhetorical language so jarring, however, is that it is almost randomly thrown into an otherwise concise and straightforward narrative, as if Bradbury went back and tried \\"spicing up\\" his writing by thoughtlessly peppering it with unnecessary metaphors. (For example: early on, there is a paragraph discussing Mildred's eyes as \\"moonstones,\\" a poetical paragraph that was initially (for me) utterly confusing because it was totally unexpected and, considering the text within which it is couched, unfitting.) I can respect various registers and don't suscribe to New Criticism's imperative for self-contained organic harmony--I (eventually) loved \\"Ulysses,\\" which is neither consistent nor self-contained--but Bradbury's changes of style accomplish nothing but confusion, distraction, and perhaps an occasional \\"how beautiful!\\" from readers admiring a pretty but misplaced sentence.While the characters aren't developed with any depth, I can respect this decision: the protagonist becomes an \\"everyman,\\" the characters become symbols, the plot can unfold more rapidly, etc. Nonetheless, Bradbury is very heavy-handed with his symbolism and messages (even the ironic reversal of firefighters' duties is anything but subtle) and, despite the \\"think for yourself\\" message, it is almost as if Bradbury is a prophetic preacher telling you what to think. Thus, the novel lacks the nuanced depth of many great works of fiction. Likewise, the plot itself is presented sloppily and often seems contrived: a man who loves to watch books burn suddenly changes his entire outlook because of a few conversations with a teenager? (If the \\"loving to watch books burn\\" were written in free indirect discourse, then fine; Guy has hidden books in his house, slightly unsettled, but still *thinks* he likes burning books. But the narrative appears unilaterally third person limited.) Books must be burned, but there is no mention of paintings, movies, musical pieces, and other art/media, so what happened to those? How, exactly, did culture go from minorities/over-commodification/instant gratification to \\"we must burn every bloody book, dammit!\\"? Moreover, the dialogue is not believable--it feels unnaturally fast, especially Guy's interactions with Faber--and it seems artificial, tailored to further the plot even at the expense of conversational logic.While not always disappointing, overall the writing gave me the impression that it was written by a smart and overeager high-schooler, not a literary master. The book has its audience, but those expecting/hoping to find a modern literary \\"masterpiece\\" will be sorely disappointed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is a book I've been meaning to read, was on my list, but was only spurred on to pick up by Bradbury's death. I read The Martian Chronicles and Dandelion Wine ages and ages ago so it was with pleasure that I returned to rediscover Bradbury's brilliance.Guy Montag was a fireman whose job it was to start fires. And he enjoyed his job. He had been a fireman for ten years, and he had never questioned the pleasure of the midnight runs or the joy of watching pages consumed by flames, never questioned anything until he met a seventeen-year-old girl who told him of a past when people were not afraid. Then Guy met a professor who told him of a future in which people could think. And Guy Montag suddenly realized what he had to do...I did know going in that Fahrenheit 451 was set in a dystopian society in which firemen burned books. All books. To ashes. Which made it hard for me to breathe. That feeling persisted throughout the entirety of Fahrenheit 451. Thank goodness it was a quick read. To be honest I skimmed over some passages, much like I would a gory, overly graphic horror scene.\\"It was a pleasure to burn.\\"From this iconic first line on, Fahrenheit 451 moved at a fast, intense clip. It's refreshing to be reminded of how a great story doesn't need to be stretched out into two-three book series like so many books I come across nowadays. Bradbury's writing is economical and compact; despite the radical vision he's presenting, Fahrenheit 451 doesn't indulge in tedious info-dumping or an unnecessary scenes. Though the plot is full of shocking action, it also has many scenes that illustrate Montag's internal struggles.Reading Fahrenheit 451 was very disturbing. Not so much because of the horror of book burning, but because the alternate history that Bradbury painted stemming from censorship is possible, even in this day and age. The unquestioning, drugged-like state of the general population is frightening because it can happen and does happen to some degree today. Everyone is numbed by artificial, dumbed down entertainment. Instead of TVs, there are entire TV walls surrounding people. Seashell earbuds fill their heads with ceaseless, lulling noise. No one has face-to-face conversations anymore. People accidentally on purpose overdose on sleeping pills - yet they don't even know how unhappy they are. Everyone goes around in a haze of oblivion, so much so that no one knows there's even a war going on.The symbolic figure of this dead and deadened world is Guy Montag, a fireman who sets fire to books. In the beginning of Fahrenheit 451, he revels in the power and spectacle of burning these hated things. But in the course of meeting a girl and an old man, both of whom infect him with the idea that the world was once different, Guy suddenly finds himself having a massive crisis of the heart, mind, and soul. From then on, life as he knows it explodes.One thing that bothered me about Fahrenheit 451 was the kind of books that \\"rebels\\" held as worth saving at all costs, even their lives. First of all, no books by female authors. Secondly, the Bible plays a big role. Which is ironic to me since most censors and book banners cling to the Bible as their reason for banning books in the first place.\\"'Do you know why books such as this are so important? Because they have quality. And what does the word quality mean? To me it means texture. This book has pores. It has features. This book can go under the microscope. You'd find life under the glass, streaming past in infinite profusion. The more pores, the more truthfully recorded details of life per square inch you can get on a sheet of paper, the more \\"literary\\" you are. That's my definition, anyway. Telling detail. Fresh detail. The good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies.'\\""},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The whole concept of this book bothered me.

It was good, but not anywhere near as good as others I've read in this genre. I've found that I don't like Bradbury's style. He's a bit too ornamental, romantic, melodramatic for my taste. He's also rather egocentric--using his writing to serve himself rather than the writer, which turns me off. If you read some of his interviews, you'll see what I'm talking about. Nevertheless, I think all dystopian sci-fi fans should read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"So, I ordered this book after consistent protesting from my fiance that this was fantastic. Maybe it was a combination of how high he had built it up, or the fact that I was never forced to read this when I was in school, but it did not impress me. It was an OKAY book, I am just was not overly impressed. Plus, I feel kinda cheated that I had to pay so much for it, compared to other Kindle books. Overall, I would recommend it if you are very interested in futuristic works, but otherwise, it is not the best read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The message in the book is similar to that in \\"1984\\" and in the writings of Ayn Rand. At times the message seemed to be so \\"in your face\\" and I'm certain that Mr. Bradbury would have been more subtle had he written it 10 or 15 years later."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury is typically a novelist you read as a child or an adolescent, much like Isaac Asimov or Arthur C. Clarke. For whatever reason, I never read Bradbury as a young man (other than a tiny handful of shorter pieces), and I've only recently decided to correct that omission. I thought I would begin with FAHRENHEIT 451, which is easily Bradbury's most famous work.Needless to say, this dystopian novel is quite impressive, and not just on the literary merits. What impressed me most was Bradbury's scalding critique of modern-day society, with its ever-shortening attention spans and its addiction to a media that is both ever-present and dumbed-down.FAHRENHEIT 451 was written way back in 1953, but it holds up beautifully. Many of its lessons are directly applicable to our multimedia age. Contrary to popular perception, this is a not a novel about state censorship, as much as it is a novel about how people willingly give up the power to think and reason for themselves. The books in FAHRENHEIT 451 are burned because the people demand it -- their increasingly rigid and shallow minds (both liberal and conservative) feel threatened by the ideas the books contain.FAHRENHEIT 451 is a short novel, one that lacks the literary style of a Margaret Atwood or even an Aldous Huxley. But it conveys its message quite powerfully, and it also success very well as a work of suspense. Not only is this book thought provoking, but it's exciting to read.It's rare when a \\"classic\\" novel exceeds my expectations, but FAHRENHEIT 451 by Bradbury accomplishes that feat. Based on my success with this book, I plan to read more of his work very soon."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This was one of my favorite books in high school, and reading it again had a certain charm, but my issue with it can be summed up in a small quote from an interview included in the final pages.\\"DEL RAY: In the introduction to the recently published Bradbury: An Illustrated Life\\", a wonderful book which I have spent hours immersed in--RAY BRADBURY: Isn't that an incredible book?\\"I had the same issue with Brave New World. Even though these science fiction romps are interesting and at times exciting, the authors are so in love with themselves and their prophetic ideas, it hurts; sometimes it even cramps the writing.

He has an amazing ability to paint a scene without unnecessary description and create tension with characters you can truly identify with and live in their skin. He will be missed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a story of conflict. Conflict between the work the main character Guy Montag does and his true beliefs. These beliefs have not been fully realized by him yet.We are introduced to Guy as the model citizen of this future world. He is a public servant, a fireman. Unfortunately, something has changed and now the firemen start fires instead of putting them out. Their mission is to find and burn books and the houses that are hiding them. Guy Montag was very good at his job and for the first many years, he did it without thinking or feeling.Several things happened to Guy that made him actually start thinking about what he was doing. He started wondering why he had to do what he had to do. Why was he burning old ladies and their books? He met his neighbor Clarisse McClellan, a young girl whose family just moved in. Clarisse made Guy think about things that he never realized before. \\"Bet I know something else you don't. There's dew on the grass in the morning.\\" He suddenly couldn't remember if he had known this or not, and it made him quite Irritable\\" (p. 4). It was these little things that people didn't take time to think about anymore.Guy started spending more time thinking about his job and why he was doing it. This was partly because he saw Clarisse almost everyday and she evoked a different type of emotion that he couldn't quite understand. By just pointing out that there are more things in life than work and television, she started to open his eyes. \\"And as many times he came out of the house and Clarisse was there somewhere in the world. Once he saw her shaking a walnut tree, once he saw her sitting on the lawn knitting a blue sweater, three or four times he found a bouquet of late flowers on his porch, or a handful of chestnuts in a little sack, or some autumn leaves neatly pinned to a sheet of white paper and thumbtacked to his door\\" (p. 13).After Clarisse disappeared, his world completely changed. He decided that he didn't want to continue down the same path he was heading down his whole life until this point. When asked what had changed in his life, Guy replied \\"I don't know. We have everything we need to be happy, but we aren't happy. Something's missing. I looked around. The only thing I positively knew was gone was the books I'd burned in ten or twelve years. So I thought books might help\\" (p. 38).In the end, Guy has finally changed everything about himself and joined with a band of likeminded people. He has become what he spent ten years trying to destroy. He was now himself a book. \\"Montag. Granger took Montag's shoulder firmly. Walk carefully. Guard your health. If anything should happen to Harris, you are the Book of Ecclesiastes. See how important you've become in the last minute!\\" (p. 69)."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most famous works of science fiction, and with \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"1984\\" represents one of the most memorable and haunting dystopias. In a future world, books are banned and firemen actually set fires instead of extinguishing them. The state exercises a form of social control through controlling what sort of information people have access to. It turns out that not all books are banned, only those that we would today consider \\"great works\\" - Plato, Shakespeare, The Bible, Darwin, etc. For me one of the biggest surprises about Fahrenheit 451 was the rationale that was offered for the burning of those books. In a nutshell, they offended politically correct sensibilities and the authorities felt that they would undermine the social cohesion. This expunging of the classics from the culture has an uncanny resonance with the attempts over past few decades to expunge them from the undergraduate liberal arts curriculum. And rationale is also similar: these books are not \\"diverse\\" enough and may offend the sensibilities of an ever-increasing list of \\"minorities.\\" It is hard not to wonder if a milder, softer version of dystopian future that Bradbury was worried about in the early 1950s has not in fact arrived.Bradbury's writing and ideas are somewhere between those of George Orwell and Philip K. Dick. His style is very engaging, and even poetic. His writing is at its best when one of his characters engages in a prolonged monolog. However, the plot development could use some improvement. There is very little in terms of transition from one scene to the next, and most scenes are overly compressed. It is very hard to follow the plot developments at times. Nonetheless, Bradbury is a wonderful stylist and unlike much of science fiction this book is a pleasure to read on a purely literally level as well as for its sweeping ideas.As a last note, I found it incredibly ironic that I read this book on Kindle. Based on this alone I am fairly optimistic that reading and great books will not only survive but in fact thrive well into the 21st century."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was a great book, definitely something you can discuss in a group setting.

Great read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent book for someone who is into pondering the meaning of life and stuff like that. However, it's not the light, entertaining book that some may be looking for. Most of the book is a metaphor, and if the reader is willing to think about what is represented so much can come from this book. The idea of the book is fascinating and Bradbury's demonstrates his point perfectly with his amazing word choice. There are so many themes and life changing lessons that can be pulled out of this book. If the reader dives beneath the surface of this book, they will get a whole lot more from this book than they would from a cheesy love story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury did an excellent job writing Fahrenheit 451. Set in a future time period, Guy Montag is a fireman but he doesn't stop fires, he usually creates them. Most of the time he burns books, one of the many things that are censored from the society in Fahrenheit 451.Ray Bradbury is great at writing descriptions. On the first page he describes Montag burning books buy saying, \\"It was a special pleasure to see things eaten, to see things blackened and changed. With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head, and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history.\\" The whole book is full of descriptions like this. Most of the time this is a good thing because it kept me interested but sometimes descriptions seem a little too long and are just dragged out.The story instantly captures you within the first ten pages or so. The book is generally an easy read and was interesting all through out and made me want to keep reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury is a very smart man. Reading this book alone is not good enough to experience it's full greatness. This was one of the few books i enjoyed analyzing, because when you analyze Bradbury you catch on to a lot of little easter eggs that you would never catch while your just reading it through for fun. This book will definantly make you look twice at the people around you and how they think. If you're interested in psychology i think you would enjoy this book.

The fire that burns inside Montag, the protagonist of Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is the burning desire to know the value that books truly have in the world and why society is so against them.The darkness of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is evident because of its modern texture and present day technology (such as the T.V.) and the stranglehold that it has on even today's society. You'd be hard pressed to find a home without a television and even more hard-pressed to find a home that truly values books above all else. Ray Bradbury's futuristic society is full of self-inflicted censorship and ignorance, which is a little discomforting because it is so modern. One is tempted to ask, \\"Why would a society bring about its own ignorance and censorship regulations?\\" The answer is simple: people fear those who are intellectually superior to them and also envy the brains that they were blessed with. Compare this phenomena to a competitive sport: when you compete you do the best you can and you think that you are doing a really good job then, out of nowhere, some one else comes out who does a far better job than you did not because he worked harder then you but because he was just more talented. Further more, in a fast moving society who really has time for books anymore when its so much easier to sit in front of the boob tube and receive a much more stimulating experience without the need to really think?\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a bundle of motifs and symbols. One of these motifs is the recurring quotes referring to nature. \\"The sun burnt every day. It burnt Time . . . Time was busy burning the years and the people anyway, without any help from him. So if he burnt things with the firemen and the sun burnt Time, that meant that everything burnt!\\" This quote is said when Montag realizes that he must never burn again. He realizes that the sun burns because it has to and seeing as it won't stop burning, he and the fireman must never burn again.Ray Bradbury was very against censoring in any form whether it was censoring out words in books or songs, or the news keeping people from knowing what is really going on in the world. The result of his views are cultivated in this book and overall \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was a fluid, well designed book that utters to us the warnings of the unforeseen effects of censorship: when we bring about our own constrained views upon a part of culture that has been around for such a long time, we will have a society that will begin to eat itself away and we will be forced to start all over again, and have nothing to work with but scraps of a lost world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I love this book.

This is a society where most people only care about themselfs. The firemen are more like policemen then firemen. They are responsible for up holding the law. If anyone if found to have a book it is the job of the firemen to take care of the situation. With flamethroughers in hand they burn not only the books but the building that houses them. It is said that firemen never have put out a fire. Guy Montag is a fireman. Occurring to Guy Montag: \\"It was a pleasure to burn.\\" Montag loved his job immensely. To him the sent of kerosene was like perfume. Montag always exempted thing for the way they were. He was \\"happy\\". He had all the things he needed to be \\"happy\\". Why should he change.

With the use of his imagery, you see his world in a different perspective.

It was an easy read, but I found that some people have expanded the meanings of this novel through a bizarre form of free-flowing symbolism. They have deemed it a modern American Literature Symbolism Bible, a title that I personally abhor. It's a good book, but not one of such importance that one should completely be absorbed in its meaning weeks after reading. This book's portrayal of Dentim's Dentifrice could be the key to understanding life, but I seriously doubt it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is an interesting tale of a strange and ominous future which is hauntingly convincing. It is the story of a man named Guy Montag, who's job it is to burn books. He loves his job until he meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan. When she disappears Montag begins to further question his job and his world. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The story was quite fascinating and I could often relate to the characters. I also liked Bradbury's descriptions of various objects in the book. However, the most amazing thing about the book was that the strange and twisted world it describes did not seem that far off. This is especially remarkable as the book was written forty six years ago. Bradbury was able to predict many things that would happen, for example the increasing picture quality and use of the Television. I would recommend this book to people who like science-fiction or futuristic books. I would not recommend it to people who prefer more traditional books. I would also not recommend it who will get annoyed by an eccentric writing style or find it hard to understand as even I did a few times."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book really makes you think and most of the things that are in this book about teens and technology is coming true in our world today, kinda scary."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Being one of the first Anti- Utopian stories I've read, it was very formative on how I look at life.

I can compare this futuristic story with that of Huxley's Brave New World and Orwell's 1984, both of which I read right before this one. I kind of think that this one was totally more interesting that the other two, no doubt about it. It's primarily about a fireman, Montag, who works for a book-burning fire deparment. One day the thought of reading those books that he burns crosses his minds. As a result, he steals some and hides them in his home. His wife, Mildred, reports him and all of a sudden he becomes a wanted fugitive. You wanna know how to the book ends?

The main antagonist was Captain Beatty who was the chief of the firemen. The story takes place in the future in a city like any other today. The only difference is that everything is run by computers and books are illegal to read and own. Unlike today, where firemen stop fires, their job was to burn books and houses they were in. It did not matter if there people in them or not. As the story developes, Montag becomes curious about what the prohibited books contain, so he steals them. Towards the end of the book he gets caught and becomes a fugitive. Although the book has a good message, it was extremely boring. It made us reflect on our own lifestyles, yet we didn't enjoy the way Bradbury wrote it. It was dry and basically boring. Yet the theme about finding our humanity and ourselves was eye opening. It made us wonder if our civilization will end up as Bradbury's novel depicts. Will we end up, so wrapped up in ourselves and our technology that we will no longer have time to love others and have a mind of our own? Or will we just walk through life, not feeling any emotions whatsoever towards anyone or anything and believe, in our dogmatic way, that this is happiness?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book although very confusing , as the author uses too much detail , was intruiging .

He begins to take books home from many of the places he has destroyed. Clarisse, Guy's next door neighbor, and seemingly the one that set his book-stealing into motion, is one of the most interesting characters. Unfortunately, she disappears without much explanation.

Bradbury anticipates a complete elimination of all books and literature, and I do agree that we are moving in a more automated, fast-paced society with less emphasis on love and personal relationships. But we will never reach such an extreme level, its simply a rediculous concept. I contest that we cannot worry about whether others are getting their daily dose of Shakespeare, Joyce or the Bible, and if we choose to read on our own, we will always have the chance to do so. I imagine that if you are reading this review, you don't run a high risk of losing interest in books in your lifetime.

This leads to all kinds of deviant things like reading. What are you doing now?One big rift between the book and the movie [Fahrenheit 451 (1966) -- Oscar Werner, Julie Christie] is that in the movie the \\"written word\\" was completely removed (even from the credits); where as in the book the state was against was literature and not technical writing.Books are just symbols of ideas that could have been on the screen also.

This is a realistic fiction book based on a futuristic world. This book is a mystery in some aspects and it could somewhat be an action book.This book is about a man named Guy Mortag.

If you are interested in futuristic and or realistic fictional stories then you should read this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"First off, I have to say that the idea isn't that far fetched. It's hard to imagine that someone in 1953 could depict our life so close to what it is like today. Television seems to run our lives and less people settle themselves in books. I say this because I'm one of them, although I do enjoy a good sci-fi novel (ie. 1984, Dune, Brave New World). That said, I have to conclude that Bradbury did in fact write a flop! It is true what they say about how you can't buy a book by it's cover. I, just as many others, was encouraged to read from the title. The concept is excellent and to a point, realistic. What seems &quot;wrong&quot; with the book however is the lack of depth the other characters have. Clarise, the girl who turned Guy Montag's head in the other direction, who had great potential, dies in the begining of the book. Her death seems meaningless as a result of lack of depth... Mildred, Guy's wife, who turns in her own husband, also lacks depth. The second reason which makes this book a flop is the lack of a conclusion. Not to spoil the ending of these great literary pieces, but the main characters in 1984, Brave New World, and Dune either die, are defeated, or emerge victorious (not in that order). But in F451, Guy ends up roaming the lands with a bunch of Harvard and Yale hobos. The government, Big Brother, or whatever you want to call it, which was so obviously against him, couldn't care less if he existed. And Guy's cause failed to alter anything, other than relocating him to the woods. There seemed to be no major conflict. Sure, people will argue that the chase was a conflict, but it was not solved. Now, if this book was part of a trilogy, then maybe there is some reason to leaving the question unanswered to what was the purpose of Guy's puiny uproar. But the fact is that the book is cut short. It deserved a better ending or even a better beginning. Whatever the case I felt thirsty for more at the end of the book, I had many questions unanswered, like what really happened to Clarisse, was she killed by a racing car or was she hiding from the government too? Does Faber get in touch with those printing guys or is he caught by Big Brother? There needn't be a happy ending, but to deprive the audience of an ending of any type spells out B A D S T Y L E."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is about a fireman named Guy Montag. He lives in a day and age of very high technology. Instead of having televisions they have \`parlors'. Which are rooms where pictures are displayed on the walls and it is very interactive. Guy's job as a fireman is not an ordinary fireman's job. In this future time houses have been made fire proof. Therefore there is no need for firemen who go put out fires. However the government has banned all books from the United States. They figure any book can cause disagreement by someone. Even the smallest minority could find a book that they think is prejudice towards them. Hence, Guy's job as a fireman is to burn any and all books that are found. However, a young girl moves in next door to Guy. She stimulates his interest in books. At first she just tries to get him to slow down in a world that is constantly speeding up. She tells him to stop and smell the flowers. This girl is found dead, but she left an impression on Guy Montag. Guy collects books from the ones they go and burn. He begins to hate is job as a fireman. He finds a man that also likes books and has been planning to destroy what the fireman do. Then, Guy Montage is reported to have books in his house. While on the job the fireman receive a call to go and burn some books. Guy is startled when they pull up in front of his house. The head fireman gives a blow torch to Guy and has him do it himself. Guy burns his entire house down, but by now he has almost gone insane. He ends up killing the head fireman and running. The authorities chase him for hours. Guy is able to escape down the river. He finds a group of people who all have ran away because they love books. Soon after he leaves the city the next world war starts. Guy's city is one of the first to get flattened by bombs. The people in the city had no warning. They were told it would never come so close. Guy Montag and the head fireman, Beatty, where actually very much alike. In the beginning they both went out and burned books with no second thoughts. However, Guy soon begins to think about what he is doing. This is when we find out that Beatty also once read books. Beatty found burning the books as an escape to loving them. When Beatty is about to be killed by Guy, Beatty does no try to move or jump away. He seems to just stay in place like he is ready to die. He has burnt enough books and he is ready for it to end. Death is his new escape.

But its not. Or maybe if it was written before the genre defining steps made in 1984. But its not. It is simply self delusional in attempting to convey an idea, plot or any form of characterisation.For starters, why did a fireman after 10 years of diligently loving his job suddenly realises the futile nature of his ways after listening to a girl talk rubbish for 2 minutes intervals over a 4 day period? Why is it OK to get high on drugs and drive 90MPH around everywhere, but not read a book about philosophy in case a conceivable minority gets offended!? And why are books banned but every other type of media isn't. The book seems to suggest its their inherently edgy content, so why just ban particular books? Why employ an entire emergency service to do this job? And most importantly, how could any of the technological devices be engineered with the risk of the fire department coming round your house at any given moment to burn it down if you dared read a single book!? This could be all be forgiven if it was written well or follows an interesting story, but it just fails in every sense of the word.

But instead of putting out fires, like today, the firemen in this book do the opposite: burn books.I read this book about two months ago in English class. I have written an essay about many topics that come up from this book, and have done other things with it.First, this book is full of crazy metaphors and similes. I did not understand most of them. Some have nothing at all to do with any of the material or other parts in the book. It's as if you have to be super smart just to read and understand this book.Second, the author makes references to the book being how life will be in the future, but it is not. We are not obsessed with our TV's and being chased around by huge robot dogs. It makes no sense to say something like this, and then it not be true. I know he wrote this a long time and that is what he thought, but still.Finally, some parts of the book make no sense. Like the part where the main character seems to be talking to himself, but he actually isn't. I did not know this, and neither will most readers. The author should have made this clearer to the reader.Something I did find good in this book, however, is the fact that the author is very creative and is very good at writing action and suspense scenes. For example, when Montag, the main character, tries to cross this one huge street, and there as a car coming straight at him quite fast.I do not recommend you to read this book. You should definitely pick a different more interesting book to read, and one that will possibly make more sense than this one.Written by Kelsey Lamb6th period English"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was confusing at times...boring at other...down right cruel at other. This future society is messed up like forreal so if you into all the sci-fi drama dystopian world this book is for you."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was hard to read from the start. Eventually one can infer what is going on, but very little is explained plainly. The copy I read was from the library, and there were mispelled sticky notes throughout with what looked like two middle schoolers trying to figure out what was going on. (For instance, \\"Why is Beatty ask about the dog? Dose he know where the books are?\\")The ending is alright, and I really liked the quote about how the inability to build creates a need to destroy."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is an interesting book with an interesting premise. The thought that the day will come when firemen will burn books instead of putting out fires is original and quite symbolic. There are some subtle highlights throughout the text but on the whole it isn't real exciting or fun. It is short and to the point, however.For me, the real story is in the writing of the text and the history of the author. His story is highly inspirational and fun to read. While the book isn't a real entertainment, it is potent in message and subtlties. There is a wothwhile message awating the thoughtful reader."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 was a great book that I really enjoyed. This book takes place sometime in the future. It is a story is about a fireman, he is not a fireman that you and I think about; instead of putting fires out he starts them. He is a book burner. Because in the society that he lives in books are outlawed and are to be burnt. There were four main characters in this story. The most important was Guy Montag. He was a tall black haired man that questions society and himself. He is a fireman that burns books for a living. He makes a lot of changes throughout the book. By the end of the book he is a wanted man. The next character was Clarisse McClellan she is a young girl that is not like everyone else. She is a free thinker. She helped Montag get started on his journey. Montag's boss is very important in the book. His name is Captain Beatty. He seems grumpy and he enjoys burning books. Towards the end of the book he is murdered. Professor Faber is an old professor that helps Motag learn about society and how it used to be. He is weak and cannot act out what he wants to , so he and Montag act as a team. Mildred Montag is Montag's wife. She is the perfect example of the rest of society. She believes that books are horrible and have nothing to offer. All she cares about is her family that was on T.V. and not much of anything else, just like the society she lived in.Guy Montag questions his job and what he wants to do with his life.One of the best parts of the book is the cat and mouse game that Fire Captain Beatty plays with Montag. Beatty is seen as a man who once had been infected with the bug of individualism, but had since 'cured' himself and now is determined to cure Montag. Beatty explains how his society came to be and Montag learns that somewhere along the line, the process went horribly wrong.I think that this book is a very good book, it kept me interested the whole time that I read it.It only took me about 3 days to read it and that was between work and school. For those of you kids that have to read a book for a book report this would be my choice."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury delivered an interesting concept. This science fiction was about how books are evil and should be burned. Mr. Bradbury gave us a concept that has never been thought about before. Although this idea is completely original, in this case, the amount of originality put into this book is not directly proportional to how much I enjoyed the book.Fahrenheit 451 is about a man named Guy Montag who is a futuristic fireman. Guy is basically paid to burn books rather than let people read them. To me, this whole concept seems too far fetched. Not only is reading or possessing books illegal but it can be punished severely. Everyone in this book is just too afraid to read books. I did not like this concept because that would never happen, and is never possible. People would always be interested even if, and sometimes especially if, it is illegal. Despite the laws Montag starts reading books illegally when he becomes completely dissatisfied with life. He begins to enjoy reading and tries to show some others about reading but instead they do not understand his super intellect.This book makes the reader think about the plot too much. The author should say what is going on rather than make the reader think too much because the reading might read too far into things and not completely understand. Books became illegal to read when minorities got overly upset about books that offended them. Eventually the minorities came got enough people to agree with them that all books were banished. Books have so much to offer that this idea seems completely unreasonable and stupid to me.Eventually Guy learns to like books. He even derives a plan to turn the world against illiteracy. Guys wife leaves him when he is not around and reports that he has been reading books. The fire department comes to burn his house down with all of the books in it. The force Montag to do it instead. Many of the concepts like this one seem like nothing of that manner would ever occur in reality. Did he not pay for that house. Why would someone burn another's house down for such a meaningless crime as reading books.This book delivers an interesting concept which may be too far fetched for myself. If you are a book and science fiction lover, this may not be the case for yourself."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am admitting this review does not relate to the actual book but to Amazon so with apologies to Ray Bradbury...Ten bucks? Really? Come on Amazon, you know this book is on a lot of school reading lists. My kid loves her Kindle but when I can buy her school reading book lists for $2 at the used book store, you lost. In fact, it is a weird circle of irony - we used to buy books, they got too expensive, bought the kindle, it was great, then you made the books expensive again and... now we buy the books. You lost an opportunity here, Amazon. For the record, she hasnt picked up her Kindle in a month.Too bad for you."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Some Authors should NOT read their books for the audio format. This is by far the worst I have heard. I found it extremely difficult to follow the story which sounded like it was being read by my great grandfather!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Reading this book could be compared to watching a train being derailed while high on shrooms. The very definition of convolution, this book is confusing and ultimately pointless.Our hero, Guy Montag, hardly makes a compelling main character. We know him as little more than a book-burner who begins to have doubts about his task. That's it. Period. Beyond that, he's not developed at all in the ample page space provided. Any other characters have just bit parts and are painfully obviously killed off as soon as the author doesn't need them anymore. It seems Bradbury has misjudged his own timeline, however; many characters, especially Clarisse McClellan, could have been part of a great supporting cast if they hadn't been gotten rid of when he did.Getting back to that \\"pointless\\" bit - well, that's just it. I honestly did not take away a single thing from this book. It was completely and utterly uninformative, and the only way it made me think was to try and figure out where the characters where and what they were talking about. An issue in and of itself, the dialogue in Fahrenheit 451 is so heavily-laden with metaphors, and the parts of conversation passed so often between different characters, every time I discovered what they were talking about was a treasured moment. Anyway, the book doesn't tell me anything. Guy Montag has doubts about his job, and runs away. Ok. So? So what? Why do I care? This had great potential to be a commentary on the suppression of individuality, but like many other possible routes, that thought had been thrown away in favor of... well, whatever this book turned out to be.An exercise in idiocy, this book should not be read by anyone who values his or her time. You won't learn anything and will ultimately be puzzled as I was when you reach the end of the book. Yet another \\"classic\\" that doesn't deserve the title."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book, whilst very good to begin with, fails in the end beacause Bradbury attemptes to beat his message in too late in the piece. He spends too much time describing the story, and his message, as he has rendered it, is too complex to cram into 180 pages. I was told to read this book in school, but was not forced, as i have a passion for reading. Anyone who now loves the name &quot;clarrise&quot; for the sole fact that she was a nice person in the novel is a wierdo. But, other than that, i found it to be a tolerablebook, up until the death of beatty, when the novels plot development peters out, and we are left feeling cudgeled for the rest of the novel by its &quot;moral&quot; Im only 13, so nyah BURN THE BOOK! bradbury has failed miserably in creating this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I thought there was no point to this book what so ever and i dont suggest anyone to read it...! i had to read it for school and i didnt even finish it because it was so bad!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Our book club recently decided to make every other book choice a \\"classic\\" book which, for one reason or another, none of us has read. Fahrenheit 451 was this month's choice. After plowing through Bradbury's self-aggrandizing Foreward AND Introduction, I was ready to be enthralled. No such luck. This had to be one of the most abysmal books of all time. I suspect there's a bit of The Emperor's New Clothes (a much better read, by the way) going on here. In other words, if you dare to criticize Bradbury, then you must be one of the mindless rubes who hate books and philosophy and creativity and yadda yadda yadda. Fine, whatever. To put it delicately, this book stunk like yesterday's diapers. I have nothing but sympathy for the poor students who are forced to read this drivel for class--at least I had the option of putting it down. I am a college English major and a Senior Editor at a major publishing house, as well as an avid reader. Bradbury's over-the-top vision of intellectuals being rebellious outsiders who are hunted down is hilariously vain. His celebration of intellect above all else excludes other virtues such as love, compassion, humor, etc.. Interesting how these themes are given such short shrift. Bradbury is an overheated, macho, pseudo-intellectual with a chip on his shoulder.

Choosing to read this book himself for the audio recording was a tremendous mistake. His speech is, at times, nearly unintelligable (He was over 80 years old at its recording).

Upset, I wrote a &quot;scorching&quot; essay to the local paper about how we should just burn our books if we refuse to fund the library.Writing the essay allowed me to appreciate just how brilliant this book is. It is dubbed a &quot;classic&quot; for a reason - the residue will remain with you long after you have read it. It has been about five years since I read this book, but I still recall many details, themes and characters in the novel with great clarity.A book to make you passionate about reading books! Self-serving, maybe, but what wonderful treasures they are. And to find a book that so opens the mind and stirs the soul is priceless. If you haven't read this book (why not?!?) it is without a doubt worth your time - and you, fair reader, deserve the enjoyment it will bring you. For those who've had the pleasure of reading the book, let me say I'm going to dust off my copy. I hope you do the same."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Everyone who reads this book (but especially Americans) should be outraged. Bradbury takes an ugly stick and beats the present day American philosophy down with it. We are a society based on instant gratification. Our slogan is &quot;Right here, Right now. It's your Right!&quot; (How many magazines about fashion, cars, and the ever expanding number of ways to cook chicken can we read before our curiousity is deadened?). This is the type of thinking that Bradbury criticized. What especially frightened me was the concept of MAKING everyone equal. Paradoxally, this is the dumbing down of America, so that no one could be made to feel dumb. It is in settling for society's values without critical judgement that we give up our freedom. Thank you, Mr. Bradbury, for putting it much more eloquently and forcefully than I ever could. Now everyone out there reading this ... BUY the book, READ the book, then tell me if you aren't outraged at the lack of neuron firings in the heads of our society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury is amazing. Fahrenheit 451 is an amazing book. So amazing in fact that I did my senior research paper on it. The plot is about Guy Montag (protagonist) learning about censorship and the death that accompanies it. The symbolism is very deep in this book. For example, the story mentions burning books, which is linked to destroying knowledge. Through intricately woven twists, it becomes apparent that Bradbury wants us to realize that knowledge and individuality are the keys to being alive and that when those are lost, regardless of our medical condition, we are dead.The obvious theme is of course censorship, but if you're willing to read it carefully and give some serious thought as to what's being said, you can see a much deeper message. This book should be required for admittance to society. Read it. You won't be disappointed.And don't pay any attention to those negative reviews - they are the people that this book talks about: the morons in our society who don't see the folly of ignorance."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury expounds a firghtening message in Farenheit 451. The book details life where firefighters burn the corpus of many well known authors such as Faulkner and Shakespeare. The book shows the importance of an outlet where people can express their ideas.This message is increasingly important as we near the horrific society portrayed in bradbury's novel. Like the society in F451 we are becoming dependent on television. Books are in a period of quiesence.The book sends it's theme, but it sends it with a hammer. If my memory serves, the book is no larger than 170 pp. Bradbury innundates every paragraph towards the end with his theme. The book is overly sententious, and I wish it was longer. The end seemed rushed and out of a cheesy b movie.Despite this flaw, Bradbury's prose is to die for. In simple, specific words Bradbury manages to convey a convoluted theme. This will remain a classic for years to come, that is if we still have books. Hopefully, F451 will recrudese book's in the future. One can only hope that our grand children will giggle over Wodehouse or marvel at F451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As 1984 becomes less relevant as a work, this novel becomes annually scarier and scarier. Everyone remembers that they burn books in this novel-- what they forget is why. Bradbury's world is one where-- --anything that might offend any special group is repressed --anything that might require people to think is repressed --people sit and stare endlessly at wall-sized tv's --suicide is rampant and unremarkable --people lead life at breakneck speed to avoid thinking or feeling In short, Bradbury has created a world which is frighteningly close to the one in which we live.

The novel is about a fire fighter named Guy Montag whose job is to actually start fires. In the society of the future, no one asks questions or thinks for themselves. Montag and his fire starting colleagues are paid to light books on fire and watch them burn. Montag meets a seventeen-year old girl who tells him about times when people treasured books and when a fireman's job was to extinguish fires. Filled with curiosity about the past, Montag starts hiding books in his home and reading them. His wife reveals his secret to his co-workers and Montag is forced to burn his own stash. Montag then meets philosophers who have stored the contents of books in their heads so that when people need and want the knowledge, it is there.Bradbury brings out a statement of theme that is not revealed without careful analysis of the story.

This futuristic civilization regards cursory items such as magazines as better than books; the television has pretty much taken over; there's even a mention of kids frequently killing each other.

It's a story of an oppressed society and a man with the courage to try and break free. Please, give Farenheit 451 another chance. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Now I did not have to read this for school like most people who wrote these reviews so that may have allowed me to enjoy the book for it's enternainment while still being taught immensely rather than forcing myself to look for the knowledge within and miss the entertainment. School would be so much fun (english &amp; history) if I could read everything as if I were doing it to entertain myself and not because I have to. My state of mind may have been the factor that made this one of the most exciting and meaninful books I have ever read.Every politician should this to learn what democracy is not. Not that I think such a regime could take over in the near future with the freedom of speech on devices such as the internet and the continous poplularity of books. But by not giving his tale a date shows that such a world could come into being any time without warning if people simply forget. The theme of the book is the answer to anyone who asks what the purpose is of learning history. Montag is forced to watch his wife and the rest of a doomed society as it repeats history and mindlessly involves itself in war. The book is not so much about the importance of books but the importance of knowledge. Bradbury shows that a civilized society must always remember and cannot always be happy.The second half reads like an action story without straying from the theme and it is made obvious where Steven King was influenced to write the unrecognized but I think great book The Running Man."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I first read this book in high school I did not give it much consideration, but re-reading it today I can see how Bradbury was so prophetic when he wrote this masterpiece in 1950.For example:F451-Montag's wife uses three wall-TVs to interact with vapid strangers and act out some ridiculous made up family play day in and out.Today-consider all the social networking websites and chat rooms being used for the same purposes.F451-They use a Thimble Bumble-Bee device to personally listen to music day and night making the person oblivious to what is going on around them.Today-There is the iPod (or any MP3 device for that matter) that has drones of people walking around not acknowledging their surroundings.F451-Robotic teller machines manning the bank 24hrs a day.Today-ATMsF451-There is a list of books that the firemen do not burn because they are acceptable (to keep the populace docile and complacent).Today-Oprah's Book of the Month Club."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I enjoy visions of the future whether it's in films or books. Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982) depicted a society where the majority of people had settled on distant planets, while Marco Brambilla's Demolition Man (1993) was a peaceful world where human contact was not allowed and crime was almost non-existent. In literature, George Orwell's 1984 (1949) and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932) both depicted a bleak future for mankind, loveless societies with technology at the fore and the freedom of the individual vastly reduced through fear and manipulation. Reading Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 for the first time I was fascinated about how it would compare to the great dystopian novels I'd already had the pleasure of reading.Set in an unspecified future Fahrenheit 451 follows the story of Guy Montag, a fireman who goes through life without asking questions and abiding by the rules. Firemen in Bradbury's future are not the fire fighters we are accustomed to but fire starters! In this society it is illegal to own or read books and anyone caught doing so must hand them over to the fire service or suffer the consequences. The title of the book refers to the temperature at which the books burn, and as can be expected fire plays a big part in the novel. Guy Montag's life is turned upside down by an encounter with his free-spirited neighbour, Clarisse McClellan, whose outlook on life is in direct contrast to Montag as she dares to ask why in a society that is not to be questioned or reasoned with. From meeting McClellan, Montag begins to question his own existence, his relationship with his wife, Mildred, his work as a fireman and whether books really should be forbidden. The book follows the change in Montag's life and the consequences it has.As with other dystopian novels, Fahrenheit 451 is often frightening when you consider such a reality in our own world. The idea that books are forbidden for the thoughts and stories they convey and are simply not to be harboured by the population is difficult to understand. By robbing the world of books Bradbury's characters are almost lifeless. Montag's wife, Mildred, is addicted to TV walls, constantly discussing the images with her friends and hounding her husband for a fourth TV wall. This form of entertainment has become the staple of society and is much preferred for the images projected ensure the viewer doesn't need to use their imagination or think. A stark contrast to books.The penalty for hording books is best reflected when Montag and his fellow firemen are called to a house where an old woman has many books stashed. After refusing to destroy her precious collection the old woman waits until the firemen have their backs turned before starting a blaze of her own, destroying both her house and her books, and taking her own life in the process. The event rocks Montag severely as does the disappearance of Clarisse McClellan who we do not see again but Montag is assured she is dead. These changes force Montag not only to question the morality of society but to begin keeping books himself and reading them! The change in Montag is wonderfully crafted, the idea that he has no life prior to the meeting with Clarisse McClellan but in discovering the beneficial elements of books he feels more alive than ever, though his transgressions leave him a wanted man.When Clarisse McClellan is out of the picture, Montag has to turn to an English professor, Faber, who begins teaching him about the significance of books to human history and how they should still be relevant in the present. While Montag begins to learn about books he has to deal with his wife, Mildred, who is reluctant to have books in her house but also with his boss, Beatty, who suspects Montag's wavering stance but proceeds to spare him punishment by assuring him possession of a book by a fireman for 24 hours is acceptable so long as the said book is then destroyed. Montag's brief meetings with Clarisse McClellan and his new found need for independence and the ability to choose means he eventually has to leave the society that has been his whole life or have his existence cut terribly short.When Montag is on the run the novel gathers pace as he first fends off firemen and then the relentless mechanical hounds. After eluding capture Montag has helicopters to contend with and these scenes reflect the stranglehold of the society over its subjects. One man steps out of line by reading and keeping books, and all of a sudden firemen, mechanical hounds and helicopters are all devoted to his capture. Montag's decision to defy society costs him everything he ever knew and if that's not enough of a problem, he also has to face up to the onset of war!Fahrenheit 451 can sit proudly amongst the other dystopian novels of the 21st century. Working round the theme of book burning, Bradbury expertly fashions a world where the individual is a mindless minion and helps add weight to the argument of the importance of books. Bradbury's novel may not predict the Internet but it does suggest books will be obsolete in favour of technology. Prior to the Harry Potter novels there was a growing fear that children's love of books was decreasing fast but now their enthusiasm has been somewhat restored. It's unlikely a future like Fahrenheit 451 will come to be but the book should stand as a warning of a way of living we simply couldn't allow to happen."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book way back in high school, but after Mr. Bradbury's recent demise (and the youtube channel vlogbrother's choice of this for their summer read) I decided to pick it up again. Once again, reading a book that I either didn't like or didn't understand in school has blown me away later in life. For those of you who are encountering this classic for the first time, Fahrenheit 451, in a nutshell, is a book about a future society that, for a combination of different reasons, has decided to ban all books and the main character, Guy Montag, is a content fireman (i.e. book-burner) who has a crisis of conscience over his job. What Mr. Bradbury seems to be saying, to me at least, is that a life that is devoid of critical thought, which is something that books easily facilitate, is no life at all. Nearly all the characters who have turned their backs on books are seemingly dead and alive at the same time, just like many of the mechanical devices that populate the book like the electric hound and the one-eyed snake. It also feels like a a caution against both anti-intellectualism and intellectualism as embodied in the character and antagonist Fire Chief Beatty. Beatty relishes burning books and has clearly turned his back on them, but uses quotes and arguments from books to try to manipulate Montag back into the field. I only give it four stars though because Fahrenheit 451 has this strange habit of moving along really fast at times (not uncommon in a book that is less than 200 pages), but can also feel really slow too. It is easy to miss crucial details, especially in part 2. But don't let this criticism fool you. This has now easily worked it's way onto my favorites shelf and is a great introduction for readers interested in dystopian future novels like1984 ( Signet Classics (Paperback) ) [ 1984 ( SIGNET CLASSICS (PAPERBACK) ) ] by Orwell, George ( Author) on Jul, 01, 1950 Mass Market Paperbound."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"My older sister had to read this book for school way back when I was maybe 12 years old.

My love of reading can be traced back to this book. His recent death triggered me to think about how much he meant to me as a boy growing into a young man, and I thought I'd pick up something as a sort of memorial to him. I hadn't read anything of his in probably 35 years, and to be honest I felt like maybe it wouldn't be that good going back to re-read them. I mean, could they actually live up to my memories? Wow, and then some! His writing is poetry, magic and a sincere look at the human condition. It is as timely today as it was when he wrote it, maybe more so.

By page 3 of the novel, however, I knew this was not a book I would enjoy. While it's a frightening, though thought-provoking look at the way society could become, it was extremely badly written. Bradbury goes on and on for pages of nonsense, and his words leave you with no more enlightenment than you had 50 pages ago. He uses redundant adjectives, and pointless sentences. I was especially annoyed when he would go &quot;inside&quot; Mr. Montag's thoughts and repeat the same meaningless phrases over and over again. I wouldn't recommend this book to a single person, and my condolances to any other student forced to waste their time on this. Fahrenheit 451 is one of the few books I would gladly toss in the fire."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I picked up this book because I had absoutely loved Huxley's Brave New World and Orwell's 1984. I thought I would like this book, considering its subject matter. I was completely wrong. Those that compared this to the other two masterpieces, failed to note one thing: Whereas the other two are written in haunting, intense, breathlessly engaging style, this book is in comparison rather choppy in its language. If the language style was not so dry, maybe I would have enjoyed slightly more. Furthermore, the book lacks any suspense whatsoever. Instead of staying up all night by my bed to finish the book, I had to constantly skip pages because of its rather boring and dry writing. I also found the characters particularly unsympathetic and unable to identify with. Instead of drawing me in, I had to force myself to finish the book (after repeatedly skimming through some unbearably slow sections). For such a small book, it's not easy to turn off a reader so many times. In addition, the book feels distant and unrealistic. It misses the realism to resonate with today's society, but it also lacks the bleak prophecy of a warning. Instead, near the end of the book, the author gave a not very subtlely disguised lecture on censorship, which is fine, except for the face that it feels like the author had left the world of storytelling and abruptly intrude into his own stories. He could not get the point across by the story itself; he had to announce it out. I also found the ending a bit ridiculous and incredulous. If words were so easily preserved in memories, we would not need writing. If the brain were so indiscriminating in its selectivity, we would not have conflicting memories. And although this book was supposedly an anti-censorship novel, I did not walk away from this book feeling the horrow of censorship. Instead, I wished I had not wasted my time on reading this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"How ironic that a book about limiting access to books is NOT text-to-speech enabled.

He will not buy audio books so the publisher makes no sale at all. He bought his Kindle for the express purpose of being able to read books through the text-to-speech function. Unfortunately, too many books have this feature disabled - often through Simon & Schuster. It is especially ironic that the publisher would limit the blind community's access through Kindle TTS when this book centers around removing access to books.

It's far less complex in terms of language and expressions than those two, which makes its reading easy and fast. But Farenheit's story is clearly &quot;too much&quot; inspired by Orwell's and Huxley's work, with too obvious similarities hard not to be comparable at the same time you go through the book. An example, Farenheit's big televisions on the walls in the houses. Remember Big Brother speaking from wallscreens in 1984?On the other side, Bradbury let us know that books are synonims of &quot;culture&quot;, and &quot;development of thinking&quot;, which in my opinion are arbitrary statements. There can also be non educative books as there are non educative tv programmes or popcorn movies.And the story changes its course abruptly at the end. The characters that didn't die are running madly across the forests, with an ending that is hardly convincing.My advice would be not to read this book, at least if you've already read those other two..."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I really did not enjoy this book at all. I felt that the plot was hard to follow and somewhat confusing. Some people have said that this book is written for high school students, but I really don't think that it is. I'm a freshman in high school and I really did not understand what was going on. I figured it out enough to kind of follow the story, but definitely not enough to actually get into the book. This is one of only about 3 books that I have ever read that I did not perfectly understand and enjoy. The basic idea of the plot is that Guy Montag, a fireman in the future, is paid to burn down houses that illegally store books in them. He meets some other characters (such as Clarisse, a 17 year old who lives in his neighborhood) who help him open his eyes to the world that he is being so blind to. If you enjoy reading about censorship or science fiction, this book might be okay for you. If you like stories that are pretty easy to follow and have a more realistic plot, don't bother. -- luckiestarre"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is one of the worst I have read!!

The thought of firemen starting fires is dark and quite odd. Burning books, though, is one of the scariest things about the theme of this book. It almost makes me afraid that this could happen not in the too-distant future. Book lovers out there, Fahrenheit 451 might give you a big chill."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is not your normal fireman. Instead of putting out fires, he starts them. We find this out right at the beginning. It is not just regular fires he starts, but book fires. If they catch you with books, they will burn them, and maybe they will burn you. In this society, they don't want you to think.There are walls that speak to you, you can drive as fast as you want, billboards stretch out for hundreds of feet because they want to make sure that you still get advertisements drilled into your head. Is this in the future, or did Ray Bradbury know what our society was coming to?When Guy came home from work, he met up with a strange girl who was curious, charming, and not like anyone he has known. She put questions into his head, and he would never be the same. After their meeting, he started to sneak books into his house knowing what would happen if he were caught. The question is: should he risk his life for the sake of knowledge, or live like everyone else: happy but ignorant?The only problem I had with it (and I don't normally say this) was that it was too short. It ended so quickly, that I didn't see it coming. I read this book in highschool (like everyone else) but it had a different effect on me the second time around. I definitely recommend it, especially for book-lovers."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451.

It's simple, but in Ray Bradbury's account of this tale, it becomes very complex.Guy Montag, the main character/fireman, discovers that this process is wrong.

Fahrenheit 451 was the featured book, and I've been meaning to reread it anyway. You probably already know the storyline... Reading books is a banned activity, and firemen are not used to put out fires, but to burn down houses where books are being covertly hidden. Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which paper burns, hence the title. The main character, Montag, starts to wonder why people would still risk having books, and ends up becoming a book hoarder himself. His house is burned down, and he flees before he can be arrested. He meets up with other readers in the countryside and decides to remember and preserve books rather than return to the city, which, by the way, just got anniliated by atomic warfare...This isn't so much a novel as a longer short story critiquing society's ever-decreasing attention span and lack of time spent actually thinking. Everything is based on entertainment, and ideas and concepts are spoonfed to the public in short, repeated soundbites. Sound disturbingly familiar? I found it amazing that, 50 years after having written the book, Bradbury's view of the future isn't that far removed from reality. We don't burn down houses with books, but we try to censor ideas and make everything &quot;politically correct&quot; so that no one is offended.This particular paperback edition is the 50th anniversary edition of the book, and features an interview with the writer at the end. He also expounds on what the characters in the book would say and do now if the book were to be expanded.Well worth reading (or reading again if you haven't done so lately)."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What began as a short story in 1950, evolved into one of the greatest American novels of all time. Fahrenheit 451, originally titled The Fire Man, was Ray Bradbury's first novel. It is ironic that the place that Bradbury chose to write a novel about book burning was in a book haven - the basement of the University of California's library. Fahrenheit 451 takes place in a future where knowledge is despised and thought of as an unequalizer. People are made to believe that in order for everyone to be happy and live in harmony they must be equals. Since books spread knowledge and knowledge is an unequalizer, most books are banned from reading and burned in order to be kept from society's hands. Due to the fireproofing of houses, firemen are no longer needed to put out fires. Instead, firemen set ablaze houses that contain illegal books, sometimes burning the people within the houses if they refuse to leave. Guy Montag was a fireman who loved to watch the flames dance in the sky and the books shrivel and die, that is until he met a young girl named Clarisse. Clarisse opened his eyes to the world around him, and no longer did Montag want to burn books, he wanted to save and learn from them.The story picks up when the protagonist, Guy Montag, is walking home from work with his baked on smile and the smell of kerosene hanging about him, having just finished attending a call from the firehouse. While nearing his house, he is accompanied by a strange young girl who introduces herself as Clarisse McClellan. They begin to talk and Montag realizes she is very different from everyone else he knows. She looks at the world around her and sees it for what it is and then takes the time to wonder why it is that way. Before they part, Clarisse asks him something that turns his world upside-down, she asks, \\"Are you happy?\\" (Bradbury 10). One might say that those three little words are the most important in the entire book because they set in motion the series of events that are to follow. At first, Montag tries to laugh it off saying, \\"Happy! Of all the nonsense.\\" (10). However, as Montag entered his house and looked around the quiet rooms and at his silent, stone-like wife, he knew that he was not happy, he knew that something was missing.Subconsciously, Montag knew he was not happy for a long time and had been collecting books from the houses he went to burn. After further discussions with Clarisse and much thought of his own, Montag realizes that there had to be a better way to live and that books could teach him how. Montag pulled out the illegal books he had been hiding and began to read them. However, try as he might, he could not understand and retain what he was reading. Bradbury compared Montag's struggle with sand and a sieve, \\"the faster he poured, the faster it sifted through . . . His hands were tired, the sand was boiling, the sieve was empty\\" (78). The sand is a metaphor for the knowledge within the books and the sieve is a metaphor for Montag's brain. The more and the faster Montag read, the faster it slipped from his memory.Montag continued to try to read and learn more from books and was found out by his boss, Captain Beatty. Of Montag's situation, Beatty makes an allusion to the Greek myth of Icarus, saying \\"Old Montag wanted to fly near the sun and now that he's burnt his damn wings he wonders why\\" (113). In the story of Icarus, his father Daedalus builds him a set of wings, fastened together with wax, so that he can escape from the island of Crete. Icarus was reckless, though, and flew too close to the sun so that the wax melted, breaking his wings and causing him to fall to his death. For Montag, the island that he was trying to escape from was not a physical restraint, but a mental island of ignorance. Montag was reckless like Icarus and came too close to the sun, in his case, knowledge, which caused his downfall, according to Beatty.Overall, I found this book thoroughly enjoyable and frightening at the same time. I look at the world around me and see it slowly turning into the world that Bradbury so vividly described. There are several students in my class that when given the assignment to read a book and do a report on it, opt to watch the video and skim the cliff notes instead. Movies and cliff notes merely brush the surface of books, which is what the parlor walls in Fahrenheit 451 do to all the information and stories it portrays. The idea of a future society where people do not think about their actions, the consequences, or of anything with substance is terrifying and yet incredibly believable in this day and age. It is this idea that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I just read this book a couple days ago (it's a quick read--just a few hours) and felt it portrayed a lot of what I had been thinking for a long time. My mother always shuns shows like &quot;Family Guy&quot; and &quot;South Park&quot; because she feels they are too politically incorrect, but she misses the point of them entirely. Political correctness is good, but to a point. In the aforementioned shows, it's used to make points about society and often the ridiculasness of people who aren't tolerant. In Farenheit 451, people have rejected this in favor of making eveyone happy. The point is, in a world where free though isn't allowed, no once CAN be happy. Montag's wife is a victim of the new society, a woman who refuses to think about anyone or anything that upsets her and is completely enveloped by her tv shows, or her &quot;family&quot;, where everything is perfect and everyone is laughing. In fact, a common theme throughout the book is people saying they are happy only to let us discover later that they really aren't. At least they aren't subconsiously. This is evident in the beginning when Montag's wife tries to kill herself. The social commentary, even at fifty years old, is still very striking. The burning of books is only a part of this novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury opened the book with the line &quot;it was a pleasure to burn&quot;. A shocking and simple sentence began a story set in the near future where a firemen's job was to set fire, as opposed to putting them out. As the story progresses, the main character, Montag, meets more and more people who gradually begins to change his views of the society and analyze his actions as a fireman. What made this book interesting was the radical concepts and belief that the society embraced. The story tells us that a fireman&iexcl;s job was to set fire on books, which were considered to be bad. Not just books were bad, but knowledge in general was viewed as sinister. Montag lives in a society that only promotes very basic information to the public, and knowledge was forbidden and strictly controlled.The title of the book is also closely related to the content. &quot;Fahrenheit 451&iexcl; is the temperature at which normal book paper catches on fire. I thought this title was not only unique and related to the story, but it also attracted its readers. By only stating &iexcl;Fahrenheit 451&iexcl; I would think to myself &iexcl;What would this book be about?&iexcl; and &iexcl;What is the significance of this particular temperature?&iexcl; These continuous questions really increased my curiosity on the book.I thought that the most successful aspect of this book is its ability to portray an image in my mind. Though Bradbury's vivid expressions, I could picture the scenes in the book. Bradbury used figurative language as the paintbrush to construct the image. Personification, metaphor, and similes were extensively utilized. In the first page of the book, every sentence contained figurative speech. For example, through Bradbury's magical use of language in &quot;With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world&quot; (P. 1 lines 2-4), I could very clearly portray a fireman holding the hose with kerosene coming out like a python spitting it's poison. This does not solely portray an image; it also leaves a strong memory, and impression afterwards. Through the use of these powerful and impressive words, Bradbury carved an everlasting image in my heart. I especially adore the quote &quot;He strode in a swarm of fire flies&quot; This effectively produces a complete image in my mind of Montag happily walking through a bunch of burning ashes. The &quot;swarm of fire flies&quot; really produces an everlasting powerful image.Another reason I gave this book five stars is that I thought it was not just an entertaining and poignant book, it was also a book that moved and influenced me as well as triggered me to contemplate about the presence and the importance of knowledge and books. The first time I read it, I could not understand it, so I read it again. After the second time reading it, I was stimulated to ponder about the significance of knowledge. I felt very deeply that controlling knowledge through the destruction of books is extremely inappropriate. I very powerfully felt that books were important to us in our daily lives, and that every one of them has value, and they should be kept and treasured. My emotions changed from detached to extremely motivated. I felt that this book really portrayed a very different world, such that books are absent. Through indirect speech, Bradbury has really moved and changed my views. I thought this book was both very thought provoking, enjoyable, and very well done. I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" has some very interesting ideas, but they get bungled in the execution. The book was written in the 1950's and takes place in the unspecified future. Books are now illegal and no one learns to read more than is absolutely necessary. The world is in a constant state of war, but drugs and mindless T.V. programs keep most people pacified.The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman. But firemen no longer put out fires; they start them to burn books and the houses that harbor them. (Because there is no written history, very few people are aware that this was not always so.) Montag meets an intriguing teenage neighbor, Clarice, who challenges him to think and not conform to society. This leads him to reexamine his life, and his relationship with his dull and placid wife. Montag is also troubled by a conversation with an old man about a year earlier. Though he was sure this man was harboring books, he never turned him in. Finally, Montag steals one of the books he is supposed to burn. He dreams of collecting books and sharing them with everyone willing to listen.What's good in this book are the theoretical ideas: the sheer horror of the society being depicted (it's like a less complex \\"Brave New World\\"), and the image of thousands of people memorizing books so they can keep the words alive. Here we see that books are not paper and ink, but living words that start with one person but can touch everybody. This is what makes them so potentially dangerous.Although the book is very involving, and reads quickly, I was dissatisfied with some aspects of the plot. Montag's conversion was much too quick. If that was all it took, why weren't there millions of others like him? He doesn't come across as an unusually bright man. Also, I think the ending of the book is rushed.A minor complaint: The 50th anniversary Ballentine edition is riddled with typos, which should be unacceptable in a commemorative volume."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"&quot;If they give you ruled paper, write the other way.&quot;-Juan Ramon JimenezIt is truly amazing how a person, different in any way from his peers, can be so the same. The year is somewhere in the 21st century and Guy Montag is a fireman--whose job it is to set fires instead of putting them out. The government of the time has professed a law which makes reading or merely owning a book illegal and the punishment? The books are burned along with your house and all of your belongings. Censorship and conformity are on an uprise in this world and Guy is right in the center. T That is until Clarisse, a girl who calls herself &quot;17 and crazy&quot;, tells him of a past where people were not afraid to be themselves. With the motivation Clariss gives him and the help of Faber, a once upon a time english professor, Guy plans on telling the world the truth about the books the government will not allow them to read. Fahrenheit 451 is a book filled with suspense and multiple plot twist that keep you reading until the very last page."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's 1950's sci fi classic presents a plot frequent in futuristic tales: the rebellion of the protagonist against the mind-numbing status quo. Fireman Guy Montag knew the pleasure and psychological rush he experienced while burning books; it was privilege to ride the Dragon, to bear the Salamander emblem on his clothing. He delighted in destroying remnants of a previous era, when people foolishly believed and reacted to the printed word. Seeking ever more speed, noise and violence to substitute for lack of intellectual and emotional stimulus, this culture has become shallow, enjoying superficial interactions and slavish obedience to mass mentality. This was a disposable society, where the government manipulated war and city officials doctored the news--to keep an audience or merely save face.But Montag gradually realizes his own dis-ease, as doubts creep into his mind; he begins to stash forbidden books in a secret chache, and to seriously consider the ideas of the school girl next door, whose family has been watched and labeled as antisocial for years. It is very dangerous for an individual to question or defy the prescribed pattern for Happiness, as dictated by mass media techniques. Was there some secret--vital to mankind's happiness and peace of mind--hidden within those scorned and banned books? Could one man save civilization from its own misgudied zeal? This gripping tale (under 150 pages) depicts a society gone amuck; RB provides many serious themes for thoughtful readers of all ages to digest.The 1968 film, though inevitably different from the original, is also a powerful statement. I saw it as a student in Italy. While walking home from the theatre, my companion remarked grimly: &quot;Nobody's getting My books!&quot; It made us realize that we should not take books for granted or ever underestimate the power of the written word."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a novel that tells of a very grim, yet very likely future where books are burned, not to be read. But the novel is much more than that. There is more depth to it than a simple dystopian novel. It really is a warning to a future where TV and Film surpass reading ten fold as a prominent form of entertainment. It's not just the prophetic style that makes this a great read; It's also Bradbury's superior writing. The characters of Guy Montag, Clarisse McClellan, and Faber the Philosopher jump from the pages as you read. You will not want to put this novel down, and there are too many things to be said about this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm 54 years old and I am reading this for the first time ever...on my Kindle.

Its place in literary history is assured with good reason. That Mr. Bradbury so accurately pinpointed that censorship would get out of control is only matched by Orwell.But Bradbury has been resisting the ebook format, stating that he prefers the old fashioned book, with its smells and textures of pages. I understand that and I prefer to hold an old fashioned book myself. But books allow us to have so many titles at our fingertips at a time that they have become invaluable. And now he has allowed this jewel to be the first of his novels to be in this format.I can only hope that his short story collection is next. It is very thick and quite heavy to take outside the home to read; then again, we need all his books in e-format...all his books can be considered classics."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This was actually purchased for a friend of mine as I still have my original copy from when I was a kid along with a first edition I picked up on eBay. This is the book that first started my interest in my favorite genre of science fiction, dystopia. Ray Bradbury's story behind this book is almost as amazing as the book is in itself. I'm not going to go into it, but Google it sometime. This book is written about a world in which houses no longer burn and censorship is rampant. Because of these two issues, firemen eventually become part of the government censorship and burn books. This novel is a short read but it leaves you feeling changed. This is in my top 5 books of all time and will always be on my shelf."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"So I finally got around to reading Fahrenheit 451 and all I can say is that it's one heck of a book. Bradbury's dystopian tale of disenfranchised \\"fireman\\" Guy Montag is so spot on in some places, I had to do a re-read. The book was published in 1953 but some of the depictions are eerily current. For example, Montag's wife, Mildred, spends her days gorked out on TV from the three wall installed sets in their house. She says: \\"It will be even more fun when we can afford to have the fourth wall installed. How long you figure before we save up and get the fourth wall torn out and a fourth wall-TV put in? It's only two thousand dollars.\\" (p. 20)Sounds a lot like a plasma screen to me.When Mildred entertains her friends, the talk turns to children. One woman, Mrs. Bowles, says: \\"I've had two children by Caesarian section. No use going through all that agony for a baby. The world must reproduce, you know, the race must go on. Besides, they sometimes look just like you, and that's nice. Two Caesarians turned the trick, yes, sir. Oh, my doctor said, Caesarians aren't necessary; you've got the hips for it, everything's normal, but I insisted.\\" (p. 96).Isn't there a growing trend for elective Caesarians these days?The references get eerier when Montag talks of anti-American sentiment: \\"Is it because we're having so much fun at home we've forgotten the world? Is it because we're so rich and the rest of the world's so poor and we just don't care if they are? I've heard rumors; the world is starving, but we're well fed. Is it true, the world works hard and we play? Is that why we're hated so much?\\" (p. 74).I shivered when I read Bradbury's description of a hotel about to be flattened by a bomb \\"that was an inch, now a half inch, now a quarter inch from the top of the hotel\\" It was an image of 9/11 all over again, those horrific moments before the towers were struck. Montag's estranged wife is in the hotel. He imagines her looking up at the \\"ceiling as it and the entire structure of the hotel blasted down upon her, carrying her with a million pounds of brick, metal, plaster, and wood, to meet other people in the hives below, all on their quick way down to the cellar where the explosion rid itself of them in is own unreasonable way.\\"It's a sickening, visceral description and Bradbury nails it.I only hope he's wrong about the rest of it; that firemen start fires instead of put them out; that reading is a capital crime; that entertainment is a televised manhunt in which the unfortunate victim is dispatched by a diabolical mechanical hound.Bradbury is brilliant. The book is chilling. It's on a lot of reading lists. I wouldn't be surprised to find it on the list of banned books. If Bradbury is right, the future's coming and it isn't pretty. But there are survivors, men and women who are charged with remembering, who are living chapters of books that no longer exist.So maybe there is hope, too."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montague, a fireman in Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, can't imagine anything better than watching books burn, the pages blacken and crumble. Guy's world is a futuristic America where firemen burn instead of extinguish and where books are illegal. Books will offend some people, so they all burn. As Beaty, the Fire Captain, explains so bluntly, \\"We can't have our minorities upset and stirred. Ask yourself, What do we want in this country, above all? People want to be happy... Don't we keep them moving, don't we give them fun? That's all we live for isn't it?\\" And they do. Their world is all about entertainment, the faster and more they get, the better. Guy is compelled to ponder his world after meeting a young, seventeen-year-old girl, who actually watches and thinks about the world, and then she disappears.Bradbury's skill with words steers you effortlessly through the gripping story. I sincerely enjoyed reading this book. I could not put it down and after I finished it I wanted to start over to pick up on the details that I was sure I had missed. I would recommend this book to anyone willing to think. However, because of its depth, less experienced and younger readers may struggle with understanding and grasping the authors message and purpose.Even after fifty-eight years, Fahrenheit 451 still retains a prophetic bite that makes you stop and contemplate our own world's direction. It leaves you considering your own life and where you are allowing it to go. Hopefully enough people will stop for a moment and care, or we will end up in the same shallow world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The beauty within Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 comes from how it begs you to look at the world around you. The futuristic society depicted by Bradbury in the 1950's is almost frightening because of how closely it resembles the world that we live in now. We have filled our lives with technology and arguably have become more removed from society than ever before. Instead of sitting on the porch and conversing while watching the sunset or listening to crickets we tend to turn our television sets and let the propaganda and the garbage be forced down our gullets. This book opens your eyes and paints the picture of a very feasible and very scary future and it forces you to be aware of what is happening around us.I have read positive reviews from people who love this book and also reviews from those that think it is an overrated piece of garbage. When forging my own opinion of this book I look at the messages that Bradbury seems to be trying to convey and how well he does that. I have found that the most acclaimed message in the book is that propaganda and technology are poison to the human mind. The book creates a world where human beings have been hollowed out by these things and have become nothing more than automated drones seeking only entertainment - and to be free from worry and woe. Bradbury has said that the theme of his book is that television takes away the desire for people to read and appreciate literature.Aside from the previously mentioned theme - I feel that the most spectacular part of this read is the satirical society that Ray Bradbury has created. I feel the message goes further than television eats away at your mind. I found that the most significant message in the story is that technology as a whole is dangerous to us. The book illustrates how technology has people moving faster and faster and becoming detached from each other (comparable to real life). People in the society only care about what is on television, or about driving a 100 Miles Per Hour, or going to amusement parks. Families are not close-knit; people send their children away to school and never really know them. It seems that every person in the world around the main characters are completely empty and do not care about the well being of anyone. This is one of the most interesting points of analysis that I have found in this book. Comparing this to how people are becoming in real life. It is almost hard to admit how similar our world is to the horrible place from Bradbury's imagination.I cannot say that this is the greatest book that I have ever read, but I did really enjoy it. Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most thought provoking stories that I have ever read. I find it to be extremely interesting from cover to cover. It is a book that you can read several times and come away with different ideas and messages each time."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I really loved this book. I'm sure the average reader will, too. Bradbury's prose is rich in metaphors and images and most of all, you capture his intent and feeling that he perfectly places in every moment of the book.The world the book is set it is ironically similar to ours today, and I find it kind of funny how Mildred is so incredibly similar to some people I know myself.Science Fiction is a label and this book is more of a homily. It's an important read because it asks so many questions...how does Our America compare to his?Read this book and decide for yourself...are you in progress and on track to being in a \\"parlor family\\" or are you curious enough to learn and love the World we live in."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenheit 451 is a dystopian novel where a Firemans job is not to put out fires but to burst into peoples homes like cops on a drug raid , find their books and then burn them. I thought this was a good book but not on the level of some of my favorite dystopian novels like 1984, Brave New World, Camp of the Saints, The Iron Heel,or even some of HG Wells or Phillip K. Dicks work for their predictive see I told you so qualities."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The story is simple, but powerful. As other reviewers have noted, some of the details that Bradbury imagined in 1950 (when he wrote it, not the publication date of 1953) have come true (large TVs on the walls, a move towards simplistic sensationalism, the deep distrust of education and educated people, etc.) I found the writing to be serviceable, sometimes brilliant. Occasionally the metaphors get too long winded and overly descriptive.The 50th Anniversary Edition, published by Ballantine Books/Del Rey is wonderful. Not only do we get the full unedited text (ironically, this book about censorship has been censored frequently over the years), but we also get the afterword and coda (added in the late 70s, early 80s) and an illuminating 10 page interview with Bradbury himself. In the interview he describes his writing process, how he thinks the book holds up today, and whether or not he'd write a sequel. It's a great addition to the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Length:: 3:49 MinsFahrenheit 451Fahrenheit 451: A Novel"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Though i wasn't a big fan of the sci-fi stuff, this book is changed my outlook on such readings, and it made me go out and buy Orwell's \\"1984\\".

Now if burning books is the type of book you like to read about then this is the perfect book for you. While reading this book you will learn about censorship and how important it is in socity today. Guy Montag who was the main character has issues weather burning books is good or not, although he is one of the firemen who burns the books.

I go to a school in Maine and I am in eighth grade. I read this book for an honors English class. I am not a really big fan of reading because I find it to be extremely boring and useless. In fact the only reason I am writing this review is because I am being forced to. This book was one of the better books that I have been forced to read over my school career. There have been some pretty horribly boring books than I have been forced to read but this one isn't that bad. In fact it is a somewhat exciting book. I would recommend this book to a student that is being made to read a book that is like this or if this book is on one of there book lists. This book was somewhat good. I am not really sure what I think about it. The book was very confusing and I found it hard to read. Now that I think about it this book was not very good. I can see why they wanted to burn books in this book because I wasn't a very big fan of this book. It was very confusing and hard to believe and a little to old. I recommend this book for people that are old enough to understand it. In my opinion this book was an OK book but for certain people."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was in a hurry to get this book for a class project for my daughter.

BRADBURY EXPRESSES HIS OWN OPINIONS OPENLY AND I LIKED THE FACT THAT IT WAS SOMEWHAT BIASED. THE TOPIC IS A LITTLE OUT OF THE ORDINARY, HOWEVER, IT IS IN THE GENRE OF DISUTOPIAN NOVEL. RAY KEPT ME INTERESTED AND I COULD NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT THE TEMPO OF THE BOOK. OVERALL, THIS WAS A FAIRLY INTERESTING BOOK WITH SOMEWHAT OF AN ODD THEME, BUT A GENERALLY GOOD READING EXPERIENCE."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 ReviewI am doing my review on the book \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" by Ray Bradbury. This story takes place in the United States in the distant future on the brink of another war. The main character of this story is named Guy Montag. Montag is a third generation fireman, which means that instead of trying to put out fires, his job is to start them. Books have been outlawed and anyone in possession of one can be punished by law. The fireman's job is to go around and respond to calls about reported book sightings and burn them. Due to the lack of books, the entire nation has turned completely to television and radio. Montag had been completely happy with his life until he met Clarisse McClellan, a peculiar seven-teen year old girl. Clarisse opens Montag eyes to the beauty of the simple things in life such as nature. Clarisse asked Montag the question, \\"are you happy?\\" This caused Montag to realize that he was not at all happy or satisfied with his life. Clarisse was killed by a speeding car soon after. Montag's problems increase when his wife, Mildred Montag, attempts to kill herself with sleeping pills, and when Montag was attempting to persuade an old lady to leave the house that they were going to burn, the lady started herself on fire and burned alive. Montag begins to try and turn to books for answers, but is unable to make sense of them. For this reason he turns to Faber, an English professor who, Mildred knows, has a strong passion for his books. Mildred decides to plant books in the houses of fellow firemen so to discredit the reputation of the profession. Later at work Mildred receives a call, which is made from his house. His wife had betrayed him and his boss, Captain Beatty, forced him to burn down his house. After he did this, Mildred was going to be arrested, so instead of going quietly he turned on his boss with his flamethrower and burnt him alive. After knocking out the rest of the police force that was present and destroying the mechanical hound Mildred had to run. Faber told him how to evade the new mechanical hound and that he should follow the railroad tracks until he finds the hobo intellectuals. Mildred successfully reaches the intellectuals and meets their leader Granger. Granger explains that the intellectuals are a group of book lovers that are all over the country and they hope to help mankind with their knowledge in the aftermath of the war. Shortly after enemy fighters flew in and dropped their bombs and nearly incinerated the entire city. One particular thing that I appreciated was the comment that Granger made about human kind where he compares human kind to a phoenix, and says that they keep rising up from their own ashes. Overall, I felt that this was a fairly good book. It definitely has some action pact scenes, but what I also enjoyed was that the whole idea that TV, radio, computers, and other forms of media are in a way taking control of our lives. This argument can be made now days, even though not to that extreme. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in science fiction books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you are a high-school student, this would be a stunner, but to anyone with a little more life experience and a shred of political awareness, the book comes across as dated, patronizing and condescending."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The novel, Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, is about a man named Guy Montag who is a fireman. Unlike most ordinary firemen, he starts fires instead of puts them out. He burns books. If anyone in their town is caught with even only one book in their house, he comes and set the entire house on fire and lets it all burn to the ground. After a while he meets a girl and starts to fall in love with her. However, she likes books, and she reads them. So, he tries reading a book and he loves it. Then he stops burning them and instead he reads them while they live together. One time his boss came to his house while he was reading his book and he had to hide it. While he was talking his wife was cleaning and almost found the book.At first I thought that this was going to be a pretty good book. It might be kind of exciting, being about burning books and all. Since I personally hate reading then hearing about someone that burns books caught my attention. It turned out to be another boring book.This book would be better suited for older adults that like to read. Books that kids are required to read should be fun and exciting books not any of these boring books. There are plenty of books out there that would be much more interesting to read than the ones that we do read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book because i enjoyed the futuristic ideas in Bradbury's &quot;The Martian Chronicles.&quot; This novel was a good thoughtful book but a little too slow-paced. Fahrenheit 451 makes you really think about whether our government is controlling us or not."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Well, basically what happens without all the boring details is there is this guy named Montag and he is a fire fighter. The only thing is, the job of the fire fighter is to start the fires rather than putting them out. Well one day when he has to burn this old womens house it really hits him hard because she refuses to get out of her house before they light it on fire. So the firemen end up burning her house, the books that were in it, and the old lady. That made him think that there must have been something in those books worth dying for. Then he met this girl name Clarisse who made him start thinking even more. So he sort of came to the conclusion that he really did not enjoy doing what he did for a living."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I started to read this book I thought it was terrible. When I was halfway through I was warming to it. I thought about how a lot of Ray Bradbury's predictions have come true, and I geared myself up for a spectacular ending. Well, that ending never came. Bradbury finishes his book by leaving his main character, Montag, wandering aimlessly through the country, reciting books with some other men. Besides being terribly sexist, this book doesn't have much of a plot, and it leaves what little it has hanging at the end. For instance, my favorite character, Clarisse, disappears. Why doesn't Bradbury have something definite happen to her? It is hinted that she has been run over by a car, but the reader knows nothing specific. This book drove em nuts in its vagueness. You can't tell what are actual happenings in Montag's life, what are metaphors for other happenings, and what are simply Montag's imaginings. This book could be a well-loved book by some readers or a hated book by others. Or it could not have any definite spot in a reader's heart. I, personally, don't love it, but I don't hate it, either. I just don't care either way."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Okay,first off I would like to say that I enjoy almost any book I read. This book has made it to the top of my &quot;burn this book&quot; list. Dont get me wrong, the idea was well thought up, but the book wasn't well written. First off, the book starts off with someone trying to commit suicide,and this character is saved even though she's totally wack. Second, the main character is named &quot;GUY MONTAG&quot;. How origanal. Third, the people in this book are IDIOTS! I mean, first they outlaw all &quot;offensive&quot; material, then they condense great novels into two page stories,and then they sit around on thier butt all day watching the &quot;family&quot; argue and OFFEND each other. The best character in the book simply dissappears in the middle of the book, and then she is found dead. Not only that but no one has friends. Not even your spouse is your friend. What kind of wack society doesn't have friends. This book needs to be re-written, and seriously re-done"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As much as I love Ray Bradbury and all of his books, he should have the good sense to have an actor read Farenheit 451 -- Ray stumbles and mumbles his way through the book, to the point that his beautiful writing loses all it's power and grace. Can't recommend this version, although the last disc is a nice interview with Ray about his writing process."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I like futuristic stuff. I really do. But I like EXCITING futuristic stuff. I like interesting futuristic stuff. To me, this was just another book about censorship. Yes, sure, the issue of censorship is important. And it was especially important in the time that Bradbury was writing in. But hasn't it been beaten to the ground?Really, though, what I didn't like about this book came not from the message but from the writing style. It was a little overdescriptive for my personal preference. I like action, and it was more philosophical than action-packed.If you like this kind of censorship stuff, you'll love this book. I'm just not into it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This small book starts off nicely with a \\"Fireman\\" name Montag walking down the street. This takes place in the future where books are banned, and fireman set fires to houses with books. It's a world where the government controls everything, and people are content watching television. As Montag walks he encounters a strange girl. A inquisitive teenager who tends to slowly open Montag's eyes to the life that himself and the government has tried to prevent him from seeing.However, the book goes downhill from there. We later learn that the girl died, maybe or maybe not by the government. Then all forms of subtlety are thrown out the window. Montag burns a lady and her house down, but only after picking up a few books. He starts a conversation with a former literature professor, who discusses how the government and people disengaged themselves from the world of literature, and how to change their thinking. The worst part was when his fire chief enters his house and gives the typical bad guy expose to the good guy on what the government is trying to do. This dialogue is extremely forced and contrived and quickly bores the reader along while taking away much of the imagination of the what and why.He later kills that fireman and goes on the run after his house burns down, only to be left in a the countryside as a survivor, and tries to resurrect the world of books and open thinking. This again overtly ties into an over the top message on the good of literature and open-mindedness.For those who value subtlety and imagination, this book is not for you. While I respect and admire Bradbury's plot and perspective, it could have been done in a much more presentable, believable, thought provoking, and by far more engaging way."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read the book Fahrenheit 451 for English class and was not impressed with the way the story was written. In general, the book is about censorship. It is the story of a society where books are outlawed because the lead to conflicting points of view, offend minorities, and cause confusion. Firefighters have the job of finding 'criminals' who are hiding books in thier homes and burn the books.I found this book to be boring and unexciting. There was very little description and this led me to be confused about several parts of the book. A few of the repeated aspects of the story were never fully described which led me to be unsure of what exactly they were. For example, the seashell radio that Montag's wife Mildred uses. A little more description would have made me understand more clearly, what it did and said. I was also confused about what the 'family' was that Mildred and her friends were constantly watching on the wall. These details of the story made me lose interest in the book. I also think that the reason for banning books was not made extremely clear. More solid reasons should have been given, other than the vague explanations.Another fact that I found annoying was that houses were fireproofed in this society. That is why firemen as we know them were not needed any longer. Therefore, it seems to me that the firemen in the book should not have been able to burn the houses of the people hiding books.The most exciting and best part of the book came at the end when Montag had escaped from his old world and was living with intellectuals away from civilization. Montag and his new friends survive an attack during a war and set out to rebuild the world. Although this book ended better than it began, I do not recommend it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"this is very dissapointing, cause after all i heard about the book i thought it suppose to be a masterpiece, but after reading it i discoverd that the writing is very poor, the story is bery weak, and the plot is dull.i think the book lost most of it's taste - a similat book like 1984 is more prefferd to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is one of the best books I've ever read. I say this without skipping a beat. Like many people, I first read this book for school, and I fell in love with it. Fahrenheit 451 is an essential book for any reader, young or old. Bradbury did remarkable things with this little book, and I know I'll never feel the same way about censorship again.Fahrenheit 451, the temperature at which paper catches fire and burns, is a hauntingly appropriate title for this book. For a controlled and thoughtless society, the reading of books has been outlawed (note, the READING of books - a point in an important scene which Bradbury wrote but never placed into the book and can be read in the Afterward). Deep thoughts are discouraged, and the public instead recieves no more than what I sometimes call \\"on a platter\\" entertainment, such as the wall-to-wall television screens and miniature radios which are placed inside the ear to block out all other sound. Firemen are now paid to burn books and the houses in which they are hidden, to protect the society that books are believed to endanger.Like another favorite book of mine and also another very necessary book, Lord of the Flies, whos fiftieth anniversary passed last year with an unfortunate lack of recognition, Fahrenheit 451 takes place during a war in the outside world. Also Lord of the Flies, little light is shed on the subject of the war, although in Lord of the Flies it is often assumed that the war is World War II. But, as Mildred Montag and her friends know, \\"It's always somebody else's husband who dies.\\"Guy Montag is a fireman who, after meeting a young woman by the name of Clarisse McClellan, becomes disillusioned with the burning of books. Montag's life changes when a book falls into his possession and, needing to see what's in the tomes that are so forbidden, begins to read.As the book unfolds, Montag's metamorphosis is astounding. A pleased, fire-loving fireman becomes a curious reader and fledgling scholar, becomes a man determined to do something about the dangers of book-burning, no matter the cost.The book is not only a good book, an important book, but also a NECESSARY book, an IMPORTANT book, which I think everyone should read. I highly recommend Fahrenheit 451 and Lord of the Flies, both excellent and thought-provoking novels which will capture the interest of those willing to think."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's prophecy of a distant (or not so distant) future is essential reading in these times of self-censorship through the dumbing-down of the national dialogue. The story seems to peter out at the end, but as a plot device it succintly allows for the discussion of numerous topics that have 'come true', at least nearer to true than the time of the original publication. For instance, listen to Beatty's history of book-burning that encapsulates a media-saturation and political sensitivity (p. 54). Or perhaps you're intrigued by the dead-on Hubris Americana Montag bemoans in the post-war period (p. 74)? Faber's recollection of a Jesus before merchandising rings as a true indictment of the modern church (p. 81) - and his threefold explanation for the importance of books (quality of ideas, leisure to think, and freedom to act on the preceding two on p. 83) should be carefully considered by all of us as we rip through our reading lists. This book delivers an impact, and is well-worth the read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Not to be confused with fahrenheit 9/11, Fahrenheit 451 is the classic dystopian tale of rebbelion and the invasion of media in our private lives.It is the story of Montag, a fireman who burns books. He loves his job, until one day he meets Clarrisse. Clarrisse is a seventeen year old girl in love with life, in a society so desperate to escape life that it never notices its many wonders. In Montag's world, billboards have to be 200 feet long so that people will notice them. The walls of Montag's home have giant television screens that his wife spends all her time watching. The walls don't tell stories, they just give people feelings.Montag accepts all this until Clarrisse comes out of the blue to shed a new light on everything. She tells him about grass having dew on it in the morning, about the blue sky, and he changes. Slowly, but he does go through a change.Bradbury's writing has been accused by some reviewers as dull. I found his writing insightful, and very interesting. One of the many fascinating things about these amazon reviews is that there are large groups of people who find that the writing was too slow, completely disregarding how writing styles create mood. But amazon has created an environment where anyone can write their opinions. If you really want to know how good this book is, read both the best and worst reviews. Then, if you find that the good outweighs the bad, at least in your mind, then read the novel. Afterwards, you should try reading the reviews that are most contrary to your personal opinion.To reiterate, Breadbury is a genuine genius, he should be commended, this novel is a masterpiece, and you should check out the worst reviews for this book for further intellectual stimulation."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Prior to reading the book Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, I knew nothing about the book other than it was considered a classic by mane Some how I managed to work my way out of reading the book all through high school and it has always been on my list to read. So I decided to choose the book for our semester independent reading project, and I am glad I did.This science fiction novel expressed the natural occurring communism in a futuristic setting. Interestingly, the books setting could easily be believed to portray our world one hundred years ago. The reality of the book is somewhat depressing in that it actually is a lot closer to the truth than we would like to believe. Books have not been banned yet, but many schools across our country are not aloud to use certain classic novels in their teachings. And maybe we are not under a mind control because of the banning of books, however our sources for entertainment operate on mind control and there are ads for just about anything surrounding our lives.This novel does indeed deserve the literary merit I has received over the past years. The novel itself steers away from descriptive science fiction and into a more dreamy approach, which leaves more imagination on the readers' part. One of the overriding themes of novel is knowledge vs. Ignorance, which the main character Guy deals with the entire novel. He must decide whether to continue to read books and continue to gain knowledge, or to just be happy like everyone else and continue to be ignorant. Ray Bradbury's novel is quite intriguing and a very quick read. I recommend this book to everyone before entering the college level, for it is a classic which has been read for over 50 years."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was one of the best books I've ever read. I had to read it in high school and I'm glad for it. Bradbury's vision of the future is shockingly similar to our own society now. Sure we're not burning books, but many of us would prefer to be entertained by watching television than reading a book. This vision is also a future where censorship has replaced free press, shying the people about the disturbing world events taking place. Since this book was written in 1953, many would think that Bradbury's vision of this future would have been proven wrong over time but to this day school districts are banning certain books, such as this one, for what ideas they might express.This book is about a possible future where books are outlawed and firemen are given the job to set them ablaze. The story is centered on one particular fireman named Guy Montag who after meeting a seventeen year old girl and an old professor, decides to join the struggle to preserve books before they are wiped out forever."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury has twisted imagination, fears, thoughts and a quick lesson together to capture our senses and keep us turning the pages!There is a certain depth to this book that is unreachable to anyone unless they are willing to dive beneath the surface to get it. Not only do the characters have feelings and thoughts; but all around the words are the feelings and sceneries that only the imagination can take in. What is actually shocking to realize is that our [country] is turning into exactly what this book says! No...were not burning books, but our entertainment and media has started controling our minds to thinking anything hard is not worth doing.Bradbury has taken all our thoughts and fears on the future and taken to writing them down into a book. Fascinating as it is, its only our fear that our society could actually turn into this nightmare."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was a real page turner. It had a certain depth to it, one that could not be reached unless the reader was willing to dive beneath the surface to get it. It had so much information packed into a good adventure, it really taught [me] to appreciate the books we have today and that we can enjoy learning at the same time as finding the lesson taught inside it. Not many books have the same perspective as Fahrenheit 451. Not only did the main character have feelings that could be seen, but all around the words were different emotions and settings in them that made you feel like you were there, and it was so creatively written it made you think harder than most books normally do. Ray Bradbury knew what he was writing so well it flowed like thoughts, and he had the same thoughts as most of us do. But he kept them in these pages for us to read now and in the future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I think the author wrote this book to tell people, who read this book, that it is necessary to bend or break rules once in a while. I agree because if you live your life always following the rules, and not making mistakes, you kind of get used to being perfect. You have to make mistakes and do something wrong once in a while. Break out of the shell and live your life curiously.I think Ray Bradbury handled setting the best because if you read this book correctly, you would figure out that the setting explains everything that happens. I love the way he uses bunches and bunches of personification, similes, metaphors, imagery and many other figurative languages.This book is science fiction. It's good because he uses so much imagery that you can literally see what the setting looked like and see what they were talking about. Some details in his book are for sure ficton but the way he described the government and the fire department is really, really unique. Ray Bradbury is an excellent author with a good imagination.I don't think the book is less than perfect because he makes the book reals and you wouldn't want to change something so realistic. I'm not saying that the setting is real, like today, but he tells you. No. He shows you how real the city is. Once you read it, you wouldn't want to change anything. I recommend this book if you love science fiction or fantasy books, you will fall in love with this book and the author."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am currently doing a research project for my sophomore project in my Honors English class. Part of the project is to read a book the author has written. My teacher told me about Fahrenheit 451 and told me that I should read this one. I didn't really know much about this book before she refered it to me. The opening page sucked me in and now that I have finished the book, it makes me wonder if society will ever turn out this way. It is amazing how Bradbury \\"predicts\\" the future with some of the events in his book. After reading this book I have so far brought the movie, and the movie The Martian Chronicles. I also want to read the book. For a teenager in high school who doesn't like to read, I'm hooked!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I taught \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" as the example of a dsytopian novel in my Science Fiction class, although it is certainly one of the most atypical of that particular type of narrative discourse. Compared to such heavyweight examples as George Orwell's \\"1984,\\" Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World,\\" Yevgeny Zamiatin's \\"We,\\" Ray Bradbury's imaginative meditation on censorship seems like light reading. But the delicious irony of a world in which firemen start fires remains postent and the idea of people memorizing books so they will be preserved for future generations is compelling. Of course, there have been more documented cases of \\"book burning,\\" albeit in less literal forms, since \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was first published in 1953, so an argument can be made that while all the public debate was over how close we were the Orwellian future envisioned in \\"1984,\\" it is Bradbury's little parable that may well be more realistic (especially in terms of the effects of television).The novel is based on a short story, \\"The Fireman,\\" that Bradbury published in \\"Galaxy Science Fiction\\" in 1951 and then expanded into \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" two years later. However, those who have studied Bradbury's writings caw trace key elements back to a 1948 story \\"Pillar of Fire\\" and the \\"Usher II\\" story from his 1950 work \\"The Martian Chronicles.\\" Beyond that, there is the historical record of the Nazis burning books in 1933. The story is of a future world in which everyone understands that books are for burning, along with the houses in which they were hidden. Guy Montage is a fireman who has been happy in his work for ten years, but suddenly finds himself asking questions when he meets a teenage girl and an old professor.\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is not only about censorship, but also about the inherent tension in advanced societies between knowledge and ignorance. Reading this novel again I am reminded about Pat Paulsen's editorial on the old \\"Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\\" (a series well acquainted with the perils of censorship) about how we might enjoy freedom of speech in this country but we do not enjoy freedom of hearing because \\"there is always the danger of something being said.\\" Censorship, in practical terms, is the effort of those who do not want others to hear what they find offensive, for whatever reasons, basically because it leads to people thinking thoughts they do not want them to be thinking. Through the rambling diatribes of Captain Beatty, Bradbury makes this point quite clear to his readers.Even though this is essentially a novella, Bradbury's work retains the charm of a short story. The recurring use of animal imagery throughout the story, the use of the mythic ideas of the salamander and the phoenix, make \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" more poetic than any other dystopian work. Even if it is predominantly a one note argument regarding censorship, it is impossible to deny that Bradbury makes a clear and convincing case for his position. Besides, there is something to be said for any work that insures that beyond the point at which water freezes the only other recognizable number on the Fahrenheit scale is the point at which book paper starts to burn."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Throughout \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" I had a mixture of feelings running through my head. For the most part, I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys futuristic novels. However, there were a few parts that I disliked and would like to tell anyone about before they read it.The beginning of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" starts very suddenly. The author sticks you right in the middle of the story it seems. I very much disliked how the book started for this reason and this reason only. I felt as if I started reading the book in the middle and missed the introduction of what was going on and whom everyone was. The only positive side of this abrupt start to the book is that it definitely doesn't start out slow. This made the book a pretty easy read.The only other parts that I didn't like so much were the ending, and the character Mildred, Montag's wife. I didn't like Mildred very much because she just seemed like a shady character. When the book started off by her trying to commit suicide, that event turned my sympathy for her away. I just think that there should have been more background or more to the story line that had to do with her seeing as how she was the main character's wife. Then, there was the ending. I really didn't like how this ended because, like in the beginning, I felt like it just ended. The story, to me, had not quite been finished yet.Finally, the main parts that I enjoyed throughout the book! The main reason this book interested me was because I had heard such great things about it. My favorite part was the way the setting was created. Originally written as a futuristic novel, Ray Bradbury was putting his ideas of how the future, or what is now present day, would be like. I also liked how easy it was to read. I love it when books get more interesting the further in you read, and \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is definitely one of them. I also enjoyed seeing where Montag's plan would lead him next or what it would cause him to do."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read Fahrenheit 451 five years ago, having bought it as an introduction to a book club, and to this day I can't remember any of the other books I bought with Fahrenheit 451, only this one magical book. Ray Bradbury is well-known as a sci-fi author, and even as a legend in literature, and I'm a believer that 451 is his best. It's subtitle describes perfectly the premise of the story: \\"The tempature at which book paper catches fire and burns...\\"It is a haunting book, filled with strange machinery that you realize during your reading you'd hate to see invented. For those of you who love books like me or even the American Constitution, this book will have extra meaning, as it's about censorship to the extreme. In fact, Fahrenheit 451 would be one of the books burned first had it been in this book. Another aspect of this novel is its description of a human's need to preserve our freedoms, and the drastic ways in which this is done. Imagine, human books.This book is relavent to today's world, as some censorship is slowly leaking into our society. A very important read indeed, and I'd recommend it not only as a sci-fi classic but also as an American classic."}]`),q={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},j={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],S={key:0},H={key:1};function W(n,e,s,c,r,i){const y=m("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",j,[(t(!0),a(f,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,w)=>(t(),b(y,{key:w,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",H,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",S,"See more"))],8,x)):p("",!0)])}const C=u(q,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-3fa1e765"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/37.md","filePath":"glossary/37.md"}'),E={name:"glossary/37.md"},O=Object.assign(E,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[k(C)]))}});export{G as __pageData,O as default};
