Very pragmatic.good show guys. I think we are alone in this little slice of time."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This book is attractively produced and the topics are well organised and well presented. I enjoyed reading it, although I disagree with the authors' premise.The authors' basic thesis is that (1) extraterrestial microbial life is probably common, and (2) extraterrestrial intelligent life is probably rare, if not unique to Earth. Their first conclusion is based largely on the existence of extremophiles, organisms that can survive extremely hostile conditions. Their second conclusion is based on anthropic principle type arguments, many of which have been discussed in earlier works by other authors.Ward &amp; Brownlee are committed to the dogma of naturalism. They admit that &quot;conditions on the early Earth would have been in many ways horrific for natural 'chemistry' experiments involving reactions that now routinely take place in what we humans call 'room temperature'. ... For example, with an oxygen-free atmosphere the amount of ultraviolet radiation reaching Earth's surface would have been far higher than today, making delicate chemical reactions on the planet's surface very difficult.&quot; But because &quot;we know that life did arise ... &quot;, they therefore conclude that it must have arisen by naturalistic processes, without any intelligent input.The section on the origin of archaebacteria, and the evolution from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and metazoans are highly speculative. Some difficulties are mentioned and then ignored (as the above). Others are just ignored. For instance, natural selection could not have acted on the simple precursors of prebiotic chemical systems, since they had no survival traits to select until they had reached a minimal level of complexity.Extremophiles also argue against natural selection. Tardigrades are tiny invertebrates that can survive extreme conditions created in laboratories (e.g. extremely high X-ray intensity and hydrostatic pressures, temperatures near to absolute zero, etc.). These conditions far exceed any Earth environment in the history of life, and therefore such hardy traits could not have come about by natural selection.The authors argue for a two-stage development in the evolution of animal life. The second stage is the well-known Cambrian Explosion. This was preceded by an earlier stage involving animals that had differentiated body plans, but were too small to found in the fossil record. This first stage is inferred from the molecular clock. Ward &amp; Brownlee admit that the assumption underlying a molecular clock (that genes mutate at a constant rate) is a matter of &quot;fierce debate&quot;, and that &quot;The Wray group's findings were extremely controversial&quot;. Nevertheless this is conveniently brushed aside when they conclude that &quot;The Wray work confirms that there were indeed two 'explosion'&quot;.The interesting role of plate tectonics in making Earth a suitable environment for life is described at length. The tacit assumption is that conditions that are necessary for life to exist, are also sufficient for life to originate - a giant leap of faith!Stanley Miller's view that &quot;the time necessary to go from soup to bugs may have been far less than 10 million years&quot; is quoted with approval. All this by blind natural mechanisms, when the untiring combined efforts of the world's best minds in biochemistry, sustained over many decades, has come nowhere near to creating the simplest life form from scratch! It seems that when people cease to believe in the Creator, they can believe the most unlikely stories."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"The authors theorize that because primitive life apparently (based on scientific evidence) began early in the earth's history that it is likely universal (and may have bounced around from Mars to earth). Once they accept this as a given the rest of the book is about how many factors are uniquely involved to accomodate complex life.This approach glosses over two critical issues.(1) All life on earth is based on the genetic code right down to 'simple' (structurally) viruses (from this point of view it is 'universal'; i.e. all life as we know it). The DNA and RNA processes of the genome are far too complex to arise spontaneously, whether here or from Mars. Modern science suggests that there must be a prebiotic evolution with a DNA precursor. The authors mention a number of theories including the popular \\"RNA World\\" theory where the RNA performed all of the necessary functions. However no one has successfully modeled this so it is only a hypothesis bordering on pure speculation. RNA specialist Gerald Joyce has gone so far as to say \\"The most reasonable assumption is that life did not start with RNA...The transition to an RNA world, like the origins of life in general, is fraught with uncertainty and is plagued by a lack of experimental data.\\" The authors' distinction between 'simple' and 'complex' life from a scientific viewpoint is misguided. The critical first step or 'prebiotic phase' is so far unexplainable and applies to all life. As the authors of a recent unpublished paper (available on the web like many articles) state \\"The information crisis in prebiotic or chemical evolution stems essentially from two observations: (i) the length of a replicating polymer (i.e. RNA-like template) is limited by the replication accuracy per nucleotide, and (ii) templates that differ significantly from each other cannot coexist in a purely competitive setup. Realistic estimates of the error rate of primitive replication mechanisms predict too scanty information content per template - less than 100 nucleotides - to permit the complete codification of the mechanism in just one template.\\"(2) The earth clearly evolved over time from an original molten mass so one might well expect that as it cooled and water formed that more structurally complex life evolved with it (even if the prebiotic phase is universal). For those interested in the evolution they would be better educated by a book on Evolutionary Dynamics that does not, by a bunch of 'hand waving', spend time speculating about the qualitative effects of the moon on tides and Jupitor on asteroids. There is lots of science on the evolution of complexity and how it can work as opposed to not work. This is not to deny that life in the universe maybe very rare, but this is apparent from our telescopes and the very complexity of the much misunderstood first prebiotic steps. However the inference that these first steps can be taken for granted is not science."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"I don't own and I haven't read the book but I agree with the authors that &quot;... while simple, microbial life will be very widespread in the universe, complex animal or plant life will be extremely rare.&quot;I would just like to make a simple change in the sentence, adding &quot;,as we know,&quot; after the second word &quot;life&quot;, so that it would read:&quot;...while simple, microbial life will be very widespread in the universe, complex animal or plant life, as we know, will be extremely rare.&quot;Why isn't the History of Science a good lesson to scientists as to the fact that man's perception of reality is in continuous evolution?

They rely on evolution and all the things that have to fall into place for evolution to happen. They talk about the many catastrophic extinctions that have happened during earth's history, but still there was supposedly enough time for evolution to happen. They even spend a whole chapter trying to explain the away the Cambrian Explosion and it's bad implications for evolution, but to no avail. All this, even though there is no scientific proof - from the fossil record to biochemistry - that evolution could be the process by which life formed and then diversified in the first place. Another thing about this book that is intriguing is how they talk so often about all the 'amazing coincidences' that had to happen in order for Earth to be able to support complex life. Earth \\"just happened\\" to be in the habitable zone in the solar system, plate tectonics \\"just happened\\" to develop, the atmosphere \\"just happened\\" to be just the right composition, the moon \\"just happened\\" to be just the right size, and so on. There are actually currently 118 factors that have to be fine tuned - some cannot vary by more than one part in 10^37 - in order for life to exist at all. As scientists, one would think the authors could see that they should take all those factors into consideration, and then they might come to the realization that the likelihood of all those factors coming together at just the right places and times by chance alone is absolutely zero. However, maybe they don't like the implications. As other people have already pointed out, Hugh Ross has been making this point for years in his books \\"The Creator and the Cosmos\\" and \\"The Genesis Question.\\" Maybe now that secular scientists have finally realized what Christian scientists have been saying for a long time, people will listen.Other than that, there is some great information in this book. The chapters on habitable zones, plate tectonics, and the importance of the moon and Jupiter to life are fantastic, and contain a lot of good information written in a way that a non scientist can understand. Overall, a very interesting read, and a real eye-opener for those who have always assumed that there is life elsewhere in the universe."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"I am somewhat concerned about the authors' motives were in writing this book. I wonder how one gets to &quot;The Rare Earth Hypothesis&quot; if one does not already have preconceived notions about the rarity of life in the universe. The authors think that if anything were different in our solar system life on Earth would not have evolved. What they have presented here is nothing new. This argument is an old hat. You need the right kind of sun, and big gaseous outer planets to vacuum up debris, a moon to provide a shield, and water. This is an old argument. But here it has become a religious argument. Once the rise of complex life becomes exceedingly improbable, special creation becomes more probable. That is the point that they are driving home, even if it is not said explicitly. People want to read that &quot;chance&quot; could not have created life, and this book offers a warm and fuzzy feeling to those people. Surely the authors would have realized that their book would have this effect. They've put humans back in the center of the universe. Once again, there we are. The only blessed planet. Our star is rare. After-all, it's only one in 400 Billion (times 100 Billion). That's 1 in 40,000,000,000,000,000,000,000... just to be conservative.

Not only are animals rare (a truth grasped viscerally by Walt Whitman when he wrote that &quot;A mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels&quot;), so is the flukish appearance of human intelligence. Out of the hundreds of millions or billions of species in earth's history, only one has evolved that has been able to &quot;build that radio telescope.&quot; Much to the joy of the silly Creationists, the series of &quot;Great Demotions&quot; that began with Copernicus appears to be ending...A worthy and useful book. Now a few caveats:I wish that the authors had explored the ramifications of their low-sentience universe (with which I agree) in a bit more depth. For example, if each Milky Way-like galaxy harbors only, say, ten civilizations at a given time, then (crunching the numbers) in all of the universe there may be only ONE case in which there are inhabited worlds as close together as the sun is to Alpha Centauri - More typically sentient &quot;neighbors&quot; would be tens of thousands of light years apart, and in some galaxies there might be but a single sentience, or none. It's truly sobering to realize how alone we may be.I was also surprised that Enrico Fermi was not listed in the index. His famous question &quot;Then, where are they?&quot; (and the implied answer: &quot;Not here, anyway&quot;) is, to me, as compelling a piece of evidence for the rarity of sentience, as all of the geological and biological arguments that are (convincingly!) marshalled by Ward and Brownlee.I was happy to see that the authors dedicated their book to Carl Sagan, one of my personal heroes. Sagan's enthusiastic curiosity about the possibility of life beyond earth was tempered by a scientist's ability to accept new, unpleasant facts (unlike those silly Creationists).

Ward and his colleague at the University of Washington, astronomer Donald Brownlee, have done a fine service to both the scientific community and those in the general public who are interested and knowledgeable in the sciences by presenting their arguments in this book \\"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe\\". At best they offer a persuasive scenario which should be construed primarily as an elegant null hypothesis in the search for extraterrestrial intelligent life, by noting the diversity of single-cell organisms and their existence across a wide array of environments, including a few that would seem completely inhospitable to life. And they make a compelling case for the difficulty of metazoan (multicellular animal) life to evolve here on Earth, noting as a classic example, the sudden rise and fall of both the Ediacaran fauna and the subsequent Burgess Shale fauna in the latest Precambrian to Middle Cambrian intervals of Earth's geological history. However, after carefully reading this book, I am more inclined to agree with an unnamed recent Amazon.com reviewer who is a professional astronomer that this book is merely an intriguing example of scientific speculation not fully buttressed by supporting scientific data. The mere absence of something, or rather, the likely uniqueness of a phenomena (e. g. plate tectonics on Earth) does not mean that it does not exist elsewhere in the Milky Way Galaxy. Our current state of knowledge of extrasolar planets is truly akin to a single individual looking out upon the Atlantic Ocean from some wind-swept New England cove, trying to comprehend its immense size merely through his or her eyes. So I would advise anyone thinking of purchasing and then reading this book to bear in mind that at best it may be an elegant example of decent scientific speculation; at worst, it may be a bad example of such speculation run amok."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This is a great, thought provoking book.

The problem is that even the authors are reluctant to assume that. The idea that our planet is the only one capable of harbor complex life in our galaxy (maybe in the Universe), certainly annoy many people."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"First of all, astrobiology, which is what this book is about, is a speculative field. One cannot expect anyone to be much smarter than others. As of today, there is no reliable evidence supporting the existence of advanced extraterrestrial civilizations.The so-called Drake equation, proposed in the 1960s to \\"calculate\\" the number of extraterrestrial TV programs that we will be able to watch in the next centuries as a product of roughly ten comparably unknown quantities, became a symbol of a superficially quantitative approach to a question that is untestable and that reflects our faith. A method to write down an equation to pretend that the discussion is serious, without answering any question by the equation. Well, in one of his famous speeches, Michael Crichton has even blamed the Drake equation for the appearance of unprovable catastrophic scenarios such as those found in nuclear winter and global warming hypotheses.How difficult is it for life to evolve? The authors claim that it is quite easy for primitive life to occur. Primitive life has been observed in extreme circumstances of many types. A scientific approach to the origins of life more or less dictates that the organic molecules can be formed rather generically and the constraints on the temperature and concentration of various elements etc. cannot be too strict. More importantly, we have a pretty convincing observational evidence that the early life should not be so difficult to create: the primitive life on this planet clearly started a relatively short time after the planet was created.However, the authors say that it is very unlikely for animal life to evolve because the animals require a much more friendly environment. You could say that even the animal life appeared shortly after the birth of the Earth which seems to imply that it should evolve quickly (and therefore likely?), too. And you would be almost right. If it starts to occur, it occurs fast. But the point of the authors is not that the evolution of the animal life is very slow: their point is that it may be fast, but if the conditions on the planet are not \\"quite right\\", it won't happen at all (at least this is the expectation).They enumerate many features of our particular Solar system and our planet - including the composition and brightness of the Sun; its location within our Galaxy; the existence of the Moon that stabilizes the precession of the Earth; various hypothetical collisions in the past that initiated plate tectonics; other requirements for animals to live. It is not rigorously known, of course, how serious these constraints are and whether a slightly different kind of higher life could evolve if some of these conditions were not satisfied. More recently, some exoplanets that would satisfy some of the \\"non-trivial\\" criteria have been found.However, the authors definitely prove that there exist very reasonable assumptions that may lead to the conclusion that we are probably the unique advanced civilization in our Galaxy if not the whole visible Universe.You know, these questions are politicized a bit. According to creationists, the life is so precious and overly refined that it could not have appeared spontaneously. Those who want to isolate themselves from the creationists often like to say - and even think - that it must be trivial to create life, and therefore we should be surrounded by aliens. (Fermi asked: Where are they?) That's the opposite extreme which is what others like.Neither party is supported by observations. It is clearly not hard to create primitive life - but on the other hand, it is not terribly easy to create intelligent, advanced life because otherwise we would have already met the extraterrestrials. The number of civilizations like ours in the Universe may be comparable to one - and it may be exactly one just because we were a bit (or very) lucky. And the \\"coincidences\\" required for life to be created could have been barely enough to produce one Earth that allowed life like ours.All these possibilities are open and no solid data are available, which is the main reason I gave the book 4 stars only. But nevertheless, I recommend you this book to see that the guess that \\"we're alone after all\\" is definitely not silly."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This appears to be a well-researched and very interesting theory. I would have given it five stars, but didn't for two reasons. The first is that I would have liked to hear about possible candidates for complex life that don't necessarily rely on water, carbon and/or oxygen. Methane-breathing, silicon-based life that drink ammonia? haha. Who knows, I'm not a Chemist or Biologist. Perhaps no credible theories for life based on alternative components exist, but the authors should have made that clear if that is the current consensus. To be fair to the authors, they did make it clear at the beginning that they were using the only proven forms of life known to exist, i.e. life found on Earth, as a benchmark. The second reason is due to several erroneous, but minor, &quot;facts&quot; included in the text, which could have been caught by more careful editing. Some of which have already been pointed out by other reviewers, so I won't list them here. None of the errors that I noticed deter from the overall gist of the theory.Be that as it may, the real reason I am writing this review is to rebut several reviews I saw from people trying to characterize this book as a foundation for the Creationist view of how life originated. That notion is patently absurd. If the Rare Earth Theory is correct, the fact that there are so many (trillions) of stars in the universe makes it highly probable that at least one (ours) has managed to assemble itself, by simple chance alone, into a system conducive to habitation by complex life forms (plants and animals). I submit that the only way the Creationist view could have any hope of being true is that if the various components of the Rare Earth Theory are proven to be correct; and yet we find that complex life is present in a high percentage of star systems. That would imply that some outside force was helping things along and facilitating the eventual rise of complex life in spite of the many obstacles outlined in the Rare Earth Theory. But I think that is less likely to happen than the percentage of duplicate Earths in the universe. haha.For more convincing evidence that Creationism is highly unlikely, I dare you to read: &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot; by Richard Dawkins; &quot;Darwin's Dangerous Idea&quot; by Daniel Dennett; and &quot;How the Mind Works&quot; by Steven Pinker.I will agree with one point of one of the Creationist reviewers. This theory should be taught in schools, but not presented as proven, and not as a foundation for Creationism. Rather, it should be tied in with the notion, as pointed out by the authors, that if habitable planets and complex life truly are rare, it's all the more reason we should take good care of the Earth. It may be the only planet we ever find on which we can survive as a species (at least until another mass extinction event occurs)."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This book contains a wealth of interesting information and I recommend it as a source to anyone interested in the subject.

This is explained in the book \\"Life Everywhere\\" by David Darling. I STRONLY suggest reading that book AFTER reading Rare Earth, however - this \\"revelation\\" does not take away at all from the quality of Rare Earth. The two books merely offer opposing perspectives - one thinking advanced life may be quite rare, the other thinking it may not be as rare. As far as we know, neither is right or wrong, and I think they both offer important views on the subject.Some people have said \\"This is speculation not science\\". Well that is partially true - but science starts with speculation doesn't it? One could say that science is speculation. And we just don't know everything about how life starts - it's a very complicated subject! This book at least attempts to explain what we DO know, and what possibly could be factors in the origin and evolution of life elsewhere.Overall, I'd definately recommend this book, NOT because of the hypothesis presented, but because it clearly discusses most of the factors effecting the possibility of life existing/evolving elsewhere."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"The fascinating quest for other worlds that might support life has for far too long been pre-empted by astronomers. But rather than practicing astronomy, what these idealists are really searching for is an extraterrestrial with whom they can converse. In a feat of l&eacute;ger demain they all seque effortlesly from planets with water to planets with creatures who talk. Their search for non-human sentient beings is always based on simple assumptions about orbital mechanics. Is a planet at such a distance from its stable parent sun that liquid water can exist over millions of years? If yes, then advanced life forms will likely have arisen and---if Darwin is to be believed---sentient beings with radio transmissions. Hopeful astronomers have even created a highly optimistic calculation--the Drake equation--to predict the number of sentient beings in the universe. According to the late Carl Sagan, that number is in the millions.But life, and especially complex sentient life, is not the purview of these celestial mechanics. Rather the question of life must be answered by biologists or, in the case of non-terrestrial life, astro- or exo-biologists. These scientists tell a much less optimistic story.These biologists feel the advent of complex life on Earth (simple microbial life can likely be found throughout the universe) was due to an incredible series of fortuitous accidents--accidents so unusual that if all life on Earth were to disappear today, it is unlikely that humans could ever evolve again on our present planet.One such accident for example, is the creation/capture of the moon by Earth--an event occasioned by an Earth-size planet striking us a glancing blow and dislodging the mass that would eventually coalesce into the moon. Our moon is large fraction of the Earth's size compared to the relative moon size of other planets. Ten times nearer to Earth, it exerted a powerful influence on tides. Enormous waves washed inland for miles twice a day. This enormous tidal flow caused salt water to dissolve inland minerals and combine them in unique ways by the filtration of hundred-mile run-offs. Unusual combinations of salts, the anaerobic atmosphere, lightning and other natural phenomenon and the mixing and filtering of ubiquitous microbes eventually created (we still don't know how) larger self-replicating life forms.The exobiological side of the story is seldom heard in the public realm because it is so deeply pessimistic over the likelihood of intelligent life arising at all--thus dashing the fervent hope of millions of scientists and fellow travelers searching for signs of intelligence with their planet-wide SETI endeavor.This book provides an excellent exegesis of the exobiological side of the SETI story--and a useful antidote. Another excellent discussion along these lines--this time whether there was ever life on Mars--may be found in \\"White Mars: The story of the Red Planet Without Water,\\" by Nick Hoffman, 2000.It's a bummer, I know, to learn from these real experts on life, that we sentient creatures may be alone in our galaxy. All those hopeful hours spent watching Star Trek down the tubes!

The authors conclude that various traits of our planet, Solar System, and position in the Galaxy, are uncommonly fortunate for the development of complex life forms. While the authors believe that there are no doubt other planets somewhere where this fortunate confluence has also occurred, they conclude that multi-cellular life is rare in the universe, and that for all intents and purposes mankind may be essentially alone and nearly unique.The authors make a case. They show that our Solar System is particularly well-positioned in its orbit within the Galaxy for life, as our star is largely on the outer periphery of the Galaxy where it is spared the lethal effects of novas and other cosmic catastrophes that are more common nearer the core of the Galaxy. Further, the authors note that our own Solar System is uncommon in that the gas giant planets are confined to the outer reaches of the System, where they do not interfere much with the orbits of the inner planets, i.e. Earth, and in fact act as meteor shields, reducing the number of catastrophic meteor strikes which can, and have, caused most complex species to become extinct.The authors also note that even throughout most of Earth's history life was single-celled and species were few, until the Cambrian Explosion of speciation. This event, in order to take place, required numerous fortunate circumstances all to occur, and the authors make a case that such a fortunate confluence of conditions cannot be common in the universe. They may be right.Or they may not. The problem, of course, is that we are really dealing with a sample of one -- at this juncture we have discovered life nowhere but on our own planet, and our ability to explore the conditions that exist on planets outside our own Solar System (or even inside it) is greatly limited. What makes this book worth reading is the importance of its topic, for surely there can be no more profound question than \\"Are We Alone?...\\"Some of the science in this book becomes a little hard to follow for non-scientists, but mostly the authors present their case with clarity, and certainly even the layman can follow the main threads of the authors' arguments throughout the piece.

I agree mostly with the arguments presented but the jury's still out on tidally locked planets located in the habitable zones of their stars. The authors' contend that the tidal locking excludes any evolution of complex metazoans but the Gliese 581 system may present more definitive answers in the coming decades. To me that's the most dynamic issue raised by this book and I'm very excited about the outcome. For instance: Can any of these planets hold an atmosphere? Do any of them have liquid water and if any how much? From my own research 581C may be more like Venus than Earth but 581D which is on the outer periphery may host microbial life and in time as the planet warms, more complex life. It could be another earth in the making but most likely not. I find myself picking this book up quite often. It's well written and well argued mostly from the viewpoint of what can be extrapolated from life's early complex evolution on planet earth. So many issues to consider but it really does not look like complex plants and animals are easy or fast to achieve even on earthlike planets which may be interspersed at an average of 5000 light year increments in a 15,000 light year habitable zone which would not include the center or edge areas of the galaxy. There really isn't enough data yet but that is the suspician of the authors'. That should be a sobering thought."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Don't get me wrong, as a scientist I enjoyed this book. It has numerous up-to-date overviews of various ideas concerning the evolution of life on earth, planetary and solar system evolution, star formation, mass extinction events, evolutionary change etc etc, but I am of the view that the basic thrust of this book-that these many things which have played a role in the development of life on earth are by and large necassary for complex life to form-that this idea is fundamentally flawed. Here are my reasons.I won't go into the exact details of what the book discusses, as there are some other very good reviews which do this admirably. But the thesis is flawed. Just because life on earth has developed in a metal-rich solar system, with a Jupiter-like planet deflecting cometary and meteoric debris, with the &quot;right&quot; temperature (supposedly), the right amount of water, the &quot;proper&quot; (supposedly) distance from the sun etc etc, doesn't mean that all these and other things are necassary for complex life to form. In fact, there are indications that conditions on earth in some ways are not conducive for complex life to form. The earths crust is suprisingly rich in oxygen, oxygen is generally toxic to life. The earth is very stable, (axis, distance from sun, etc etc) which may mean that evolutionary change is considerably slower than on other planets. On another planet, with a more diverse planetary environment, and periodic instabilities, complex life might actually evolve considerably quicker. Life on earth appears to go through long periods of relative stability-this might be peculiar to life on earth and a relatively stable planet, and not the best environment for the evoltution of complex life. The earth is relatively poor in some elements which are apparently very important in complex life forms, such as phosphorous, and others. There are many peculiarities about the earth which are not necassarily necassay for life, and may even hinder it. The book does not spend much time in discussing thses ideas.But apart form these arguments, there is a blatant underlying flaw, that is, the idea that because life as we observe it has indeed been profoundly influenced by a number of different factors we can observe, that this therefore means that these processes are necasary for all/most complex life forms to evolve. How do we even know, for example, that water is necassary for life, let alone continental drift, large gaseous planets, the moon and so on. Silicon has long been conjectured to be able to provide a basis for the complex chemistry necassary for complex life, and silicon reacts differently to carbon with water and various other liquids. The many factors the book discusses are how life as we know it has formed, yes, but this does in no way mean that life can't form in other ways. If there is anything about life that seems obvious, is that is it adaptable, and suprisingly so. Life finds a way. The earth is not a blueprint, it is just one example of its course. Because it took 4 billion years on earth for complex life to get going, may indicate that the earth is not very good at getting life started, rather than complex life being improbable in the first place.I'm of the view that the obvious variety of conditions present in the universe may well create numerous conditions where life can flourish. True, this life might possibly be very different form what we imagine, blobs of 'intelligent jelly', rather than 'little green men'(primates). It is only simplemindedness which assumes that life on earthly conditions is the only way."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"I greatly enjoyed reading this book.

I got the feeling that the authors were glossing over some science a little too quickly. Also, I didn't see how they could be so conversant on DNA... as astrophysists or geologists.On a plus side, there are many great references to other books, magazine articles and respected journals.The basic gist of the book is: once you get past the almost impossible odds of duplicating another Earth, there are the incredible odds of making RNA (or DNA which is even more complicated), and duplicating the environmental conditions that allow multi-cellular beings.We can demonstrate making amino acids, but we have no idea how nature made RNA or DNA.So this, and other deductions, leads to their conclusion that higher forms of life (&quot;ET&quot;) is very unlikely on other planets.Again, this is a great read.John Dunbar"},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Rare Earth is an overview of the complexities of, what we consider, life.

These types of assertions are irresponsible for any scientists to make, muchless ones who wish to be regarded as experts in their field. Why do I say they were irresponsible? Here we are just a few years after the book was written and we have disproven many of the blatent assumptions that the authors used to provide leverage to their flimsy assertions. We now know that the Goldilocks zone is quite a bit larger than was believed before, we know that life can thrive in far more hostile and extreme conditions than was believed before (extremophiles), we know there are many, many more planets circling distant stars than was known before. I could keep going but the point is that the authors jumped to conclusions based on very little information, which is fine accept that they tried to build a convincing and \\"factual\\" sounding argument as to why their assertions were correct.However, if you, like me, are interested in being knowledgeable about astrobiology and the prospects of life elsewhere in the universe, then you probably ought to read this book.

Unfortunately, it fails to provide convincing evidence for this view, is often marked by sloppy writing, and in places borders on being wrong.As an example of the latter, the authors seem to imply that the Sun has little or no interaction with the Galaxy's spiral arms and that the inter-arm regions of a spiral galaxy have a lower stellar density than inside the spiral arms. Neither is correct. It is true that the Sun is not now located in a spiral arm. However, the Sun orbits the Galactic center, taking about 250 million years to do so. The Galaxy's spiral arms do not rotate with the stars. The Sun therefore probably passes through at least one spiral arm every orbit. Over its lifetime the Sun has made approximately 20 orbits, plenty of time to pass through multiple spiral arms. Indeed the authors seem to be unaware of a proposal that massive extinctions in the Earth's past were caused by passage of the Sun through a spiral arm.In many places the presentation also seems muddled. If we are told that Jupiter is more than 300 times the mass of the Earth (p. 235), do we really need to be told less than three pages later that Jupiter's mass is 318 Earth masses (p. 238)?While reading it, I kept finding myself saying, That's not right, or, But what about ....?

Although the conclusion derived from the Rare Earth Hypothesis is that life is unlikely to exist elsewhere in the universe through evolution, it also makes the case that life here on earth, as well as the stable habitat created for life, are statistically improbable, even implausable.If the creation of life by means of evolution is unlikely, then how did our existance come about? The quick answer is &quot;By some other means.&quot; When one considers what those other means might be, the most likely, if notthe only other answer, is &quot;Creation by a supreme, all-knowing, all powerful, being&quot;.Although this is clearly a well written, well documented book of science, the issue of creationism is touched upon in a couple of places; e.g., on page 37, the authors state &quot;If some god-like being could be given the opportunity to plan a sequence of events with the express goal of duplicating our 'Garden of Eden&quot;, that power would face a formidable task.&quot; Who fits this description of God? DUH... Certainly the all knowing, all powerful Judeo-Christion-Muslim God, known as Yahweh, Jehovah, Allah, by the respective groups, could accomplish this, as well as God as characterized by many eastern religions. If this task of creation is too formidable for God, does it make sense to conclude it happened by ACCIDENT, e.g., evolution? Get real. Give me a break.Again of page 129 they write &quot;Sedgewick's discovery of the seemingly instantaneous appearance of complex fossils convinced most scientists of his time that life was spontanteously created - put on Earth through the action of some deity; this observation is still cited by creationists as evidence against the theory of evolution.&quot;Although the authors provide an evolutionary explanation for this &quot;relatively sudden and signal outburst of animals - an unleashing of abundant and voracious creatures upon the earlier bacterial world,&quot; (page 131) they also say &quot;We believe that it yields crucial evidence for estimating the frequency of animal life in the Universe&quot; (which turns out to be 'rare'). How about Genesis 1, verses 20-25, for a description of the Cambrian &quot;explosion&quot;?Could it be that these authors are &quot;closet&quot; creationists? Comments that may seem to some to discredit creationism actually support it.They also make significant inroads against the prevailing scientific view that life in the universe is commonplace, by means of the &quot;Theory of Evolution&quot; (which seems to be taken more as a fact than a hypothesis by these writers and many other authors on the subject). The Drake equation (page 267), proposed by Frank Drake in the 1950s, that predicts the probability of life on other planets, is modified (page 271) to add additional factors that conclude intelligent life elsewhere is improbable, not overwhelmingly prevalent. Carl Sagan's 1974 predictions of millions of civilizations in our galaxy is refuted, as well as the writings of other authors such as Isaac Asimov, who fine tuned the Drake equation in his 1979 book &quot;Extraterrestrial Civilizations&quot; (not specifically mentioned in &quot;Rare Earth&quot;).Another damaging claim, on page 250, questions the viability of the SETI project, the &quot;Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence&quot; where the authors state &quot;If the Rare Earth Hypothesis is correct, then it (SETI) clearly is a futile effort.&quot; How much money have we taxpayers spent on this &quot;futile project&quot;.

Ward and Brownlee argue that the Drake Equation that states that the universe is teeming with life may be right--but it might not be intelligent life or complex life such as higher mammals and plants. All of this is conjecture and while it is a fascinating discussion it's based on our bias that life has to somehow resemble us or the creatures of our planet. Ward and Brownlee suggest that we might be disappointed to discover if we hold up a mirror to the univese we won't see ourselves; that's not a surprise given how diverse life (despite the common building blocks)is on Earth.Is there life out there? We won't really know until we get out there. Until such time everything else is speculation. Are the conditions for complex life such as on our planet unlikely to be on other planets? Sure but that doesn't preclude lifeforms radically different from our own that might have as much in common with us as we do with a neutron star.This is indeed a worthwhile book to read but keep in mind that there are other books on the same subject that can provide balance to this point of view."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Evolution, the Big Bang ... these and other loosely framed theories are devoid of much understandingRare Earth is a gem!

It is an interesting, if ultimately unconvincing book. Interesting theory, lots of conjecture, and lots of \\"What if...\\" in every chapter.To me it seems that in many places sweeping statements are made, but never supported. Take for instance the statement on page 110 \\"Changes in ocean chemistry caused by increased tectonic activity beginning a billion years ago facilitated the evolution of skeletons.\\" But the section does not, to me, provide adequate support or explanation for this supposition.Also take for example the Drake Equations which - while properly explained - is misstated in the details.The equation is usually written: N = R* x fp x ne x fl x fi x fc x L where:N = The number of civilizations in The Milky Way Galaxy whose electromagnetic emissions are detectable.R* =The rate of formation of stars suitable for the development of intelligent life.fp = The fraction of those stars with planetary systems.Ne = The number of planets, per solar system, with an environment suitable for life.fl = The fraction of suitable planets on which life actually appears.fi = The fraction of life bearing planets on which intelligent life emergesfc = The fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space.L = The length of time such civilizations release detectable signals into space.(Source: Seti Institute, http://www.seti-inst.edu/science/drake-bg.html)However, as given in the text of \\"Rare Earth\\" the formula is:N* x fs x fp x ne x fi x fc x fl = NThis does not appear to be a big difference, however, the terms fi, fl, and fc are each mis-defined in the book. fi is defined as planets where life does arise, not intelligent life; fc as planets on which intelligent life emerges, not civilizations that develop a technology; and fl as percentage of lifetime of a planet that civilizations release detectable signals into space, not planets with life. This may seem nothing more then nit picking over details, but to me this is symptomatic of the entire work. If you can't even get a few simple 40 plus year old definitions right how accurate is the rest of the work? The belief that earth is the rarest of planets and then the selection of information to support that idea appears to be the main thrust here.Good science uses data to take you to a logical, fact supported conclusion, you get the reverse when to select facts to support a preconceived conclusion.Overall an unsatisfactory book."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"I originally bought this book after reading an summary in a science magazine, as I wanted to know more about their ideas...

This tradition is found in many religions and embodied in some scientific thought. The late Carl Sagan, for example, surmised the existence of one million civilizations capable of interstellar communications in the Milky Way galaxy. Ward and Brownlee take exception to these estimates. According to the authors, microbial life is common in the universe &quot;but even the simplest animal life is exceedingly rare.&quot; Instead of millions of such civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy there might be just a few. There might be just one.One of the things I liked most about this book its very nice summary of the history of earth. Chapter 1 has some interesting information about recent discoveries regarding the environments in which extremophiles live. It might seem incredible to us, but extremophiles actually thrive in very high temperatures, pressures, and pH levels that we would find terribly fatal. The wide range of environments in which the simplest life forms can live gives rise to the greater probability of finding them throughout the universe. Extremophiles not only thrive in such environments, they can also tolerate brief forays into space aboard debris ejected from meteor impacts, and they can escape harsh surface conditions by living deep under ground.The second chapter introduces us to the concept of habitable zones. For extremophiles the habitable zones are quite large, so planets harboring such life can be found in a wider range of orbits around a wider range of stars. More complex life, however, requires far smaller ranges in environmental conditions, leading to a much-reduced habitable zone. Habitable zones must also exist over sufficiently long periods of time for life to evolve. In other words, the habitable zone has both spatial and a temporal components. The upshot is that habitable zones for complex life are pretty small, and may not exist at all unless the star is quite similar to ours.Chapter three describes some of the critical components for a habitable earth, including the creation of hydrogen and helium (and a bit of lithium) in the Big Bang, and the creation of heavier elements in stars. The earth needed to form from an inter-stellar accumulation rich in metals with the right amount of water. The authors argue that such conditions are rare in the universe, and that planets such as ours are rare as well.Chapter four discusses the conditions on earth after the initial bombardment stopped, during the earth's early formation. This chapter has some very interesting material suggesting how bacteria, archaea, and eucarya form the earliest tree of life. Chapter 5 continues by describing how Eucarya are differentiated from the archaeans and the bacteria. Eucarya include the animals, ciliates, fungi, plants, flagellates, and microspordia that constitute the complex life that the authors claim is so rare in the universe. The key piece of evidence regarding eucarya is that they took a long time to evolve in earth's history. The message in this fact, according to the authors, is that eucarya require a more specialized environment in which to evolve - a narrower habitable zone - and that this environment must persist for long periods of time. All of which argues against this type of life being common in the universe.Chapter 6 is called &quot;Snowball Earth,&quot; and describes the earliest known ice ages on earth, which date to 2.4 billion and 800 to 650 million years BP. These ice ages, in contrast to the one a few tens of thousands of years ago, literally covered the entire earth and froze the oceans over. These ice ages could have helped to stimulate the evolution of animals, and (just as importantly) they also show that major environmental changes - changes that can cause mass extinction - have and can occur on earth. Timing and the extreme nature of the events are critical to the evolution of life.The real centerpiece of this book is chapter 7, which discusses the enigma of the Cambrian explosion. Perhaps no other event in earth's history has generated as much debate and speculation as the comparatively sudden rise in complexity of animal species that accompanied the Cambrian explosion. The authors argue that the triggers for this explosion (and they offer several possible candidates) are necessary for the evolution of complex life, but they are also rare - adding further emphasis to their hypothesis that complex life in the universe is rare.Chapter 8 describes mass extinctions and threats to animal life. Chapter 9 raises some interesting issues about the importance of plate tectonics and argues that the evolution of animal life requires plate tectonics to maintain biodiversity and to stabilize global climate. Chapter 10 discusses the importance of the moon in creating tides, contributing to orbital stability (and possibly contributing to plate tectonics) and Jupiter, which cleans the solar system of planet-crossing projectiles that could sterilize earth. Again, the point is that these conditions are rare, and so planets with complex life are also rare.Chapter 11 describes ways in which the rare-earth hypothesis might be tested, and chapter 12 reassesses the odds of complex life in the universe via a modified form of the Drake equation. I found chapter 12 a bit of a disappointment, though, since the authors never really stick there necks out and make a claim for how many planets with complex life might exist in the galaxy. The final chapter discusses the philosophical and ethical implications of the rare-earth hypothesis, including the role people play in the current extinction crisis.This is a first-rate book. The notes are detailed, the index complete, the text clear and understandable. The argument is lucid and in many (though not all) ways compelling. And, of course, it's hard to think of subject matter more relevant."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This is one of the most wide-ranging and readable of all science books aimed at a non-specialist audience. The authors raise Big Questions in astronomy, planetary evolution, geology, climatology, ecology, and biological evolution, reminding us of how interdisciplinary the extraterrestrial life debate really is. The vast array of subjects they address could make this book an ideal discussion text for a course designed to introduce non-scientists to scientific issues and methods. The book, at least in its hardback edition, has an uncrowded format that makes it easy to read.Ward and Brownlee accumulate a lengthy series of arguments in support of their position that, while simple life may be relatively common, complex life is rare. At first glance, these arguments seem persuasive. However, a closer reading reveals that the authors sometimes tilt the debate in their favor by choosing the argument that best supports their case even when the evidence is very limited or ambiguous, e.g. their statement that plate tectonics \\"may be vanishingly rare in the Universe as a whole.\\" How can they know this when our sample is limited to our own solar system? Sometimes, the authors make unsupported blanket generalizations, e.g. \\"On every planet, sooner or later, a planetary catastrophe can be expected that either seriously threatens the existence of animal life or wipes it out altogether.\\" Stating that \\"it just seems to have been by chance that our Jupiter formed as it did\\" is hardly scientific. Oddly, after stating that SETI is a futile effort if their hypothesis is correct, the authors go on to say that \\"There probably are other civilizations in the galaxy that have radio telescopes.\\" In the end, the fundamental limitation to such arguments is that they are based on the only biosphere we know -- our own. This is summed up in the authors' statement that \\"It appears that Earth got it just right.\\" Life as we know it may not exhaust all the possibilities.There are some errors. Venus does not always present the same face to the Sun. Nicholas Copernicus was Polish, not Danish. Frank Drake's equation was developed for a meeting held in 1961. One hopes that the authors will clean up these details for a second edition."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"These two authors have written a highly informative book to support their thesis that we might well be the only multi-celled organisms in the universe.

It provides an entertaining and accessible summary of the biological, cosmological, and geological science involved in the development of our home planet.

In order to make the most accurate prediction possible the book makes use of the strongest evidence we have to date, our knowledge of our own solar system. Using very wide breadth, the authors rationalize the following simple theme, \\"The occurrence of simple microbial life is pervasive in the universe, but the occurrence of more complex, multi-cellular life is not.From this book I now realize that the number of natural phenomena affecting the possible occurrence and evolution of complex life in one of our neighboring stars is far greater than I ever imagined. I thank the authors for enlightening me on this subject. Perhaps in future I won't be as disappointed as I was during the first Viking landing. I really did think they would find vegetation on Mars, and I'm still upset about it.The authors of &quot;Rare Earth&quot; present their subject very well, although perhaps not in a style that would excite the average public, as did Carl Sagan and Issac Isamov in their science books. Indeed, I recommend that the authors of this text consider rewriting it in a more popular form, with plenty of illustrations. Hey, people love pictures, myself included.The controversy between the people at SETI and the authors is unfortunate. I believe both sides have a lot to gain from each other's work. In my opinion it was a mistake for the authors to have included, near the very end of the book, references to SETI. The antagonism created was predictable. I myself am a participant in the seteathome project, having completed 225 work units so far. However, I do not allow my excitement over the possibility of receiving an alien signal stand in the way of my objectivity in the face of the best hard evidence we have to date.

In other words, we haven't seen any ET's because there aren't any-or very few. The book makes this argument reasonably effectively and supports it with some science.I was disappointed that the science seemed pretty shallow-not really well done. There are just plain factual errors, e.g., the repeated assertion that Venus and Mercury present the same face towards the sun all the time, which leads to the elimination of a whole class of stars as potential homes for Earth type planets. Some science was confusingly presented, some just irrelevant, e.g., the discussion of periodite as distinct from basalt.One is tempted to dismiss these as minor flaws, but they are particularly irritating in light of the authors' hubris about our current knowledge. For instance, I think they too easily dismiss the possibility of complex life developing or surviving in some way we haven't thought of. Such a possibility could overcome the need for the presence or absence of certain chemicals, the necessity of protection from ultraviolet radiation, or relax temperature limits, etc.Another instance: in considering the consequences of the cessation of plate tectonics they predict, with no qualifications, that the continents will disappear, Earth will become a \\"waterworld\\", sea life will be aversely affected, carbon dioxide levels will drop to zero, the greenhouse effect will be diminished and Earth will freeze. There are no alternative hypothesis, no consideration of possible breaks in their chain of reasoning. The role of water vapor, clouds, the effects of increased areas of evaporation, the adaptability of life are not dealt with at all. This unqualified confidence seemed particularly unsuited to scientists who, as a group, find it necessary to change some aspects of their creation story every five months and can't come close to predicting next week's weather.The argument that the moon's role in stabilizing the obliquity of the Earth's spin axis was essential for the existence of long lasting complex life was unconvincing. It was hardly an argument, more just an assertion. I came away saying, \\"Maybe....but, well, maybe not.\\" Another assertion, not even an argument, \\"the critical 40 degree C mark that is the upper temperature limit of animal life.\\" Living in Phoenix Arizona, where the temperature reaches 50 degrees C, I'm tempted to say, \\"I don't think so.\\"It was a little jarring to find several mentions of the current \\"mass extinction\\" mixed in with the statement, \\"The fossil record suggests that there are more species of animals and plants alive on Earth today than at any time in the past.\\" No data is presented or alluded to; the nuances and profound uncertainties regarding the current stage of life on Earth are just not acknowledged-just boilerplate about rain forests and topsoil.

In addition, the writing, especially considering the material they are discussing, is surprisingly easy to read and understand and totally lacking the 'jargon' so prevalent in today's academic world. I highly recommend this book to anyone who really wants to consider the implications of their thesis."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This is one of the most astonishing books I have ever read. Its thesis, that complex life similar to life on the Earth, is probably very rare in the galaxy, if not the universe. The authors meticulously build a case for Earth's special place in the cosmos, showing how bacterial life might be common but that anything bigger than simple organisms might not be able to survive the ravages of time and comets and wandering axial tilt. As other readers have pointed out, this doesn't necessarily mean that silicon-based life or some other kind of life can't exist in the universe, but it does demonstrate that Fermi's Dilemma might in fact be true. As a science fiction writer, I was stunned at how much this book could change the way science fiction is written. No more Star Trek universes with complex life in every system, no more &quot;federations&quot; or &quot;foundations&quot; or &quot;assemblies&quot; of thousands of inhabited worlds. According to the thesis Ward and Brownlee present, habitable worlds might be few and far between. Humans may very well find no other worlds beyond the Earth upon which to live. RARE EARTH will make it difficult to read books or watch movies that envision a galaxy filled with wonderful and curious creatures, where humans spread out across the galaxy as if they were so many islands in Polynesia. And if the Rare Earth hypothesis is true, then we are also obliged to get our act together here and now if we are going to become a space-going species. I think this book puts a lot of science fiction writers out of business. It certainly makes a lot of science fiction, including my own, seem downright silly."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This is certainly a great book. It is bound to age quickly since most of the book is based on really ground-breaking discoveries and propositions that are many times challenged shortly after their publication. The book presents a paradoxical theory that says that life is widespread on the universe but most of the times it doesn't go much beyond the very simple organisms on the first evolutionary steps.Complex life as we see on earth, the book says, must be extraordinary rare if not unique. The idea is revolutionary and the book is written in a very compelling way.The idea certainly goes against the mainstream challenging consolidated ideas like the Drake Equation. The Drake Equation, devised by Dr. Frank Drake in 1961 is a famous way to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations able to communicate within our own galaxy. This important estimate is one of the pillars for projects like the SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence).One of the most interesting ideas presented in the book in my opinion is the possibility of exchange of microorganisms between planets and moons within our solar system. Meteor or comet impacts in planets would eject rocks that could carry live microorganisms to neighbor planets. This would happen more often in smaller planets subject to smaller gravitational force and with thinner atmospheres like Mars. Life as we see it on earth, the book says, might actually have started in Mars. However the book doesn't consider the artificial process of seeding life what is for me the lost factor on Drake's equation, the colonization factor. An advanced civilization, even a unique one, could very well have spread life on the universe bypassing the first evolutionary steps and making complex life feasible even on planets that are for a shorter period of time at the solar system habitable zone. If nobody did it before we, humans, might very well start doing in the near future.Many are, according to the book, the reasons why earth displays such a lush biodiversity. Things that we many times take for granted like plate tectonics, Earth's magnetic field, the presence of other planets like Jupiter and Mars, the size and stability of our Sun and Earth's basic composition are paramount to our very existence. The odds of reproducing such favorable conditions are, according to the book, slim.The book covers a wide range of subjects from astronomy to biology passing through geology, paleontology, climatology, and many other ologies. But don't panic, the book is written in a way that you can read it and enjoy it even if you lack the basic knowledge in one or more of the subjects covered. This is done by constantly restating the key points presented in every chapter.This is a fascinating book on a fascinating topic. The biggest problem is that we try to study or even predict the nature of life in other planets based on our unique sample, Earth. As any statistician would agree it's hard to make good statistics on only one sample.Leonardo Alves, November 2000"},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Astrobiology, the subject of this excellent book, is a science still in eager anticipation of its first object of contemplation. Professors Ward and Brownlee from the University of Washington, the former a geologist, the latter an astronomer, argue very strongly that such an object will not be what we would call an animal or a metazoan. Certainly the word &quot;intelligent&quot; will not apply to the first extraterrestrial. Their thesis is that our earth is indeed rare, the product of innumerable rare events and unusual conditions, so much so that we should expect to find similar circumstances elsewhere only very rarely. Acknowledging the recent discoveries of extremophiles, single-celled organisms that can live in very harsh environments, the authors aver that microbial life, on the other hand, should be plentiful. They believe, nonetheless, that the leap from microbes to complex life forms is a very rare event indeed.Their argument is based on all the things that can go wrong. They cite a formidable litany of hindrances including the need for a planet to be the right size at the right distance from a star of the right size and composition, to the need for plate tectonics (for biotic diversity and the recycling of materials) and a large moon (to stabilize the planet's tilt and temperature), to a Jupiter to sweep the system relatively free of deadly planet-crossing bodies, and especially to a very long time period in which to evolve, etc.Their argument is tantalizing and difficult to fault. We have only one example of the rise of complex life, and it seems reasonable to conclude that the factors that allowed this life to evolve are necessary. But I am troubled. If I look at the factors that led to my birth, my birth as exactly me, the whole process seems rather miraculous. If my parents had never met, if my mother had had a headache that night, if, in fact, she or my father had behaved in any way differently from exactly how they did behave during the time up and including my conception, another little sperm might have fertilized the egg and I would not exist. Or, take a hand at bridge. If you are dealt 13 spades, you can be pretty sure that something fishy is going on since the odds against getting exactly 13 spades are astronomical. However, the odds against being dealt any other exact hand at bridge are also astronomical, in fact the odds are identical. But some combination of cards must be dealt! So the fact that the development of complex life on this planet seems miraculous in the sense that everything had to be just right for it to develop may be a misconception. I think it's akin to the anthropic principle. If our solar system were different perhaps some other creatures would be here rhapsodizing over just how miraculous all the coincidences were that produced them!The authors, of course, are talking about carbon-based &quot;life as we know it.&quot; Since it is massively difficult to speculate on life as we don't know it, especially when considering that 90% of the universe, the so-called mysterious dark matter, is still totally beyond our ken, they are wise to qualify the argument. I would add that life may take on forms and modes that we wouldn't recognize as being &quot;alive.&quot; It may be, for example, that the stars are &quot;alive.&quot; We know that they are born, they grow, reproduce and die. They spew their seeds, the heavy elements out into space where they attract other elements and form new stars. Such life would be &quot;life as we wouldn't recognize it.&quot; There is also the possibility that life may take on forms and modes totally beyond our comprehension, giving us &quot;life as we can't possibly know it.&quot; An example would be my friends &quot;the energy beings&quot; who live, reproduce and disappear in a small fraction of a nanosecond, too quick for us ever to be aware of them.Yes, one may, I hope, speculate. Certainly that is what the authors are doing here. Regardless of how carefully they conform to what is currently known in a scientific sense, and regardless of how carefully those speculations are expressed, they are postulating from a sampling of one. But the authors know this. On page 282 they write, &quot;The great danger to our thesis...is that it is a product of our lack of imagination. We assume in this book that animal life will be somehow Earth-like. We take perhaps the jingoistic stance that...lessons from Earth are not only guides but also rules.&quot; Nonetheless they say that &quot;evidence and inference&quot; lead them to believe that the earth is very rare indeed.There is some redundant repetition from chapter to chapter, which can happen with two authors, and there are the usual &quot;spell-checker&quot; typos, i.e., &quot;out&quot; for &quot;our,&quot; etc., that occasionally mar the text, but no more than usual. On page 267, however, they estimate that there are between 200 and 300 million stars in our galaxy. Of course the number is more like 100 billion. They probably meant that there are 200 to 300 million &quot;sun-like&quot; stars in our galaxy. These quibbles aside, I think that the significant value of this book is that, in the process of arguing for their rare earth, Ward and Brownlee are able to share with us their formidable understanding of the latest findings in a number of sciences, especially geology, biology and astronomy, and apply that knowledge to astrobiology. The material on tectonics and mass extinctions is especially interesting. Their recreation of the impact and aftermath of the object that hit the earth at the end of the Cretaceous is strikingly vivid. More than this, it is their enthusiasm in presenting the material that makes this excellent book so very interesting and readable."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Rare Earth is a fascinating book that argues that intelligent life is rare in the universe. The value of this book does not lie in the cogency of its arguments but rather in the panoply of interesting facts and theories the authors marshal to argue their point. The authors contend that simple unicellular organisms are ubiquitous in the universe, if not potentially in our solar system. They base their argument on the Draconian environments here on earth where extremeophiles survive. They contend, however,that only a set of unique circumstances could allow unicellular organisms to develop into complex metazoans. The unique conditions include the position of a planet in a solar system, the position of a solar system in a galaxy, and the close proximity of both a large planet and a large moon. Furthermore a planet requires earth-like plate tectonics and maybe a couple of ice ages thrown in that dwarf our previously known ice ages in severity and longevity.(They describe the new theory of &quot;snowball earth&quot;). The weakness of their argument lies in their emphasis on the conditions necessary for life rather than the process. The formation of a complex molecule, RNA, necessary for life, and DNA, necessary for reproduction, might be a far more difficult process than the evolution of microbes to complex organisms. They also make their argument from a strictly anthropic point of view,ignoring the possibility of completely different forms of life. It seems axiomatic that the more complex the life form becomes in any habitat,the more specialized the habitat must become to sustain that life. In any case, intelligent life can be extraordinarily rare but be far from unique due to the vastness of our universe. New theories of inflation, especially chaotic inflation, suggest that the visible universe with its one hundred billion galxies is merely a speck in the much larger cosmos. In summary, even though I don't always agree with the authors, this book is too interesting and informative not to read."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"For the authors even the simplest animal life is uncommon in the universe, and intelligent life extremely rare. They believe that our earth is a very special case, because (1) there is more life diversity than on others planets, caused by sudden massive life extinction through meteor impact and by global climate change provoked by plate tectonics; and (2) earth is surrounded by 2 special planets: the moon and Jupiter. The moon causes lunar tides, stabilizes the tilt of Earth's spin axis, and it slows the Earth's rate of rotation. Jupiter was important in the formation of the earth.Their crucial argument is the importance of plate tectonics. They develop their argumentation very well: plate tectonics promotes biological productivity, diversity and helps maintain equable temperatures on earth. But how do they know that it is extremely rare in a cosmos of billions of billions of stars? This argument cannot be tested. So we and they don't know. Their case is built on ignorance.Nevertheless, I recommend this book for its challenging proposition, although the text could be more condensed."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"The &quot;Rare Earth&quot; hypothesis is a counter proposal to today's common belief that we are not alone in the universe.

Chapters focus on proofs and evidence for the &quot;Rare Earth&quot; hypothesis. Some of these proofs can get rather lengthy and detailed but it's necessary and it is not so overwhelming that the reader will drop the book and walk away. Many of the concepts will just blow your mind, like the formation of the moon, the aborted planet, and snowball Earth.By the end of this book, I found myself wondering whether our existance is really a chance occurance in light of so many galactic obstacles."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Ward and Brownlee's book is provocative but not convincing. In a universe as big as ours, statistically unlikely events occur all the time. The one event described in the book that truly would be a freak would be the existence of the Moon, which (1) stabilizes Earth's axis and (2) augments the tides(which would be provided at 1/3 volume by the Sun). However, this argument is at least qualified by the existence of Pluto and Charon. The problem of the Sun-hugging Jupiters is an interesting one. However this could be due to the fact that the stars around which Sun-huggers formed are much younger than the Sun and the process of solar system formation is not yet complete. The role which extinctions have played in the evolution of life on Earth is itself very inconclusive. Although perhaps they stimulated the evolution of advanced forms, just as easily they could have retarded them. As it is, we know so very little about the formation and history of planets it is premature to jump to grand conclusions. Nonetheless Ward and Brownlee reject facile reasoning and challenge the reader to examine basic assumptions."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"First off, let me say that I'm a big SETI supporter (both in the rah-rah and charity senses), and I don't see this book as anti-SETI or hopelessly pessimistic.

I also found this section of the book to be fun to read.However, their second premise is not as convincing, but not for lack of data. They present a strong case, and while I find each step logical, the final outcome -- that the universe (or at least our quadrant of the galaxy, as they point out) is sparsely populated with animal-like life -- does not strike me to be as bleak as they propose.So, it's a good read that is sure to expand your knowledge and cause you to think..."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Scarcely 200 years ago, the world seemed immense, immortal, and enigmatic. Brave explorers searched for the Open Polar Ocean. Large swaths of continents were marked &quot;unexplored&quot; on maps. The geological systems of the world were barely glimmers in the minds of the first of the great 19th century scientists. After reading this book, with its fast-forwarding and reversing through geologic time, one feels like we're hanging on to a tiny, fragile marble by our fingernails. There's such a thing as an overdose of perspective!A lot of improbable things seemed to have had to happen for higher life to evolve on earth. The authors say that microscopic life may spring up wherever there is half a chance, but animal life requires a lot of just-so adjustments--adjustments that the Earth took billions of years to perform. For life--meaning carbon-based, liquid water requiring life, other elements being ill-suited to being a base for life--to arise, the sun had to be a yellow main sequence star, and the earth had to be a certain distance, and there had to be plate tectonics, liquid water, a magnetosphere, possibly a freakishly large moon, maybe asteroid bombardments, not too much exposure to gamma rays or nearby novas, and who knows what else. The authors postulate that such a chain of circumstances is probably rare in the universe. This is a disquieting thought, to think of entire gigantic elliptical galaxies probably being barren of life. So, far from being the crown of creation, we seem to be an accident, contemplating an accident.Whether you accept their hypothesis, or you think the universe is buzzing with other sentient life, it is educational to read the latest ideas about the origin of life, the history of Earth, and several of its more probable dooms. The authors are mercifully agnostic about flummery like the Gaia hypothesis, in which, practically, people try to convince themselves that the faces they see in the clouds really are faces. A compact, well delivered geology lesson, wrapped up in a profoundly disturbing idea."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This is a good book that I will recommend to friends, particularly those who are seeking to better understand their relationship to the universe, yet lack much in the way of scientific background. This book does a great job of describing some basic theory regarding the coalescence of our planet, the structure of our solar system, and the processes involved in evolving the higher life forms we are familiar with. The authors are very readable to a lay audience, though they do tend to be redundant.I am troubled, however, by what appears to be a paradigm problem. The authors spend a great deal of time describing the unique set of circumstances that Earth affords, resulting in the complex array of life forms we observe about us and in the fossil record. The troubling part, however, comes in the manner in which they approach the subject, and is most tellingly observed in their expanded use of the Drake formula near the end of the book, used to roughly quantifiy the probability that we might find intelligent life out there somewhere else in the universe. The problem is, we are looking backwards and saying, &quot;If this didn't happen, and that didn't happen, and this didn't happen, then we would never have gotten to what we see today.&quot; This is really the only tool we have, but the problem lies in the fact that we CAN NOT say, &quot;Had these things not happened, where WOULD we be?&quot; You can never know the multitude of unrealized possibilities when talking about your own experience, but we also cannot lose sight of those when we are talking about an infinitely complex &quot;other&quot; reality that is out there. All we know is that life &quot;as we know it&quot; was a co-creative process that evolved right along with all the factors that appear to have influenced it, such as the presence of the Moon and Jupiter, plate tectonics, and how fortunate we are that the K/T asteroid wasn't twice the size that it was. But if life was evolving along with environmental conditions and changes, and had a DIFFERENT set of conditions existed, might not a different outcome that is just as plausible been the result? Life as we know it is still interacting, moment by moment, with it's environment, and the slowly changing conditions of our solar system, and it is likely to continue to respond...sometimes in ways that cannot be predicted. The deterministic approach of the Rare Earth Hypothesis seems to be locked into the paradigm that life as we know it is the only realistically achievable life. But is that indeed realistic? Perhaps we are rare...in fact, I would surmise that we are. Perhaps, though, there are (in the words of Carl Sagan), &quot;billions and billions&quot; of rare, unique, life supporting planets functioning and evolving according to paradigms we can not yet even conceive of. Just because we don't know HOW to see it does not meen it isn't there. We may not know what to look for, yet!Remember, for a few hundred years, the physics of Newton was unapproachable, and unquestionably &quot;the&quot; way the universe operated. With a shift in paradigm, we got relativity and quantum mechanics, and now Newton's physics, while still very useful, is in many regards, just quaint. Are we doing the same thing with the Rare Earth?It's a good book, and will stimulate considerable thought!"},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"It would seem that many (most?) scientists feel that life, in varied forms, must pervade the universe, but the authors of this book make a knowledgeable and well-reasoned case that life, or more precisely, complex, multicellular life, could be exceedingly rare in the universe and may in fact be limited to our Earth. In effect, they answer Fermi's famous query \\"where are they\\" by their analysis of all the factors that contribute to the hospitable environment Earth offers life, and how unique and cumulatively improbable those factors may be. It seems a life-harboring planet can't be near the center of a galaxy or in its periphery; its sun must be the right size -- not too large and not too small -- and must burn its nuclear fuel for at least several billion years to help life develop; the \\"Goldilocks\\" planet must be a rocky planet near the sun, but not too near (I believe the authors estimate the range of the habitable zone in our solar system to be in the neighborhood of only 30 million miles); the planet should be large enough to have sufficient gravity to retain its atmosphere but small enough not to attract frequent asteroid bombardment (it also helps to have a reasonably nearby giant like Jupiter to attract these asteroids); the planet needs to be geologically active with convective heat at its core to generate a magnetic field to deflect the solar wind; and this geologic activity should contribute to plate tectonics which resurfaces the planet resulting in new geographic niches and areas of isolation thus speeding up evolution of the existing forms of life. One fascinating item for me is the benefical existence of our moon which has the required size to maintain our angle of rotation at 23 degrees; without the moon, the angle of rotation would fluctuate too much rendering our seasons too unstable. There's more, but you get the point. As one who would be thrilled with the discovery of life elsewhere in the universe, I nonetheless found their analysis sobering but also stimulating and provocative. For fans of science, their multi-disciplinary approach effectively used astronomy, astrophysics, geology, geophysics, biology, astrobiology, and paleontology.It should be noted, however, that the authors suggest that microbial life may indeed pervade the universe; their pessimism is confined to more complex life (they call it \\"animal life\\") that may require billions of years to evolve. They suggest that the extreme resiliance of micro-organisms in some of earth's most hostile environments, e.g., we've found microbes in Yellowstone hot springs, Anarctica, and in deep ocean vents utilizing hydrogen and sulfur, indicate that this form of simple life may indeed be found in various cosmic environments.This book was published in 2003 and subsequent discoveries in our own solar system have been described as \\"expanding the habitable zone for life\\" rendering, perhaps, this book's assessment of life's chances unduly pessimistic. Over the last decade missions to Jupiter and Saturn have discovered exciting possibilities on two of Jupiter's moons (Io and Europa) and two of Saturn's moons (Enceladus and Titan). While the sun may be distant and these moons quite cold on the surface, tidal forces from the immense gravity of their nearby planets generate heat in the interior. Europa is suspected of having a large amount of liquid water underneath its surface. Titan has the only surface ocean in the solar system (other than Earth) albeit one of liquid methane (liquid at -300 degrees F). The most intriguing possibility is Saturn's moon, Enceladus. The Cassini mission flyby discovered that Enceladus has geysers of liquid water spewing into space that also contain salt and organic molecules. Nonetheless, with all the enthusiasm for finding life in the universe, this book is a welcome counterpoint."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"One of the most popular themes in science fiction is the prevalence of alien intelligent life in the Universe. While the supposed real-life abductions and UFO sightings may be silly, the scientific consensus has been that intelligent life is common in the Universe. Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee support the idea that simple life forms are common in the Universe, but contend in Rare Earth that any type of complex, multi-cellular animal life is extremely rare. Their book covers the \\"Rare Earth Hypothesis\\" which explores the difficulties that evolution overcame to reach today's complexity, as well as the special conditions of the Earth, Moon, Sun, and Solar System that produced the extended period of stability needed to foster complex life and prevent sterilization of the entire planet.I am nowhere near an expert on this topic, but as a scientist I found this book worthy of a review. I highly recommend it for its clear qualitative explanations of complicated scientific topics and its relatively neutral presentation of both sides of the more controversial topics. While readers may have qualms with at least some portion of the Rare Earth hypothesis, most will learn several important and indisputable facts about Earth's history that are essential to life today. The majority of readers will know about the \\"habitable zone\\" of the solar system, but may not be aware of the requirements of other types of stars, types of galaxies, and favorable regions inside of galaxies. The various ups and downs of the evolutionary pathway were also fascinating to read about, as life on Earth evolved little for billions of years and then rapidly diversified in the Cambrian explosion around 500-600 million years ago. The (controversial) reasons behind this explosion of life are essential for understanding how humans evolved and for assessing the timing of evolution on other hypothetical Earth-like planets. Unequivocally, it is relatively easy to create prokaryotes, even in extreme conditions, while evolving multicellular eukaryotes is much more difficult and requires several intermediary steps.I found the section on building a habitable earth to be especially thought provoking. The habitable zones in the universe are quite small due to a shortage of heavy metals near the edge and a close proximity of bodies that cause gravity perturbations or eject high-energy particles near the center. But since the Universe is expanding and heavy metals are becoming more common, perhaps solar systems like ours are rare now, but will become more common several billion years from now? Will the exploded remains of today's stars form into more favorable planetary systems in the distant future? Or, as the authors suggest, will radioactive elements have decayed too much to prevent plate tectonics on newly-developed planets? As with many other topics, there is no definitive answer and the reader is left to form his/her own opinions or conduct further research.The most difficult challenge facing Ward and Brownlee is testing the Rare Earth hypothesis. By their own admission, there simply is not enough evidence to confirm or deny some of the crucial aspects of their arguments. Not surprisingly, this is the greatest shortcoming of the book and the biggest reason why they are not completely persuasive. But as the authors contend, given the current available evidence, Earth may be the only planet with animal life in this portion of the galaxy, and even possibly the entire galaxy. When considering that the \\"Drake equation\\" predictions of a million or more intelligent civilizations, the contention for a far rarer Earth is quite reasonable, even without conclusive evidence for many of the authors' claims. The book is perhaps best characterized as the pessimistic answer to the overly-optimistic projections for life generated by the discovery of exoplanets in the 1990s.Still, the mathematical merit must be given adequate consideration. The \\"sample size\\" for testing various elements of the hypothesis is quite variable. We have good estimates for the total number of stars in the galaxy and the percentage of which are similar to the sun and with an acceptable amount of heavy metals (small quibble: the authors incorrectly cite the number of stars in the Milky Way as 200-300 million, it actually is 200-300 billion). The population of other life-inhibiting dangers such as quasars and magnetars can be reasonably estimated. But the extremely important presence of a Jupiter-like planet to fend off comets is mostly unknown, as it is only possible to measure \\"Hot Jupiters\\" and Jupiter exoplanets with highly elliptical orbits. The only complete sample of a solar system is our own. Earth is the only known planet with a large moon and plate tectonics, with the only other candidates for comparison being Venus and Mars. Models can estimate the probability of some of these factors, but the initial conditions are inherently biased without more complete data from other stars.Earth is the one and only example of life itself. From our perspective it may appear that animal life here emerged by pure chance. But we do not know the true odds of this chance. Is our evolutionary path the only one, with the other possibilities resulting in life remaining primitive or going extinct? Or is our planet just one possible path of many? The authors do present the possibility that plate tectonics may have actually inhibited life early in the Earth's history by slowing the oxygenation of the atmosphere. However, the details of the fossil record are so sparse that it is hard to know what actually existed, much less what could have existed in an alternate evolutionary paradigm. It seems nave to think that Earth's way is the only way--but it certainly could be.The opportunity for debate is actually a big part of the appeal of Rare Earth. The question, \\"Are we alone?\\" pervades popular culture and makes for great discussion. As mentioned in the preface, Rare Earth emerged from lunchroom conversations. The concluding chapter actually weakens the thesis by laying out alternate explanations to the Rare Earth hypothesis while offering nothing new to counter except references to the previous chapters. I think this is intentional--an attempt to provoke conversation--but perhaps the authors simply lack evidence or do not want to be redundant. Ultimately, there is no way to confirm or deny the Rare Earth hypothesis, so it may be many generations before this book's legitimacy is decided: either forgotten as an anathema to widespread discovery of other earths, or a groundbreaking beginning to our society's role as protectors of a very rare and special ecosystem."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"It is scientific, but it doesn't have the boredom of a chemistry class. Yet, it touches on those things you find in the Element Table. It reads somewhat like a novel about how the Earth came about, and why it supports life, combined with some of the complicated explanations from physics and chemistry that describe what was necessary to make it all happen. It does not talk about God, but as you read you can reflect on the intelligence that was necessary to produce all this, or you can simply give credit to science and leave all talk of \\"cause\\" out of it.It gives a lot of essentials--which I only skim over here--beginning with the \\"Big Bang.\\" From this came little more than three things--three elements: hydrogen, helium, and lithium. The hydrogen produced helium as a result of thermonuclear fusion. It was now the heaviest element in the universe. However, almost everything we take for granted to support life on earth requires elements heavier than helium--even the elements that make up 96% of the earth's mass--oxygen, magnesium, silicon, iron and sulfur! Where did these come from? How did they come about? It's a long story and complex--more than be explained here. But Peter Ward does explain the formation of the stars, planets, moon, galaxies, etc. It's really very interesting if you enjoy this stuff.What I found most exciting is when he talked about the formation of \\"carbon,\\" maybe because this has been tossed around as a political football. But this was the secret to having life in the universe. No carbon--no life--for a while! Carbon had to wait for the formation of giant red stars. These had such density that their inevitable explosions (and the thermonuclear fusion that accompanied them) were powerful enough to allow three way collisions of helium atoms to form carbon atoms. From carbon, heavier atoms could be formed. This all happened because the matter from the Big Bang was being cycled/recycled in and out of stars. Don't' believe it? The atoms of our bodies were once the matter of stars too! This gradually began to enrich the universe.In my very simple summation: our sun was formed by this process and such resultant matter. While it was forming, it was surrounded by millions of miles of gas, dust and rocks. As the sun grew hotter, only certain elements could survive in certain areas orbiting the sun. Planets were formed by those elements. Those closer to the sun were too hot to end up with enough nitrogen and carbon to support life. Those too cold wound up with an abundance of these but were too unstable to form solid surfaces. The earth was the only one to have the right surface warmth (climate/temperature) where all the elements could survive. It makes sense too! Our atmosphere is a precise mixture: 78.09% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.039% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases, which is what supposedly works out to be the best for forming hard surfaces and supporting life.Other things I found fascinating were the earth's characteristics and conclusions that can be drawn from them. One thing is that the earth is the only planet in our solar system that has water on the surface and a temperature range that allows it to always exist. It also has linear mountain ranges. These are not as important as the process that creates and adjusts them: plate tectonics. Although this is what causes such terrible things like earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, it is what is also responsible for acting as the planet's thermostat, by recycling chemicals which are crucial in keeping the volume of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere relatively uniform and liquid water abundant. It is also the cause behind changes in our sea levels and the formation of minerals that keep the levels of carbon dioxide in check (yes, global temperatures). It also make possible one of earth's greatest characteristics: its magnetic fields which above all protects us from deadly cosmic radiation.One of the pleasures this affords is that the author describes in much detail how all of this happens."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Writers Ward and Brownlee have put together a very readable text on astrobiology in their Rare Earth, Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe.

They discuss what it has taken for our Earth to evolve and what some other planetary systems may have that would allow \\"life.\\" They finally look at the Drake Equation and assess possibilities for other Earth-like existence. Some will differ in their opinion at the end."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This is a fascinating book. The authors address a fundamental question, \\"Are we alone in the universe?\\" They focus on various stages that other planets would have to go through to be like our Earth. They explain why each stage is very unlikely, and that this means our Earth is a very, very special place.The Drake Equations, developed by Frank Drake, were an attempt to make an intelligent guess on the number of space going civilizations in our galaxy, and the whole universe. There were several factors, each having to do with a stage along the path to a space going civilization. Some scientists came up with a number like a couple million space going civilizations in our galaxy. The authors of \\"Rare Earth\\" believe that this is way too high. They break down the various factors of the Drake Equations and explain why it is unlikely to get through that stage successfully.The authors make a large number of interesting observations. For example one of the things I found fascinating was in the last 500 million years there have been 15 mass extinctions of life on Earth. Another was just how important Jupiter being in a stable orbit has been in cleaning out random junk, thus reducing the amount of junk that could hit the Earth. Jupiter has probably cleared out 99.99% of the junk floating around our sun.For me the most interesting thing was what the moon was doing to the Earth billions of years ago. Current models show some body of matter coming close to the Earth, losing its iron core to the Earth, and then some of the left over matter forming into the moon. It appears the moon originally may have been 15 times closer than it is now, so the gravity from the moon would have been 225 times greater. It appears this generated land tides in which the land on the Earth might be going up and down by hundreds of feet every couple hours, with the \\"waves\\" going thousands of miles per hour.The book is full of many such interesting things. It is well written and I had a hard time putting it down. The authors comment on a large variety of topics relating to how unique our Earth may be. If you have any interest in this topic, this is a good book to read."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book and the explanations given therein. My bone with the authors is that they have stretched their conclusions (namely that life in the Universe is a rare event) way too far. The idea that Earth is a perfect place for life because everything is 'just so' is not really new. Arguments for intelligent design (code-word for creationism) follow similar logic. The problem with the logic of this book is that it assumes all life must evolve exactly (or nearly so) as it did here on earth (same requirements, same molecular structure etc). Although this may be true, we simply do not yet know if that is the case. The authors do indeed argue that this is true only for complex life and therefore the discovery of simpler life forms may not negate their thesis. However, we also do not have enough information to make such a broad sweeping conclusion regarding the Universe. Ultimately, the argument comes down to what we observe in our own solar system and indeed we may be a 'rare earth' insofaras the type of complex life we have here, but complex life in other forms may be common elsewhere in the Universe. Indeed, the solar system may simply appear 'rare' because we are in charge of defining the term. Nevertheless, this is a very entertaining book and I encourage you to read it with a critical eye."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"The thesis of this book is that \\"microbial\\" life is probably common in the Universe, but \\"animal\\" life is uncommon. However, in the process of developing this thesis, many assumptions about the possible forms that life might take are made but not analyzed. The particulars of the astronomical and geological history of Earth are examined in depth, and it is shown that for life exactly as it appears on Earth, it is likely to be the case that many of those particulars turn out to be necessary. Examples of such conditions are the existence of plate tectonics, the presence of a large moon, and the presence of a large planet (Jupiter) in a circular orbit well outside the Earth's orbit. The step that rings false is the inference that since such particulars may well have a lot to do with exactly how complex life developed on Earth, that therefore these particulars must obtain anywhere else in the Universe that complex life occurs.This book an enjoyable read, and is a really interesting summary of the astronomical, geological, and biological history of Earth, but the generalizations as to what may or may not occur elsewhere in the Universe are dubious at best. The implicit assumptions behind the major arguments in this book may turn out to be true, but I actually found the book very frustrating because these extremely important assumptions were never articulated, examined, or analyzed. Here are just some of what I believe are the major implicit assumptions underlying the argument in this book:- life anywhere must occur on an Earth-like (stony) planet- the planet must be in a \\"habitable zone\\" similar to the zone in which Earth exists -- a zone in which Earth life would be able to live- life anywhere requires the existence of liquid water- \\"complex\\" life anywhere requires \\"just the right amount\\" of liquid water, so that the entire planetary surface is not covered- life anywhere must be based on organic (carbon) chemistry- life anywhere must be based on similar biochemical molecules that support life on Earth- life anywhere requires the presence of trace quantities of heavy elements such as are produced in supernovas.- life anywhere must be organized as cells and groupings of cells- eukaryotic cells are a prerequisite for complex life- the category of \\"animals\\" has some natural analog elsewhere that life occurs (although, by hypothesis, this would be rare)- environments in which \\"extremophiles\\" live are actually \\"extreme\\" in an absolute sense, and not just the natural and \\"comfortable\\" (for them) environments in which certain types of organisms have evolved or survived(Other important assumptions, e.g. about the necessity of plate tectonics, a large moon, and a Jupiter-like planet in the system, are at least developed explicitly).I believe these assumptions are allowed to go unexamined because there is no attempt in the book to define in general terms what is meant by \\"life\\". Instead the example of life on Earth is used as a template in a very specific and geocentric fashion. Without addressing these issues, the theory about the relative cosmic abundance of \\"microbial\\" life and the relative scarcity of \\"animal\\" life in the Universe seem somewhat meaningless. The assumption that there must be direct analogs of either category strikes me as unjustified by the presentation here, even if it turns out to be the case.The thesis of the book, about the relative abundance of \\"microbial\\" and \\"animal\\" life in the Universe at large, almost seems like a side show compared to the attempt to show that complex life anywhere must occur in the same conditions as occurred here on Earth. Instead of using the example of life on Earth to speculate on the general conditions under which self-organizing, homeostatic, replicating, adaptive systems may occur, it is implicit in this book that life anywhere must be substantially similar in many details to life on Earth, and that therefore the particular conditions that led to complex life on Earth must be replicated in order for complex life to occur anywhere. The logic of much of the extrapolation of the book is inverted. Contingent events that happened on Earth are used as a basis of speculation about what might be necessary for life anywhere. It is hazardous to make proscriptive generalizations from a sample of size one, but that is done repeatedly in this book. I can't say they are wrong, but I don't find the argument convincing."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"It is refreshing to see some logic and science applied to an area where many prefer to apply mysticism - the belief that the universe either is, or is not populated by advanced life.

The more that is discovered the more I can see and understand the depth of rare earth ..."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"I bought this book right after reading Stephen Webb'sIf the Universe Is Teeming with Aliens ... WHERE IS EVERYBODY?: Fifty Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life. I wanted a more technical analysis of this intriguing subject and Rare Earth provided just that, and a lot more. The book carefully details the countless of factors that had to occur just right for life on Earth to end up where it is now. I found the book highly accessible even though I have no formal education in any of the fields that were heavily present throughout the book, namely astronomy, biology and geology. The only tiny problem I ran into, not being a native English speaker, is that I had to check a few technical words every now and then, the kind of words you don't normally run into (e.g., phyla, specific species' names etc.). This, however, merely helped expand my vocabulary.The book piles up tons of arguments to support its central hypothesis, that while simple life may be common in the universe, complex animal life is exceedingly rare. The book is at its best when it deals with the various astronomical factors that led to the formation of Earth and, ultimately, to the evolution of man. At few points, particularly with respect to evolution, the book does seem to suffer from a lack of imagination and seems to assume that if complex animal life is to evolve elsewhere, it has to evolve more or less the way it evolved here. This issue is not addressed until the sixth last page (of the paperback edition) and there it is dealt with only briefly. Also, around halfway through the book the central hypothesis seems to disappear too often as the focus shifts to detailing the origins of our planet. These are minor complaints, however, as the book is filled with relevant information and manages to cast heavy doubt on even moderately optimistic estimates of the frequency of complex animal life in the universe.Anyone interested in the subject (aren't we all?) should get their hands on this book.

The appearance of so many complex animal body plans so near the beginning of the rise planetary life as we know it is a reminder that we are missing something still in our theories of evolution.

I have long been aware of ergonomics in relation to my computer work area, but it never occurred to me to transfer that knowledge to my play area.

I found the sequence on relieving colic to be especially useful for me and my little one. My baby loves our &quot;Yoga time&quot; during the day!"},{"Title":"Baby Yoga","review":"BABY YOGA gives a beautiful insight into how the practise of Hatha Yoga postures can be introduced in a safe way to babies - from birth to toddlers - by their mothers, fathers and carers.The book is written from Dr. Freedmans personal experience as both a mother of four children and from work and research with mothers in the Amazonian Jungle and India where the practise of infant massage has long been a part of their cultural tradition.The book begins with an introduction to the benefits of baby massage and yoga - physical stimulation, suppleness and strength of the spine, benefits to the bodily systems as well as the 'bonding process' between mother and child are discussed.The exercises are divided into age groups - birth to eight weeks, eight weeks to four months and eight months+. The postures and relaxation techniques are introduced gradually, thus assisting the development of the chiles motor and sensory skills whilst being sensitive to their emotional needs. The mood in which the book is written is one of happiness and joy and on reading, one feels as though the idea of well-being reaches out and touches the reader.The sequences are gentle yet progressive and the methodology to each posture is detailed both in written and picture form thus making them easy to follow. The benefits to each posture are also explained - eg, the 'hip sequence' works on opening the babies hip and knee joints, tones the spine as well as working on the babys abdominal organs thus helping with conditions such as colic and other digestive complaints.Of course the baby isnt the only one to benefit from the practises detailed in the book. There is a very big emphasis on communication between mother and child both from a fun, energetic perspective as well as a relaxation angle. Many different methods of relaxation are included which can help the mother - eg relaxation and post natal depression.Specific ailments are also discussed, the article on crying was a fabulous read (pages 126/127) and one could imagine it would be an invaluable read to any new mother.Safety as well as performing postures appropriate to the childs age, needs and ability are very much a part of baby yoga. The book is very keen to stress that the mtoher 'make contact' and seek their childs permission before embarking on their yoga session. Handy tips such as never forcing a childs arms apart before they are ready as well as letting mum know that it is 'ok' to turn their child upside down (in the headstand) even if they get a few horrified looks from their parents and peer group!The book emphasises that yoga can become very much a part of everyday life. The section on relaxed holds (pages 40/41) and picking your baby up (pages 88/89) are a super read since no one really ever shows a new mother the correct way to hold their child that will safeguard the mothers posture and feel more comfortable to their baby.A wonderful read to anyone who has a newborn child or is considering becoming a parent. I would recommend reading it in conjunction with watching the Baby Yoga video.S Lynch - The Yoga Studio"},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"Dr. Metzger has given the reader an invaluable resource for the study of the text of the New Testament. The book is divided into three major parts. Part one begins with a detailed description of the ancient method of bookmaking. Next, Metzger lists the major Greek manuscripts and codices as well as a basic description of each. He also lists the major non-Greek witnesses (e.g. Syriac, Coptic, Latin, etc.) and discusses the role of quotations from the early church Fathers. Part two is devoted to the history of the printed editions of the Greek New Testament from the time of the Complutensian Polyglot and the Textus Receptus (the text used for the KJV) through Westcott and Hort until the present day. Part three is an instruction manual for textual criticism, including the many theories of criticism and the method of conjectural emendation. In this section, Metzger also discusses the many types of errors and deliberate changes made by the scribes. He then gives an analysis of several textually difficult passages (e.g. Mark 16 and Acts 20:28). The book also includes 16 photo plates that show selected manuscripts. A working knowledge of Greek is helpful because Metzger often cites Greek words in the text and footnotes without an English translation. If one wishes to learn the basics (and more) about textual criticism, then this is the book to buy."},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"This book is a vital tool to use in rebutting the Ex Cathedra heresies of the King James Onlyists. Virtually every page contains important information that the KJOs would rather not discuss. (Or discuss out of context, if they acknowledge it at all.) And while this book isn't devoted to KJVOism per se, it is a great resource for the anyone who actually wants to examine the evidence for himself, rather than relying on the words of Ruckman, Riplinger, Cloud, Waite, Grady, etc...For example, while Westcott-Hort are condemned by the KJVO crowd, Erasmus is practically placed on a throne and his own heresies are ignored. His tampering with the text is overlooked while Westcott-Hort are branded as every sort of apostate and heretic imaginable. One standard is applied to Westcott-Hort, another is applied to Erasmus.Was the text perserved? Of course it was. Just not in the manner that some would have you believe. There was no additional &quot;moving&quot; of the Spirit over Erasmus, the KJV translators, or Benjamin Blayney to prevent them from making errors. Let Rome have it's Ex Cathedra doctrine.A word of warning: This book is deep. It goes into a lot of detail regarding various Greek and Latin manuscripts, as well as early versions and Patristic quotations. It takes time to absorb everything this book contains. But don't give up! To truly understand the implications and details of the whole Bible version controversy, one needs a working knowledge of just how the Bible itself was transmitted down through history."},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"If you are interested in learning how the New Testament we read today came to be -- read this book. It is a tremendous overview of the sources that have been relied on that, taken together, make up the New Testament as we now understand it. It is fascinating to read about the divergences between different versions of the scriptures and the reasons for these differences, i.e., inattentive scriveners, etc. For those who may feel uncomfortable with this I should point out that Metzger is not seeking to undermine belief in the scriptures, in fact, he is the editor of the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible. However, he at no point allows his beliefs to interfere with his objective examination of the evidence. Obviously, he believes that such an examination should not undermine belief. As he states, no fundamental tenet of Christianity is impacted by the sometimes divergent readings in ancient manuscripts. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"This is the classic work on New Testament textual criticism. It is thorough, clear, and actually entertaining. However, it does need rewriting. The text of the book has not been changed since 1968. The author has just added appendices as new evidence comes to light. This makes the book a little cumbersome at times to read. Rewriting the appendices into the body of the text would make this book even more useful.***************UPDATE: This review was written about the 1992 edition. The 2005 edition addresses my criticisms."},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"Dr. Metzger's landmark encompasses a lifetime of scholarly work in the field of textual criticism and represents one of the best fundamental texts on the subject.

A must for those who are being introduced to this complex and broad field of study."},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"Metzger's book is a fabulous read for anyone serious in academic study of NT Textual Criticism (TC). Metzger introduces the reader to every possible arena of knowledge within the world of TC. From his opening sections on writing materials, types, and styles to his latter chapters on how to use TC, Metzger poignantly gives the reader everything he/she needs to know. Metger also does a great job at giving examples of meangingful papryri, manuscripts, and other documents. The only down side to Mezger's book is that it is not an \\"easy read.\\" Certainly the information is somewhat taxing, however, it is profitable to anyone who wants to learn the basics (and some advanced level information) of NT TC. All-in-all the book deserves five stars...it is simply an indispensible book."},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"For clearness of exposition and soundness of principles, and even correct if not beautiful typographical appearance, this is the best introduction ever to NT Textual History and Criticism.OK, the Eberhard NESTLE book of some ninety years ago is again available and is a well thought-of German pedagogical feat of a textbook, glory to it!_ but, truly, it's also painfully outdated.So, what? It's true that the updating of the third edition isn't done in the best possible way_ but, what do we have to offer? The ALAND and ALAND handbook? Of course, it is a good repository of the latest data in the field, but a good, readable textbook it isn't.The 4th edn (METZGER, EHRMAN,The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration (4th Edition)OUP) is really an updated and improved revision of METZGER's now classical text, well done and helpful overall. For sheer quantity of raw material the ALANDs still hold the sway, but theirs is in no way a readable or agreeable book.So, I think it's on the whole better to stick to METZGER, and -for a good updating- to get the EHRMAN, HOLMES bookThe Text of the New Testament in Contemporary Research: Essays on the Status Quaestionis. And don't forget the recent book by COMFORT,P.W.Encountering the Manuscripts: An Introduction to New Testament Paleography & Textual Criticism"},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"This 4th edition updates a classic by Metzger. The new co-author that joins the aging Metzger is from the liberal end of the spectrum, and a few of the new views expressed in the 4th edition put a lot of weight on a very few manuscripts that agree with a liberal interpretation. There is thus a section on the \\"Oppression of Women\\", for example. Although Metzger's well-balanced approach is thus in jeopardy, the book is on the whole a useful update to the 3rd edition."},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"I have used Metzger for over thirty years - all through the first three editions. Now for the fourth edition, the liberal higher critic, Bart Ehrman has been allowed to inject his tendential ideas. And, in my opinion, it has ruined the book. I am not doubting Ehrman's credentials - he was a student of Metzger - but he has an agenda, and that is evident in his additions to this edition. His feminism and radical view of early Christianity, as evidenced in his many other works, mars a classic work that deserved better treatment. Trust me, Metzger's theology is not shared by Ehrman. And his theology comes through, although textual criticism should not be agenda driven. I know that I will be skewered by some readers, but in my opinion a classic in the field has been marred by an editor who wants to steer readers away form the facts and toward his bias.If you don't know what I am talking about, just read his \\"Orthodox Corruption of Scripture\\" and his \\"Misquoting Jesus.\\"Give me back the third edition of this work - and spare me the musings of a man who admits he now denies the faith he once espoused."},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"If someone wants to know how we got the New Testament this would definately be the book I would recommend. Metzger starts off explaining how copies were made he then goes on to discuss the various versions and biblical manuscripts that survive. He then goes onto talk about the various Textus Receptus versions, Westcott & Hort and Textual Criticism. This is a good book if you're interested in how we got the New Testament and I would give it five stars even though it is a bit dated. The Appendix attempts to update it but it doesn't do a good job the text should've been rewritten.The problem with this book is it's dated. Since it was written some quite substantial manuscript discoveries have been made. Metzger is bias towards the Alexandrian text and relentlessly degrades the Byzantine text at every opportunity the reader should not ignore this. However, he takes the Westcott & Hort approach that the Byzantine was very late and has no ancient readings. He presents a very compelling argument that validates his view. However, the Chester Beatty Papyri and Bodmer Papyri of around 200 AD disprove his theory entirely. These were found after this book's publication and I do believe Metzger has updated this title.Going on the attitude of this book I don't think this will be enough to sway Metzger's view on the Byzantine text. He does note these discoveries in the Appendix but he trivialises their significance. In my opinion nothing short of a miracle is going to change Metzger's attitude on the Byzantine text. Now I don't want readers to think I'm a King James/Textus Receptus supporter because I'm not far as I am concerned they're archaic and should be treated as such. Its just I don't believe the Byzantine text was as corrupt as Metzger makes it out to be and from my own research it is not as bad as he makes it out to be."},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"This is a great book by Metzger, a must for any serious bible student. Goes to show why the KJV, or the Textus Receptus should be avoided when studying the New Testament Greek it is to modern of a text to be used. It is riddled with flaws so I would recomend the 27th addition of the New Testament Greek by Nestle & Aland witch used the most ancient munuscipts and Texts. The restoration part of this book is also very good, proving that the prophet mohommud of Isam was never even mentioned in the Bible the way Islamic's claim proving that he was a fraud. I would seriously recomend a book called Christians and Muslims at the tabled to prove Islam is not legit according to Islam scholars. Metzger book is a great study guide and proves to be very useful in better understanding the NTG."},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"Good historical stuff, but Metzger is full of generalizations which he just pulls out of his head. No evidence whatsover!His premise is that the Byzantine text is flawed. He then goes on to accuse the scribes which copied the Byzantine text of altering the text on a constant and regular basis. No evidence is given for these accusations other than they altered the text to make it conform to their beliefs or to make certain narratives more alike. Prove it Mr. Metzger.The manuscripts for the Critical Text of which Mr. Metzger is so fond was found in Egypt. Wake up boys and girls, that's where the Gnostic heretics lived. They had access to the egyptian manuscripts and were far more likely to alter them than a christian scribe who believed he was copying the actual words of Jesus or the apostles.The Byzantine church kept to the original teachings of Jesus and the apostles far longer than any other group. Let's give them the credit they are due."},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"I have not had time to read this text in its entirety; hence, a review is not in order at this time.

He therefore provides a great deal of useful reference information in this book, which should be accepted with the understanding that he is heavily biased.The reader should know that he is one of the five primaries working with the United Bible Society, in establishing their Greek Text Publications (UBS4 or GNT4).Mr. Metzger (writing name for George Collord), is fully sold on the Alexandrian Text-Type (primarily the Vaticanus Codex B and the Sinaiticus Codex Aleph). He discounts the Byzantine Text-Type.He also totally disregards the notion of Providential Preservation of God's Word, since that eventuality would negate his premise of &quot;Lost then recovered by eminent scholars&quot;.God says He will preserve His Word to all generations (not permit It to be lost then recovered 1400 years later):&quot;The Words of the LORD [are] Pure Words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.

For decades now, required reading in many if not most Christian seminaries. The 4th edition is co-authored with Bart Ehrman and is an excellent update on the state of the art. Before anything else, this book should be read with the intent of understanding the issues involved in studying the New Testament text. There is a tremendous variety of versions of nearly every piece of text in the New Testament.

For this reason, this work is an excellent resource. The book's scope includes an overview of the major papyri, uncials and minuscules. True, he is partial to the critical point of view, but who could blame him? Those who place more weight on the majority text are placing more weight on those codices that are much more recent, and are consequently further from the original. Compare Metzger's work with the pamphlet of Van Bruggen's lecture for both sides of the coin."},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"This is a difficult read. It was one of my texts for a seminary Greek exegesis class. Worth reading--in fact, every Christian should be familar with the information presented in this book.

These two books are wonderfull together, I constantly use them as references.This book is worth it's weight in gold!! Buy it! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"Very little needs to be said about this book. It's an excellent introduction to the manuscript history of the New Testament. The work is well-written, relatively easy to read, and could be used by introductory college classes in the subject. Indeed, it was probably written for that specific purpose. As a side note, Bruce Metzger is a Christian, while Bart Ehrman is an atheist. Metzger even makes an appearance in Lee Strobel's infamous \\"The Case for Christ\\", while Ehrman is the author of the bestselling atheist book \\"Misquoting Jesus\\". A piquant combination!The first chapter of \\"The Text of the New Testament\\" deals with the making of ancient books in general, to give the students a feeling for the purely technical problems involved when the New Testament was written down, \\"published\\" and re-copied. The next chapter presents the most important ancient NT manuscripts. The oldest fragment of any NT text is known as P52, contains a few verses from the Gospel of John, and has been dated to the first half of the second century. Naturally, the famous Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Alexandrinus and Codex Vaticanus are all discussed. Apart from the Greek manuscripts, Metzger and Ehrman also mention translations into Syriac, Latin, Gothic and other ancient languages. There are even fragments of a Nubian translation.The next two chapters give an overview of the history of textual criticism. For centuries, the dominant version of the New Testament was the Textus Receptus , based on medieval Byzantine manuscripts. Today, this manuscript tradition is considered inferior and is no longer used in Bible translations. Only a few fundamentalists still cling to it, usually in the King James Version. The last five chapters of the book are more technical. They deal with the methods used by modern textual critics. Of particular interest are the causes of errors in ancient NT manuscripts, including intentional changes. The notion that doctrinal changes caused Christian scribes to change the New Testament is a particularly contentious one.I warmly recommend this work for serious students."},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"This text provides and excellent introduction to the history of the development of the text of the New Testament. In doing so, Metzger makes am implicit argument for the value of textual criticism. At the same time, one senses a real passion for New Testament scholarship. This is a good companion to anyone learning Koine Greek and wanting to understand the history behing the study of New Testament texts"},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"Many facts concerning biblical Greek manuscripts that truly do exist can be found here, as well in books written by scholars of the opposite ideological bent. What makes for a challenge in reading such books is those occasions when assumptions and/or conclusions are presented as facts. Many of such \\"facts\\" can, and are, viewed differently by accomplished conservative scholars. Bart Ehrman, the brilliant Greek scholar who is the new partner in the latest edition of Metzger's work, is, unfortunately, radically bent toward a leftist viewpoint of the Scriptures. This leads to an over-confidence, typical of left-wing biblical scholars, that is deleterious to sound scholarship. In time, if the established history of left-wing scholarship holds, his work will become dated when another young and clever scholar devises some new theory concerning development of the ancient Greek text.For a more balanced, erudite view of this subject, one might want to read Harry Sturz' work.And for an opposing view, conservative to the bone, Maurice Robinson is the one to read. He is a capable scholar, though blinded somewhat by his right-wing prejudices, but one that can more than hold his own in the heated debate over the development of the Greek text, and who states categorically that Ehrman is guilty of several factual errors in this book."},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"This is the quintessential book on NT textual criticism. Metzger covers virtually every issue regarding how the New Testament came into being in this volume. His scholarship is thorough and detailed, his writing is easy to read and his passion for the subject matter is obvious. In addition to describing the process of tranmission fully, this book serves as an incredible reference tool for the papyrii, manuscripts (both individual and families), codices, textual variants, etc. Metzger even includes a section on the application of textual criticism with several example passages. A must-read for any serious NT student. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"OPENING REMARKSBefore trading in this book for Kindle credits, the reviewer thought he'd post his marginalia for posterity (or, more likely, just for his own amusement). This book has been THE standard text on its subject since well before anyone knew Bart Ehrman's name, and will likely remain so even if Ehrman remains true to his decision to leave off the practice of textual criticism entirely. Given the text's likely long future, with however many new editors and editions, this reviewer's comments may eventually be of interest to one or two other readers (counting the reviewer himself as one such reader, of course). The reviewer makes no profession to advanced expertise in the text critical field; his comments, therefore, are the reflections of an interested (and, he likes to think, thoughtful) layman. In this review, ALL CAPS stand-in for italics.SELECT QUOTES & COMMENTS (MARGINALIA)Page 13. Metzger and Ehrman text: \\"In any event, it is clear that it was the Christians who early adopted and popularized the format of the codex in preference to the scroll for their sacred books. Whereas among surviving Greek manuscripts of pagan texts, whether literary or scientific writings, only 14 of 871 items dated to the second century A.D. are in the form of a codex, all the surviving Christian biblical papyri of the same period are in codex format (11 in number). Of the approximately 172 biblical manuscripts or fragments of manuscripts written before A.D. 400 or not long thereafter, it appears that 158 come from codices and only 14 from rolls.\\" Reviewer's marginalia: \\"Assumes surviving manuscripts are roughly representative samplings.\\" Though Metzger and Ehrman here make only an assertion about the physical format of ancient texts, not about the verbal content, their assertion and the reviewer's comment have broader relevance. One thing the reviewer has noticed in mainstream works of New Testament textual criticism is a tendency to assume that very tiny numbers of long-lived specimens (typically long-lived because located in environments that are unusual; unusually dry, for example) may safely be treated as representative of what was generally available at the time such specimens originated. Is this a SAFE assumption, or just a WISHFUL one?Page 18, note 23. Metzger and Ehrman: \\"The earliest known minuscule Greek manuscript bearing a date is a copy of the four Gospels, now in the public library of St. Petersburg, with its all-important colophon dated 7 May 6343 (A.D. 845) by the monk Nicolaus....This manuscript has raised problems for scholars; paleographically, the handwriting appears to be too mature and fully developed to stand at the beginning of the minuscule period, yet no forerunners have been recognized among extant manuscripts.\\" Reviewer's comment (which he's starred): \\"Suggests earlier origin of minuscules, with earliest examples non-extant.\\" However correct or incorrect this inference might be, it struck the reviewer as sufficiently important a few years ago to put an emphatic star by it.Page 21. Metzger and Ehrman: \\"In times of economic depression, when the cost of vellum increased, the parchment of an older manuscript would be used over again. The original writing was scraped and washed off, the surface resmoothed, and the new literary material written on the salvaged material. Such a book was called a palimpsest....One of the half-dozen or so most important parchment manuscripts of the New Testament is such a palimpsest; its name is Codex Emphraemi rescriptus. Written in the fifth century, it was erased in the twelfth century and many of the sheets rewritten with the text of a Greek translation of 38 treatises or sermons by St. Ephraem, a Syrian Church father of the fourth century.\\" Reviewer's comment: \\"This NT manuscript was not thought too highly of by those who overwrote it, apparently.\\" Next to Page 22, note 25 (where Metzger and Ehrman make note of additional palimpsests and provide reference to a David C. Parker article with additional details), the reviewer adds: \\"Did believers tend to overwrite (and thus show disrespect for) a certain textform? See how these [by which he meant, the palimpsest manuscripts listed in Metzger and Ehrman's footnote] are classified into families.\\" (The reviewer never pursued this \\"research project,\\" nor does he know if it is something that's already been done. Any reader who finds the topic interesting should feel free to look into the subject further; the reviewer will not be doing so.)Pages 24-27. Metzger and Ehrman identify three periods of New Testament manuscript transmission: (1) was the \\"earliest ages of the Church,\\" when non-professional individuals produced large numbers of copies and translations, often with a high degree of error, and widely varying in quality. (2) was a period of dominantly professional reproduction by trained, commercial scribes, beginning when \\"in the fourth century Christianity received official sanction from the state.\\" Though the numbers-driver (commercial) nature of the work led to a procedure where multiple scribes would pen manuscripts based upon an oral reading, inviting certain types of mistakes, line-counting (also used for pricing) and review by trained error-spotters helped improve accuracy. (3) was \\"the Byzantine period,\\" during which monks, subject neither to pressing time demands nor commercially-driven production quotas, and working from originals they could see and read rather than from ones they only heard, copied out manuscripts \\"either for themselves or for some benefactor of the monastery.\\" The reviewer's marginalia only note his impression that each stage was progressively less error-prone than the prior one (not that potential for error even went away, of course). Relating this (now) to his earlier comments, it seems to the reviewer that the importance that one's sample be representative becomes greater as one seeks to reconstruct earlier periods of manuscript history. A manuscript (however fragmentary) lucky enough to survive from \\"the earliest ages of the Church\\" might be very good or, by Metzger and Ehrman's own account, very bad, gross errors in reproduction having been MOST PREVALENT during that early period. Does this state of affairs suggest that a heavy reliance on the the longest-lived (or, as the mantra would have it, \\"oldest and best\\") manuscripts is prudent? The reviewer remains skeptical.Page 69. Metzger and Ehrman: \\"In common with other manuscripts of the New Testament, the text of Vaticanus [text type: Alexandrian] is divided into what may be called chapters. The system of division, however, appears to be more ancient than that current in other early parchment copies of the New Testament. For example, in the Epistles no notice is taken of 2 Peter; therefore, the system of divisions appears to date from a time when this epistle was not regarded as canonical.\\" Reviewer's comment: \\"Or to have been created by an editor who did not view it as canonical, whatever Christians in general believed.\\"Page 70. Metzger and Ehrman: \\"Though the document [Codex Ephraemi] dates from the fifth century, its text is of less importance than one might assume from its age. It seems to be compounded from all the major text types, agreeing frequently with secondary Alexandrian witnesses but also with those of the later Koine or Byzantine type, which most scholars regard as the least valuable.\\" Reviewer's comment: \\"Note: text type determines importance; yet, importance of witnesses determines valuation of text types. Manuscripts are granted greater weight if they support Alexandrian readings.\\"Page 76. Metzger and Ehrman identify Codex Coislinianus as \\"an important codex of the Pauline Epistles,\\" but don't note any reason for their identification of it as important. They do note that it is \\"Alexandrian,\\" however. Reviewer's comment: \\"Important BECAUSE Alexandrian?\\"Page 77. Metzger and Ehrman: \\"Codex Regius is an eighth-century codex of the Gospels, nearly complete....Though badly written by a scribe who committed many ignorant blunders, its type of text is good, agreeing frequently with Codex Vaticanus (B).\\" Reviewer's marginalia: \\"Again, Alexandrian = Good!\\"Page 79. Concerning Codex Purpureus Petropolitanus (77), Metzger and Ehrman write: \\"The text belongs predominantly to the Byzantine type, but it preserves a number of readings of earlier types....\\" Comment: \\"note presumption that non-Byzantine readings are necessarily older ones.\\"Page 80. Metzger and Ehrman: \\"Codex Borgianus...is a valuable Greco-Sahidic manuscript of the fifth century....The text is very close to that represented by Codex Vaticanus (B).\\" Comment: \\"Yet again, Alexandrian = 'valuable.'\\"Page 81. Metzger and Ehrman: \\"Codex Monacensis....Though its text is mainly of the Byzantine type, it also contains occasional readings of an earlier type, akin to Alexandrian.\\" Comment; \\"Again, assumes Byzantine reading = late reading.\\"Page 87-8. Metzger and Ehrman note that Manuscript 33, of Alexandrian type, \\"has often been called 'the queen of the cursives.'\\" Reviewer's marginalia asks if this minuscule's royal status owes to its Alexandrian text type.Pages 88, 89, 90. Metzger and Ehrman identify Manuscript 81 as \\"one of the most important of all minuscule manuscripts\\" and note that it \\"agrees frequently with the Alexandrian type\\"; lament that Manuscript 579's Matthew is Byzantine, but rejoice that its other Gospels preserve \\"an extremely good Alexandrian text\\"; make reference to \\"a large number of pre-Byzantine readings, many of them of the Western type of text\\" in Manuscript 614 (thus identifying the Western text type as older than the Byzantine); and note that Manuscript 892 \\"contains many remarkable readings of an early type, belonging chiefly to the Alexandrian text.\\" Reviewer's marginalia: \\"Again: Alexandrian = 'most important'\\"; \\"Again, presumptive Alexandrian supremacy yields positive judgment of manuscript value\\"; \\"[Western type of text] presumed pre-Byzantine\\"; and \\"Again, circular [with a symbol for circularity rather the word 'circular].\\"p.127. Metzger and Ehrman (concerning New Testament quotations by Church fathers): \\"When the manuscripts of a father differ in a given passage, it is usually safest to adopt the one that diverges from the later ecclesiastical text (the Byzantine Text or the Vulgate).\\" Marginalia: an exclamation mark. This idea that what believers (or, the Church) tended most to receive and use, and which thus most multiplied and came to dominance, is most safely assumed AGAINST has never sat well with the reviewer.CLOSING REMARKSGranted, any non-specialist trying to assess text-critical methodologies does so without the \\"implicit knowledge,\\" the practice-acquired inarticulate awareness that may lie behind the assumptions of such expert text-critical practitioners as Metzger and Ehrman (cf. Polanyi's PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE). Though, to the reviewer, Metzger and Ehrman's approach seems in part driven by arbitrary assumptions and even circularities, it may be that Metzger and Ehrman have simply failed to make explicit some expert awareness the reviewer lacks. Of course, some experts in the text-critical field, such as those advocating Majority Text or Byzantine Priority theories, also doubt some of the standard assumptions. (A convenient sampling of a range of views may be found in David Alan Black, ed., RETHINKING NEW TESTAMENT TEXTUAL CRITICISM.) As well, the late Dr. Letis (author, e.g., of THE ECCLESIASTICAL TEXT), often suggested that \\"the quest for the historical text\\" (standard Metzger/Ehrman style textual criticism which, for example, naturalistically ignores what orthodox Christian faith has to say about its own text), leads unavoidably to \\"the quest for the historical Jesus\\" (by which he meant the higher-critical dismantling of the New Testament's message in favor of historical reconstructions at variance with that message). While probably overstated (anyone who corresponded with Dr. Letis prior to his untimely passing, as did this reviewer via email, should confirm the doctor's penchant for overstatement), Letis' suggestion does prove accurate in the case of Bart Ehrman, who followed the lead of his textual criticism right out of the Christian faith. Could it be that this Metzger/Ehrman text works from foundational presuppositions fundamentally at odds with consistently faithful Christian piety, that it in fact depends upon (and teaches to those who read it uncritically) naturalistic attitudes and methods inimical to the Faith (however at ease many believers may currently be with those attitudes and methods)?David M. Hodges21 October 2011"},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"If it already is not required in many seminary/religious studies classes, this book should be required reading.This book does not discuss Higher Criticism, or other Religious Studies methods. It focuses on Textual, or \\"Lower,\\" Criticism - which is the attempt to reconstruct or evaluate and collect the most \\"authentic\\" and accurate bible texts from the thousands of extant and varied manuscripts. This book is an excellent resource for learning this method.The book begins with ancient writing methods and details the physical form of extant manuscripts. From scrolls to codices, method of papyrus/parchment manufacture, and the ways ink were made. At first I wasn't sure if this bit was necessarry, but after reading it, I appreciated why this is not a minor subject. I am particularly interested in the Anthropology of Religion, and this includes material culture and archaeology.From there important manuscripts are discussed. Of the nearly 5,700 manuscripts of part or all of the New Testament, it was explained why the ones selected for this overview were important.If you come from a Christian background that ignores, or doesn't care about, the Church Fathers, (or are an atheist like myself) the end of Chapter 2 explains one reason why it is important to examine what the Church Fathers wrote.First, as is important for my focus on the Anthropology of Religion, it provides cultural information on the development of the Christian religion in temporal and spatial terms. Secondly though, as the book points out, their quotes from the bible within their own works can give you an idea of the form of certain bible passages at a certain known point in time... before many more later variations or variant readings crept in.Chapters 3 and 4 give the reader a brief historical overview of how manuscripts were chosen in the pre-critical and modern critical periods. For the grad student, chapters 5 and 6 discuss the current methods for performing Textual, or \\"Lower,\\" Criticism. It describes the technical nuts-and-bolts of how to find, among the thousands of extant manuscripts, the earliest and/or most \\"authentic\\" ones to use, and how to detect change, evaluate variant readings/passages, and so forth.For the believer, the facts presented in these chapters, as well as in chapter 7, may be hard to grapple with. These chapters discuss how to deal with the shockingly vast array of differences between manuscripts in their readings of any given passage. Chapter 7 discusses the types of errors in biblical manuscripts and how they got there. For instance, some insertions/additions were on purpose and are entirely new stories composed for competing doctrinal reasons (the \\"comma Johanneum\\" in 1 John 5, \\"pericope de adultera\\" in John 7-8, and others, for instance). Others were scribal errors or unintentional omissions, misspellings, etc.Those undaunted by the manipulation (intentional or accidental) of the bible's thousands of extant manuscripts will, at best, realize the compilation of any given modern translation is a large series of compromises. Finding \\"the authentic\\" words of \\"the original\\" is an impossibility. Regardless, after reading this book, one walks away with a huge appreciation for the work of the countless scholars and textual critics who have tried for centuries to get the best distillation of biblical texts.Chapter 8 gives a brief historical overview of how different manuscript types, or families, developed as well as their basic characteristics and geographical distribution. Chapter 9 concludes by displaying a few real life examples of how to perform Textual, or \\"Lower,\\" Criticism.For non-students, or lay persons, this book is still fascinating as it discusses the historical development of the bible. For grad students (like myself soon enough) it is an excellent primer on important techniques you will be using in the field. Also, for scholars, opposing scholarly views are discussed throughout, explaining the strong and weak points of alternate views and why consensus on some techniques/conclusions was reached.For the believer, it is important to know the complicated mess that is the bible in order to deal with these questions in an informed manner. I imagine atheists may read this book, only to find confirmation of their disbelief. For scholars though (both believers and unbelievers), this book is a must have. It is an introduction to your craft."},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"Even though Bart Ehrman is by no means a traditional conservative christian (as witnessed by his other books), he and his co-author know their manuscripts. As a passionate Biblical-Greek student, this book has has helped out a lot and given me a deeper understanding of not just the critical apparatus, but even the text itself. It's a must have tool if you're serious about being any type of authority when teaching or preaching on the Greek."},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"Bruce Metzger's work is a fascinating, in-depth study of how the New Testament (as it has been passed down to us) came about. This is a work that is filled with historical records, intrigue, and interesting facts that will interest anyone who has a desire to understand the goings on behind the scenes of the scriptures as we know them.I found particularly interesting his discussion of the choices that church Fathers made when deciding which texts were genuine and which were not. In one case, Origen had before him manuscripts that covered the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ and the murderer who was eventually freed--Barabbas. One manuscript included the Barabbas' first name, which was Jesus. So Barabbas' full name was Jesus Son of the Father (Bar-Son, Abbas-Father). This gives a sharper image of the choice the crowd had before them--between Jesus the Son of God, and Jesus Son of the Father. We know which one the crowd chose, and Origen chose the manuscript with only Barabbas' last name, claiming that no evil-doer could have been named Jesus."},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"I have just started studying textual criticism and this book does an excellent job of introducing the reader to the art and science of textual criticism."},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"I have been formally engaged in lower criticism of the Greek text for over 3 decades, have published 5 large volumes on the Syriac New Testament and Greek New Testament and still do not fathom the marketing verbiage associated with this, Metzger's standard volume. To state that some great fall from a textual tradition occurred in past textual transmissions is simply without evidence. That Bart Ehrman, the Dan Brown of lower criticism, is now associated with this excellent text is yet another reason to begin abandoning the tome in favor of more objective resources. I suggest going back to B.F. Westcott's History of the Canon... or to FF Bruce. Both far greater scholars than Ehrman. For all its value, Metzger is no longer an objective treatise but is rather based on an a-priori assumption of human need to restore a text that was never lost; an historical and evidentially false premise and unabashed tool for promoting the \\"need\\" for one's own publications.In my undergrad when performing a exhaustive Claremont Profile of variations in the Synoptics, (Using SCE Legg, and all lower textual treastises), I learned from nearly every tradition of text that variations were not historically cyclical, bore no pattern of misguided or mal-intent, nor did they appear to be theologically driven. These things were evident in the peudopigrapha but not in the transmissional text of the NT. Most variants were Atticisms, (in an attempt to produce a refined \\"Greek\\" translational form using Koine as a basis), simple conjugation errors, connective, eyesight errors, (dittography), and common mis-spelling errors. Ehrman's fantastical leaps of textual causes rest solely in his desire to sell greater volumes, but not in fact. That Ehrman is now associated with this text should come as a warning to those of us who respect the objective science of textual analysis. I now say no to this tome until Bart Ehrman is removed from it.

A book that should put to rest all those who say that the New Testament is unreliable witness to Jesus. Read and see the Truth ."},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"I could just say that this is a bad book, but it seems better to present some evidence of why, so I took some time to create this review. First, please note that Metzger was a liberal theologian (not a fundamentalist) and Erhman is a self-admitted agnostic. That doesn't mean that everything in the book is wrong, but it does raise a red warning flag. What follows are some of their claims, assumptions and admittances with page numbers so the reader can verify as he/she chooses and get a general idea of what this book presents.1. Pages 183-184: Mezger/Ehrman admits that Westcott/Hort's higher criticism is subjective (not based on observable evidence); Yet, the authors believe it is the best method for determining truth.2. Pages 227-228: The author's proclaim that conjecture must be perfect in order for it to stand as fact. Yet, many of the ideas presented in the book are conjectural without any observable facts to back them up.3. Page 232: The authors claim that methods involving scientific principles are in operation with regard to modern higher textual criticism (this refutes claim number one; or is it the other way around?).4. Page 238: Authors admit to use of circular reasoning in determining original text (by the Alands who are just as much higher critics as Metzger and Ehrman are).5. Page 240: Admittance by authors of the \\"necessity\\" of a humanistic approach to determining the original text (they never mention a preference for being guided by the Holy Spirit within the book).6. Page 245: Pronouncement that analysis cannot determine best texts (what happened to the scientific method idea?).7. Page 254: An admission of omission by scribes (including in their favorite texts - Aleph and B).8. Pages 256-257: An admission of nonsense being written by scribes (including within their favorites).9. Page 258: In a section entitled \\"Errors of Judgment\\" there are a number of assumptions that the authors shift toward the 'fact' department as the book moves forward.10. Page 265: The authors admit that the Vaticanus conflates (the very thing that they accuse the Textus Receptus supporters of doing).11. Page 273: An admission of their belief in the possibility that the original text could have been errant (of course, this is a clear statement that the authors do NOT believe in inerrancy).12. Page 275: An assumption of errors within the text (I agree on this point with regard to the texts that sourced from Alexandria).13. Page 277-278: While this book is well footnoted, it almost never has notes listed for its most outrageous claims. Here the authors claim that the Alexandrian text is the best and yet have no footnote to support that claim and very little verbiage to support said claim and NO evidence. The support for this claim is in their assumptive secondary claim that the \\"...textual witnesses connected to Alexandria attest a high quality of textual transmission from the earliest times...\\" Yet, they previously admitted errors, omissions, nonsense, etc... having come out of Alexandria.14. Page 278: Here the authors admit that Origen is one of the sources and centerpieces of their higher criticism, but offer no evidence to support that other than the assumption from item 13 (above). Methinks they need to read more about how flawed an individual Origen really was. He castrated himself, he didn't believe in the Trinity, he didn't believe in inerrancy and held a number of other untenable theological positions.15. Page 279: The authors suggest (assume) conflation in the Byzantine text, but offer no proof other than \\"...nearly all the critics today...\\" agree on this point. This assumption is a classical logical fallacy.16. Page 300: The authors claim the best criterion for choosing the best text is the \\"common-sense\\" method of choosing \\"the reading that best explains the origin of the others.\\" Of course, the authors make no mention of being guided by the Holy Spirit on this point, so it ends up being an arbitrary choice of the best text.17. Page 304: Admission that textual criticism is at least partially an art (not totally scientific) - it is not scientific at all, but I won't belabor that point.18. Page 306: The reason for discarding the Byzantine witnesses is clarified here (not old enough by their standards). By the way, the reason most are not old enough is because most of the oldest ones were well used by early Christians. Used books fall apart. Unused books do not. I wonder why the Vaticanus and other Alexandrian texts survived in such good condition?19. Page 318 (and from many, many, many other pages): the free use of the words \\"it is easier to believe,\\" \\"probabilities,\\" \\"there is no discernable reason,\\" \\"it is easy to understand,\\" \\"may be historically correct\\" and on and on and on. Unfortunately, most of these assumptions mysteriously become fact somewhere within the pages of this book.20. Page 322: The Vaticanus admitted to be doubly in error.I could list many, many more examples, but I'll stop here. I recommend this book for those who wish to gain an understanding of the arguments in favor of textual criticism. However, I recommend the reader familiarize himself with books that render better arguments in contraposition to Metzger/Erhman's views such as: Which Bible? edited by David Otis Fuller, Which Version is the Bible? by Floyd Nolen Jones, Forever Settled by Jack Moorman, The Causes of Corruption of the New Testament Text by John W. Burgon, and/or Defending the King James Bible by D.A. Waite. I know Christians who think that they understand this argument well, but I can attest that they do not. If you have not read any of these books that I just listed, please take the time to carefully read at least one of them and allow the Holy Spirit to lead. Don't believe your trusted family member, friend or favorite seminary professor. They too may have been deceived on this issue. This is NOT about King James only (those who think that - you know who you are) - its bigger than that. Read Proverbs 9:7-10 and consider those words carefully."},{"Title":"The text of the New Testament","review":"Book was received in perfect condition and in great timing.

Spenser with help from the police ferrets out the killer who happens to be a patient of Spenser's love interest, psychologist Susan Silverman. The predictable story moves along until the energetic conclusion of Spenser taking down the killer.Spenser is called to the case as the fear of racism overtakes the city. Each victim is a black woman with a similar M.O. on each murder. The red herring of an unrelated murder is merely a distraction to someone of Spenser's detection experience. Spenser quickly puts together that the killer is a patient of Susan who proceeds to walk a tightrope of protection of her client and maintaining confidentiality with the need to stop the killer. As she gets in harm's way, Spenser tightens the screws, forcing the killer to make mistakes until he is captured.What could have been a mundane book becomes a deep insightful study of the causes of mental problems leading to serial killers. Dr. Silverman recognizes the issues the led to the deaths and proceeds to help Spenser while keeping her professionalism intact. Each chapter is packed with clever perception, bold intelligent statements, and a shimmering energy of excitement. This makes for a page-turning book that is both suspenseful and intellectually satisfying.Highly recommended for mystery/suspense readers and Robert Parker fans. Exceptional writer who will be sorely missed."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"Parker is a master with words. He says so much in so little. Wonderful characters with humor and intelligence."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"I've tried to read this series in order, yet somehow I missed this gem. Going back in time (before even Pearl I) reminded me why I remain loyal to this series. Spenser brings us along every step of the way as he tries to solve Boston's Red Rose Murders. One of his moves (I won't spoil it here) makes you wince as he does it because we know, as surely he must, that he won't get away with it, but we sense his frustration and know why he must give it a try. The villain of this piece is nuts, and there's unpredictability that reasonably goes a long with that. Having the villain share narration duties with Spenser helps heighten the suspense. And then there's Susan. I have never been a fan of hers, but she's integral to the story and for once isn't desperately obnoxious! In fact, when she's in \\"Dr. Silverman\\" mode, she's interesting and even earned by grudging respect."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"A truly adult story, with an eerie feel to it unlike most Parker stories. THe story presented chracter development in Belson and Quirk and displayed a deeper understanding of the Spenser/Silverman relationship. The most satisfying Spenser I've ever read."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"Spenser is called in by the police on a murder investigation in this, the 15th book in the series. There is a serial killer on the loose - the killer is targeting black women in their 40s, binding and gagging them and killing them in a most gruesome manner. His signature? A single red rose. As race and class tensions rise in Boston, the police put pressure on the team investigating the murders - and Spenser - to close the book on this as quickly as possible.As Spenser edges closer to the truth, the killer targets Susan. With the police off the case (due to the confession of another man), Spenser calls in Hawk to help him. The two primaries on the murder investigation - Quirk and Belson - are asked to take vacation, because they believe that the wrong man is in jail. They join Spenser in protecting Susan and trying to find the killer.The action in this book comes and goes - but when it is there, it is high intensity! This book is a thriller and a rather gruesome serial killer murder mystery. As such, it is atypical of Spenser - not to say that murders do not occur, just that usually murder is not the crime Spenser is investigating. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this book a great deal - a recommend from me!"},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"I love Robert Parker, and enjoy many of his novels. I've always found his Spenser series to be uneven -- some of the books are spectacular, but many of them are just passable.I would put CRIMSON JOY in the \\"passable\\" category. A serial killer is on the loose, and Spenser is tapped by the Boston police to help find him. Apparently, Spenser is better trusted than their entire detective force. Spenser later learns that the killer many be one of the patients of his long-time psychologist girlfriend, Susan Silverman, and that her life may be in danger.CRIMSON JOY is readable, and most of the dialogue is fun. But there is very little story in this novel. The serial killer plot is pretty simplistic. Parker focuses more attention on Spenser's relationship with Silverman, and the constant love talk between them. If you've read the more recent Spenser books, you know what I mean by this. There's also a lot of padding in this book, with numerous scenes that have little relevance to the serial killer plot. So we see Spenser at the gym, Spenser cooking, Spenser on a radio show, and so on.If you like Parker's writing, as I do, then reading CRIMSON JOY is a decent way to spend a few hours. But if you're looking for an exciting, multilayered story to sink your teeth into, my advice is to try something else."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"My husband and I are big fans of the Spenser series. He has read all of them; I have not, but I'm working on that. My husband wasn't all that crazy about this book and the following three (Playmates, Stardust, Pastime). I can't get into Playmates because I'm not a basketball fan (AT ALL), but I found Crimson Joy to be pretty good. I like psychological thriller type stuff. This may not be the most thrilling psychological mystery one could read, but I liked it a lot for what I think it is intended to be. The only reason I bring up the other three books is because if you read Crimson Joy and you like it, you might be more likely to enjoy the next three. I haven't gotten there yet, but I intend to read all of them (if I can get through that dang basketball!). I won't go into the plot, you can get that from other reviews and the synopsis. I do recommend the book, though, and that's what counts here."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"I have always loved RBP's books especially the Spenser character I was so sad to hear he had passed but am glad they completed what stories he had started prior to his passing"},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"Spenser and Susan must track down a serial killer who leaves a red rose next to each victim. I read this while sick in bed, and it was a perfect read for that setting. A solid entry in the Spenser canon. A little more disturbing than your average Spenser novel, just by the fact that it's a serial killer with sexual dysfunction."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"I reccomend almost any Spenser novel to the uninitiated. Like goood wine, however, they can be habit forming! I'm addicted to the quick wit and sarcasam employed by Spenser. You will never learn much from a Spenser story but you will never get bored either and time, though short, will burn away rapidly.If you like Boston and environs geography, sharp repartee, clever wit, and enjoyable characters you will enjoy almost any Spenser story."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"I've been reading the few Spenser books I've missed over the years and Crimson Joy was one of them. The interaction between Hawk and Spenser is great as usual but if I would be a fan of Silverman (which I'm not), I'd be lukewarm about her role in this particular story. One thing unusual about this story line is that it's pretty gruesome and more like a Patterson book vs the Spenser books I love. No matter, I recommend all Parkers Spenser books as EZ entertaining reads. The interaction and personalities depicted are my favorite part (Quirk always a welcome addition)."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"The first thing I noticed and liked about this \\"Spenser\\" book was that it was 292 pages, one of the longer ones. Then I was delighted that Hawk played an active role in the story--always a plus.A severely psychotic serial killer, a white man, is killing Black women in Spenser's hometown of Boston, and Quirk and Belson of the Boston PD request Spenser's help. Conveniently, Spenser is not bound by the rules required of a police officer. He can break into places without a warrant, harass people, exchange favors with mobsters, all kinds of fun things.When the serial killer gets too interested in Susan Silverman, Spenser's girlfriend, the job becomes personal. Yet before the story ends the killer is eliciting Spenser's pity, and probably the readers' as well.Susan Silverman, the woman Spenser puts so high on a pedestal she probably needs to wear an oxygen tank, is detestable. She is vain, self-centered, insensitive and materialistic, with a Ph-D from Harvard, which she never lets Spenser forget. She says degrading things to him which are supposed to be taken as jokes, daintily picks at her food, sips and nibbles in such an affected way, that it makes me wish I could reach into the book and smack her upside the head. In several stories her pigheadedness and determination to have her own way have put Spenser and Hawk in life and death situations for which she never seems to feel any guilt. I would be delighted if she did not exist.I've read most of the thirty-something Spenser novels. I've not read one I did not thoroughly enjoy--some a little more than others. Crimson Joy may be one of the better ones.There is an enigmatic thread in regard to Spenser and Hawk's relationship that runs through all the stories. It becomes more profound, or at least is emphasized more as the stories progress. Crimson Joy is one of the stories in which this unfathomable connection is particularly noticeable. They appear to be more than friends, more than brothers, lack the physical connection to be lovers, yet they seem to be a combination of all these things. They trust each other unconditionally. Their respect for each other borders on idolatry. They would die for each other, and have proven their willingness to do so any number of times. Hawk almost always calls Spenser \\"Babe\\" (in A Catskill Eagle he even called him \\"Honey\\"), Susan once made a snide remark about them eloping together, and in Crimson Joy when Hawk made a remark that a woman was falling in love with him, Spenser said, \\"I don't blame her.\\" There are many other such examples. Yet they are both wild about women. The undefinable bond between them is one of the important reasons I have been drawn to the Spenser novels."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"I have read and reviewed the first fourteen Spenser books and now to fifteen, CRIMSON JOY. Why aren't you reading this series?? Parker has created a great series with good story lines and such rich characters. They are all in this one, Spenser and instead of meddling is invited by Lt. Quirk and Detective Belson to help them, Hawk,not a huge role, and Susan Silverman, great book for her character. Serial killer on the prowl, might be a cop, but definitely a sickie."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"This time the reader was grabbed by the neck and held for a while as CRIMSON JOY opened onto an in progress investigation of a fresh murder scene of the Red Rose killer's \\"signature.\\" From there the plot ran relentlessly into the seamless consequences and serious carnivals of media, political, and social \\"consciousness\\" pushes polluting professional pursuits of a serial killer. Parker had precisely pegged the gestalt of this \\"scene\\" and its take-off sidelines, with this # 15 in the Spenser series featuring the king pin of Boston homicide detectives, Lieutenant Quirk. Serving as his posse were Sergeant Belson, Spenser, Susan, and Hawk.Presented on page 67 of the current mass market paperback, was one of the most cleanly accurate dialogues I've read of the position and essential attitude of a professional police person in charge of such a situation. Quirk, the good-guy cop (those types do exist), was confronted by representatives of the worst examples of human self-enhancement posed as social consciousness, from a shark-frenzied media, higher-echelon police presence, racial political-punk, religious frock, and feminist frizz (\\"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly,\\" exist in each of those Rings).And the mad-cap chase was on.Realistically, though, with Parker unable to present it any other way, this type of investigation gets nowhere fast, through grueling, non-stop, prime effort of dedicated noses sniffing dirt, and grinding stones.(I worked for a couple months in 1985 in Portland, Oregon and Tacoma, Washington, with a couple private detectives trying to pick up the Green River Killer's trail. I'm still not sure what trail we were following, but it didn't give a successful conclusion at that time, fast, slow, or otherwise. Ann Rule recently published a flawlessly professional book, GREEN RIVER, RUNNING RED, about that horrifying nightmare's various trails and conclusions.)So, the chase was on, in CRIMSON JOY. The actual investigation (in this Spenser novel) had begun effectively and efficiently a day or two prior to the rush (even though getting nowhere fast is the result for a frustratingly long time for heroic pursuers in this reality \\"show\\") and would continue relentlessly, in spite of being watched by a carnival of the calculated concern of users of the situation. Observing through Spenser's eyes those humans who pose primely (and primly) in pseudo-self-righteousness while they're using a serial killing arena to further professional, social, or personal causes; I was wondering (as directed by Parker's crisply chosen words) where the evil of rankest stench stewed. Was it in the killer, in his background, or in the foreground of the words: \\"We're watching you, Quirk, to be sure you do your job to the specifications of our suck-power interests.\\"As anyone who has read even a few pages of a Spenser novel would know, he has a nose to sniff the goods on anything, even in innocent seeding phases of personal rot. Hold your noses, folks, and dive in. Before taking the riveting descent, however, be aware of your time, place, and reading pose. You might not be leaving that setting before you crack the book's spine in the middle. Not to worry about time as much as muscle strain. The reading speed could be near double your norm for a Spenser novel, and the sinew tension should be set and held by the third line.This plot is cold, as it should be. It's not over shocked; yet it's true to base reality, as it should be. Having read and reviewed the first 14 and a few of the later Spenser novels, I would expect no less from this author honoring through prime literature, sub-cultural significance in three pivotal decades of human evolution.CRIMSON JOY is another insightful winner in the Spenser annals, not only flawlessly featuring all the above, but also allowing Spenser and Susan's relationship to culture-out cleanly in the heat of overlap of their personal and professional lives, as they slosh as a team in the middle of this carnival's sewers.It's interesting to me, from our current temporal perspective, to note the original copyright date of each Spenser novel. I then note the fact that a book is usually conceived and written a year or two prior to the copyright date, around situations which had begun brewing a year or so prior to a novel's conception. Most often, in the case of an established, successful author, that manuscript would have been published around a year after the copyright date. Of course, in this Third Millennium these time frames are in flux, getting wherever faster.Linda Shelnutt"},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"There's more than one interesting twist in this installment of the Spenser series, evidence that Parker's working hard to stay out of a rut.First, this is a bit more serious than usual in that the unknown killer is a psychopathic serial killer. Our hero isn't quite up to his usual quota of wisecracks.Secondly, some of the narrative is from the killer's viewpoint, a first for a Spenser novel.Thirdly, there is a hint at the Harry Bosch type conflict between solving a case and playing police politics &amp; protecting the police image. (This was written 4 years before the first of the Connolly series)And fourth, there's a real testing of Spenser's relationship with Susan as there's a serious conflict between his need to protect her and her need for autonomy &amp; adherence to her profession's practice of condifentiality between doctor &amp; patient.The reader might have a bit of trouble suspending disbelief over the points of Spenser's openly working with the Boston police and of the extreme coincidental factor, but it is an entertaining read up to the average Spenser."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"This is a departure for Parker, as some of the story is told from the point of view of the villain. It's a very suspenseful read, and I liked how how strong Susan was; you may not always enjoy her, but in this one she seems to be a person apart from Spenser, which gives her some reality. Not just a pretty face who finds it &quot;irresistable to be loved so completely.&quot; My biggest problem is Parker's simplistic Freudian psychology. Guess why the serial killer kills? Surprise - it's his mother's fault. Parker does tend to take the easy and obvious route with the motivations of his characters, and that isn't always a bad thing, but it gets wearying when you read the whole series. Spenser, the ultimate autonomous man, would never say his father (or anyone else) is responsible for his actions. So why should anybody else's parents take the blame? Gimme a break."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"This is the 15th story in the Spenser series, enjoyable and not one of the best. The main characters are here: Hawk (always like this cool character), Quirk, Belson, and of course, psychotherapist and main squeeze Susan Silverman. RBP lays out a good story with the cop-shrink conflict in releasing information, with the usual witty repartee back and forth between them, and as always, the dialogue with Hawk is superb. I always appreciate how fit Parker must have been, because as he got older, he could still recall and relate how some of the physical acts occurred like fighting and running (or was it good writing and a creative imagination?). I am always searching for the RBP's books that I missed while living my own good life. Good job RBP - rest in peace."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"Book descrbed as \\"very good\\". The book that was received was extremely old with all pages yellowed and dusty.Should have been given a much lesser grade! Other book sellers on this site provide more accurate descriptions!"},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"A serial killer is on the loose; he binds his black female victims, strips them naked, sticks his gun in their vagina and pulls the trigger. Once he commits the act, he masturbates and leaves a long-stemmed red rose with the victim. After three murders, Belson and Quirk are getting nowhere and they have a strong suspicion that the killer is a cop. Therefore, they call in favors and recruit Spenser to aid them in the case. He complies and has the same suspicions. The killer taunts Quirk to try to catch him and the news media and local politicians all join in the clamor, raising the race issue.They suffer a setback when a black man tries to get away with killing his wife by performing a copycat murder. He doesn't quite do it to perfection and Quirk and Belson easily recognize the situation. However, the people higher up are more than happy to believe that all cases are solved. Quirk and Belson then take a \\"vacation\\" to continue their search.The situation takes an immediate turn to greater immediacy when a man tries to break into Susan Silverman's apartment. Spenser is there, fights him off, but his pride suffers a hit when the man is able to leap over a fence and get away while Spenser is unable to clear it. The assailant also leaves a rose behind and kills Susan's fish.The man is a client of Susan's, and this fact is soon discovered by Susan, Spenser and Hawk. There is a climactic final scene when Susan and Spenser confront the killer in front of his clearly psychotic mother. Susan backs Spenser up with a gun, but the killer runs away. Spenser has no trouble chasing him down and the killer ends up sobbing in his arms.While this story is good, it lacks the interesting dialog of other Spenser novels. Spenser, Quirk, Belson and Hawk are all very serious, rarely engaging in any of the wisecracking banter that is the signature of the best Spenser novels."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"This addition to the Spenser series as a little hard to get into. The story was rather farfetched - Boston has a serial killer, so the Boston police ask Spenser to find the killer?And of course he is a nut-case, so of course you can guess who his counselor is, so of course we have another somewhat boring Susan is in distress story. She's just his girlfriend, she shouldn't take up so much of Spenser's time.Come on Parker, you can do better than this."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"How dumb and coincidental is this - the bad guy is a patient of Spenser's girlfriend. This is good for readers who can't keep 4 characters in a book straight. He's done much better.

And I didn't know anything about Spenser before I met him in Crimson Joy. I don't know - I thought maybe Sam Spade; dark, rainy nights, bare light bulbs in a dingy office.Boy, was I wrong.In this book, Spenser and friends are up against the Red Rose killer. The bad guy is quite obviously a psychological case, so Spenser's psychologist girlfriend gets to be a partner in crime as well as in bed, with delightful humor and good will. They're both such really great people, it's fun to be around them.Spenser is in great physical shape; he's brave and witty; he's a gourmet cook. He's never ruffled. Faced with a slime talk show host or a five-thug citizen pressure group, his wit, strength, and courage save the day.Okay, it might all be too good to be true, but this is a story. It's comfortable, funny, fast-paced, breezy and uncomplicated. The plot is clever enough to interest, even if the outcome is surly a foregone conclusion.In Spenser's words, &quot;To be who I was and do what I did had to assume I'd win.&quot; That's how I felt from the start and I was glad he was who he was and did what he did and I loved every minute of it."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"I have been reading Spenser since I was a teenager and this is one of the best I have read.The case in the story, a serail killer who leaves a red rose at the scene of the crime, is a heart wrenching one. As the case developes the novel gets more intense and more belivable.Then when the reader thinks the case is resolved Parker throws one last heart wrenching detail at his readers. This is parker at the top of his craft. A must read for any Spenser fan."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"What a relief! After reading A Catskill Eagle I started to worry that Parker was losing me with his &quot;Spencer as Rambo&quot; style. But Crimson Joy gets back to what made Parker a superb mystery novelist: Spencer solving a mystery and tracking down the criminal. There is a lot of police involvement in this one as Spencer agrees to help out our favorite detective, Martin Quirk. Hawk helps out, which is always a plus, and there is the added suspense of Susan being put in the path of danger as she becomes involved in her role as psychotherapist.A Crimson Joy is a top notch Spenser novel and I highly recommend it for all fans of the crime novel. I can't wait to read the next in the Spenser saga!"},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"In Crimson Joy, the indomitable Spenser turns his focused, deadly attention to tracking down a psychopathic killer who leaves a red rose on each of his female victims. Spenser is joined by Hawk, his soul-brother. In fact, the strong bond between Hawk and Spenser, explored in the humourous and touching dialog between the two is a nice bonus (in this as in other Spenser stories).When the killer turns his attentions to Susan, the love of Spenser's life, the case becomes dramatically personal for Spenser and for Hawk, too, who, in his quiet, intense way is as devoted to Susan as to Spenser.The narrative is fast-paced and the dialog tight and compelling. But don't think that the author lacks a romantic soul - for every so often comes a descriptive line of real poetry, as in&quot;...the slim gold of nature's first green beginning to edge out on some of the shrubs.&quot;Likewise, Spenser himself is no one-dimensional problem-solving tough guy. He is an intelligent, cultured man with a strong sense of morality. He knows he is in fact his brother's keeper. (And his woman's protector.) He demonstrates genuine human sensitivity - &quot;The thing about monsters is, you want to kill them until you meet them, and when you meet them they don't seem monstrous, and killing them begins to seem unkind.&quot;The end of the story provides an interesting twist which leaves the reader knowing more about the killer and his motivations than the characters in the book every learn.Each one of the Spenser stories adds to the accumulated lore about Spenser, Susan and Hawk. You won't want to miss this one."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"This book is a typical Spenser for Hire book, for better or for worse. You know the routine by now: capable of a read in a single sitting; the witty repartee; the sassy and cocksure internal narrative by Spenser; the sparring with Hawk to mask the mutual feelings of respect; the surprisingly clever descriptions of characters; the Boston settings depicted with pride. Parker is to be commended on his choice of words, because although his stories are so brief, they say a lot and don't waste much time. In fact, I describe the Spenser stories as compact more than short. They are powerful in that Parker never lets you forget he is a wordsmith, and capable of great bursts of creativity and humor.Crimson Joy is not as action packed as other Spenser books, and is more cerebral. Susan plays more of a role in this one, too, and thus it has a lot of psychological overtones. This makes the book interesting from a clinical sense, but some readers might miss the fighting and machismo. This book is kind of sexy, too, in terms of its exploration of Spenser and Susan's relationship, though it never stoops to being crude or raunchy. [I keep forgetting these are just racy enough to prevent their becoming family books, since I find myself wanting to recommend them to folks of all ages.]"},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"After the epic conclusion of &quot;A Catskill Eagle,&quot; Robert B. Parker's next couple of Spenser novels seemed rather pale in comparison. Although he went from imitation James Bond back to more traditional, intimate adventures for our hero, it certainly seemed like Parker was just going through the motions by the end of &quot;Pale Kings and Princes.&quot; I was a feared that this series was going into decline. However, those doubts were quickly assuaged by the beginning of &quot;Crimson Joy,&quot; which hooked me immediately and convinced me Parker was trying to reclaim the high groundUltimately &quot;Crimson Joy&quot; is a very atypical Spenser novel for several key reasons. The first is that there are interludes told in the first person perspective of someone other than Spenser. In this case it is a serial killer called the &quot;Red Rose Killer&quot; because he leaves a long-stemmed red rose on the corpse of each woman he kills. Periodically we hear the killer's thoughts as he has a session with his psychiatrist, and if THAT does not set warning bells off in your head you are not paying attention. Second, because we have access to the mind of the killer, this book has a much grittier tone than any of its predecessors. No matter how much pity you feel for the killer, and certainly the circumstances that created him demand some degree of pity, the revulsion element remains strong. The ending of this novel is as unsettling as anything Parker has ever written. Even our hero is not as quick with the quips as usual, simply because these horrific crimes do not allow too much witticism. One thing about Parker: he certainly tries to avoid ending a Spenser story the same way twice. Finally, Spenser is on the case, without pay, as a favor to Martin Quirk, who has already been taunted in a personal message from the killer. When it becomes clear Spenser and Susan are potential targets as well, the search becomes more personal, but you also get the feeling that for once our hero is not as in control as is usually the case. In effect, he and Susan are quite vulnerable, which ends up working in the story's favor.On the home front, although Spenser and Susan have been happy since her return, there happiness has been based on mere words rather than actions (I mean actions other than sex). In this novel, because the case is bound up so intimately with Susan's work as a psychiatrist, the couple have to work out their boundaries more explicitly than before. Certainly Susan seems both more serious and more settled than before, which in turn clearly strengthens their relationship. This is more than getting them back on track, this is getting them to continuing their progression. They even get back to doing some more cooking, although still nothing like the early days. &quot;Crimson Joy&quot; is one of the best Spenser novels, but admittedly it might not be everyone's cup of tea. Finish this one well before you have to go to bed."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"Spenser should've put Susan and her professional ethics in a room with the serial killer and not opened the door until she was begging like young Dr. Frankenstein when he's locked in with the Monster. Then again, maybe it would be the serial killer crying to get out."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"Robert Parker's Spenser series is always good, and Crimson Joy is even better than many of the Spenser books.A serial killer has been targeting black woman. He ties up his victims, shots them, and leaves a red rose on each woman (thus he's been dubbed Red Rose by the press). Homicide detective Lt. Martin Quirk of the Boston Police Department brings private investigator Spenser in on the case. Red Rose wrote a letter to Quirk claiming that he's a cop, and Quirk wants at least one person on the investigation who is not associated with the BPD. Red Rose then starts leaving red roses for Spenser's girlfriend, psychologist Susan Silverman. Spenser suspects that Red Rose is one of Susan's patients, but Susan is reluctant to help because of patient confidentiality issues. In the meantime, Spenser and Hawk take turns guarding Susan while Spenser and the BPD investigate the murders. The race is on to catch Red Rose before he kills again--especially before Spenser and Silverman become victims.I enjoyed Crimson Joy for a number of reasons. First, this becomes a psycho-thriller as Spenser matches wits with Red Rose. We even get to hear the voice of Red Rose as he struggles with his demons and his past. Then there is the conflict between Spenser and Silverman about what is more important---patient-doctor confidentiality or catching a killer. There is also a twist at the end. And then there is always the repartee between Spenser and Hawk. These all add up to a great book."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"I've read all of the Spenser novels, and I believe this is one of the very best. It delves into previously unseen areas of Spenser's relationship with Susan, especially when their professions come into conflict. When Susan becomes a potential victim of a vicious serial killer and may have knowledge, through her practice as a psychologist, that could help catch him, Spenser runs up against the doctor-patient confidentiality that helps define her as a therapist. He must quell his normal bull in a china shop urges and work around her rather than irreparably damaging their relationship and her opinion of herself.Crimson Joy is less physical than other novels in the series, with a heavier emphasis on the psychological aspects of the case. It also adds a rather effective new twist: some of the chapters are told from the killer's point of view, rather than Spenser's. All in all, it's an excellent read, and a very well put together story."},{"Title":"Crimson Joy","review":"Another great mystery in the Spenser collection. I am loving Spenser.

But Gia never saw her daughter, her aunt saw to that. The loss of her child forced Gia to leave Talboton, GA for New York City. Almost fourteen years later Gia still longs for her child and wants to do something about it. In a crowded department store, Gia bumps into Daniel Davis and his thirteen- year-old daughter, Starr. There is an immediate attraction between the two, and an answer to a wish even Gia could not have imagined.\\"Blind Faith\\" by Kayla Perrin revisits Andrea and Mark, a couple who ended their relationship because Mark was snubbed by Andrea's parents.

The speeches included in this book/audio CD allow the reader/listener to delve into the thoughts of some of the greatest African-American orators of the past century. To reflect upon what was said decades ago and quickly come to the realization that what was stated then can still be said today and still be relevant is simply amazing, if not unsettling. For example, more than a quarter of a century ago Rev. Joseph Lowery spoke on issues such as the rising rate of Black unemployment, the lack of Black leaders in American government and the ratio of the Black population in the United States (11%, at the time) to number of enlisted persons in the military who were black (33.3%, at the time).Although Say It Plain misses the mark by excluding of one of the most powerful African-American orators, Malcom X, it is still nonetheless comprehensive. One should appreciate the diverse group of orators who are included; from Marcus Garvey and his Black Separatist views to Clarence Thomas and his politically conservative views. Moreover, listening to the accompanying audio CD, one will get a sense of the different oratory styles: Jesse Jackson's inspirational \\"I was born in the slum, but the slum was not born in me.\\", Dick Gregory's comedic \\"...the good old days was 10 B.C., 15 B.C. .........10, 15 years before Bull Connor.\\", and Johnetta B. Cole's charge to her African-American sisters to \\"Defend Thy Name\\".Say It Plain is not just twenty-plus speeches that were transcribed, placed in chronological order, and sold as a book. Before each speech there is a brief introduction that provides the reader with some context: a historical perspective of the speaker, the events of the time, or simply when, where and why the speech was given. In many cases, this brief introduction is as significant as the speech itself.All in all, I would suggest taking a refresher course in African-American history - with a twist - and read and listen to Say It Plain. Your mind and spirit will thank you for it."},{"Title":"Say It Plain: Live Recordings of the 20th Century's Great African-American Speeches: A Book-and-CD Set","review":"I enjoy Say It Plain: Live Recordings of the 20th Century's Great African...

Readers will be treated to an exciting and straight-forward military action story - albeit with satirical touches - and a political wake-up call.The military action in Babbin's book is accurately described and furiously paced. His warriors are tough, smart, and highly motivated. The low subplot centers on ambitious and unprincipled Washington politicians, to whom the military values of duty, honor, country mean nothing.Babbin uses a team of Navy SEALs, ably led by Lieutenant Cully O'Bannon, to illustrate the valor of America's military. But this legacy -- with a long and glorious pedigree -- is put in jeopardy by a cynical political establishmnent in the grip of political correctness. In Babbin's fictional Washington -- difficult to distinguish from the actual one -- the military is putty in the hands of social engineers eager to translate every left phantasm into policy. Women in combat. Social work deployments. The whole disaster.At the top of this sorry political food chain is a shallow, opportunistic president who has no military service, a bossy wife, and no understanding of how important a strong and motivated military is to America's freedom and prosperity.Ring any bells yet?Any resemblance between characters in Babbin's novel and some of the real politicians who infest Washington is, well, not that hard to parse. The names have been changed to protect the guilty. But readers won't need a magic decoder ring to figure out who a ficticious California senator named Barbara Berkely is, or an attorney general referred to by all the president's persons as Will Do Wanda. Sometimes Babbin can't restrain himself, so we have a U.N. Secretary General named Boolah-Boolah Gemali. Charles Dickens, call your office.Formidable on the battlefield, the military services are no match for politicians who won't give them the financial support they need to do their jobs, or the respect they deserve for doing them. In his long set-up, which can be a bit talky at times, we see politicans and their staff members (sometimes more powerful than the elected politicians themselves), driven by ambition and left ideology, strip the military to the bare bones, including disbanding all the nation's special operations units.Babbin may go a bit over the top in describing the political rape of the military. Not even the Clinton administration -- the most anti-military administration in the nation's history -- tried to deploy 20 percent of Army and Marine Corps troops to guard the South American rain forests. And today's feminist red-hots are more interested in having women serve in submarines than in doing away with subs.But Babbin deserves the benefit of our doubts. The melody here is right, if not every word of the song. He knows whereof he writes. He's a former Air Force JAG officer. As deputy undersecretary of defense under George Bush (the first one) in 1990 and 1991, he served Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney during Operation Desert Storm. He knows whose phone rings and in what order when things start hitting the fan. He shows readers, in dramatic narrative, how the military and its civilian leadership work together when the pointy end of the spear has to poke someone.Many of Babbin's descriptions of White House lefties ring true, and make it hard to decide whether to laugh or cry. Here's a young staffer who obviously believes late-night bull sessions in Yale dorm rooms prepare one better to take arms against a sea of troubles than does military training and combat experience. He's sifting candidates for the position of deputy national security advisor. After describing two academic candidates glowingly, he says:&quot;The third is a Marine brigadier general, and he's probably the least qualified of the lot. He has no formal education at all, just a degree from the Naval Academy.&quot;After politicians have miniaturized and feminized the military -- including shelving the elite special units that do the tough, up-close and personal work -- America is presented with a crisis of crises, cooked up and executed by a bold, dedicated, and competent band of terrorists. Worthy opponents for O'Bannon and his warriors, who return from the civilian work to which they have been relegated, for a pro-bono job.The last 40 pages or so of &quot;Legacy of Valor&quot; are as exciting as anything in Tom Clancy and feature a clash for all the marbles at one of America's most sacred sites. It's not revealing too much to say that at the end the reader will have some reason to hope that Babbin's ficticious America might, after all, learn to support and respect the men and women who, to borrow from Kipling, guard us while we sleep."},{"Title":"Legacy of Valor","review":"There aren't many heroes that can turn a woman's fancy these days - certainly not in our Nation's Capital. The only thing chicks in Generation-X like me have going to for us is a small British boy-wizard in training named Harry or the occasional cheesy USDA Grade-A beefcake in a romance novel.That was until I met Navy SEAL Cully O'Bannon on the pages of Jed Babbin's new military thriller Legacy of Valor (Pentland Press 2000). It is a griping story of love, loss, glory and the Navy SEALs. Not so gently - it hammers away at a liberal establishment in the corridors of power in Washington, D.C. that frowns upon national defense and smothers you with psychobabble. (Sound familiar?)What makes the novel so charming is Mr. Babbin's accuracy with the military lingo without submitting the reader to an over indulgence of geek-speak minutiae. (Gals - that means both you and your guy can enjoy the book together!)This is Mr. Babbin's first novel and it starts strong off of the blocks. His use of fictional and real-life characters helps the reader clearly focuses on the guys who are donning the \\"black hats\\" in this modern day Western that pits good and evil against each other. Mr. Babbin also has an amazing gift for showing us the dark underbelly of folks in political power who - for their own amusement and pleasure - make choices at the expense of our safety and national security.If you are looking for a book with strong characters and a cutting-edge story line - order this book and hope for a rainy where you can rip the phone out of the wall, sip on some single-malt scotch and read a fine novel."},{"Title":"Legacy of Valor","review":"In response to the kidnapping of American Ion Perdicaris in Morocco by Mulay Hamid El Raisuli in May of 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt gave the Moroccan government the following ultimatum; &quot;Give me Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead.&quot; Roosevelt delivered that famous ultimatum with the knowledge that his military was not only the most powerful in the world, but also the most respected and feared military of that time. May of 1904 was a moment in history when the President of the United States showed his respect for, support for and pride in the American military. Many things have changed since then. Among those changes has been the loss of respect, appreciation and support of the American military by many in civilian power.In his novel, Legacy of Valor, Mr. Jed Babbin vividly portrays how one administration can have such loath and disrespect for the military that it becomes the cause of deadly destruction. Legacy of Valor is the kind of novel that makes the reader both agitated with excitement and consumed with condemnation for a President who would treat his military with such contempt. So well written is Legacy of Valor that it's characters like Cully O'Bannon and Senator Berkley virtually jump out of the pages and pull you right into the middle of a hot fire fight or a room full of conspiring Senators. Mr. Babbin's insight into the military and his experience inside the Beltway has allowed him to create an amazingly entertaining and insightful novel well worth reading over and over.This is a book that should be taken very seriously. Mr. Babbin's novel is a great tribute to American soldiers and especially those who make up our Special Forces. I highly recommend Legacy of Valor. My heart and prayers go out to those whom our fallen soldiers have left behind."},{"Title":"Legacy of Valor","review":"Jed Babbin's book, &quot;Legacy of Valor&quot; is the sleeper of the year! Remember what it was like before Jack Ryan and &quot;The Hunt for Red October;&quot; Dirk Pitt and &quot;Raise the Titanic?&quot; Remember how you got those books and hunkered down for a weekend of reading? Well this weekend get Cully O'Banion and his SEAL compadres and &quot;Legacy of Valor&quot; and curl up with a hot-buttered root beer (or someone who is drinking one) and have a great weekend read. Let Jed Babbin, who knows Washington D.C. and the Pentagon like no one else, tell you what can happen when the President and Congress forget what the Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force are really here for. Oh yeah, go to the &quot;John&quot; before you start the last 40 pages because when terrorists seize the United Nations and the President you won't want to put the book down. Jed Babbin's &quot;Legacy of Valor&quot; is satire, message and a ripping good yard all rolled up into one weekend read!"},{"Title":"Legacy of Valor","review":"Summarizes the commitment and dedication of our special operation troops, as well as the sleaziness and moral corruption of many of our current leaders."},{"Title":"Princess Diana: The Book of Love","review":"I was pleasantly surprised when I read this book. It's a collection of Diana's sayings during her life, interspersed with poetry from the 15th and 16th centuries, and tributes to the princess. The illustrations are beautiful. The author has chosen flowers, a symbol of Diana's funeral grieving. I like this book because it's something I can turn to at any time in order to remember the things Diana said, and she had plenty to say about family values, probably making some of the more significant statements about our life and times that have been made in recent years. I am a family person and I fouind myself relating very much to many of the things she said about values and children and suffering. This is not a scandal book about the princess, but one that reveres her memory.

The text seemed to be aimed at junior high level and contained no real insights or new opinions. A pleasant book, but of little value or depth in a study of the subject."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"In A STRONG WEST WIND, author Gail Caldwell divides her life into parts: the first thirty years spent in Texas, and what came after that, her post-Texas life. She continually interweaves the lives of her parents --- who came of age during a world war --- with hers, which was shaped by the turbulent '60s.Gail was born in the Bible Belt of the Texas Panhandle in 1951. Stricken with polio shortly before the discovery of the Salk vaccine, learning to stand up, then remain upright and eventually walk was a real struggle for this tenacious young girl. Her sister Pam, older by two years, taught Gail to read at age four, and this opened the door to a magical world for her. She seemed to absorb books; they were her escape as well as her internal destination.Gail was a shy child in a fairly boring town where the winds howled ominously and the horizon seemed to go on forever. She loved fiction, especially war novels; as a teenager she wrote sad poetry and dreamed of leaving the barren Texas landscape behind her.The quiet bookworm rebelled as adolescents often do. Smoking, rock-and-roll, and hanging out with friends became her new interests. Her first serious boyfriend --- who appropriately could be called a parent's nightmare --- hung around for two years. The lifelong closeness she had felt to her father dissolved as he and Gail seemed to be on opposite sides of every issue.She enrolled at Texas Tech, but her years of serious reading did not translate into her being a model student. She switched majors every semester and was more interested in world events, especially the Vietnam War, than her studies. She was arrested in 1970 for possession of marijuana; the charges were later dropped but the arrest widened the schism with her father.Gail drifted into the antiwar movement and moved to Austin to attend the University of Texas. In the summer of 1971 she hitchhiked to Berkeley and wandered around for several weeks, absorbing both the atmosphere and the philosophy of the area. She returned to college, only to drop out just weeks shy of graduation. Gail seemed at loose ends. She spent some time in Mexico with friends, participated in the women's movement, and even played in an all-girl honky tonk band. Finally she returned to the University of Texas, where she was an American Studies student in graduate school.Against the backdrop of Gail's growing up and rebellion, she contrasts the lives of her family both as she perceived them as a young child and how she eventually came to understand the reality. It's quite clear that the author believes we are heavily influenced by our geographic landscape, by the books we read and internalize, and by the obligations and restrictions placed upon us at developmentally critical times in our lives. By looking back through her life in an in-depth, soul-searching manner, Gail seems to have arrived at a solid appreciation of her family as well as an understanding of the complexities that shape us all.--- Reviewed by Carole Turner"},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"Having my own roots firmly ensconced in the barren desolation of the Texas panhandle, I seemed drawn like a magnet to this book. When I picked it up and read that the author was of the same age as I, putting it down was no longer an option. Driven to see how this neighboring girl of the thriving metropolis of Amarillo (my childhood was of a more pastoral ranch setting) viewed her early life on the southern plains pushed my interest beyond the level of resistance.What I found inside A STRONG WEST WIND by Gail Caldwell was an astonishing array of similarities to my own early existence, yet creating polar opposite results in later years. Caldwell's early cognizance of life in the panhandle mirrored my own on so many levels; both having a deep love of books, considering in some innate way our own domicile to be the center of the universe, an unquestioning admiration for our fathers, an upbringing deeply rooted in faith; and yet, despite these similarities, our own personal end results of world views hold gaping divergence.I was at once, saddened by this book; that Caldwell would deviate so far from her conservative upbringing to embrace such things as war protests and the women's movement; and simultaneously touched by her visions of life and the poignancy of her perspectives. This is illustrative proof that personal discernment is in no way predicated on circumstantial similarity.Though our views of the world are as far removed as is imaginable, I felt a kinship to the author and must admit with clarity that she is a brilliant and poetic writer. It has been thousands upon thousands of printed pages since I have found a wordsmith whose prose flowed with such emotion and fluidity. Political and social differences aside, it would be disingenuous of me and I would be failing to accurately represent this book if I did not give it the 5 stars it deserves."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"I grew up one street over from Gail in Amarillo. She was in my sister's car pool (at Tascosa High) for a while. My strongest recollection is when she would get in the car, although my presence was rare, she always had a big smile for me--as opposed to the usual grimace I got from my sister's other friends as they charmingly asked \\"what's your little brother doin' here?\\". Yes, I was a little smitten with Gail--albeit 40 years ago--so my review may carry a certain bias....This book amazingly evokes the Amarillo of many years ago. Yes, the winds were/are horrific. Yes, the political climate was/is ultraconservative. I could not help but have an overwhelming feeling of nostalgia for many of the feelings, landmarks, and memories she, in my opinion, lovingly conveys. I was taken aback that some of the other reviewers appear somewhat offended by the author's rendition of the city. However, Amarillo is not for everyone. Because Gail chose not make it her permanent home, I viewed this as a testament to her desire and courage to outstandingly succeed (come on, people, we're talking the Pulitzer here) in a world and profession probably unavailable to her in the Texas Panhandle.Broad strokes rather than brass tacks. For those unacquainted with the northern plains of Texas, the prose is beautifully evocative. I was fascinated with the successful combination of lyricism, southern \\"down hominess\\", and, yet, the in-your-face bravado of a Texas Panhandle native. It was very telling to see how her world of books/reading shaped her life/outlook in tandem with the Caldwell family dynamics. Viewing one's youthful world more through a parent's eyes is hardly specific to the South, even if it is, perhaps, more of a mainstay. The fierce independence attributed to most Texas natives comes later in life--bent and shaped by a tribal sense of--if not \\"us against them\\", at least \\"we are unique\\"--as one begins to formulate views of his/her relationship to the rest of the country and world.Bravo, Gail. I look forward to another book. Congratulations on your many achievements."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"Memoirist Gail Caldwell is unable to make up her mind in \\"A Strong West Wind,\\" her recounting of the Texas panhandle influences that formed her character. A distinguished Pulitzer-Prize winning literary critic, Caldwell repeatedly emphasizes the role of books in childhood. In so doing, however, the author never establishes a relationship with the reader. Instead, Caldwell uses a ham-handed approach by showing off just how many books she has read and how many literary allusions match her life's experiences. Making readers scurry for either a dictionary or a compendium of \\"Who's Who\\" in literature, she is little more than a pretentious, self-obsessed show-off in more than half the book. When Caldwell dispenses with her need to prove to the world that she has read every important book ever printed and focuses on the significant events and people in her life, her memoir comes to life. Caldwell's treatment of family, social upheaval and war rings with courage, truth and sensitivity."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"If you want the opposite of James Frey--that is, if you want to read beautiful, true prose that doesn't flinch from the deeper truths, read Caldwell. This is a book about West Texas, growing up, leaving home, struggling with family, remembering the farm, hating Vietnam, going to Mexico, reading great books, moving forward. I put a pot of coffee on and read through the night, then passed it on to my Dad, who did the same. Thanks, Ms. Caldwell."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"Gail Caldwell's memoir A Strong West Wind is written for each of us who longed to move away from our hometowns, knowing that something better just had to be around the corner. Caldwell, who grew up in the Texas panhandle, artfully uses the metaphor of the wind to steer us through the passages of her life.I was hooked by her first line \\"How do we become who we are?\\" Hers is a story of growing up with more questions than answers. I found myself nodding in understanding at so many of her reflections.I needed to know, I think, that you could be sad and half crazy and still have a life that meant something. I needed to figure out for myself, which I would do over the next decade, that sometimes these definitions concealed or shrouded a brighter truth--that what looked like an off-road ditch might be another, better path (p 205)Caldwell artfully weaves disparate themes of literature, war, growing up in the 1960's, and her special relationship with her father into a colorful tapestry. As an avid reader, I particularly enjoyed how she cited lines and characters from favorite books to correspond with scenes in her life. Caldwell is at ease discussing a broad spectrum of authors from classics like Shakespeare and Tolstoy to more modern writers, Faulkner and McCarthy. It is clear how important reading is to her life from her first visits to her hometown library \\"a generous old Georgian mansion with two sets of stone steps up to its wide verandas.\\" Caldwell aptly describes herself as a child \\"bored beyond measure without a book in my hand.\\"After her father's death, Caldwell writes poignantly: \\"What we have of anyone is so slight; the timbre of a voice, the leftover stories, the smell of a hunting vest. And yet so much of life is about the empty spaces...\\" (p 224).From girlhood to middle-age, the wind carries us through these spaces in Caldwell's life--a life like so many of our own."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"Growing up in West Texas, I was drawn to this book. In certain sections of the book, (primarily the early sections), I felt as if I were reading my own life, but in the most beautiful prose imaginable. Each sentence is to be savored. Once the story moved to Austin, TX, it was again captivating. And the book leaves you with such awe of her writing and ability to put the reader into the times and the place of Texas in the 60's and 70's. It's obvious why Ms Caldwell is a Pulitzer winner!! For anyone who grew up in small town America in this time era, this is a must-read."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"This memoir is so much more than just a how-I-grew-up story. It's worth reading just for its emotionally riveting narrative of Caldwell's youth in Texas, but what made it leap to my Top Ten list were two things: the way Caldwell lassoes and corrals the bright, dangerous zeitgist of the Vietnam era, and the lyrical originality with which she writes. Caldwell's sentences are themselves works of art, full of careful but exuberant diction, a subtle rhythm she calls \\"the necessary meters of the heart,\\" and metaphors so perfect you have to stop in the road and pick them up and turn them over in your hand. She takes us from the happy childhood of a girl who loved books, through the fire of adolescent rebellion in the 60s and the shaky but determined departure for parts unknown, to the grace of a mature woman making sense of the past she fled and the people who both defined home and forced her to leave it. Caldwell even made me want to visit Texas, and nothing literary or real has even done that before."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"If you are a writer or a discerning reader, you really should read this book! If you appreciate inspiring, non-cliche prose, GAIL CALDWELL'S A STRONG WEST WIND is a must-read. In fact, it is a must-read twice. Her story fascinates. But it is the richness and density of her writing that makes it live and captivates the reader.This is a flat-out outstanding work of high prose and perception, rendered with down-to-earth honesty that isn't always what you want to hear. Peppered with multi-demensional imagery, the sheer beauty of her gutsy account inspires awe. The saga of a brilliant, willful, yet sensitive child-of-the-50s-and-60s and her uneasy oddysey to find her true calling captures the essence of the times better than anything I know.Caldwell's skill with language is deceptively simple. Words are her instrument. The thoughts sound. The cadences flow like a fine jazz musician improvises. And like a musician, a coarse grittiness takes hold at times and shakes you from your reverie.Love good writing? Read it. Highly recomended. However, if you're a 'good ole boy', don't bother. You might be tone deaf or too set in your ways to appreciate what's happening here."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"I grew up outside Amarillo, with many relatives in town. Our monthly trips to town gave me a very strong sense of what Amarillo was -- and it's exactly how Ms Caldwell remembers it, even today.Her lyrical descriptions of the Panhandle, its denizens, and most importantly, the sky, made me homesick. She rightly explained how some may leave, but many return one day, to a place that is quite unlike anywhere else, even in Texas.Only those who grew up on the plains can truly appreciate the beauty in an ocean of gold and brown, bounded by a sky so bright blue in day and black and filled with stars at night, it it truly takes one's breath away.Thanks to Ms. Caldwell's memoir, those memories become reality for a time. This book is a keeper."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"I am a true fan of the memoir but I read only half of this - and that took me days because it kept putting me to sleep. I can't even comment on anything because nothing happened."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"Our book club from Amarillo just finished discussing this book. We are seven women who grew up in Amarillo and attended Tascosa High School during the same era as Gail Caldwell. Her memoir is arrogant. Who wants to waste their time reading a list of books another person read?We graduated went to the University of Texas in Austin. We are glad to be back in Amarillo.We would have rated the book a zero of five stars if that was an option."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"Judging a book from the cover, I expected a story about a little girl feeding chickens and helping Ma and Pa. What I got was a beautifully written account of someone who grew up in Texas, now in her 50's looking back on the settling smoke and dust of her years as a rebellious child. (I rightfully did get some chickens in the latter part of the book as she became more mature, so the book was not a disappointment to me.)This book is \\"required reading\\" for anyone who is in their 50's. I was born in 1948 in California - I can relate to this fellow time traveler. I am father of a daughter of similar temperament. Gail's lucid thoughts about her father are insightful for this father in understanding myself and my daughter. I judge the best part of the book was about her father.I appreciate how carefully written this book is. She writes of the years from the perspective of what was important to her at the time. She glosses over her family in the early years as \\"annoying people\\" - but later in her account she goes back to them with the maturity of years to seek them out and treasure them, not as care-givers but as links to who she is and to appreciate them for who they are and what struggles they had to endure. The book shifts from \\"me\\" to \\"them\\".Any book that makes me cry real tears gets 5 stars."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"Ms. Caldwell from the beginning states clearly the purpose of her narrative: \\"How do we become who we are? What shapes our mind and heart?\\"A tough and complex question for sure. One that is reflected in each page of a necessary mosaic that comes together at the end when you stand back and realize there is no pure answer or explanation, for our becoming (I think) never ends. This for me is the beauty of the story. For it leaves, and in a way, exposes us, to our ourselves. And, the strange mystery of who we are, or possibly who are we meant to be.Enough of us run, or avoid in one way or another as best we can for years, the toughness of that question. We do not stand alone in this world. We are not the masters of our fate. Ms. Caldwell with courageconfronts the question as honestly as she can, presenting her story. And without imposing any imperatives or final solutions leaves the rest up to us.The author states she wrote the narrative to 'fill the hole in her heart'for a lost friend. A hole she has filled with love and understanding that can harvest a grain to feed others in their hunger for meaning, beauty and, I think, even with my limited sight, for those who want to see, a purpose in life."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"I've read Caldwell's brilliant and wise reviews and musings on culture at large for years and I could not put this book down. This is one Texas writer who deserves the Pulitzer she got and any other prizes they can heap on her. The book: funny, heart-wrenching, and not afraid to look hard and long, not so much just at the self, as too many memoirs do, but at this country in a time of turmoil too. This is a sort of love poem to a time and place in America. And I'm not somebody given to reading poetry.Read this book and give it to someone who likes to read and think and mostly to anyone who likes a good story."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"Gail Caldwell is a Pulitzer Prize winner for writing book reviews for the Boston Globe. In this book, she looks back on growing up in Texas and, perhaps more importantly, her relationship with her dad.\\"A Strong Wind West\\" (228 pages) brings us the story of what it was like growing up in Amarillo, Texas in the 50s and 60s. Gail was one of 2 daughters in the Caldwell family, and she has a strong bond with her father, which eventually grows more troublesome as Gail moves away to college, first in Lubbock, then later in Austin. For a while, it looks as if the author is going to focus (too) much on the anti-war, feminist movement of the late 60s and early 70s, but then she turns her attention to the many different family members, both past and present, and the author paints a complicated, yet compelling portrait, in particular how her relationship revolves over the years, ultimately finding peace again with her father, and for that this book ultimately makes a good read.Particularly insightful is the author's retelling of her academic experiences at Austin, where she dropped out 8 weeks before graduating, only to take up the thread years later and to then go on and take a Masters. Her insights on how certain professors engaged her, or not, are really good. In the end, this is not a revelatory memoir, akin to Frank McCourt's tales in \\"Angela's Ashes\\" and its sequels, but it still makes for an enjoyable book all around."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"I usually enjoy memoirs, particularly one written so well that it draws me into the writer's world (Mary Karr's The Liar's Club is one such book). This book, on the other hand, is NOT such a memoir:the writer kept me at arm's length and didn't give me a direct experience of her life. Most of it seemed like a summary or overview, not something that gave me any sense of her unique perspective. Caldwell didn't help me experience her world, even though I grew up in the same era of Vietnam, drugs, and nascent feminism. I read about half of it and quit."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"A Strong West Wind: A Memoir. By Gail Caldwell. 228 pp. Random House. Caldwell has been in the northeast for some decades now, along with her Pulitzer Prize for book reviews in the Boston Globe. Her own words are the most compelling invitation to read her volume on her life, especially her Texas home. She writes that \\"my want for Texas was so veiled in guilt and ambiguity that I couldn't claim it for the sadness it was. I missed the people and the land and the sky -- my God I missed the sky -- but most of all I missed the sense of placid mystery the place evoked, endemic there as heat is to thunder. You can be gone for years from Texas, I now believe, and still be felled by such memories.\\" Then there's \\"Mine is a story that begins with the fragments of dreams on the most desolate of prairies, where a child came of age listening to the keening of dust storms drown out the strains of Protestant hymns.\\" Listen to this one, \\"The past has no compass. I know this now as surely as I know that the land itself has a voice, capable of keening. Anyone who finds this a pathetic fallacy has never lain on a rock in high wind. It's hard listening, God in the vortex and all that, because the answers there usually have nothing to do with the questions posed. You have to walk out into it to learn anything.\\"Further on, while unloading her father's shotgun for his protection she \\"realized how I must look -- a barefoot woman in the yard with a rifle in her arms -- and I remembered where I was and thought, Oh hell, it's Texas, no one would even care.\\" Place this one on the shelf for literature."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"Perceptive, luminous. If you need gratuitous sex and violence, try somebody else. But this is right-on writing. My whole book group was just kind of breathless over this book. I heard there's talk about it being a movie--I hope so."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"Ms. Caldwell is a skillful writer and has a great flow of descriptive language. Unfortunately, the memoir is weighted toward unresolved Oedipal issues. She seems to have some awareness of this since she suddenly tries to develop the character of her mother toward the end of the book. The book spends little time on the significant and actual impact of the Panhandle environment on character development. I know. I grew up there. We all had her John Wayne fantasies of a father in order to survive the vast emptiness of it all."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"Haunting memories and a super personal commentary on the cultural milieu of the 60s and 70s, with occasional high humor, make this book a must-read. Do not try to read it out loud to your best friend, however, because Ms. Caldwell's sentence structure is complex."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"Gail Caldwell's A Strong West Wind is a beautifully-written memoir of a woman who grew up in the high plains of West Texas. The story begins with her mental escape from what seeemed like a cultural desert through voracious reading as a child, and of her flight as a young woman from her origins and the judgement of her parents into the broader world. Only as a mature woman does she come to understand the magnetic pull of the West Texas landscape and of the values of her origin. The book is a rite of passage, a journey that eventually returns the author to her roots. If you like Beryl Markham's West With the Night, you'll like A Strong West Wind. An excellent read. Sam Pfiester"},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"Caldwell is a master at writing. There are no extra or elaborate descriptions, yet what she describes is crystal clear and said in a way that is unique. I especially like what she has written on the subject of addiction and the frustration of failing in the process. \\"It was like covering a blackboard with writing every morning and then that night erasing everything you'd learned.\\"I haven't finished reading it yet, I'm almost there though. I'm reading it like someone who wants to remember the words on the page. There are valuable lessons to be learned from Caldwell's experiences with the deep friendship she writes about, and about being an accomplished writer who happens to be an introvert who fought an addiction with alcohol and won."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"Bought this after reading another of Caldwell's books, and this did not disappoint. I wanted to know more about her after the first book--Let's Take the Long Way Home, written after A Strong West Wind. Her writing is so personal, descriptive and specific."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"Gail Caldwell has a magical, sensible way with words that wrap themselves around the reader's heart, hopes and experience. The shock! The sadness! The empathy! The confusion. The peace. But it's more than a matter of generating emotion. It's an achievement in transforming the reader and in the expert cultivation and shaping of the reader into a character participating in the story. I loved the experience of reading (and participating in) this book."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"I have not finished it yet, but Gail Caldwell has obviously written a first-class intelligent memoir. Her honesty and superior insight without pretention shines through. I remember her, somewhat because of her physical beauty, as, well, \\"Cladwell,\\" during her youth when she worked in Austin for our mutual friend, lawyer Brooks Holmam. She, and her work, are what we have all come to know as The Real Deal."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"Gail Caldwell's account of her West Texas childhood is one of the most accurate and beautiful accounts of a place that seems to lie just beyond the imagination of the rest of America. I know it is absolutely perfect, down to the way sunlight looks in the gritty air. I know West Texas and this book just might be the best one ever to capture the place as it is. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"A Strong West Wind brought back many memories of growing up in Texas, early close relationship with my father and the quirky things happening in Austin in the 70s. I bonded with the author on many of the pages. Some of the references to the books she had read could have been left out."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"This book is beautifully written with much love about a place and period of time needing to be characterized. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"I read this book recently for a closed circuit reading service for the visually impaired. There's nothing like reading aloud to expose a book's shortcomings. This one is flawless. A jewel.A great book for baby boomers coming to terms with the loss of their parents. Incisive like no other book I've ever read, except perhaps Amy Tan's memoir The Opposite of Fate."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"The author asks: How do we become who we are? It would seem to me that we ARE who we are! Gail Caldwell was always a lover of books, so she became a book reviewer--or literary critic if you want to be fancy. She didn't become a reader, she WAS a reader. She used drugs but she didn't become a drug addict. It would seem that she arrived at her adult place by becoming an adult, by having a family who never seemed to push her in any single direction. For this she needed more than 200 pages? I really don't get what she was trying to figure out; I think she just wanted to write a memoir and felt she needed a theme.One of the reviewers here said \\"Amarillo is not for everyone\\" and to that I would like to add a heartfelt \\"Amen\\"! Growing up in Texas does not mean a girl sneaks out to date a boy her father doesn't approve of. Being a teenage girl ANYwhere probably means dating a boy your father doesn't approve of. At least that was how it was for myself and my friends on the San Francisco peninsula. We tried drugs, too. Of course, we were often caught disobeying our parents and were punished for it. Gail Caldwell was never caught, or punished?Before I bought this book I read that it was about a little girl who had gotten polio. It wasn't.There are some harsh words here from several of the reviewers and I am sad to say that I concur with lots of them. I too am a book lover and I have read lots of books, and lots of books about books, but my gosh I have never seen so many books and authors referenced in a book such as this, a book purporting to be about growing up in the west during a troubling time in our country's history. To this I can only say, Boy, does this woman know books, and we are duly impressed with the summaries or overviews of all the books you have read in your life."},{"Title":"A Strong West Wind","review":"We read this book for out family book club, and we were all disappointed. The writer seemed bratty, shallow, self-centered and very full of her ability to choose a really obtuse word when a clearer one would do. We didn't like her and couldn't figure out why she was so depressed and depressing, other than perhaps her family history. I couldn't figure out how she was rebelling against her father, who seemed, as did her mohter, to support her in her every endeavor. She had a wonderful childhood and seemed to resent it. I would not recommend this book to anyone, and the only reason I did not burn it is that I think it is sacreligious to burn books. This one deserved it, though."},{"Title":"Trafalgar: The Men, the Battle, the Storm","review":"I've read many books on Trafalgar. This one stands out for its clarity. The dangers the first RN ships to break the line were in are highlighted while the Allied re-taking of some prizes is told more clearly than I've seen before. The author's handling of Collingwood is very evenhanded."},{"Title":"Trafalgar: The Men, the Battle, the Storm","review":"Unlike the previous reviewer, this was my first read on the battle of Trafalgar. I found the description of the ships and the battle very detailed and could follow. I did however, have trouble following the events after the battle, particularly the storm. It would have been more helpful if the aurthors would have used more maps to show the positions of the various ships at various points. Although the events of the storm quite dramatic, the book seemed to lose its edge after the battle. Overall a good read and worth picking up."},{"Title":"Trafalgar: The Men, the Battle, the Storm","review":"Well researched and a good read at the same time. The author's use of original source material, such as private letters, outs a very human aspect on what was, after all, a very bloody battle for both sides."},{"Title":"Trafalgar: The Men, the Battle, the Storm","review":"There are several accounts on Trafalgar and this is one that I would put in the middle. It cover the basics of the battle and the people who fought in it and hits on all of the salient points. The storm is covered in the best detail of any book which is why this one is worth some attention. Overall though the book is very slow to get through and not as well written as others. The information is good but it does not add anything really new to the debate that is already ongoing. Overall if you are starting out on Trafalgar I would find another book but if you are looking for a decent refresher on the subject this will work."},{"Title":"Praxis I Exam Cram","review":"I am so glad I did not rely solely on this book to study for the PRAXIS in Math and Writing. The math section is really good. I especially liked the CD because it gave me a feel for the real exam (I took the CPPST version). The \\"cheat sheet\\" was helpful because all the information needed was in one page. However, this book did not do it for me in the Writing section. The book did not cover a lot of areas found in the exam. If you really want to pass the PPST, you're better off buying Barron's How to Prepare for PRAXIS book. That book has more info and covers a lot more subjects. Other than that, I give Exam Cram 3 stars."},{"Title":"Praxis I Exam Cram","review":"I've purchased many Exam Cram books over the years. This one was disappointing. A major reason for buying it was the CD with test prep questions and test bank.

Given the price of the book, it should come with the full test."},{"Title":"Praxis I Exam Cram","review":"I think this a good book to use to for preparing for praxis I.

You would be much better off buying the Kaplan praxis book."},{"Title":"Praxis I Exam Cram","review":"If you are taking the Praxis test, then you should know there are two formats: paper and computer based.For a Praxis reveiw resource the book is okay, but there are better: like the books published ETS, the Praxis designer, and Kaplan. So if you are taking the Praxis paper-based test, the book may help you.However for those that are taking the computer-based test I provide you with the following tale of woe. I received this book as a gift and the giver insisted that I try out the software right away. The giver was very embarressed when I answered a question correctly, I was informed I was wrong. I know my answer was correct, because the program's \\"Explanation\\" confirmed it. In fact, I could not answer any question correctly. Also, every time I answered a question I was given a \\"Windows Explorer\\" error and/or an \\"Internet Explorer\\" error. This also happened when I selected next.Now, the software may work great with Windows XP, I do not know. What I do know is that I did install the program correctly and did use it corretly.At the time of this writing, there were no updates for the software from the publisher."},{"Title":"Praxis I Exam Cram","review":"Diana Huggins provides test-takers with a simple, easy-to-use guide on how to study and prepare for the Praxis I and Praxis II teacher's licensing exam. She gives short and direct information, in regards to the math and reading sections, which are designed to remind one of the important elements they've already learned rather than actually newly instruct them in it. In this way, the studier can skim and concentrate on the areas needing the most help, while not having to trudge through the things they already know. The writing section gives clues and strategies on how to approach the essay questions (of course, it can't teach you how to write). The book gives ample sample test questions and opportunities for self-practice. It also comes with a perforated, tear-out \\"cheat sheet\\" to help with last minute studying and a CD-ROM to give one the feel of real-time, computer-based test-taking. If one is a confident test-taker and needs only a little brushing up on the particulars, this work is a painless and adequate choice for doing so. However, for those who may have difficulty in the test arena or are not confident in the background knowledge required to pass the exam, a more thorough and dense guide may be needed."},{"Title":"Hand-cranked phonographs: It all started with Edison-- : an introduction to vintage talking machines, records, and more!","review":"I highly recommend Maken's book to both the novice and experienced phonograph enthusiast.

They rescued him and his sister from the London streets and treated them like their own children. But now it's time for payback. Max must take his position in the family, and that includes marrying well. But for Max, marrying the woman his father has chosen will mean losing the only woman he has ever loved.Kirsty and Max made a promise to each other as children, but now Max is grown and Kirsty knows her position as tenant farmer's daughter on the Rossmara land. The two understand they cannot marry, but understanding doesn't douse desire. When Max forces things by installing Kirsty as his personal assistant and moreover that she live in his wing of the castle, Kirsty's reputation is ruined and Max's relationship with his parents is threatened. He and Kirsty are unable to stay away from each other. Max's selfishness unleashes heartache and shame. But Kirsty remains loyal to Max, stoically ignoring the gossip. Will two families may be destroyed in the name of love?Stella Cameron forces the reader to swallow a cruel, selfish, heart-broken hero, a hero who very nearly destroys everything he's ever wanted as he juggles loyalty to his family and love. Then Ms.Cameron dares us to love Max. The magnificence of Ms. Cameron's writing compels us to accept and even cheer for Max as much as we do for Kirsty. THE WISH CLUB is a deeply moving story that will stir passion in every reader's heart.Rickey R. Mallory"},{"Title":"The Wish Club","review":"I finished this book simply because I will finish most any book that I start reading, no matter how horrible. This was one of the WORST books I have ever read. The characters were stiff and undeveloped and unappealing. I wanted to smack them all upside the head and tell them exactly what was going on that they were too dumb to see. The plot is convoluted and full of holes - for example, there is a plot to find a book belonging to a 'Gentlemen's club' that detailed their sexual adventures. Now, the book is in Max's possession, even though he doesn't know what it is about. The book is later seen in the possession of a bulter, who is actually using it. But in the end, the book doesn't exist! Surprise! I guess everyone imagined it. And somethings, like the mysterious rider, are never explained.Don't bother. I reccommend Forbidden Magic by Jo Beverly if you want an historical romance with a mystery-filled plot and engaging characters."},{"Title":"The Wish Club","review":"Cameron's novels tend to be hit and miss for me. This particular one was a miss. I simply couldn't get interested in either the plot or the characters. To be honest, I found the villains a bit more interesting! I'd advise skipping this one and heading for another Cameron instead."},{"Title":"The Wish Club","review":"How could I have missed the story of Max and Kirsty? He was a boy, a pickpocket in London, who was adopted by Struan, Viscount Rossmara, and she's a girl who grew up as a member of a crofter's family on the lands surrounding Castle Kirkcaldy--the Rossmaras home. These two have always loved each other but he feels responsible for doing his adoptive parents wishes and her family don't believe the lairds have serious interests in peasants. They say they'll disown her if she goes anywhere near him. There is hot sex in the book--but I surely didn't stop reading, in fact I turned the pages faster. And the sensuality between Kirsty and Max (don't miss the blowing bubbles scene) is incredible.I'm glad Ms. Cameron wrote this book--I'm glad she writes all of her books!"},{"Title":"The Wish Club","review":"The characters are both unbelievable and unlikable, for the most part.

It's not the best Stella Cameron ever but it pretty darned good. The struggle that both characters endure are very real."},{"Title":"The Wish Club","review":"I enjoyed the other books about the Rossamara family but this one just went too far in the yucky, kinky, disgusting sex scenes, and not far enough in giving the hero and his family the intelligence to see that they were being duped by the &quot;bad&quot; people on the neighboring estates. Not much thought could have gone into developing the plot or the characters. Too bad... I really liked the other Rossamara stories, every one of them. This was just a book too far in this series"},{"Title":"The Wish Club","review":"I love reading Stella Cameron present day novels, but frankly am disappointed in her historicals. The dialogue is obscure, the characters slightly stilted. Stick with her books such as &quot;Pure Delights&quot; and &quot;Sheer Bliss&quot;."},{"Title":"The Wish Club","review":"This book was a good twist on the much done star-crossed lovers thing. The couple are two tortured souls, with Max being the more so with Kirsty willing to do anything, even become his mistress, just to be with him.So the story goes: poor boy turned rich loves poor girl but his feelings of obligation to the family that took him in won't allow them to be together and her family's adamant that she &quot;know her place&quot; - a peasant - and stay there.The twist here, the missing journal, leads the story's villains, Horace Hubble, Lady Hermoine and Countess Grabham to Max Rossmara, believing that he is in possession of it. Max loves his childhood friend Kirsty Mercer, a crofter's daughter, but cannot marry her due to pressure from his family (mostly his father, Struan the hero from Cameron's &quot;Bride&quot;).The story is good, although there are a few disturbing sex scenes between the villains, regardless of their blood ties - ICK!Don't let that stop you from reading the book."},{"Title":"The Wish Club","review":"I always enjoy it when the man is the one being forced to marry -- but I didn't particularly care for Cameron's propensity to include explicit scenes between characters who are NOT the hero and heroine.

I am so glad that this Author decided to write the book. I remember getting a post card way back in the early 1990's and thought it was a gimmick so I had no imput in the book. There is nothing to be ashamed of now and I hope that everyone who reads it will understand better the relationshop with us and the slaves that toiled to soil for us. Unfortunately during the aftermath of the Civil War, my branch of the Family did not have much left. Many of us have worked real hard to set things right for many who suffered. As I was growing up only small bits and pieces of our Families past were reveled to me. I always felt that I was being kept in the dark and now things have been illminated for me.

This is an exceptional book that combines the best of responsible historical research and engaging journalism."},{"Title":"The Hairstons: An american Family in Black and White","review":"I may be a little modest because this book really hit home for me. The people described in this book are people that I've heard so much about growing up. The writer really captured the spirit of these individuals. This book is an excellent choice for someone who wants to read a genuine, well-rounded book that comes completely from the heart and soul."},{"Title":"The Hairstons: An american Family in Black and White","review":"Henry Wiencek has done a masterful job of researching the Hairston plantation. I am awed by his ability to find slave descendants who kept their history alive through the oral tradition. Mr. Wiencek has tackled a subject most of us don't want to discuss and he has done a incredible job of describing the daily lives of the Hairston slaves and their white masters. He takes the reader on the painful journey of the freed slave and introduces us to their living descendants. Outstanding! A must for any lover of American history."},{"Title":"The Hairstons: An american Family in Black and White","review":"This book is, quite frankly, one of the most powerful books I have read in a long time. The author chronicles a southern family's history, unwinding the complex relationships between master and slave and illuminating the enormous contributions of African-Americans to the growth and development of our country--a history long neglected and nearly unknown. As this well researched tale unfolds, the mystery of this family's heritage, their contributions, their curse, and their redemption---both black and white---becomes understood. Their story is our nation's story. I now have a better understanding of why the legacy of slavery continues to haunt our relationships even down to this day. Every American should read this book!"},{"Title":"The Hairstons: An american Family in Black and White","review":"This book has had a profound impact on me, and I encourage you to read it. Wiencek has done a painstaking job of documenting the legacy of slavery on the white and African American descendants of the Hairston line. Wiencek uses court records, actual letters written by the early white Hairston planters, interviews with present-day descendants, and other texts to trace the rise and fall of the white Hairstons and unconquerable spirit of the black Hairstons.Moreover, the &quot;protests&quot; one sees in these reviews by some of the present-day white descendants of the Hairston planters lends even more credence to the devastating story of greed, sorrow, poverty, and ultimately, triumph painted by Wiencek's seven years of research into the Hairston families' history. Were I a white descendant, I imagine it would not be welcome to have the mythology about one's family as benevolent, caring owners who never sold their slaves exploded. (Indeed, if any African Americans may have a legal claim for reparations, surely the black Hairston family does, for Wiencek &quot;discovers&quot; how the white Hairston family deliberately stole the inheritance--worth millions in present-day dollars--of one of their ancestors, a mulatto child whose father, a wealthy Hairston plantation owner, left her the bulk of his estate. I won't spoil the entire story for you by saying more here. You can learn the details yourself when you buy the book.) And Wiencek does explode the myth, not through rhetoric or anecdotes but through the use of documents that, for example, show the sales of children from their families. Wiencek also provides the reader with an extensive bibliography and chapter endnotes to give authority of each claim made in the book.The only &quot;complaint&quot; I might have with this book--and it's no complaint--is that I often find the story within it painful to read. I'm a fast reader, yet I find I can only read this book a chapter or two at a time, or some days, depending on the passages, only a few pages at a sitting. I then have to stop and move on to some other task to try to shake off the feeling of heaviness that envelopes me. In those moments, I am sometimes struck by how far the owners would go to obtain and retain their property, and that includes their slaves. By how resentful many became after slavery's end and how they saw their former slaves' leaving of the plantation as a betrayal. By the strength and courage of the slaves themselves and their present-day descendants. By how some whites, despite the times in which they lived, had the courage to defend and assist the slaves and their descendants.America is truly a land of complexity and contradiction when it comes to the relationship between blacks and whites, and no story brings the strangeness of that relationship more to light than that of the Hairstons.Please, read this book and judge its merits for yourself. See if you find it as wonderful, as awful, as inspiring as I do."},{"Title":"The Hairstons: An american Family in Black and White","review":"I consider myself to be an avid reader, but there were times as I read that I had to put the book down due to emotions that boiled up in me as I read. Not so much of anger,(there was some), but of sorrow and despair. Mostly because of what these people went through, but also because so many southerners are even today ignorant of their history, glorifying, what at the time was as bad if not worse than Nazi Germany of the 30's and 40's. To quote a famous man &quot;those who don't know their history are doomed to repeat it&quot;. This book will be required reading for my entire family. Both immediate and extended."},{"Title":"The Hairstons: An american Family in Black and White","review":"When Henry Wiencek was doing background work for a book on old houses, he visited a plantation home in North Carolina called Cooleemee. Cooleemee has been owned continuously by the Hairston family, and the present owner is Judge Peter W. Hairston. Wiencek asked Hairston if he knew of any descendents of Cooleemee slaves, and he was introduced to Squire Hairston. This chance encounter lead Wiencek on a seven year odyssey to discover the history of not just the white Hairston family, but the black Hairston's as well. The Hairstons: An American Family in Black and White is an incredibly fascinating book that reflects not just the history of one family, but the story of our nation. Fortunately for his readers, Wiencek writes this historical narrative to read like a novel.The Hairston's were once one of the richest plantation families. Together, they owned 45 plantations in three states, and Samuel Hairston was said to own over 10,000 slaves (the most slaves ever owned by one person). The Hairston's tended to marry other Hairston's to keep the plantations in the family. But their way of life changed forever after the Civil War. While the fortunes of the white Hairston's never recovered, the black Hairston's were able to make something of their lives. Due to perseverance and discipline, they became engineers, farmers, musicians, lawyers, teachers, farmers, principals and ministers.Slaves in the Family by Edward Ball covers a similar subject matter, but Wiencek's book gives us much more of a historical perspective. The history of the Hairston's in American begins around 1729 and continues to the present. The author touches on the Revolution, the Abolitionist Movement, the Civil War, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, the Civil Rights Movement, blacks in the military and integration. These stories are all told through the eyes of the Hairston clan. Much of the success of The Hairstons: An American Family is due to Judge Peter. He opened his home and his archives (over 25,000 documents) to Wiencek and never put any conditions on where the author's research might lead. Cooleemee is also always open to his black brethren, and he embraced these Hairston \\"kin\\" with open arms. When Squire Hairston passed away, Judge Peter sat in the front row of the church and sobbed uncontrollably.What truly drives this book are the themes of love and friendship, forgiveness and redemption, and loyalty and reconciliation. We also see how determination, perseverance and faith can overcome so many obstacles. The Hairston family exhibits great family pride, and over a thousand black Hairston's gather each year for a reunion. Wiencek will also have you running an emotional gamut from incredulity to outrage to finally, hope. You will see that despite the horrible history of slavery and prejudice, both sides of the Hairston clan have come together in a spirit of forgiveness and acceptance (something the relatives of Edward Ball were not able to do). Wiencek also did extensive research to discover the truth behind many family mysteries. In some respects, it reads more like a mystery, although he wasn't able to solve all the unanswered questions.My only complaints about The Hairstons are minor ones: the family tree was a bit confusing in spots. Also, I thought the picture selections could have been better, and there could have been more of them. A map of the Mississippi plantations would have also been helpful. But please don't let these small problems detract from an otherwise excellent book. Although I have borrowed this book from the library, I will definitely purchase a copy for my collection."},{"Title":"The Hairstons: An american Family in Black and White","review":"I am the niece and greatniece to two relatives in the book from pages 120. Jean is my aunt and Bay is my great aunt. For many years, our grandmother, Laura Hairston Cunningham Crenshaw told the stories of how powerful her family was. She always said she was black. Being very young at the time, I couldn't really understand why she kept saying that because she didn't look Black. This family history is fulled with the curses and blessings that come from years of sinful living and righteous living. My siblings and I visited our grandmother in Mississippi several times in our youth. My sister read the book and she was in tears, an older brother read the book and he became angry. I choose to accept the past for what it is. I have lived with my father who has direct knowledge of that family going back several generations, yet, he never discusses his life as a youth growing up in the heart of the South as a Hairston. His two brothers are now deceased but they left children behind. We have family members in Chicago and St. Louis as well as Mississippi.I can only tell you that wealth extracts a price of its own. So does being poor. My father loved his mother and his maternal grandfather. He came away from Mississippi having learned about the character of a man and how to measure it. He loved his children (and there are many of us). He loved his brothers and his sister. We may never know the depths of his hurt and we may never understand if the hurt is the result of being a Hairston or the product of a so-called bi-racial marriage. What our family knows is that the past owes us nothing. The stories that are told about this side of the family don't matter. We were loved by them and they loved us. God brought the family through those times and continues to smile on us today. Every family has a story to tell. The Bible is filled with stories of the lives of those who passed on many years ago. Our destiny is to learn from those who have passed on. Each of us shoulders a responsibility to achieve whatever is good and right in God's sight. No more and no less."},{"Title":"The Hairstons: An american Family in Black and White","review":"Subtitled, &quot;An American Family in Black and White&quot;, this is a true story of a Southern family that spans the years from 1790 to the present day. The author, Henry Wiencek, is a northern journalist who specializes in old homes. One day, when visiting an historic plantation in Virginia, the owner piqued the author's interest by telling him anecdotes and showing him historical records. The author was fascinated and started doing research and interviewing the surviving members of the family, including the descendents of the slaves who had also taken the last name of Hairston, many of whom were related by blood.This is not only the story of one particular family. It is the story of America itself and the awful institution of slavery. The white family members look back on it with anguish and never make any apology for it. Historically though, there are letters and documents in which they try to justify it. For example, at the beginning of the 19th Century one young white plantation owner visited England and wrote a letter about appalling conditions of the factory workers in London who lived in squalor compared to his well-treated slaves in Virginia.During the 19th Century, most of the whites merely accepted the situation with the exception of one plantation owner in Mississippi. When he died, he left his entire plantation to his daughter who was born to a slave woman. Such a thing was unheard of at the time. The case was delayed in the courts for years while the daughter and her mother were quickly sold. The writer did a lot of research and finally traced the daughter, who wound up with a very interesting life of her own, even though she remained a slave.Some of the stories of the Civil War were fascinating, especially the role of the former slaves who became soldiers in the Union Army. In one particular battle in Mississippi, they fought so bravely that their Illinois white fellow soldiers risked their own lives to save them. In another documented incident with northern soldiers, a white man was disciplined harshly for disrespecting one of the black men. This kind of respect changed however. The Buffalo Soldiers of WW2 were treated badly. It was hard to read about how they were sent into battle by incompetent leaders. The author interviewed one of these Buffalo Soldiers who was still alive and some of his stories are fascinating.Another one of the living black descendents is Jester Hairston, who acted in the movie &quot;The Alamo&quot; with John Wayne. He now is one of the most respected historians of slave music and travels around the country continuing his research and giving lectures. Many of the former slaves settled near the Virginia plantation and opened businesses and sent their children to college. Basically, they've done much better than the white plantation owners who just sold off one parcel of land after another until it was practically all gone.The black Hairstons have a long-standing annual family reunion and the author joined them on several occasions. Eventually, they all visited the still-standing plantation and met the white owner, who was honest in his understanding of what a horrible institution slavery was. Eventually, they have made peace between them.I loved this book. It had great stories. Wonderful authentic history. And a fine theme about forgiveness. I also felt I met some great people along the way. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Hairstons: An american Family in Black and White","review":"I picked up this book in Dallas,TX and realized that I lived 45 minutes away from where it took place, I wanted to get in my car and drive there (don't do that, it is still private property) It is a wonderful book, I could not put it down. It is not preachy or boring, it is not filled with words but visual pictures woven into fascinating family tapestries. It tells the story of two families, one white, and one black (owned as slaves), It talks about the days of slavery to now. Where the families are today and the relationship they share in the present. It was one of the most amazing books I have ever read. I can't believe I never heard of it before now. The mark of a good book for me is when I do have to put it down I find myself thinking about it, I found this happened a great deal with this volume, run to get it, it is one of the best books I have ever read (and I read alot :D)"},{"Title":"The Hairstons: An american Family in Black and White","review":"All right, let's sum up:1. Yes, the author is biased against the white people in this fascinating story. But he is candid enough to admit it and those instances when this prejudice appear are easy to identify and thus deal with on the part of an alert reader. Why the author thinks you cannot love your grandfather and respect his accomplishments even though he was flawed (as all human beings are) is a great mystery. Why he thinks sins are inherited is even more mystifying.2. Yes, the family trees are confusing but the anecdotes are great3. Well-written.4. Written by a Yankee, yes, but one with a fascination for the South.Summation: This book has flaws but it is still well worth reading and much better than Slaves in the Family or Confederates in the Attic"},{"Title":"The Hairstons: An american Family in Black and White","review":"The reviewer first discovered the Hairston family in 1968 while preparing for doctoral orals at the University of Virginia. Samuel Hairston, of Oak Hill, in Virginia, called by &quot;DeBow's Review&quot; the largest slave-owner in America and wealthier than John Jacob Astor, sounded like a good dissertation topic. The reviewer found the family papers, a massive collection of correspondence and plantation records, still in the family. They would not allow access to them, and the project was impossible without them.The papers are now in the University of North Carolina Southern Historical Collection and Henry Wiencek has been able to use them to write the fascinating story of both sides of this family story--those who were slave-owners and those they enslaved (when freed, people enslaved commonly took the last name of their masters). Hence, there are two Hairston families, one white (pronounced Harston) and one black (pronounced Hairston), although Wiencek establishes blood relationships throughout the family trees. What makes this story even more compelling is that the Hairstons were probably the largest slaveowners in the U. S. at the time of the Civil War. According to Wiencek they may have owned as many as 10,000 people on 40 plantations in Virginia, North Carolina and Mississippi. Samuel Hairston and his wife, a dynastic marriage uniting already substantial holdings in land and human beings, owned about 3400 according to &quot;DeBow's Review.&quot; To put this in perspective, 75% of the residents in the fifteen states where slavery was legal did not own slaves at all; the average slave-owner held fewer than five people in bondage; fewer than a thousand families owned as many as 100.The strength of this book is the superb job it does of tracing the story of the African-American Hairstons after emanicipation. It is a story of triumph over adversity largely through strong family ties and education. The book is less successful in telling the story of the white Hairstons in a clear fashion.There are just a couple of other minor points. The art editor apparently selected a generic photograph entitled &quot;Plantation&quot; for the front cover. It looks like dozens of plantation houses across the south. Yet the focus of the white Hairstons was &quot;Cooleemee,&quot; a plantation in the piedmont tobacco country of North Carolina. &quot;Godey's Lady's Book,&quot; the 19th century version of &quot;Woman's Home Companion&quot; regarded it as the one of the most beautiful homes in the country. It is still standing and has been restored and is the home of Judge Peter Hairston, one of the primary sources of information about the white and portions of the black Hairstons. Why not use a photo of Cooleemee?The reviewer also thinks that Wiencek was taken in by Judge Hairston's explanation of the different pronunciation of the last names of the white and black Hairstons. Judge Hairston told Wiencek that the white family pronounced the name &quot;Harston&quot; because that's the way his Scottish ancestors pronounced it. It had nothing to do with making a distinction between white and black members of the Hairston clan. The latter is probably not true. When the reviewer lived in Danville, Virginia, not far from Oak Hill, members of the white family told him that the &quot;Harston&quot; pronunciation was to distinguish them from the black &quot;Hairstons.&quot; Telephone books do not pronounce names; they just list them. For years, there were only two white Hairstons listed in the Martinsville, Virginia, telephone book. To distinguish themselves from the pages of black Hairstons, these &quot;Harstons&quot; had the word white listed in parentheses behind their names. This is not the only example of different pronunications to distinguish between the races. The &quot;T&quot; in Booker T. Washington stands for Talliaferro but some white Talliaferro's still pronounce it &quot;Tolliver&quot; while white Jordans are &quot;Jurdens&quot; and black Jordans are Jordans, as in Michael.As a historian, the reviewer wishes that Wiencek had used a more precise form of annotation. He does not use notation numbers in the text. Moreover, in the notes, he lists only the page number in his text. Since there are often 4 or 5 citations on a page, it is difficult to be sure precisely what is being referred to.This is really a superb book and an excellent read. I would recommend that it be read as a companion to Edward Ball's &quot;Slaves in the Family.&quot; Ball does the same thing for his family in South Carolina. In the reviewer's opinion, the &quot;Slaves in the Family&quot; is the slightly better of the two books, probably because of Edward Ball's personal engagement with and passion for the topic. The last chapter will bring tears to the reader's eyes.Alvin L.

I appreciated the author's acknowledgement of his own discomfort.I have to say what has moved me even more are the reviews I have read here by Hairston descendants who have read the book. I think that perhaps is the ultimate value of this book. I can only hope that how I live my life from this point onward, and how I raise my children, can help shape the present and the future in ways that will enhance relationships.

One of the reasons was because this was the first black family that I had ever seen to be so cohesive and large. My father-in-law's name is Major Lee Hairston,Sr. and comes from Martinsville Virginia,I believe he has 12-16 siblings, some of them still living there. My husband is 1 of 11. He told me years ago that the name was pronounced Hoston or Harston.I thoroughly enjoyed the book and was very proud that my husband's family participated in the making of America and its history regardless of the role.I believe the book allows black people a hope and desire to continue our struggle out of 'Jim Crow' and America's inequality.The author mentioned that the family contained distinctive characteristics, but he did not list them. In my observation of the family plus my own children they are 1)fingernails 2)lips 3)nose 4) flat forehead 5)length of hair and/or texture and 5)skin color and/or eye color. They may posses 1 or all of these features, they're also usually petite.My only compliant is that the book ended, I was ready to read more. We are sending a copy to Melvin's parents in Roanoke.

In some ways, this is a better book.The author Henry Wiencek provides a sometimes confusing family tree of both white and black Hairstons. Once you get used to it, you will find yourself paging back and forth trying to find the Hairston Wiencek is talking about. What I found most fascinating was how the Hairstons kept the plantations in the family. For instance, \\"Saura Town Peter\\" Hairston arranged for his daughter Ruth to marry his nephew Robert after her first husband, Peter Wilson, died young. This usually worked, but in this instance, Robert, who wanted to free his slaves against Peter's daughter's wishes, left his family. He established another Hairston dynasty in Mississippi.When Wiencek tells us about Robert and his heirs, the book becomes fascinating. Robert fell in love with one of his slaves, having a daughter with her. When he died, he left his plantations to the daughter, Chrillis. The other Hairstons, some of whom had followed Robert to Mississippi, fought the will, and when that didn't work they transferred Chrillis to another plantation, telling the judge she had died. Wiencek tracks down Chrillis, and she's not the only former slave he's able to ferret out. Once again \\"Saura Town Peter\\" enters the picture. Wiencek contends that \\"Saura Town Peter\\" had another family with one of his slaves, Sally Blag. At a reunion of the black Hairstons, Wiencek meets Joseph Henry Hairston. Joseph knows he had a white ancestor but is unable to trace any further back than a slave named Elias. Wiencek is able to find strong circumstantial evidence that \\"Saura Town Peter\\" may have been the Joseph's white ancestor.Joseph Henry Hairston is a remarkable man. He works his way up from sharecropper to army officer to lawyer for the federal government. Joseph and Judge Peter Wilson Hairston, the present owner of Cooleemee Plantation on the Yadkin River in North Carolina, are the central protagonists in the book. Judge Peter opens his archives to Wiencek and helps him all he can to write this book, although he's worried what Wiencek may say. The white Hairstons insist that their family was kind to their slaves. Judge Peter's worst fears come true when Wiencek shows the Judge's grandfather selling Robert Hairston's slaves down the river.There is reconciliation at the end, however, as Judge Peter opens Cooleemee to the black Hairstons and the black Hairstons embrace their heritage no matter how cruel some of the Hairston ancestors and overseers were to their people."},{"Title":"The Hairstons: An american Family in Black and White","review":"The Hairstons is about two families from the same family tree; however, one branch were slaves and the other were slavemasters. The black family, which includes Jester Hairston (the late, famed actor and writer of traditional gospel music such as AMEN) was owned by the white Hairstons, the largest slaveholders in North Carolina. Their empire spread into parts of Virginia and an offshoot in Mississippi.This is a story of slavery and its' legacy in America. Told in vivid detail from slave ledgers of the white Hairstons, this is a moving, anguished and appalling account of one families' beginnings in the slavery trade and how the same family &quot;bonded&quot; with their black slaves and vice versa. This is an awesome, gripping story and a must read for those interested in the history of slavery in this country and the true accounts of what happened."},{"Title":"The Hairstons: An american Family in Black and White","review":"THE HAIRSTONS-REVIEW BY Joseph T HairstonThis is the first book that I have bought in the past twenty years. Why? Because of the personal values and life experiences that invariably color the interpretation of some events. I think that also applies to this book. Fortunately, the author, Henry Wiencek, identifies himself as a novelist, which provides some additional clarity.This is an interesting book, has some value, primarily to the group of people, Black and White, who were either members of the slave owners or slaves. It flushes out the many relationships amongst the Hairston slaves, and then free peoples, and many of the relationships between the Hairston slave owners. The latter set of relationships is more definitively revealed in Judge Peter W Hairston's book, \\"The Cooleemee Plantation and Its People.\\"A point that may be missed is the courage displayed by Judge Hairston, and his wife Lucy, for the time and effort expended to produce the Cooleemee book and the assistance rendered for the Hairston book. Fortunately, courage has not color. One more point is that the Cooleemee book was restricted to 1000 printings and I have the priviledge of having one thanks to the foresight of my brother James Henry Hairston.Fortunately, this book presents another example of American (I don't like that word as I don't know what the definition is) history adding to the present social mosaic of this country. However, it is important to one group of people, the Hairstons, and may serve as a coalescing point for the values they have, and continue to display, by highlighting these clanlike relationships through the organization of the National Hairston Clan.Weincek's 7-8 year effort certainly indicates the amount of time and resources that are necessary. Even with his effort, the subject \`The Hairstons\\" is really too large a project for one person to do justice. For example, there missing elements: what was therelationships with the Choctaw and Cherokee Native Americans to both groups, slave owners and slaves? Surely the slaves had ancestors who preceded their enslavement.The book is a worthwhile book, but it does raise a lot of unanswered questions called a genealogist's nightmare."},{"Title":"The Hairstons: An american Family in Black and White","review":"History comes alive in this well researched heart rending book of American slavery. It gives an insight into the lives of many who have been lost in history and a voice to those who have long been silenced."},{"Title":"The Hairstons: An american Family in Black and White","review":"I feel that when Americans talk about slavery, the true stories of the people who suffered as slaves and the people who were the slave owners are largely overlooked. &quot;The Hairstons&quot; reminds us that it is the day-to-day life of all of us as individuals, whether rich or poor or black or white or slave or master that creates the centuries of history that shape our country. Henry Wiencek has written a very important book that every American would benefit from reading."},{"Title":"The Hairstons: An american Family in Black and White","review":"If ever there was a book that should pull the cobwebs off the eyes and minds of everyone who has ever tried to defend slavery as a benign institution--this is it! Slavery was an evil cancer that continues to affect America even today.The reality of slavery and all that it touched was that it embodied a truly despicable trait--greed, greed, and more greed. As a means of ultimately justifying this pernicious system as the &quot;christian&quot; thing to do, the twin evil of racism was introduced and allowed to flourish unabated in this land as well.Mr. Wiencek has done a masterful job of bringing to life and putting on equal footing the Black side of the Hairston family with the white Hairstons. He has written about some stories and some &quot;secrets&quot; whose telling is long overdue. Remember America, &quot;the truth shall set you free.&quot;Before Americans can truly begin to heal racially, we will have to explore this sickness and learn much, much more about our complete history. We will then have to take curative measures--acceptance, forgiveness, complete honesty, and respect--in order to stamp out this disease (hatred and bigotry) which has proven to be so debilitating for so long."},{"Title":"The Hairstons: An american Family in Black and White","review":"I found this book to be an astonishing inditement of the south. The details of how individual blacks and whole communities throughout the south continued to be enslaved -- politically, economically, and even physically -- 135 years after the Civil War were painful to read. Although recent members of the white branch of the family have recognized their black relations, there are many examples of heartlessness visited upon the black Hairstons in the not too distant past. Anyone thinking the confederate flag is a symbol of regional pride should read this book to be reminded of the sins performed under its banner. At first I was a little put off by the author putting himself in the story, but was overwhelmed by the vignettes he drew of the needless suffering and cruelty inflicted upon black people. Although the white Hairstons were less cruel than most of their white neighbors, the horror of life before the Civil War, during Reconstruction -- how cruelly blacks' hopes and rights were extinguished -- through the Second World War is all too realistically described."},{"Title":"The Hairstons: An american Family in Black and White","review":"This Book has a very important to me and it will always have a pecial place in my life because it is about my family.

From what I have been told he was a ferryman. Having attended &quot;Hairston Clans Reunion&quot; when I was younger, I am intrigued to know that there is a book written about my family! It tells a story of days long gone and how a family has thrown away racial barriers and how they decided to come together as one!"},{"Title":"Urban Reflections: Illustrated World Cities","review":"This is a wonderfully illustrated book due to the innate talents of the illustrators, Richard Rochon in particular. In contrast, author Harold Linton is leveraging the expertise of others, only in an attempt to claim credit as author of the book. It's too bad this has been allowed to happen. Although it doesn't quite diminish the works of others, it paints Linton as an authority that he is not. Harold Linton does not deserve author credit for the few prefacing remarks that he makes in an attempt to sound as though he understands the world of architecture. On this book he should have, at best, claimed an editor's role and stopped at that. However, this is typical of Linton, who, as evidenced by many of his other books simply leverages the hard work of others to claim personal credit that is not deserved. Given all of this, I rate this book with mixed feelings. The works are A+, the commentary is D- so is that a C+ average? Average at best for the commentary. Top notch for the illustrations, all by others than the author."},{"Title":"Re-Entry: Making the Transition from Missions to Life at Home","review":"I'm a minister and have been involved in missions quite a bit.

I lived on the mission field with my family when I was a teenager, and this is a great book to prepare you for reentry if you had a good mission experience.If you've lived through catastrophic events while on the mission field, it's likely that your reentry will be the exact opposite of what this book prepares you for. I lived through a natural disaster that was well publicized while on the mission field and did disaster relief work. I stayed in-country for 10 months after that natural disaster, and read this book when I prepared for reentry.I wish I hadn't!My experiences were exactly opposite from what this book prepares you for. I anticipated that life at home may have changed, and I was excited to engage my friends and family with inquires into their lives. What I got was bombarded with questions about my experiences, and I felt entirely unprepared and that my experiences were the exact opposite of this book.I'm sure that this is a great book for most people; I just wish I had never read it."},{"Title":"Re-Entry: Making the Transition from Missions to Life at Home","review":"We just returned from Russia when my father gave me this book, and said, 'read it'. That was good advice.Returning from an extended period in a foreign country can be a difficult experience. This book describes problems you can fall into, and how to avoid them.It talks about how people fail to notice you've even been gone. Or don't seem to care that much what you did. When you understand these are common experiences, it helps those problems become a lot less personal.Overall, we've applied the principles of this book, and haven't experienced most of the 'reverse culture shock' that many do. And we've been home nearly a year now, so we'll probably do okay.Good book to give a returning, or retiring missionary, as a gift."},{"Title":"Re-Entry: Making the Transition from Missions to Life at Home","review":"We received this book before we returned from the mission field 10 years ago and found it very helpful.

My only regret is that I didn't know about this book earlier! It is a very useful and practical guide for people who have spent time overseas, have experienced changes during the time away and are now returning to a \\"home\\" that has also changed during their absence. It provides specific questions for reflection and introspection BEFORE someone leaves the field, helps the person anticipate common reactions once s/he gets home, and suggests ways for the person to reintegrate back into life and community. The book actually suggests that a person who is returning start the reflection portion BEFORE they leave the field, and I concur. The language and style of the writing is very simple and direct. This is not a book about the theory of reentry; it's a practical guide. The book was written a while ago so some of the analogies are rather outdated, but that was the only negative."},{"Title":"Re-Entry: Making the Transition from Missions to Life at Home","review":"This a great book!

An excellent Caribbean novel."},{"Title":"Crick Crack, Monkey","review":"More than humor, I remember this book for its poignancy, the effects on a young girl of her own culture (black, Caribbean) being denigrated and other cultures and anything associated with whiteness and England being praised. So touching was the scene where Tee is playing with dolls; so telling is her idealization of the dolls' world and the juxtaposition with her own.Everyone wants the best for their children; this book examines how people decide what is best and how these preconceptions affect the very children they love and want to protect."},{"Title":"Crick Crack, Monkey","review":"A good short narrative of being brought up in the Caribbean. Hodge's writing is beautiful and to the point. The multiplicity of motherhood in Cynthia's life rings true for many of us who are familiar with Caribbean culture and anyone who recognizes the all too familiar issues of self identification during one's early teens.

I taught it with considerable success in an upper-division class. The students found the ending disappointing, though.The cultural and linguistic complexity of Trinidadian society and the country's struggle to carve out an identity for itself are effectively captured in the confusion of the orphaned protagonist, Tee, who is torn between the warm but no-nonsense environment at her Tantie's and the 'properness' of life with Beatrice, her aunt who lives in the city."},{"Title":"Crick Crack, Monkey","review":"This beautifully written West Indian coming of age piece tells the story of Tee and her brother, Toddan who are forced to reside between two worlds as their aunts battle over guardianship of them.After their mother dies and their father moves to London, Tee and Toddan live with Tantie (their father's sister) and Aunt Beatrice (their mother's sister) during their childhood and adolescent years. As the story centers around Tee's adult and childhood self recalling these experiences, the reader gets a glimpse of the down-to-earth but somewhat loose influences from Tantie and the snobbish but cultured influences from Aunt Beatrice. From one aunt she learns expletives and from the other etiquette.Hodge cleverly displays Tee/Cynthia's duality and the impact that it has on her child and adult self. Both struggle with trying to exist and coexist in two worlds, fit in with relatives and classmates, learn from the differing cultures that surround them, and find themselves in the process.One explanation of the term, \\"crick crack,\\" is that in the francophone islands, when a storyteller wants to tell a story, he or she will shout \\"Crick!\\" And those eager to hear the story will shout \\"Crack.\\" Another explanation suggests that the term is rendered when a storyteller is inquiring of his or her audience whether or not the story told is factual or fictional. Similarly, Tee poses such a question to herself to determine which world to abide in. With an inquiring mind and a \\"shrieking crescendo,\\" I'll utter, \\"Monkey break \`e back on a rotten pommerac!\\" You'll have to read the book to get that one."},{"Title":"Louise Michel","review":"Louise Michel. Edith Thomas. Trans. Penelope Williams. Montreal: Black Rose Books, 1980. 444 pp.The Paris Commune of 1871 stands as one of the fiercest social revolutions of French history. Caught between invading Prussian armies and the French nobility, the French working class took up arms against Versailles to fight for democracy, secular government, and equal rights for both the working class and for women. At the centre of it all was Louise Michel - public orator, giver to the poor, and bane of the Paris police. Biographer Edith Thomas provides a thorough examination of Louise Michel's life both private and public, from her illegitimate birth, to her career as a schoolteacher (whose radical teaching methods often put her at odds with conventional society), her participation on the battlefield, her exile to New Caledonia, as well as her triumphant return to France and her unending fight for revolution, up until her death.Thomas is an astute biographer and thorough researcher, sifting through Michel's highly imaginative perception of events and arriving at a critical observation of the \\"Red Virgin of Montmartre.\\" What emerges is a woman who is charitable yet self-important, politically inflamed yet nave, prepared to kill for her cause and yet to nurture the fallen enemy. Thomas is not shy to point out the woman's inconsistencies, and refuses to categorize Michel as merely an anarchist fanatic, revealing to us just how complex the human heart can be. Louise Michel is a thoroughly readable book, whose writing is both informative and delectably visual. Thomas channels Michel's sense of lyricism and allows Louise to speak very much for herself, reprinting dozens of Michel's anthemic poetry. This biography allows readers to relive events through Louise Michel's eyes, at the centre of the action, as it unfolds. Translator Penelope Williams has not only translated from the French into smooth, concise English, but has also provided plenty of footnotes for those unfamiliar with French history. Regrettably, Williams chose not to translate any of the poems quoted in this book (including those written in Michel's honour by Victor Hugo and Paul Verlaine), despite their prominence throughout the text. Nonetheless, this biography is a pleasurable read and I recommend it to any who are curious to learn more of this provocative woman."},{"Title":"Louise Michel","review":"Louise Michel was one of the leading figures in the Paris Commune, and afterwards became one of the leading figures in the early anarchist movement.Because of her polemical role in history, Louise Michel is one of those historical figures always made out to be either a demon or a saint by biographers, but seldom given a balanced treatment.Which is why Edith Thomas offers a refreshing take on the life of Louise Michel. Although Edith Thomas is sympathetic to Louise Michel, the Paris Commune, and the anarchist tradition, she fortunately does not believe in hagiography or making saints out of revolutionary heroes. Edith Thomas comes down very hard on Louise Michel on a number of points.Edith Thomas's criticisms vary from the trivial to the serious. On the trivial side, she notes that throughout her life Louise Michel consistently lied about her age. (\\"Whether sparring with the judicial system or providing biographical data under calmer circumstances, Louise consistently claimed to have been born in 1836, rather than (as was the case) 1830. This is a traditional practice on the part of beautiful women, but a curious indulgence by a plain woman who--as we shall see-- was never preoccupied by affairs of the heart).Another recurring theme throughout the biography is Louise Michel's graphomaniac nature, and her compulsion to constantly write poems and novels. And no literary critic could be harder on Louise Michel than Edith Thomas. (She calls Michel's novels unreadable.)On the more serious side, Edith Thomas points out that Louise Michel, despite her romantic dreams of revolution, really understood very little of the socialist or anarchist economics she dedicated her life to.And, like many political celebrities, Louise Michel could be a bit of a sensationalist seeker, and loved the media lime light a little too much.And yet inspite of all this, it is impossible not to admire Louise Michel when reading Thomas's biography. Louise Michel always gave away everything she had. She worked herself tirelessly for the anarchist cause even after the onset of old age. When a crazed rightest tried to kill her during a speaking engagement, she forgave her attempted assassin and even intervened in the courts to save him. And until her death all the European governments were so frightened of this little old lady that she had an escort of police spies follow her everywhere. (The only exception being England, which she much preferred because the government at the time had a much more relaxed attitude towards political refugees and radicals).Although Louise Michel is most famous for her role in the Paris Commune, the entire Paris Commune ordeal (from the initial revolution, to the final trial of the revolutionaries) occupies a comparatively small part of the book. Over half of the book deals with Louise Michel's life after she returned from exile and became a leader in France's anarchist scene.(As Edith Thomas notes in the introduction, one of the things that makes Louise Michel such a fascinating figure is that old age never seemed to slow her down. She continued leading demonstrations and speaking in political clubs until her death at close to 80.)Therefore this book may be somewhat disappointing for those interested in a detailed history of the Paris Commune, but it does provide an interesting look at the anarchist movement in Europe in the 1880s and 90s. Although the author never takes her spotlight off Michel, glimpses are given of the first May Day demonstration in France (at which Louise Michel was prominent) the anarchist era of dynamite in the 1890s, the Dreyfus affair, and how it split the anarchist community in France, and the Russian revolution of 1905, and the excitement it caused among all European radicals. Figures like Emma Goldman and Peter Kropotkin also make small appearances.Louise also had several friends in more mainstream politics, such as writer and politician Victor Hugo (with whom Louise had a rumored sexual liaison. Thomas explores this rumor in the book).And George Clemenceau (later to become prime Minister of France during World War I) who supported Louise financially several times throughout her life.I have two quibbles with this book, and both have to do with the publisher rather than the author.First of all there is no index, which makes it hard to keep track of some of the characters wandering in and out of Louise Michel's story.Secondly the translator for this book chose not to translate any of the poems in English. (This is a bigger deal than it sounds like, considering how many of Louise Michel's poems are quote in the book. Not to mention poems about Louise by Victor Hugo and Paul Verlaine.) I can't tell you how much I hate this kind of thing. If I could read French, I wouldn't have bought the translated version of this book.(To add insult to injury, the translator has an introduction in which she apologies for translating street names into English, and adds: \\"I have based my own [translation choice] on one simple assumption: most people who read a translation do so because they do not speak the language of the original publication\\"...And then she leaves untranslated verse on pretty much every page of the text)."},{"Title":"Mexico: Laredo to Guadalajara","review":"Published in 1951, this collection of photographs were taken on a journey along the Pan-American highway from Laredo to Mexico City and then along the Mexican highway from Mexico City to Guadalajara. Given that it was over a half-century ago, much has no doubt changed and the pictures are a look back at a past that may be gone.Nevertheless, it is good to look back and see something of what life was like in Mexico in 1951. The buildings that you see are clearly very old, so if you were to go to the locations, most would look the same. The majestic mountains would still look the same, although there would certainly be more vehicles on the streets. I had to look very closely to find any motor vehicles.Even though the photos are in black and white, it is clear from this book that the scenery in these areas of Mexico is truly spectacular.

Drawn from personal family history, he captures the brutality and the compassion of the early pioneers and the Indian nations that they were dispossessing.Lewis Wetzel &quot;Le vent de la mort&quot;, (Death Wind) is a prominent figure in this book. Wetzel is a genuine historical personage and is accurately portrayed as both a guardian to the border settlements and the Indian hater and killer he was known to be.The book follows the life and adventures of two brothers Jim and Joe, Jim a Christian missionary and Joe a gregarious newcomer to frontier life. Wetzel always known as a loner, develops a friendship with the young man Joe and trains him in the ways of forest woodcraft. All the while Jim struggles to strengthen and protect the already established Morvian Indian mission. All of this set against the intrigue of Indian politics,war and the rampaging murders and kidnappings of the white renegades Simon and Jim Girty.Although an historical novel, Zane Grey uses the various characters and happenings as a vehicle to give us a clear picture of the sentiment surrounding the precarious daily life for both the defenders of the Indian nations and those who acted as the American border rangers."},{"Title":"The Spirit of the Border","review":"Read this book almost twenty years ago and this is one novel that made its greatest impact on me.

He was not a pastor that tiptoed around an issue, nor did he have long flowery sermons. He always went right to the heart of the manner in such a straightforward way. So I was delighted to find the his book Men Of The Bible was written in this characteristic style.Men Of The Bible digs into the lives of several men we read about in Scripture. Some of them are prominent, and some are rather obscure; some were godly men, and some were not. But in every instance, Moody gets right to the key points of their lives, and then shows us how to apply them.Since the focus of the book is the men of the Bible, this would be an excellent resource for a men's Bible study, or a small group meeting; although I think anyone would benefit from studying this very readable book."},{"Title":"Men of the Bible","review":"I've read women of the bible and wanted to see what was said about the men of the bible. very interesting."},{"Title":"Men of the Bible","review":"I found this book very informative.

It only takes a few hours to read this book, but by doing so you could change your entire life."},{"Title":"Men of the Bible","review":"This is a slim volume, which reads more like a sermon than a text book.

This book answered all of the WHO,WHAT,WHEN,WHY and HOW. The author was on point with each of these men.

By using this method, it gave the painting clarity."},{"Title":"Men of the Bible","review":"I really liked this book. I had never given much thought to some of these men.

Sometimes he appeared to get off the subject but then I found out that it was really relevant to what he was bringing out. The men that he comments on - are not the ones that one would think that he would comment on.

Herod and John, Blind Man and Joseph are two paired sets that contrast and compare the two. They do not sound preachy, even if they are sermons, instead examining the lives of these men for the lessons we can gain from them. And are well done at that.

Take William Lever. In each of his houses, his bedroom was left open to the elements. The only roof, if any, was partial, and if he and his wife spent the night in rain or snow, it was just the timely clime for a good night's sleep. Sleep well he did, every night, even if he had to brush off a layer of snow upon arising. He rose very early and took a cold bath. He dined well and chewed each mouthful 32 times; like his open air sleeping, it was a health practice he recommended to others. He planned grand schemes, and never backed down on them, never changing his mind. He didn't like discussing such plans: \\"We won't argue: you're wrong,\\" he would say often to his employees. An interviewer in 1905 summed him up: \\"Mr. Lever seldom does anything like other people.\\" This irascible, ridiculous, and yet enlightened man died in 1925, and his company, Lever Brothers', employed 85,000 people around the world and had formed global trade and benevolent employee relations in novel ways. He deserved a biography before now, but Adam Macqueen has written a jovial and well-researched one in _The King of Sunlight: How William Lever Cleaned Up the World_ (Bantam), a welcome rescue from obscurity of an odd and influential mercantile prince.He was not born to commercial royalty, but to a mere grocer in north England in 1851, one of ten children. He went into his father's trade, but was a natural salesman and transformed the simple grocery into first a wholesaler and then a soap manufactory. Sunlight Soap appeared in 1886, cut into one pound blocks ready for sale, in the innovation of a brightly-colored box bearing the firm's colors and Sunlight logo. Lever advertised in innovative ways. He liked paintings, and he liked to buy a picture, say of a girl and her dogs, and change it for advertising purposes, inserting a soap bar and bath in the corner, as if the purpose of the artist was to illustrate washday. Lever felt that if he bought the painting, he need not tell the artist of his intentions to use it as advertising, nor to pay extra for it for that purpose. His great social experiment was Port Sunlight, a pastoral suburb and soap factory near Liverpool, a planned village for his workers. \\"It was his village, his creation, paid for by his cash, and here he could indulge his control-freakery to the full.\\" It must be said that he was an essentially benign dictator, and that his community system worked for decades. He was far in advance of laws requiring factories to have fresh air, fire alarms, or sprinklers; he was genuinely concerned that employees get well treated, even in the mills which he established in the Congo, with schools and hospitals for the workers, an example of care that was unprecedented in that continent.There are many funny episodes in his life detailed here, including the preposterously blown-up incident of his cutting his head from a portrait of himself which he had commissioned from Augustus John but which he did not like. He had feuds with the newspapers, most famously with the _Daily Mail_ which turned on him after cancellation of an advertising contract; he won the suit against the paper and gave the damages to Liverpool University. His world was completely changed by the First World War, and he had a bizarre and expensive scheme for development of Hebridean islands that was a failure late in his life. Macqueen's account has to include the sad later years, when Lever could not adjust to his inability to control in detail his enormous empire, but his was overall a vastly successful entrepreneurial life, and one that remains influential today. Macqueen has drawn analogies with British contemporaries that may not be immediately recognizable by Americans, but his book is full of humorous detail that is easily appreciated. Lever was obsessive and dictatorial, but he was also humane and funny, and both sides are here in full."},{"Title":"Retroactive Justice: Prehistory of Post-Communism (Cultural Memory in the Present)","review":"Those who still try to understand our recent common past will not be able to find a better and more unusual book than the \\"Prehistory of Post-Communism\\", a dark Swiftian time-travel, which criss-crosses long centuries in order to illuminate that what is just left behind us. The reader enters a labyrinth, in which the very same protagonists reappear time and time again from different perspectives, taking on different masks and roles in the course of their doomed unheroic fight for and against historic destiny. The author has borrowed from history, anthropology, sociology, and philosophy in order to write a book of unusually high and strange literary qualities. The unknown author is the late W. S. Sebald's scholarly companion: his free associations hide a conscious and strictly organized formal construct. It is a real intellectual joy to read this learned work, one of the best, and certainly one of the most unusual historical books published in the last years."},{"Title":"Your Healing Diet: A Quick Guide to Reversing Psoriasis and Chronic Diseases with Healing Foods","review":"Ms. Earls has captured the heart and soul of what it takes to maintain a better life through the right food.

I've been through all the medications & have long suspected that my diet could be part of the problem/solution, but previous attempts to figure out what this meant hadn't panned out so well. Other books on food allergies, etc. make the prospect of an anti-inflammatory diet seem very daunting, expensive and inflexible... this is the first that gives real-world, brand-name recommendations for on-the-go meals as well as breaking down what to look for on food labels. This really speaks to my lifestyle (and probably most people's), as I simply don't have the time to cook three meals a day.I have been following these guidelines for a few weeks now (not quite perfectly, but Ms Earls states that this is ok!) and feel that my symptoms are already easing up a bit.

The rest of the book simply repeats what other books and websites claim about psoriasis and nutrition. The book is based on what I consider to be an unproven theory that psoriasis has its origins in toxins that build up in the body. The book provides no proof of this but simply goes with that assumption and describes foods that could possibly act as triggers for psoriasis flare-ups. The price of the book is relatively cheap and the dietary guidelines will certainly help improve overall health even if they don't have any impact on healing psoriasis. Since very little money seems to be spent on researching the causes of psoriasis as apposed to treating the symptoms, it wouldn't hurt to try these dietary guidelines."},{"Title":"Your Healing Diet: A Quick Guide to Reversing Psoriasis and Chronic Diseases with Healing Foods","review":"I bought this book hoping to find help for what my DR is calling a \\"bad episode\\" of my psoriasis.I did like this book but would have been much happier to find some help that does not mean I have to do a 360 degree turn around in my life.

It was my brother's book but I picked it up to check it out and could not put it down.I had recently been reading Dr. Mark Hyman's book, \\"The UltraMind Solution\\", and had done his recommended elimination diet. I learned a lot from \\"The UltraMind Solution\\". However, it took me almost a year to read. Why? Because it was 447 pages of complex, comprehensive, complicated, detailed material and not very easy to read. Perhaps \\"UltraMind\\" wouldn't be so difficult to read for some, but it was for me.I wish I had known that \\"Your Healing Diet\\" (a little book that I breezed through and enjoyed reading) would give me nearly ALL of the benefits in one day of reading that a book I struggled and labored to complete over many months gave me!My point? Read this book first! It is an easy to read book and has all of the essential information you need to begin using food to heal your body. It is wonderfully, gloriously, tremendously concise. Did I mention it was easy to read and CONCISE?!And the information inside this book WORKS. I am living proof. I had seasonal allergies for almost 20 years. Because my allergies were affecting my ability to hear I was told by my doctors that I needed to take an antihistamine (Claritin), a decongestant (Pseudoephed) and a double dose of nasal steroid spray (Flonaise) during my worst seasons, and smaller doses year round.I wish I had known 20 years ago that changing what I ate could eliminate my allergies. 20 YEARS OF ALL THOSE DRUGS! ALL THAT TIME SPACED OUT AND LOOPY!As \\"Your Healing Diet\\" explains, changing what you eat can heal inflammatory and auto-immune conditions. But the author also explains the necessity of incorporating into your life ways to be more positive, ways to chill out and to reduce stress that will contribute greatly to your body's healing. It was hard to change what I eat but it is more challenging for me to manage stress. But I am working on it! And I love getting rid of the allergies and managing the psoriasis (got that too) without drugs. I can only imagine what other unknown benefits I am gaining (or other inflammatory issues I will now be avoiding such as arthritis) from using the healing diet.And if after reading \\"Your Healing Diet\\" you feel that you want to get deeper into the \\"food as medicine\\" and integrative medicine principals, read Dr. Hyman's \\"The UltraMind Solution\\". He's great. I love Dr. Hyman. But choosing to read \\"Your Healing Diet\\" is a smart, simple and effective way to get started NOW!"},{"Title":"Your Healing Diet: A Quick Guide to Reversing Psoriasis and Chronic Diseases with Healing Foods","review":"Deirdre Earls is practical, down to earth and readable.

I have had psoriasis since I was 12 and I'm 42 now. I have finally, for the very first time in my life, felt thankful for my psoriasis for signaling a problem internally. I'm starting the process of changing my thinking and my eating habits. Your book is my guide, my companion, and my support. This is not easy but I believe with all of myself that this is the right path for me. I'm in the middle of the holidays and I'm having some wine and other foods I was avoiding but I know I'll go right back to my healthier choices. I am not beating myself up, in fact, I look forward to having my family and guests gone and the peace and quiet back and the ability to really put myself, my diet, and my health first. I'm hopeful that as my healthier way of eating becomes more and more my way of life that even guests and holidays won't have to interrupt it. I am eating more consciencously now and even though it's not as ' clean' eating as it was a week ago, I don't have the guilt or fear I used to have with failing a diet.Thank you so much, Deidre for sharing your personal journey. I've felt so alone with this skin disorder until now. I've found your book on Amazon along with Pagano's and I carry it with me to the grocery store all the time.

If you want a source for information that cuts the nitty gritty right away, this book will serve you well. Earls explains how diet changed her own health, and then teaches you how to reap the same benefits by improving your own diet.She covers the foods to avoid, foods to include, and which foods should be purchased organic. If you have trouble implementing diet changes, this book lists meal ideas, snack recommendations, and foods to keep in your kitchen. Very helpful guide that you will refer to often."},{"Title":"Your Healing Diet: A Quick Guide to Reversing Psoriasis and Chronic Diseases with Healing Foods","review":"The author presents little, of any, scientific evidence for her claims. The book is very thin and is mostly the author's shopping lists. I have very real problems with inflammatory arthritis and need information that would help me sort out what dietary information is real and what information is just the latest trend. I suspect this author is just spouting the latest trends with nothing to back up the claims. Like many people with inflammatory arthritis, I am allergic to soy and all soy products, which makes it difficult for me to get a healthy diet already. I also have kindney stones and must avoid high oxalate foods. This author insists that all meat, eggs, poultry, and dairy must be removed from one's diet if healing is to occur, and relies heavily on products with soy for protein. Don't waste your money on this book, find one that actually uses some scientific evidence to back up opinions on strict dietary guidelines. Just because the author managed to get herself healthy on this strict diet does not imply her gut was leaking and she found the cure. People with serious medical conditions need to eat right and exercise, perhaps this author achieved remission due to lifestyle changes and not due to the extremely strict dietary regime she has subjected herself to."},{"Title":"Your Healing Diet: A Quick Guide to Reversing Psoriasis and Chronic Diseases with Healing Foods","review":"You do not get a diet to follow.

When I quit smoking six months ago, eczema flared up all over my body. I was literally scratching my skin off. I went to several doctors, each of them gave me the newest medication on the market for eczema, told me to try it and come back for something new to try if it didn't work. Nothing worked!! Determined to get off of prescription medication and seek a cure, not just a mask, to the symptoms I've had all my life I met with Deidre. She recommended I try a whole foods diet for six months, no caffeine, no alcohol or processed foods. After five months on this diet, my skin has cleared up and I have quit taking all prescription medication with no side effects. I feel better than I have in years. Deidre's book, Your Healing Diet, is my little guidebook. I keep it out and refer to it when I need to remind myself that I am well because I am on a diet that promotes healing from within. I am so thankful that I've been able to take control of my health and don't have to rely on western medicine, but can actually heal myself by eating right. Deidre has been so supportive and encouraging. She is a valuable resource for people truly desiring to make a change in their lives to promote healing from within."},{"Title":"Your Healing Diet: A Quick Guide to Reversing Psoriasis and Chronic Diseases with Healing Foods","review":"A year ago my husband was struggling with severe psoriasis with lesions covering 98% of his body. He lost all hope of healing when doctors told him that there was nothing they could do to cure him. Out of desperation I contacted my son who was instrumental in finding Ms. Earls. She gave us hope and started us on a healing diet which was our new beginning to a healthy lifestyle. Our family embarked on a team effort to support my husband, and in return we have all benefited from our efforts. Within weeks of following a healing diet we began seeing changes in my husband's skin and demeanor. Today my husband is 95% cured of psoriasis and shows no visible signs, no longer has high cholesterol or on high blood pressure medicine, and has lost 40 pounds. We continue to practice all that Ms. Earls recommends in her guide Your Healing Diet. Her practical approach makes the compact guide user friendly when shopping, planning meals, or doing expository reading.Our family has a profound gratitude for all that Ms. Earls has done for us. CF, Victoria, TX"},{"Title":"Your Healing Diet: A Quick Guide to Reversing Psoriasis and Chronic Diseases with Healing Foods","review":"The impetus for writing a book against psoriasis came from Deirdre Earls' own long and painful encounter with the skin condition. The dietitian from Texas chose a more natural way of tackling her problem by healing with diet instead of chemotherapy. Her book Your Healing Diet (BookSurge Publishing, South Carolina, 2006) gives dietary advice on coping with problems, including psoriasis, resulting from noxious food.Though Earls' book is a short one, mere 62 pages, it offers a simple and clear explanation of the anatomy of psoriasis and other diseased conditions in terms of food intake and digestion. Particularly informative and interesting are the author's description of human body's acid/alkaline balance, nutritional value of different food species, and comparison of natural versus processed food items. The facts sum up to the uncommon but wholesome principle of \`healing from the inside out' rather than \`healing only the symptoms from the outside in'.Earls puts forth her three central healing principles: diet, positive outlook, and outdoor activity. The brunt of her dietary commendation stands on fresh vegetarian food, discouraging flesh, fat, and artificial snacks. She shares her own culinary chart with the readers, caring for taste, which, to her, comes after good health.The real value of her work is latent in the power of motivation her words stir up in the reader. The many side effects of drugs are the horror of a patient. Knowledge of our natural nutritional treasure is essential to each and every person who is having health problems of any sort. Earls' short book comes close to achieving this aim.For Americans, or those visiting here, Your healing Diet is of practical guidance in that it has a list of stores where food of value can be purchased. Whether one is home or traveling, Earls' book is a good guide to better eating."},{"Title":"Your Healing Diet: A Quick Guide to Reversing Psoriasis and Chronic Diseases with Healing Foods","review":"I wanted to post a message out here to vouch for Deidre's professionalism and competence as a nutritional/dietician expert and special consultant for people with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. I am the support group leader for the Dallas/Fort Worth Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Support Group. We are a National Psoriasis Foundation affiliated support group and we have a Web site at www.dfwpsoriasis.org. I founded the support group in the summer of 2003. We currently have 263 members and we meet monthly at two DFW area locations. I have had Deirdre up to speak to our group on two occasions. At both of those meetings we experienced our best meeting attendance ever and the group members were very appreciative of Deirdre's presentation and the information they received. Deirdre has continued to field questions from our group members and her motivation is sincere and her overall intent is to better the lives of people who must deal with this disease daily (as she does). I fully intend to ask Deirdre to come and speak to our group again in the future and I know she will be warmly and appreciatively received. I personally consider Deirdre our best resource when is comes to treating psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis or any inflammatory disease for that matter from the perspective of diet and nutrition. Given her exceptional training and the fact that she is a patient herself, I don't think you could find a better resource anywhere."},{"Title":"Your Healing Diet: A Quick Guide to Reversing Psoriasis and Chronic Diseases with Healing Foods","review":"I'm 58 and have had psoriasis for 50 years. I had been to numerous doctors and all the creams and ointments didn't work. The injections did but with terrible side effects. In looking on the internet I found an article by Deirdre Earls and I ordered her book. That was last May. I've lost 30 pounds and my psoriasis is 95% cleared up. This is the first time in years I can shave my legs without my tub looking like a crime scene. I want to yell to those doctors, \\"read Deirdre Earls' book\\". I would never have thought diet would make that much difference. I haven't had meat or fried foods in a year and don't even miss them. I've enjoyed trying new things.

This is a book not just for someone with psoriasis but for anyone who wants to take charge of their lives and improve their health."},{"Title":"Your Healing Diet: A Quick Guide to Reversing Psoriasis and Chronic Diseases with Healing Foods","review":"Earls uncovered a significant link between diet and autoimmune disease. Using this knowledge, she set out to create a dietary approach that relies on natural healing rather than powerful, often dangerous, and always prohibitively expensive medications. The result is a profoundly useful and well-written book, Your Healing Diet."},{"Title":"Your Healing Diet: A Quick Guide to Reversing Psoriasis and Chronic Diseases with Healing Foods","review":"Approximately four years ago I bought and read this book. At the time, my foot was so inflamed that I could not walk without a limp. A rheumatologist diagnosed me with Ankylosing Spondylitis. Needless to say, I was scared. I read this book and determined to follow it's advice 100%. After about five days, I felt like a cloud had been lifted from my brain. I just KNEW what I was doing was right. I continued to feel better. The book mentions food allergies may contribute to inflammatory diseases so I went to a doctor who did a IGg test of my blood and determined I was allergic to peanuts, milk and almonds. Prior to changing my diet I had practically been living on these foods and at the time was still eating a lot of almonds. I believe ceasing consumption of these foods was critical to my healing. After four months of changing my diet, I had a weird desludging incident. My left thumb turned red, swelled and developed a yellow crust. I wiped the crust off and the thumb returned to normal. The entire \\"thumb\\" incident lasted maybe 30 seconds. Although I felt better, I was taking a fairly large dose of sulfasalazine and did not know for sure how much the drugs or the diet was helping. However, after about a year I moved to Utah where I saw a different rheumatologist who examined me and suggested I stop taking the medication because I was no longer having symptoms of an inflammatory disease. I stopped the drugs and I felt even better. Currently I am less strict than I was that first year. I am eating a whole foods diet but I do eat animal meat occasionally (no diary) and drink a weekend night glass of wine. I try never to have sugar, white flour or processed foods. I feel great and have no obvious signs of disease. This book changed my life in a powerful and positive way."},{"Title":"Your Healing Diet: A Quick Guide to Reversing Psoriasis and Chronic Diseases with Healing Foods","review":"I bought this as a follow up the the Pagano book, Natural alternative to healiing psoraisis.

It broke down all situations and what to order, purchase, choose to maintain the diet. It was very helpful."},{"Title":"Shadow Quilts: Easy-to-Design Multiple Image Quilts","review":"Maxiner and Slusser lead the quilting world in structure and color with this new book. The quilts in the full-color photographs are stunning. The author/quilters have once again shown their artistic abilities. Quilting is an American tradition, but the authors have moved this tradition to a higher level in their choice of color placement and geometric patterns. In this book, they show that quilting is no longer just a process of using what is left to create a practical item. We can no longer envision quilters hand-sewing squares of scraps together to create a necessity. The authors of this book use up-to-date methods and tools. They have created beautiful works of art that are methodically thought out and carefully pieced and, as are traditional quilts, sure to become heirlooms. A beautiful book!"},{"Title":"Shadow Quilts: Easy-to-Design Multiple Image Quilts","review":"It is no surprise to discover that Patricia is a methodical, organized designer while Donna is a &quot;what if&quot; sort of person. They have blended these two approaches perfectly in Shadow Quilts. The concept is that you begin with a traditional block and layer it over a shadow version of itself (or even another block). The shadow is formed by making the block appear in the background in a different fabric. The first half of the book is devoted to exploring the possibilities and explaining the concept so that you can go out and create your own Shadow Quilt. The second half contains 9 projects so you can have your hand held until you are ready to fly on your own. Their writing style is entertaining and easy to read. There are numerous sections with detailed instructions for techniques such as adding a sleeve or hand painting your fabric. If you are looking for a way to be more inventive and want a little guidance, this is a good place to start."},{"Title":"Shadow Quilts: Easy-to-Design Multiple Image Quilts","review":"I ordered this book because I'm interested in learning to create the illusion of transparency in my own quilts.

The state of Utah is unique in having representative strata of every era, so the book from front to back is a more or less seamless journey through time. On the way Stokes gives excellent reviews of the fossils, mineral deposits, and scenery, along with the mandatory topics on sedimentary and igneous rocks. The entire state of Utah is covered region by region as well as through time, and special attention is given to the Wasatch Range faults, hot springs, and theoretical formation. Excellent photos and exact locations are provided for most of the rock layers, so you can check out the strata yourself. Highly recommended for anyone interested in geology. And, if you're not interested, this may kindle the flame."},{"Title":"Geology of Utah (Occasional paper no. 6 of the Utah Museum of Natural History)","review":"This wonderful book is not only the leading and best introduction to the geology of Utah, but it is also an excellent introduction to the long, strange history of the Earth; so much of what makes Utah geology exciting is that it reveals patterns and processes that were operating globally. Yet there is an excellent argument for its localization: the Wasatch Front, an anomalous structure that is clearly present since the Precambrian and persists to this day, as evidence in the contrast between the flat landscape of western Utah and the precipitous rise of the Wasatch Mountains. Demarcated by earthquakes, hot springs, and abundant evidence of geologically recent vulcanism, the Wasatch Front amounts to a complex fracture zone that runs in a line, north to south, for hundreds of miles. The book begins, brilliantly I think, by placing the puzzle of the Wasatch Front before the reader; thenceforth the chapters are organized (as is the geological custom) by geological epochs. But in every chapter Stokes is mindful of what is known and what is not. For a non-expert reader, and I am among them, one of the rewards of this book is precisely this author's honesty: He not only tells you what we do not yet know, but also why what we think we know is almost certainly wrong. For example, it is abundantly clear that, during the Cretaceous period, the North American plate west of Utah must have been greatly elevated, for the general trend of erosion was from west to east, and enormous amounts of sediment were deposited over Utah's shallow seas. Yet the volume of sediment deposited is far greater than could have been produced by any known conception of western North America during this period. Adding to the mystery is the subsequent subsidence of western North America -- now called the \\"Great Basin\\" -- and its confused, convoluted geology. In comparison, east of the Wasatch Front, one finds the Colorado Plateau, one of the few areas in the Earth where sediments remain very much as they were deposited, in undisturbed, horizontal beds that accumulated sequentially. These beds, some of them thousands of feet thick, run laterally across the landscape for hundreds of miles.What makes Utah so special, geologically speaking, is the wondrous fact that relatively recently (geologically speaking, of course), the Colorado Plateau was pushed upward -- a mile upward. With a persistently arid climate, rivers coursed through the soft stone and carved majestic canyons. The scenery is very beautiful, but it is all the more amazing when one realizes that this scenery showcases the history of the known Earth, from the time of the first living creatures right down to the present.The story is magnificent, and Stokes' careful, cautious telling of the story lends it credibility and authority. This is a magnificently well researched book, written by a geologist who must have been the world's leading expert on the subject at the time. Of course, there have been new discoveries since this book was written, but geology isn't a field in which rapid progress is made overnight. A few minutes with Google Scholar will suffice, should you wish to make sure you're up-to-date on a particular subject.This book represents a compilation of lecture notes and illustrations that the author put together for his course at the University of Utah, which was titled Geology and Scenery of Utah. Not surprisingly, it was consistently among the most popular courses offered. I wish I had been among the students waiting in the classroom when Professor Stokes walked in and said, \\"Geology is the study of the Earth, and rocks are its basic documents. Few areas of equal size are more rocky than Utah.\\" If you can get a copy of this wonderful book, you'll feel as if you had been in his classroom. Any reader who loves geology will be proud to own a copy of this extraordinary, wonderful book"},{"Title":"Geology of Utah (Occasional paper no. 6 of the Utah Museum of Natural History)","review":"Between this book and Hintze's similar book, Utah has some really good geology books that make the landscape come alive. Stokes helps you visualize what Utah looked like during different geologic periods and also highlights areas where the geologic record is absent such as the middle Triassic.I wore out my first book driving around the State for my work and had to purchase a replacement copy.

I suggest it to everyone who really likes martial arts and science fiction."},{"Title":"Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction","review":"Anthologies are notoriously inconsistent. Most contain several essays considerably below the level of the best pieces and many contain a few utterly miserable ones. On the downside, no essay in this collection truly stands out; on the upside, there really isn't a weak entry in the volume. I honestly cannot think of another collection of which I can make that statement.Whether you are a serious fan of Sci-fi or a casual reader seeking an introduction to the field, this collection will prove invaluable. I fall somewhere between those two categories. Over the years I've read a few hundred Sci-fi novels and seen most Sci-fi films that have been made, but it has never been my main source of reading or film viewing. I've read rather a lot of the historically important works such as Mary Shelly, Henry Kuttner, H. G. Wells, Olaf Stapleton, and David Lindsay, but I've never attempted anything like a comprehensive reading of the classics. And I have ready very little that has been published in the past fifteen years. Still, I found that I learned an enormous amount about the field from this book. I learned about several historical works I had not previously known of, got a better understanding of the state of the genre from one decade to another, and learned a great deal about trends in the field in the past couple of decades. I also learned something about the various literary critical reactions to the genre. For those in the academy, it is a helpful introduction to the scholarly take on things.The book is also great at pointing the way to other books. I kept a sheet of paper beside me as I read. I have already bought a few critical books on Sci-fi based on mentions of them in this volume, while I also have compiled a list of a number of novels that I plan on reading.The essays in the book are broken down into three separate sections. The first section deals with the history of Sci-fi, from precursor works to the magazine age to various decades after. The second and most academic section deals with various academic approaches to Sci-fi, including Marxist, feminist, postmodernist, and queer theory. The final and most wide-ranging section covers a variety of themes such as gender, race, hard science fiction, alternate history, space opera, film and TV, and religion. The writers are mainly English and mostly academic, though several are also writers of Sci-fi. Even the writers, however, are fully qualified academics. For instance, one of the more scholarly entries is that by Brian Stableford. Though most of the essayists are British, American Sci-fi has so completely dominated the genre that it automatically demands priority. If anything, I was somewhat surprised by the absence of some European writers. There is, for instance, very little discussion of Stanislaw Lem, though several deserving British writers do receive attention.In addition to the very good essays there is also a very interesting (though certainly not exhaustive) list of chronology listing some significant novels, short stories, movies, and television series. There is also a good bibliography at the end of the book, though I wish it had been annotated.I highly recommend this collection to anyone interested in Sci-fi either in a casual or more dedicated fashion. In all honestly I have to say it is one of the most successful volumes in the Cambridge Companions series that I have read."},{"Title":"Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction","review":"This is truly a fine volume, highly recommended to anyone who wants a broad sampling of the academic thought that has been applied to the genre. Although it's a collection of chapters by many different authors, I thought the quality was uniformly excellent. The structure of the book results in some overlap of themes, for example with a chapter on \\"Feminist theory and science Fiction\\" appearing in \\"Part 2. Critical approaches\\" and a chapter on \\"Gender in science Fiction\\" in \\"Part 3. Sub-genres and themes\\". However, I didn't find this to be a flaw; it gives the reader the opportunity to read different authors approaching related topics from different angles.My favorite authors and chapters included Ken Macleod's \\"Politics and science Fiction\\" and Edward James' \\"Utopias and anti-utopias\\". Farah Mendelsohn's chapter \\"Religion and science Fiction\\" was a real eye-opener for me, examining a side of science fiction that I'd been pretty dismissive towards.Not cheap, but well worth it."},{"Title":"Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction","review":"Overall, this is an excellent collection of essays for scholars and science fiction fans. I originally purchased it in hopes that it would make a good text book for a freshman-level college science ficiton class, but it is way too advanced for that. It would work well for a senior or graduate level class, though. Each essay helped expand my understanding of different periods of science fiction history and various topics and subgenres. I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning more about science fiction, as long as you are okay with reading some pretty scholarly essays."},{"Title":"The song of Hiawatha (The Children's illustrated classics)","review":"&quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot; is the best book I have ever beenexposed to.

The best read-alouds are the ones in which the children beg for &quot;one more chapter&quot; and the adult reader enthusiastically complies. This book met both criteria.The most impressive aspect of this book was its ability to be a very upbeat, positive story while not shrinking away from the sad details of poverty.

The girls quickly become friends, and Janey is even able to attend a camp school with a wonderful teacher, making her feel things are too good to be true.As luck would have it, that's precisely the case. Mom gets sick with pneumonia, and Dad can't work. The Larkins don't have the money to pay a doctor -- or rent -- although Mom is too weak to travel.In desperation, Janey gives the landlord her beloved willow plate, her one luxury possession and the only thing she has to remember her birth mother by. As the family is about to leave, she decides to go say goodbye to the plate...which triggers a chain of events that changes the Larkin family's fate forever."},{"Title":"Blue Willow","review":"I grew up in the Central Valley in California, among the agricultural life described by Mrs. Gates in Blue Willow. Her descriptions of the heat, the landscape, the people, and the fair are so accurate I feel like I am living there again as a child. Her insights into the life of the itinerate farm worker are so touching and real. I highly recommend this book to anyone who want to see what life was like in the Central Valley."},{"Title":"Blue Willow","review":"If you are yearning for a book with great adult role models, read this one. It is so refreshing to read about adults who are positive and who persevere during hard times. Written in a time when government handouts were not the norm, the adults take responsibility for just doing what they need to do in order to survive. Their hard work pays off and the reader is treated to a happy ending. You just want to cheer for this family."},{"Title":"Blue Willow","review":"Janey Larkin has grown up the daughter of migrant workers, with no roots and skimpy education. Her family occupies an empty shack while Dad works in the cotton fields, but she yearns to attend a real school (as opposed to a &quot;camp&quot; school) and live in a permanent home, so she can make friends.Janey's prized possession (from her great grandmother) is a lovely plate with the blue and white Chinese pagoda willow pattern. Her unrealistic dream is to live in such a house by a lovely willow. Then her mother becomes ill and they can not pay the rent (extorted by the vicious, dishonest foreman who pockets the money). Janey contemplates making the biggest sacrifice of her life, to help her parents.This stark tale blends agrarian poverty with a young girl's dreams of self- improvement, happiness and family unity. Despite the despair of the plot--stacked against the squatters--there is hope, as human kindness and rural justice struggle to take root and bloom, like the willow by the creek. Yet how can Janey bear to part with her beloved plate? A thoughtful book that will touch the reader's heart."},{"Title":"Blue Willow","review":"The book Blue Willow is about a girl named Janey. She was sad and had a friend name Lupe. Janey had to move a lot and she had a plate that reminded her about her great-great grand father. When she moved she had to leave the plate behind. She saw a place that remind her of the plate.I think that the book is trying to tell you about hard work. It's hard work moving to a different house. The author's purpose is to entertain you, so you could read more of it because it's a good book.My opinion about the book is that other kids should read it, because it's a super good book to read. I like it because her teacher was kind and friendly. Janey couldn't see her friend Lupe so she has to meet new friends. My favorite part of the story is that Janey caught a horned toad."},{"Title":"Blue Willow","review":"Blue Willow is one of the books that I keep in my bookcase and read on a monthly basis because the basic truths it reveals bring you back to real life. It describes clearly the depth of a child's emotions and reminds adults that very few children live in a child's world nowadays. The world is a lot greyer with much less black and white to make decisions easier. I read this and &quot;The Little Princess&quot; often to keep my perspective. It also sets an excellent example of personal integrity. I wish there had been a follow up book with more of Janey's personality explored."},{"Title":"Blue Willow","review":"Forty years ago, when I was 10 years old I read a book that touched my heart and I never forgot it.

Today, by accident I came across this book after all these years and it brought back so many wonderful memories of how much I loved this book. I'm buying it (of course) for my 10 year old son to read it too. Unfortunately my daughter is much older, but I think even as a older teenager she might still enjoy it.

As a result of reading this book, I started collecting Blue Willow china."},{"Title":"Blue Willow","review":"Blue Willow is a bittersweet story that is an invaluable read for young people. Though the main character is a 10 year old girl, the realistic portrayal of the deprivation and pain experienced by the working poor during the Dust Bowl/Great Depression draws the reader (whether boy or girl) into the story.Janey's treasured Blue Willow plate is her means of hanging onto the past with hope for the future. The plate recalled days when her family owned their own home and farm, and when her own mother was alive. It gave to Janey hope that she might once again have the joys of stability, sufficient food and clothing, and rest from the grinding poverty that oppressed her, her father and step-mother.This book has excellent lessons to teach: of friendship that reaches across cultural and financial borders; of learning to love and accept someone who doesn't always show their love back to you; of exciting horizons that a caring teacher opens up to a knowledge-hungry pupil; and the meaning of courage defined by faithfulness in hard times, regardless of the cost.Janey is 10 at the opening of the story; I would recommend the book to those nine and up. It is a touching classic that needs to be read by young people, to provoke a deeper thoughtfulness about life, and thankfulness for what they have."},{"Title":"Blue Willow","review":"I read this book for the gifted program we had months to finish but I ended up bring it in a bit late because it's one of those books that gets boring at some parts of the book.

The cover and title may be boring, but the story is NOT. A girl named Janey Larkin has to move time after time again, because her father is a cotton picker, and cotton pickers have to move alot. But, she meets a friend, a hispanic girl named Lupe. That is one goo thing about this move. But then, she hears she has to go to a camp school, which is a school were children go if their parents are cotton pickers. Because 'They don't belong' in a regular public school. But Janey likes her teacher very much, and is glad that she didn't have to go to the public school. The Blue Willow is about the blue willow plate, whick Janey's mother gave to her before she died. It is the only beautiful thing she owns, and can't hang it up until they move somewhere nice, not a shack, her mother says. Her STEP-mother.Then, her step-mother gets ill, and Janey has to cope with that. But, Janey knows it will all turn out well in the end! I totally recomend this book!

His Victorian prejudices blinker him to much of interest that he barely touches on. Worth having though.Far better the second time!"},{"Title":"Anne Sexton: A Self-Portrait in Letters","review":"The Art of Self-ExposureAnne Sexton (1928-1974) showed the best of herself in letters. To quote Donald Hall she was a \`soul-flasher.' She was passionately engaged in living and tormented into dying. Her flight through life was one of breathtaking bravery in the face of crippling odds. The letters date from 1944 when she was sixteen, through 1974 a few days before her death. Full credit should go to the editors, Linda Gray Sexton, daughter of Ann, and Lois Ames, Ann's closest friend. The commentary is sensitive, knowledgeable and readable. The necessary biographical linkage is there.There have always been unfortunate attempts to link Ann Sexton and Sylvia Plath. Their similarities are their age, their sex, their birthplace in the Northeastern United States, and their self-inflicted deaths. And there the similarity ends. Ann was a fragile child who emerged a tormented woman. She was creatively brilliant in a very natural sense; yet she worked feverishly all her life to improve every word she wrote. She once said, \\"I am tearing at the stars.\\" Ann enjoyed a large circle of devoted friends and repaid their devotion in kind. She was supportive and free with advice to younger struggling poets when she could barely survive her own despair. Ann was a naturally beautiful woman who seemed completely unaware or disinterested in her own breathtaking countenance.I am astounded at how helpless she became at the end of her life. I truly do not comprehend how her friends and family could bear her onslaughts of misery and self-paralysis. They must have loved her very much. These letters are appealing and a pleasure to read. She was a wordsmith as well as an incredible poet. Following is a stanza from \\"All My Pretty Ones\\"Never loving ourselves,hating even our shoes and our hats,we love each other, precious, precious.Our hands are light blue and gentle.Our eyes are full of terrible confessions.But when we marry, the children leave in disgust.There is too much food, and no one left overto eat up all the weird abundance."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton: A Self-Portrait in Letters","review":"I love reading other people's letters. It's a little like catching them undressing! ... Making one feel a little naughty for watching.Ann's letters are quite revealing, refreshing, honest, as if she is talking to you directly. The misspelled words and puntuation errors just add to the honesty of the words...especially in the beginning of the book. The way Anne jumps from here to there... the same way a person's thoughts or ideas would. Anne writes her letters like this!Can you believe Anne Sexton got a C in Engish class w/ little effort? Just goes to show you, the genius many of us may hold inside. But throughout the letters, Anne continually second guesses herself, continually craves validity about her writing...\\"Is this any good?\\"She and Sylvia Plath have much in common and discuss their suicide attempts as if it is a common thing to discuss. \\"How many times have you tried to kill yourself?\\" Sounds like a poet to me!I so wanted Anne to be happy, to feel satisfyed, to be content with her MANY accomplishments, but the mental illness would not allow her this luxury.Anne wrote letters to many people and made them fall in love with her...\\"I love you.\\" she told many of them. \\"I don't know what I would do without you.\\" She even wrote beautiful letters to a monk who was, after a while, willing to leave his Monk-hood. \\"Oh no!\\" Anne wrote back. \\"This love affair can only be in letters!\\" Yes, what a perfect distance, Anne.One fan wrote about his love for Anne and her poetry. \\"I am only a housewife!\\" She wrote back. Did she really see herself this way? Oh, Anne!Anne said...\\"Poetry is the opposite of Suicide.\\"WOW!And when she finally stopped writing it, she killed herself once again. This time for real.I give Anne's letters five stars, but the book as a whole four stars because of the lack of Anne's poetry, which should have been available for the reader throughout the book.I loooove Anne Sexton!!!!!! put this review under Siammuse!!!!!"},{"Title":"Anne Sexton: A Self-Portrait in Letters","review":"When I first began exploring poetry as a pre-teen, trying to go beyond the rhyming and beyond the few things we see in our burst toward \\"Education,\\" I ran across the works of Anne Sexton and immediately fell in love with them. They were hopeful and hopeless all at once, loving and filled with dismay sometimes on the same page. As I learned more about the author from a scattering of books, I saw how much of herself she put into her writing because she was tormented in so many ways, too, and that this wasn't a love of writing that powered her onward. It was the need to let things go so she could continue living - in a very real physical sense. The failures on the marital front, the challenges that she found in motherhood, the way she found herself struggling with something that culminated with her writing at the start and breaking at the end - it was all there and I really didn't understand that until I read books like A Self-Portrait in Letters. That's possibly one of the things I liked about her more than most poets as well - Anne Sexton was really struggling when she found herself and the painful Muse she used to write. If followed through, you can see the desperation in the motif of work she constructed, and you can see where she feel too far to be salvaged and ultimately ended her life in October of 1974.This book isn't a book of poems and doesn't contain anything like that at all inside. It is instead an intimate glimpse of her as she wrote fellow writers and people she loved, trying to figure out everything besides the pen. It shows how she felt about writing sometimes and how she felt about losing sometimes and, ultimately, it showed how she felt about the divorce that would consume her life and the years off she found and the things that drove her to kill herself.While you can bear witness to this vicariously in her poetry, you can definitely tell that there is something far more driven when looking into her words that she wrote in a montage of letters. More sadly still, you can see her as she struggles to find a way that she will not ever obtain, and you can see the mental illness that silenced one of the most powerful voices poetry has really ever known.If you are a fan of Anne Sexton and would like to see something on her life from her point-of-view, then this is a good book to look into. It IS NOT a good book for someone looking into the works of Sexton because none of that is there ,and I'm not really sure I would recommend it to anyone other than those interested in what really ailed the writer. I found it fascinating to see her private letters and to delve into her life, because I wondered what had taken her from feeling as if she could function to walking away from everything in the prime of her written moments. Still, this is more exploration into a person that anything else, It is trying to understand, too, because understanding is the key to so many a door not opened simply by the quill."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton: A Self-Portrait in Letters","review":"I give this book four stars because I honestly do not like Anne Sexton as a person - or as a poet really. I was very curious about her so I readAnne Sexton: A Biographyand found that I didn't care for her as a person. I then readSearching for Mercy Street: My Journey Back to My Mother, Anne Sextonand found that I really disliked her (it could be I'm biased because my own mother was mentally ill ...). So ... having said this, why did I feel the need to read her letters?? I LOVE reading women's letters. I suppose I was hoping I might like her after all after having read her correspondence to people she cared about. I was wrong.I found it annoying that she stumbled upon poetry and suddenly she knows what it's like to be a poet. In her earlier letters, she is constantly apologizing for the incoherentness of her manic letters - and finally ends the letter a page and a half later. It's interesting that she felt harassed by so many people sending her poems and asking for her input and critiques/criticisms and yet throughout her life, she was constantly sending her poems to others asking for their feedback.What I really appreciated about these letters is that there really is no need to have read a biography on Anne Sexton in order to enjoy them; it would definitely help, but the editors did such a thorough job in the editing process that they were kind enough to fill in gaps between letters, even going so far as to explain who Anne was responding to and why.While I didn't enjoy these as much as other letters, they are unique and obviously they are appreciated by many people. I wouldn't go so far as to recommend this book to many people, but I wouldn't exactly try to keep anyone from reading it either."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton: A Self-Portrait in Letters","review":"These letters are written with the same exuberance and passion that distinguish Sexton's poetry. She is a person of extraordinarily strong expression. At times this can be tiring, especially when it involves flattering or over- praising fellow writers. But most of the time it is strong and convincing, especially when it tells the drama of her daily struggle to somehow hold on to her sanity and create her poetry. Poetry is she makes clear her life- raft and place of refuge. But the letters also reveal involvement in family life and struggle with its responsibilities. In fact I found one of the most moving sections of letters those she wrote to her husband when she was far away traveling in Europe. Her husband was throughout their marriage an anchor and source of strength. He did not care for or understand her poetry, and was worlds away from her politically but he gave her love and support. In these letters to him she expresses her deep appreciation and love for him.In many of the other letters Sexton expresses love and admiration for her correspondents. She had many friends and in writing to them she expresses such strong positive feelings for their work and person that it is no wonder many became long- time friends. And this when her intensity and demandingness emotionally did often lead to cooling of relationships in time.Sexton in a moving final letter to her daughter, writes \\" No matter what happens you were always my bobolink, my special Linda Gray. life is not easy.It is awfully lonely. I know that. now you know it- wherever you are ,Linda, talking to me. But I've had a good life- I wrote unhappy- but I lived to the hilt. You too Linda- Live to the HILT!To the top. ..\\"Sexton is one of those writers who follows the Salinger prescription and 'writes her heart out'. This is an especially moving collection of letters one filled with pain and love and generosity and ambition and beauty."},{"Title":"Anne Sexton: A Self-Portrait in Letters","review":"I first heard about Anne Sexton in one of my American literature classes in college, when we studied some of her works. Even though I was interested in a few of her poems at the time, I was quick to put her (and her writing) out of my mind. It wasn't until a few years later that I rediscovered Anne at the library where I work. I happened to see a book called \\"Anne Sexton: A Self-Portrait in Letters\\" on the sale shelf. Curious, I flipped through some of the pages and started reading fragments of her letters. Moments later, I decided that I wanted to purchase the book. Though it took me a while to read the biography, I became fascinated with Anne and all aspects of her life. The fact that this biography explores both her personal and professional life attracted me as a reader. The title, in itself, is interesting because it caught my attention, and I had never before read a person's biography that consisted mainly of letters--written to acquaintances and loved ones. It was a new experience for me, and a very enjoyable one at that! It seems that nowadays, for the most part, letters are disregarded as they have been replaced by e-mails and text messages. Reading Anne's letters also reminded me of when I used to write to various friends all over the world. Though I have stopped writing letters, Anne's biography took me back in time and allowed me to live vicariously through her written word. \\"Anne Sexton: A Self-Portrait in Letters\\" is a definite must have for those who wish to delve further into the mind of a brilliant poet."},{"Title":"An Encyclopedia of the Violin","review":"Perhaps one of the broadest accounts of the violin ever written, An Encyclopedia of the Violin is a well-written, fascinating, and at times nostalgic account of violinmakers, performers, violin literature, and more. This is truly an epic and groundbreaking book that covers more information than one would expect from a volume several times larger. Published in 1925, it contains rare photographs of distinguished violins and bows, as well as well as vivid descriptions of intricate details of these instruments, as well as a guide on how make them! Another section is devoted to violin technique, including advice on how to play difficult passages from the violin literature. In addition, there is also a massive dictionary of violinists, containing the author's often insightful analysis into the style of the performers, and also includes their biographical information. An Encyclopedia of the Violin is so all encompassing that it could easily be split up into several fine books-Great European Violins and Their Makers, Guide to Violin and Bow Making, The Art of Violin Playing and Teaching, and Violin Performance from 1800-1925 are just a few of the hypothetical titles that the reader can create exclusively using the material in this unique and monumental book. To top it off, the introduction was written by the famous Belgian violinist Eugene Ysaye, one of the greatest players of all time, and the author's idol as a performer. While some of the material and ideas in An Encyclopedia of the Violin may seem dated to the modern reader, there is much that is timeless and invaluable and will appeal to professional violinists or anybody else that appreciates the sound and beauty of the violin."},{"Title":"An Encyclopedia of the Violin","review":"This book covers a great range, and is a great addition to any library.

It was jsut as ordered and I saved significantly as compared to the bookstore."},{"Title":"The World of the Cell, 5th Edition","review":"I think the recent reviews of this book have been unfair. I have looked at the beginning chapters of this recent (6th)revision and I think the book has remained a great quality Cell Biology book. As stated in other reviews, the book is detailed, but most good schools will require you to know at least the level of detail presented in this book and likely more. I found this book to be an excellent preparation for more advanced classes in Cell Biology (which used Alberts) and Biochemistry. The book is organized to make sure the students have the underlying knowledge to successfully understand more complex concepts later. The only major drawback of this book is that Alberts exists and the eloquence and sophistication in Alberts is lacking in Becker's World of the Cell. That said, I still recommend this book for people needing to know and understand all the basics of Cell biology/biochemistry."},{"Title":"The World of the Cell, 5th Edition","review":"I know that Cell Biology is a difficult subject to master, so there will always be shortcomings in a textbook's ability to communicate the subject in an understandable fashion. However, I thought this book was awesome. I followed the text entirely. I loved the fact that this text was an introductory text and didn't assume that the reader has previous knowledge of the subject. The authors explained everything. In later chapters of the book, they would summarize previously mentioned material, and reference you to the appropriate section of the book if you needed a more in-depth recap. The figures and tables are incredibly helpful in visualizing what is going on within each molecular process. Like I said, loved this book. I will say that I didn't find the CD-ROM helpful at all, but I won't dock points from such a good book for that reason. Good luck to everyone with your studies. Hope you enjoy the text."},{"Title":"The World of the Cell, 5th Edition","review":"I am in awe of the usability of this book. The subject matter is not trivial, but is presented in a very logical, step-by-step sequence. Illustrations are in color and strongly reinforce the text.

Bravo to the Authors and the Publisher, Benjamin Cummings."},{"Title":"The World of the Cell, 5th Edition","review":"the textbook is very very inclusive. there is lots of information so u have to read it many times to filter out what u need for your class's needs. it isnt impossible to read but u definitely need to read it over a bit to grasp the content. slides online and those provided by the teacher TAUGHT me the material and the text just reenforced it."},{"Title":"The World of the Cell, 5th Edition","review":"I have a BS in biology and continue to buy various cell biology (and other biology) texts. I already have 2 editions of \\"World of the Cell\\" (including this 7th edition) and am buying the newest (8th) edition now. But I noticed that the average customer rating for this edition was only 3 stars. That's riduculous!\\"The World of the Cell\\" series is my favorite on cell biology. It gives a great amount of detail but at the same time starts from square one and explains everything along the way in a clear, well-organized manner; and the diagrams are excellent. They are great undergraduate-level cell biology texts. The 7th edition is no exception."},{"Title":"The World of the Cell, 5th Edition","review":"I used this text for pre-med biology course-- I was simulataneously taking Biochemistry as well, but more on that later.The text, while not overwhemingly as detailed as other reviewers write, was all in all okay, but fell short in many areas. One of them is the distinct typographical and grammatical errors that riddled, what seemed, to be the only chapters we covered. There were many sentences that were run-ons, which disrupted the learning and flow of the text (and, in my opinion, a textbook backed by such a major publisher as this, errors like that are out of the question).Sometimes, for instance in the TCA chapter, I felt that the material presented on Oxidative Phosphorylation seemed out of order, and just a bit too condensed.The photosynthesis chapter was utterly horrible.The exercises at the end were poorly written, and seemed to ask esoteric questions about common topics. The answers to these questions were esoteric still.I felt that the only saving grace about this were the wonderful pictures: I liked how each chapter opened up an exhaustive diagram. Other than that, this is book pretty much only a decent cell bio book, but no biochemistry one."},{"Title":"The World of the Cell, 5th Edition","review":"I am a student taking a Cellular bio class from Jeff Hardin. While he is a terrific lecturer, I, like many of these reviewers, find the book extremely difficult to follow.The index is incomplete. The text will highlight a word as if it is the definition (see cis-acting element), while the glossary definition includes information merely glossed over in text. Isn't the text where you are supposed to get a complete description as well as examples, while the glossary provides the concise definition? The glossary definition of endocytosis doesn't even include the directionality of the vesicle. The section on the Calvin cycle is needlessly complex. I found myself viewing an overview on the MIT website, so that I finally understood what the book was getting at. Then I went back to the book and understood the reading.I shouldn't have to look up each topic online to get an overview before I read the book. For most courses I take, the book is the reference we refer to first. Not so for this course with this book. This is doubling the amount of homework time spent on an already complex topic. The diagrams include many acronyms with little or no explanation. Pretty pictures, but they don't elucidate the key points without a different text for explanation.I am almost done with this semester and am on my way to getting an AB, the equivalent of either an A- or a B+ at other universities. I do not feel as if I have learned much for the amount of time I have spent, and I am an extremely hardworking honors student.GET ANOTHER BOOK."},{"Title":"The World of the Cell, 5th Edition","review":"This books is great because it is hard cover and because it is easy to understand.

Normally, I find it interesting to read biology books for my classes, but this one was so boring that it was painful to read. The author goes way into detail about the individual enzymes involved in every single cell process. The book is so detailed that it makes it difficult for students to get the \\"big picture\\" out of every concept covered. Every time I tried to read chapters of this for my class, I would fall asleep. I talked to other friends who were in my class. Everyone agreed that this book was plain horrible to read. If you are required to read this for your class, then I feel sorry for you. All I can recommend is that you go to all of your professor's lectures and write down everything they say so that you don't have to read World of the Cell."},{"Title":"The Circus of the Earth and the Air","review":"Let me begin by saying that I read this book, start to finish over the course of an evening, so as far as the &quot;page turner factor&quot; goes, this book has it in spades. Stevens manages to grab the reader's attention early on... around page two... and hold it. A very, very, impressive command of suspense, especially for a first-time novelist.The story is told in a straight-forward, lucid, almost childlike prose. This is both a stregnth and a weakness. While this approach-- for the most part, simple, declarative sentences-- makes it easy to read in one sitting, it robs it of a certain resonance. It a pharse, the language is not deft enough to create any real sort of ambiguity or enigma. Now, obviously, this is a matter of preference. I'm a reader of Pynchon, Millhauser, Kafka, Bartheleme, Gaddis, Barth, Coover, etc. I feel that Stevens' work is, in a sense greatly informed by such authors-- especially Millhauser, and on a more subliminal level, Kafka. Stevens does invite you into a dreamworld, but there really isn't much for the reader to do but observe. This is an enjoyable, but not challenging book. It doesn't ask the reader to do a lot of work. Worse, there is a sort of &quot;feel-good-new-agey&quot; thread that surfaces once in a while, and seems evident in the Hollwood-esque ending. (another reader remarked that the ending was open to interpretation-- I don't really believe that it is open to ENOUGH interpretation-- there are really only two possibilities.) The &quot;blue light&quot; I felt, to at once be cliche, but also not really explained well enough. There is a difference between deliberately creating ambiguity and being unclear. I think Stevens just doesn't explain himself well enough. Ultimately, I think the book is a very successful, straight-forward thriller that tries to hard to be something else... the stray meditations on Christianity, the existence of higher powers (the Blue Light???)just seem out of place and are never really followed through.... the story fits together like a comic-book or sci-fi trilogy-- 10 pages in which a mysterious character explains every mystery in the book up to that point. Great for turning pages, not so great for expanding minds."},{"Title":"The Circus of the Earth and the Air","review":"After all of the great reviews, I was VERY disappointed with this book. And frustrated. I found the ending ruined the story. There were a lot of really good passages in this book, however. But in the end the story is rendered pointless. For me the book was a pointless journey, and in the end it was completely meaningless. It made me angry that I got hooked on the story so quickly, only to find absolutely no meaning and no redeeming qualities in the end. A total waste of time. Too bad. It could have been fantastic. Even 3 years later, the waste of my time spent reading this book is the only thing memorable about it."},{"Title":"The Circus of the Earth and the Air","review":"It literally took me mere hours to read this captivating novel by Brooke Stevens.

Every person with a soul will make a strong connection with the story and its main character- you will never want to leave the world of The Circus of the Earth and of the Air."},{"Title":"The Circus of the Earth and the Air","review":"I read this book over a weekend and took the next week to come down. The world is ours? but what the protaginist went through, and the intercies of reality the circus seemed to exist in was a trip and a half."},{"Title":"The Circus of the Earth and the Air","review":"This has become on of my favorite books. I recommend it heartily to certain friends who are willing to take a ride on a magical realism journey where danger and romance are encountered in an alternate reality that is similar to but diffracted from our own. I'm a sucker for all things circus and the author worked under the big top himself and knows his stuff. The author is reminiscent of Hitchcock, Cormac McCarthy and Jim Crace in his ability to create an ordinary character we care deeply about who perseveres in the face of danger and despair. His second novel, Tattoo Girl, is also a dark masterpiece of magical realism. As another reviewer said, \\"Circus\\" is \\"difficult to describe\\". Since it won't be in a bookstore by this time, check out the Amazon \\"preview\\" at top of page and see if a few pages grab you.

Doesn't mean I don't enjoy it, as displayed in Mr. Stevens' narrative. I was, indeed, grabbed by the first few pages, and kept reading, thinking this would lead to an interesting conclusion. Since I was a novice to this form, I greatly appreciated Mr. Stevens' ability not to give anything away, treating all readers like first-timers. This, to me, was good. There was a lot of potential regarding secret societies, and the dream-like quality of the whole thing was intriguing. All-in-all, I was expecting more. After such an impressive build-up, the ending was a disappointment. I'm left wondering what it was all about. This is, apparently, not a genre that I'm prone to. Sorry..."},{"Title":"The Circus of the Earth and the Air","review":"This booked reminded me much of &quot;The Unconsoled&quot; by Ishiguro.

It's a novel not quite like anything else I've ever read. It's exceptionally ambitious for a first novel, hitting all the big themes and doing it in an interesting, original way; it doesn't quite pull everything off, but it's a fine attempt.Alex and Iris are your typical married couple-- they're in love, but they have the same kinds of fights every married couple does. Until, that is, they see a circus while on vacation and decide, on impulse, to attend. Iris volunteers for the disappearing act... and never returns. In order to unocver the mystery behind his wife's disappearance, Alex must infiltrate the circus, a nightmarish, and yet absurd, world of existential horror and desperate joy.If Jean-Paul Sartre-- or, perhaps, Jean-Paul Sartre's paperboy-- had been obsessed with circuses, he might have written this novel. Stevens' characters have that same sort of dreamlike two-dimensionality to them-- they're there for the purpose of advancing the story, and you know they're there for the purpose of advancing the story, but that doesn't make them, or the story, any less engaging. Stevens puts his characters into the oddest situations he can dream up, and has them shift emotion at the drop of a hat in order to accommodate these situations, and none of it ever seems contrived. (Okay, almost never.) The story's the thing here, though, and the story demands of both the author and the reader, \\"look at me! Pay attention to me! I'm what'[s important here!\\" It takes the strongest of stories to pull something like this off, and Stevens' story manages it-- almost. There's something missing, however small-- a gleam more emotion in the characters, or a bit more realism, perhaps a stretch or two where Stevens should have paused the action for characters to reflect a bit more. I don't know. But the skeleton shows through the skin a few times and pulls the reader away from the wonderfully phantasmagoric world which Stevens wants us to inhabit. Still, though, the potential is worth it, because when you finish this book, you will know Brooke Stevens is a talent you need to know more about. ***"},{"Title":"The Circus of the Earth and the Air","review":"Okay, so I will admit it. I have not researched the author one bit, so this review will come clean from my head with no supporting material. This novel is an extremely entertaining read, though it does feel a bit as if it had been written by a novice writer. One with great talent, but one who is not quite at the top of his game yet.The book is a wild ride, I will give it that. It has a touch of magical realism, a healthy dose of the absurd, and an absolute fascination with the Circus. In many spots, it is quite haunting, and for that alone, it is worth the read.One of the small flaws I noticed, was the absolutely unnecessary (and somewhat anti-thematic) adultury. Didn't quite get the purpose for all of that when the book is basically the main character's search for his wife. Absolute conviction and dedication don't really mix with infidelity on a plot level.Still, at around 10 bucks, it's worth ignoring the few flaws. All-in-all, an easy-to-read entertainer with some higher aspirations."},{"Title":"The Circus of the Earth and the Air","review":"This book was very well written, but the last chapter did not seem to explain many things in the book that seemed as if they were of importance. The answers that were given seemed as if they were there just to finish the book. I thoroughly enjoyed the book till the end though."},{"Title":"The Circus of the Earth and the Air","review":"This book operates on an entirely different plane than most other novels. It is an action novel that's simultaneously psychological, mythological and emotional. The many scenes, which are almost entirely visual and exquisitely beautiful, operate on multiple levels. Proof of this is the way the story and characters seem to infiltrate the reader's dreams. For myself and most of my friends who read it, we found it nearly impossible to put down or to stop thinking about for that matter. It is an experience that you will not forget."},{"Title":"The Circus of the Earth and the Air","review":"This book was quite a surprise. I read only the back cover when it was presented to me as a rather interesting book. I wasn't quite sure what to make of it and then I started to read it. It was fast paced right from the start. The writer didn't waste 2 chapters explaining in detail the charaters and background... and for me that was a wonderful thing. The story flowed well and I couldn't seem to put the book down, even when I knew I had to.This is a must read for anyone that likes romantic adventures."},{"Title":"The Circus of the Earth and the Air","review":"There are thousands of novels published every year, but only a few ever rise to the top of the literary heap. Stevens' novel is among the elite few. It manages to deftly combine the elements of a love story, Americana, surrealism, Gothic art, and European film into one beautiful engulfing tapestry. Stevens does what few writers do successfully: carve out a unique landscape that is completely his own. The classic American journey-novel has been given a much needed shot in the arm by Stevens, and I hope that in 10 to 20 years this becomes a part of the so-called canon in high schools and colleges.This is one of three books I'd take with me if I were on a desert island. A big-hearted book that embodies the word &quot;escapist&quot;.So buy it now from Amazon!"},{"Title":"The Circus of the Earth and the Air","review":"This book was quite a surprise.

It was like Brooke Stevens had gotten into my head at night and captured my dreams. The book is a dream. I've often thought about figuring out how to most accurately convey the dream world to others. Brooke Stevens has done it! It captures the thick and mysterious atmosphere of the circus and carnival. There are hints of Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes. A must read for anyone who has fantasized about running away with a dark carnival or is just fascinated with the hallucinatory world of dreams. This book is a masterpiece! Thank you Brooke!!"},{"Title":"The Circus of the Earth and the Air","review":"This book has been described as an &quot;action novel,&quot; as &quot;ethereal&quot; and &quot;esoteric&quot; and &quot;suspenseful.&quot; I argue that it is none of those things. In fact, I would argue that this book is nothing more than a meandering, clumsy tale that appears to have been made up as the author went along.The set-up is great, and as far as novel concepts go, a good one: a couple go to a circus, the wife volunteers for a disappearing act, and, uh-oh, she never reappears. The circus performers completely ignore the panicking husband, and the next day, nobody anywhere has any knowledge of the cirucs, its existence, etc.I once went on a forest walk with a friend, and he claimed to know where he was going. We walked for five hours, and although it was obvious he was lost, he asserted he knew where we were. We missed lunch, we sprained ankles, it rained at some point, and finally we emerged right where we started. &quot;See?&quot; my friend said, &quot;I told you I knew what I was doing.&quot; I decided not to argue with him.This novel is that friend. It takes you through some interesting places, some mind-numbingly dull places, some confusing, painful, and altogether pointless places, and emerges right where it started with a weak, half-hearted &quot;voila!&quot;I am not one to discount absurdism in art, or to deny the ars gratia artis in the world of novels, but only when it is well-done. This book could be considered &quot;well-paced&quot; if the trip took you anywhere; because the journey, here, is the point of the book, and not the destination, the utilitarian style of writing only stultifies any kind of mood or atmosphere that Stevens is attempting to create. I found myself reading faster and faster and faster, sure that around the next corner I'd discover something of interest, something profound and meaningful. Instead, I just found more corners! By the end, I'd turned so many of them that, whoops, I was back where I started.Finally, my biggest complaint is that the novel presupposes an air of importance and metaphorical self-righteousness that gives it the grace and subtlety of a pubescent tirade. The metaphors are clunky, heavy, and EVERYWHERE (count the number of fish and sea similes, I dare you). The over-arching themes of the book attempt to make the point of the story weighty and substantial and significant, but only serve to highlight just how uninteresting and dull the main character (Alex) and his actions really (usually) are.If you want an ethereal, metaphorical, creepy, mystery to read, skip Circus, and check out Danielewski's House of Leaves. His book has almost the same goal, but he achieves it with the elegance and style Stevens only hints at."},{"Title":"The Circus of the Earth and the Air","review":"There are very few books that I remember for years after I read them, and this is one.

With what you think happened? With what the narrator thinks happens? Remember the last time you took way too much cold medicine and could have sworn your mom was walking through walls and your dog had turned into a flying monkey? Welcome back to that state of mind. Opening on a deserted beach, Stevens quickly takes us to the circus, where popcorn is purchased and wives are lost. From there, onto a mysterious island-based military fortress, where that wife may or may not be. To his credit, Stevens never creates a dull moment. The pace is furious, and the barely buried psychological implications are immense. On the minus side, Stevens does not rank up there as a writer with one of the prettiest styles I've ever encountered. At more than one point, the language seems functional at best. One is reminded of an old cliffhanger series. Some parts are more than a little implausible, even a bit corny, yet you HAVE TO know how it all turns out. When you're not in the mood to tackle Ulysses, but you're not really psyched for Dean Koonz either, give this one a shot.

To understand the history of this area and why it poses such a threat is not easy for someone who has only recently decided to learn more than what is provided on television or in the newspaper. Sumit Ganguly's book presents a thorough history. I have searched several sources both online and in other books and haven't found anything elsewhere that is not in this book. Ganguly offers more than one solution to the problem but it seems that no one is really interested in listening right now."},{"Title":"The Crisis in Kashmir: Portents of War, Hopes of Peace (Woodrow Wilson Center Press)","review":"Kashmir interests me on several levels, and not just because of the increase in our trade and business relationships with people on the subcontintent. As a Canadian Federalist I see elements both common and different with Quebec separatism - and Quebec was in \\"crisis\\" around the same time. As a liberal centrist my concern is about societies that polarize themselves, or fall to one extreme or the other - and here the Indian nation as a whole has done reasonably well navigating the waters. But to see how it got there one needs to look at the history.To summarize the situation is not to do it full justice. Historically the valley of Kashmir and the adjacent territory of Jumma formed a single Raj with a Muslim majority, but one that was ruled by Hindus. The region is the north of India abutting Pakistan, Afghanistan, China and unilaterally annexed (by China) Tibet. (Ganguly provides 2 reference maps at the opening of the book.) In 1947 the goal the Indian National Congress was to create a secular and democratic state. In contrast the goal of Pakistani nationalists was to create a religious Muslim state for South Asian Muslims (pp8). Kashmir, physically between the two, could have gone either way. A third option, independence for the landlocked region was a weak alternative. Interestingly enough, and I found this a fascinating point, Kashmiri independence was opposed by China who viewed it as a similar signal for Tibet.From the Indian POV, Pakistan and the ISI were the agents behind fomenting insurgent in Kashmir since the late 1970s, through funding madrassas and training guerilla fighters among the youth and encouraged towards Islamic fundamentalism. Pakistan's argument was to appeal to nationalist and Islamic identity, citing corruption, betrayal, despotism, religious discrimination and other memes designed to broker discontent. In the 1965 insurgency featuring infiltratrators from Pakistan did not received local support, most Kashmiris would up siding with the Indian government and many of the mujahadeen were turned in. Overall Pakistan's attempts at instigation backfired badly. Not only were these allegations too sweeping, they paled against the same behaviour exhibited by the accusers, writ large in the accompanying democide that occured during the 1971 secession of Bangladesh.Ganguly emphasizes that in the Indian model Kashmir is not the only province where a federal minority is a local majority - the Sikhs of Punjab being the closest example. If Kashmir were to leave that might lead others to follow. As such most Indians regard Kashmir as an integral part of the country (the same can be said of English Canada's regard for Quebec), and though the feeling inside Kashmir itself is mixed the argument for pluralism is that it has offered more opportunities for growth, liberty and advancement that the alternative next door in Pakistan.Which is not to say that the central government did not make it's share of mistakes, and Ganguly does a good job of detailing the negative impact of Indira and Rajiv Ghandi's drift to centralize state power. Another problem was the central government's granting a concession restricting against selling land in Kashmir and Jammu for Indian nationals from outside the region. New Delhi also tended to ignore corruption and mismanagement in Khashmir itself, rather than stirring up trouble with Sheikh Abdullah and other Muslim leaders. Ganguly concludes with his assessment of options going forward.The book does have a few drawbacks, one of which is the large number of players in the conflict, some key, others fleeting, that are mentioned. There is a profile of the various insurgent groups in one of the appendices at the back, but a timeline and a dramatis personae reference would also have helped. At times I found it difficult to keep track of the relationships and allegiances.Ganguly's book was written in 1997. At the risk of speaking too soon, the crisis in Kashmir is over. The Federalists won. The separatists and insurgents lost. The Kashmiri economy is growing and the Pakistani alternative offers little attraction. That doesn't mean that the government in New Delhi can be complacent or that secession is still not a possibility - but that is a problem for another read."},{"Title":"The Crisis in Kashmir: Portents of War, Hopes of Peace (Woodrow Wilson Center Press)","review":"Easily the most detailed and well organized treatise on this unfortunate conflict. While on one hand it establishes the nefarious designs of the Pakistani establishment, it also exposes Indoor Gandhi's chicanery in subverting the will of the Kashmir electorate via crass political subterfuge (e.g. transfer of Governorship to her puppet, a certain Jagmohan Malhotra). One of Dr. Ganguly's proposals, granting autonomy, is a dangerous one; this could lead to similar demands from the other disturbed states. It is critical that we listen carefully to the demands of the disenfranchised and work to mitigate decades worth of pain. The 1965 conflict deserves a more thorough coverage though."},{"Title":"A Land to Call Home (Red River of the North #3)","review":"I wouldn't have been surprised if the author wrote that the characters \\"cooked themselves up some POSSUM STEW.\\" The dumb hillbilly language started appearing in Book #2, and now that I've finished Book #3, I am so irritated by it that I've lost interest in continuing the series.I am from the South (30+ years) but now I live in North Dakota (10 years). If I was a Norwegian, I would be very insulted that the author portrayed my ancestors as talking like a bunch of country bumpkins. I've got nothing against talking that way. I talk that way sometimes! I \\"cain't\\" help it! It is very endearing IF you talk that way naturally. But Norwegians and North Dakotans don't talk that way, don'cha know? (Oh, sorry, that's Minnesotan). Where did the author come up with that idea, if she did so much research, spent time in the state, talked to locals, and even has Norwegian ancestors? If she wanted her characters to talk like that, then she should've written a series set in Arkansas or Kentucky or Tennessee, etc. - in the South - where they DO talk like that!!Furthermore, I have NEVER heard anyone, ANYWHERE, say \\"if'n\\" in real life. The only people I may have ever heard say \\"if'n\\" would have been Granny or Uncle Jed on the old TV show \\"The Beverly Hillbillies.\\"Kaaren is the community's schoolteacher for a while, teaching all the little Norwegian children to speak English, yet \\"she done picked up\\" some pretty poor grammar skills somewhere, with all them double-negatives and incorrect tenses they all keep using. Most all the main characters are portrayed as Norwegian immigrants, and yet the reader is to believe that they've all picked up on this country slang somehow? And from whom are these characters picking up their hillbilly grammar skills anyway, if most everyone else in the Red River Valley are fellow Norwegians??? There were no hillbillies around there for them to pick it up from. Besides, people simply don't start talking like the locals in a region just because they live there for a while. I've lived in North Dakota for 10 years, and I hear the locals say \\"uff da\\" all the time, but I don't say it. Likewise, THEY haven't started speaking with a southern drawl and southern colloquialisms just by being around me.At times, the characters carry on lengthy conversations with perfect grammar, then next time, bam! back to country slang. Make up your mind. In reading these books, I could \\"hear\\" the native Norwegian accent and dialect when the characters were talking \\"normally\\", but then the author throws in that poor grammar, and it just doesn't fit. Call me obsessed, but it just bugs me...\\"We don't got no slates.\\"\\"Can't a body give a gift if'n they wants?\\"\\"Lessen you'll take a stewing chicken or some such.\\" (Unless)\\"Lessen twenty dollars, I think.\\" (Less than)\\"Well, shoot, if that's going to be your wedding dress, you'll do us all some proud.

We get the picture. Must every mention of babies have to be about nursing, putting them to their breasts, etc.? (Before anyone jumps all over me - I nursed all my children and enjoyed it.) Also, I really did not care to know that Ingeborg was taking turns nursing Kaaren's twin daughters. Who cares if they may have done that in those days. TMI.Kaaren, in her job as schoolteacher, is constantly called \\"Mrs. Bjorklund\\", even though she is now Mrs. Knutson. How does an author make a goof like that? And how does that get by editors and publishers???It appears that they buried the Baard's stillborn baby, Elizabeth, twice - first in Ch. 14, the day after she was born, then again in Ch. 26, when the ground thawed. Author goof again???In Chapter 26 & 27, little Andrew goes from baby talk, to adult-sounding conversation about watering the cottonwood with logical complete sentences, and then back to baby talk again (\\"Astrid so little\\"), all in one day.Someone else pointed out that Ingeborg could not have used the same gun to shoot both deer AND geese. It would have blown the geese to smithereens.Now, all that being said and gotten off my chest....I just have to say that I did not miss the big picture. The experiences and actions and reactions of the characters in this book do inspire me to trust in God more and talk to him more, and thank him in all of life's circumstances, big and small, good and bad. So for that, this book WAS worth reading."},{"Title":"A Land to Call Home (Red River of the North #3)","review":"If you like Christian historical fiction, this series will not disappoint.

Even though he is young and immature, he is a hard worker with an eye for the future and inside information on the plans of the railroad. Kaaren delivers twins, nearly dying. One twin is not healthy and Lars cannot accept his deaf daughter. School is in full swing in the prairie schoolhouse, with Kaaren as teacher.Ingeborg and Haaken travel a far distance by train to escort home the seriously injured younger sister of Kaaren. Solveig is a bitter, disappointed young woman who was on her way to join her sister, but whose future is crushed in a train wreck. Face scarred and barely walking, she goes home with Ingeborg and Haaken. Olaf, Kaaren's long lost uncle, mysteriously turns up after a long absence and his many talents make him useful and loved.Penny has finally decided to travel to Fargo for work and further schooling. The farms continue to progress - a large wooden barn now graces the homestead of Ingeborg who gives birth to another baby, Haaken's first biological child. Metiz continues to weave in and out of the lives of the pioneer families. Her grandson, Baptiste, stays with his friend Thorliff to go to school and help with the farm work.As much as she balks, Ingeborg gives up her plowing and hunting after teaching young Thorliff to take her place. As usual, tragedy does not pass over them without leaving scars. A tragic fire, blizzards and failing farms cause loss of life and dreams. Agnes give birth to a stillborn daugher. She harbors intensive anger toward Hjelmer for hurting her dear niece, Penny.The railroad is coming and the time for proving up their land arrives. Both the Bjorkland widows are remarried with families. Extra people share both homes now. A large sack house stores their grain for direct loading on the train.The book ends with their town becoming a water stop for the railroad, a real town with a real name, Blessing. In spite of the author's confusion with family relationships and forgetting Kaaren's married name, book 3 still deserves 4 stars."},{"Title":"A Land to Call Home (Red River of the North #3)","review":"Those pioneers are sooo brave!

On the one hand the state has some spectacular scenery. I think Red Rock Canyon is the best Vegas has to offer for hiking and sight seeing. I also like exploring (spring time only) the Lake Mead Recreation Area. Mt. Charleston offers fine mountain hiking and Great Basin National Park is a real gem in the national park system. On the other hand, I also like being able to drive an ordinary car to trailheads, and it is here that Nevada presents obstacles not found in my home state of California. A significant percentage of the hikes Mike White describes in this book require a high clearance vehicle just to get to the trailhead. On top of that, in many cases trails are not maintained. Fortunately White provides very detailed route descriptions, an absolute necessity when attempting Boundary Peak and several lesser known hikes in the state.On the whole this is a good book. It is not intended to be comprehensive, but is rather a selection of what the author thinks are the best walks in the state. The Ruby Mountains receive a lot of attention, as does Nevada's half of the Lake Tahoe region. I was pleased to see that Cathedral Rocks State Park also received a nice write-up. Sharp pictures and decent location and hike maps will help those who want to further explore the Silver State. But in the final analysis, for many casual dayhikers (I am often in that category and my wife always is) the rigors of getting to the trailhead will discourage attempting many of these trips. What Nevada needs is an outdoors book along the lines of 'California Hiking' by Steinstra and Brown. Such a book would be far more comprehensive than this one and list hikes for all levels of walkers. It would also provide more opportunities for those whose sense of adventure does not include replacing the transmission pan on their vehicle after, or worse yet during, a trip to the mountains. But if you are willing to risk it, this book is for you. It offers high adventure without the crowds found in other western states."},{"Title":"Broke down engine, and other troubles with machines","review":"_The Broke Down Engine and Other Troubles with Machines_ (1971) is a baker's dozen of short stories by Ron Goulart. They were published between 1958 and 1970. Five stories came from _Fantasy and Science Fiction_, two from _Fantastic_, two from _Playboy_, and one from each of the following magazines: _Galaxy_, _Amazing_, _Worlds of Tomorrow_, and _Venture_.The title comes from the _Broke Down Engine Blues_, which a computer sings in the title story:Feel like a broke down engine, mama,Ain't got no drivin' wheel.If you ever been down and out and lonesome,You know exactly how a poor man feels.Goulart says in his introduction that \\"the moment of breakdown can often be the moment of truth\\" (8). He is talking in part about the breakdown of machines. But he is also talking about the breakdown of society and human sanity.Now, this theme can be found in many of Goulart's novels. But in these short stories, it is more distilled, more powerful. The punch is stronger, the satiric bite sharper. The stories are prone to disturb you. They stick in your mind in a way that most of his novels do not.Two stories (\\"Princess #22\\" and \\"The Katy Dialogues\\") deal with androids of has-been movie stars from Biz Enterprises. In the first, the manager and android are caught up in a revolution. In the second, the two are stranded in a jungle, and the human goes quietly insane.Two stories (\\"Broke Down Engine\\" and \\"Terminal\\") are chillers set in societies that are systematically \\"eliminating\\" surplus populations by gas. Goulart's point in both pieces is that once you start, you can never turn back. Sooner or later, the killers will be the victims as well.Several stories involve appliances that run amok. \\"The Trouble with Machines\\" features the sky-blue killer refrigerator. \\"Lofthouse\\" involves a mechanized house that cuckolds its owner. \\"Disposal\\" dramatises the human insanity that results when a garbage disposal breaks down. The last line of this story is a gem.Several stories are concerned with social sevices that go awry when turned over to robots-- hospitals in \\"Calling Dr. Clockwork,\\" food services in \\"Nobody Starves,\\" and the police in \\"To the Rescue.\\" (\\"Calling Dr. Clockwork,\\" incidently, invites comparison with Harlan Ellison's \\"'Repent, Harlequin,' Said the Ticktockman.\\")\\"Joker for Hire\\" concerns a welfare bum who succeeds in spite of himself and what he does when he Makes It To The Top. \\"Muscadine\\" involves the problems of managing a robot author. And as for \\"All for Love\\"... I will just say that it is one of the damndest love stories that I have ever read.So if you have ever felt broke and hungry with no place to go... Or if you sometimes feel that time is out of joint... If you sense that the old order of things is collapsing... Take a look at this collection. I can't guarantee that it will make you feel any better.

All myths have meaning, and the task hasbeen to translate the myth into the myth-languageof our own era. For the most part, the languageof our mythology is the language of psychology.And of course there are several styles ofpsychological language: Jungian, Freudian, Adlerian,and so on. In this case, the language goes backto Plato and has been brought to the presentidiom through the work of Paul Diel, the lateAustrian psychologist.Plato, the great voice of the journey of thehuman soul, was the first Western writer to speakof the idea of spiritual development, the ideathat a human being might lead his life in such away as to AWAKEN [my caps] within himself thedivine life. The possibility of such a discoverymakes Plato's works a psychology, or a study ofhuman behavior in the physical, intellectual,and spiritual sense.

Too many of the books I've read lately give us the magic formulas to follow, some leading us through a veritable mathematical maze to tell us what kind of leader we are. &quot;Principle-Centered Leadership&quot; by Covey and &quot;The Platinum Rule&quot; fall into this category. What Blanchard and Shula have done, and done quite successfully is to integrate theory with actual examples. While I don't agree with everything that Shula has done, I do applaud his efforts. I do absolutely believe in his philosophy of &quot;Lead by example,&quot; and the necessity of developing trust. Both Shula and Blanchard emphasize this aspect of leadership as critical. There are too many so-called leaders in the corporate world who do not lead by example. They are quite willing to demand of you what they are unwilling to do themselves. On top of the quality of the reading, the book is very easy to read.

It's a &quot;hands on&quot; doer's guide. The strength Ken Blanchard brings is his strong Christian influence. Shula's credentials consist of his long term track record as an NFL coach. In this book Shula describes how he leads by example and thorough preparation.One place this book separtes itself from books of this genre is that it emphasizes &quot;follow through&quot; as contrasted with goal-setting. That's an action focus. It puts the spotlight on doing something."},{"Title":"Everyone's a Coach: Five Business Secrets for High Performance Coaching","review":"Don Shula, the National Football League's all-time winningest coach, teamed up with Ken Blanchard, the internationally known and multiple award-winning author, educator, and management and leadership consultant, and together they co-wrote an outstanding book about leaders getting the best performance from the individuals and organizations they are privileged to lead. Whether you are responsible for the performance of multiple organizations, or for just one other individual, the leadership wisdom and insights in this book can help you maximize your coaching and leadership effectiveness.The winning combination of the two separately distinguished leaders in their respective fields, and the complementary structure of the book were brilliant. Organized around the acronym C.O.A.C.H., the five coaching \\"secrets\\" that Shula had practiced and Blanchard has been teaching for over 30 years, the book alternated synergistic passages from Shula then Blanchard to explore and explain the acronym in theory and practice from the football gridiron to modern business situations, and ultimately to the game of life.Here's how Shula and Blanchard define and think about the acronym C.O.A.C.H.:Conviction-Driven: Effective leaders stand for something.Overlearning: Effective leaders help their teams achieve practice perfection.Audible-Ready: Effective leaders, and the people and teams they coach, are ready to change their game plan when the situation demands it.Consistency: Effective leaders are predictable in their response to performance.Honesty-Based: Effective leaders have high integrity and are clear and straightforward in their interactions with others.Conviction-Driven: \\"Someone has said that a river without banks is a puddle. When I apply that saying to human interactions, it reminds me of the job of a coach. Like those river-banks, a good coach provides the direction and concentration for performers' energies, helping channel all their efforts toward a single desired outcome. Without that critical influence, the best achievements of the most talented performers can lack the momentum and drive that make a group of individuals into champions.\\"Overlearning: \\"To me a game doesn't end when the clock finally runs out. It ends on Monday, after we've analyzed every play and learned all we cana from it...Failure is successfully finding out what you don't want to repeat...Learning is defined as a change in behavior. You haven't learned a thing until you can take action and use it.\\"Audible-Ready: \\"Preparation means everything to me. I'm passionate about my players being ready for anything. Now, part of being ready is being able to shift your game plan at will. I see myself as a battlefield commander who has the guts to make the right moves to win. I want to be prepared with a plan - and then to expect the unexpected and be ready to change this plan. I must preserve the right to change - even to change at the last moment - as circumstances demand...Audibles aren't surprises - just new ways of doing what you already know how to do. Business people need to learn to call audibles, because in today's world, nothing stays the same.\\"Consistency: \\"Your team will soon learn what your standards are and perform accordingly. I not only insist on practice perfection, I'm there to see that it takes place. I don't miss practices. I need to be out there smelling out whatever isn't working. Even the slightest deviation from perfection needs to be noticed and corrected on the spot. Correcting and redirecting performance is strategically important - it's where we outstrip the competition. Some coaches will let little things go. Right there is where the difference is made. To me, it's not a matter of how many times we've done it or how late it is or how tired the players are. We'll do it until we get it right. Then we won't deviate from it in the game. I'd rather throw out a play or formation during practice than find out it can't be done correctly in the ball game. We seldom try anything on game day that we haven't been able to perfect in practice. If I'm asking our players to do something they can't do, I want to know about it now.\\"Honesty-Based: \\"I have a straight-up approach. I don't know how to go around corners or how to finesse. My players know this and they expect candor from me. Congruence is important to me. What you see with Don Shula is what you get. I don't play games. Effective coaches confront their people, praise them sincerely, redirect or reprimand them without apology, and above all are honest with them. Integrity pays, and integrity means being honest with yourself and others. This is a key ingredient in my coaching philosophy.\\"In his introduction to the book, Blanchard stated that he is on a search for simple truths to help leaders and managers be their best. With Shula's proven long-term coaching effectiveness as the foundation for this book, Blanchard has found and shared many simple leadership truths and complexities. This book would be a welcome addition to anyone's coaching or leadership collection."},{"Title":"Everyone's a Coach: Five Business Secrets for High Performance Coaching","review":"This is a must buy for every coaches library.

That is pretty obvious. And as the master painter and draftsman once noted, \\"Wisdom is the daughter of experience.\\" The book is authored by NFL coaching legend Don Shula, and Ken Blanchard, a prominent businessman. The authors derive the many anecdotes for this book from their own success. Basically, the book is composed of the following useful information: advice, strategies, summaries, key points, varying points-of-view, and so forth. I found the book to be a good, thorough read. Sometimes, what I need is concise, well-organized reminders of what works and does not work for someone who wishes to be at the top of their game. The book is not a magical pill. Besides, why should it even be that easy? Perhaps there is another coaching book out there that offers more inspiration. Who knows? It is really a matter of taste or preference. Nonetheless, Shula and Blanchard's book is informational and all information is useful, especially if it comes fairly cheap. Just layer it on if you must have more. Otherwise, this is a good, useful read."},{"Title":"Everyone's a Coach: Five Business Secrets for High Performance Coaching","review":"When I first read this book, 15 years ago, I didn't understand so much because I was not used to American Football then I decided to learn about it and everything becomes more clear to me, the acrostic: Conviction-Driven, Overlearning, Audible-Ready, Consistency and Honest-Based is very simple to understand and apply."},{"Title":"Everyone's a Coach: Five Business Secrets for High Performance Coaching","review":"As an Australian I have had very little exposure to NFL football and did not know of Don Shula, his records or his coaching philosophy... having said that, I was geatly impressed with Shula, his approach to coaching, training and people... and equally pleased that Ken Blanhard could bring life to these principles within the business dynamic.The book offers a wonderful collage of stories from Shula, the players and officials that give insight to the man behind the records, so for Dolphin or NFL fans, it, in my humble opinion, makes for a good read.The book also offers a business perspective on the coaching principles of Shula, offerred by Blanchard. For those interested in coaching people or teams, be it in sport or in business, it offers wonderful gems and insight.I really enjoyed it and gained a lot, though I must say, it is not an 'answer-all' for leadership and coaching.

It tells you just about anything you may ever have wanted to know about working on your bike and more importantly, how to set it up properly. It goes through everything step by step, but not in a dummies fashion. The writing is straightforward, entertaining and best of all fact filled. I would call this the bible of dirtbikes.

The 3rd edition is in color and MUCH easier to read. 3rd edition has a 'bit' more 4 stroke info but not enough to justify buying the 3rd edition if you have the 2nd.Good book. Good for beginners and as a reference for the experienced.You may want to take some of the things he says with a \\"grain of salt\\" or \\"does this apply to me\\" attitude though. Page 22 has a Maintenance Interval Chart that suggests changing the transmission oil every 2 hours and a top end rebuild every 10 hours - or less depending on riding conditions. Not sure I want to change the oil in the middle of a 4-hour easy trail ride.

I was looking for something that had a bit more \\"theory\\" to it than a a factory service manual. In your service manual you have step by step instructions on how to perform maintenance. In Motocross & Off-Road Performance, Eric Gorr shares his extensive knowledge and secrets of the trade.Everything from basic control set-up to engine porting and crank rebuilding is covered. While the more advanced topics are not as in-depth, they serve as a great primer for those looking to take their do-it-yourself to the next level. If you're just doing basic work and maintenance on your motorcycle, there's still plenty of information for you. Suspension set-up is covered in extreme detail, as well as carburetor tuning.The bike-specific section is extremely helpful as well. Eric looks at all the Japanese bike manufacturer's and gives each model and year an overview; it's strengths, weaknesses, and ways to fix those flaws.Again, you'll find plenty of insight and little tips and tricks in this book. There's no doubt that this is an essential shop book for everyone from avid dirt bike riders to enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Motocross & Off-Road Motorcycle Performance Handbook, 2nd Ed. (CyclePro)","review":"As an active veteran off-road motorcyclist, here is my review of the second edition of the new Motocross &amp; Off-Road Performance Handbook. The original edition of this book was released in 1996. It featured a unique way of organizing and presenting technical information about off-road motorcycles including a master reference of extensive tuning tips for bikes. The original edition of the Performance Handbook was a best selling motorcycle title that won a Bronze Medal at the 1997 International Automotive Media Awards, in the technical how-to books category. The new edition of the Performance Handbook includes expanded sections for beginners like choosing types of off-road bikes and basic maintenance, as well as enhanced interactive links to online forums for more technically advanced tuners and race mechanics. Nearly 50,000 words and 50 photos have been added for 225 pages of information on dirt bikes from the early 1980s through 2001 models. Chapters like Suspension and 4-Stroke Engines have been enhanced to cover the latest models and newest technology. The new book also features a dirt bike buyers guide for companies in America and the UK including web site links. The author, Eric Gorr was a monthly columnist in the off-road motorcycle press in the US, UK, Australia, and Spain. Gorr is also published in the SAE and holds two US Patents related to IC engine technology. Currently he's a moderator on the dirt biking web forum DirtRider.Net Other interesting books on similar subjects would be the Sport Bike Performance Handbook by Kevin Cameron, the Two-Stroke Tuning Handbook by A.

In the previous volume, Pranj held back the mental thrusts of the agents. Illusions appeared and were banished. The outlaw heard someone at the door and leaped to the entrance, only to be flung back unconscious. Then the crosstime agents took Blake back to their homeline.In this novel, Blake Walker has been a crosstime traveler since his infancy. Originally from another timeline, he grew up on Earth. Now he is a Wardsman in the Vroom Crosstime Service.Marfy Rogan is twin sister of Marva. Both are daughters of Eric Rogan, one of the Hundred on Vroom.Com Varlt is a Master Wardsman in the Service. Blake had known Com as Kittson during his first crosstime adventure.Pague Lo Saie is a senior Wardsman in the Service. He had used the name Erskine in the previous adventure.In this story, Marva disappeared from the Project. Although her personnel disk indicates that she is well, Marfy cannot reach her mind. So the detector is wrong.Blake travels to the sterile timeline of the Project to deliver a minor instrument and to check up of the girls. When he arrives, neither girl is in the camp. Marfy is out in the storm and Marva is supposedly away in the helicopter.When the storm lets up, Blake meets Marfy out by the rocks. She explains her concern over Marva and asks to return with him to Vroom. Then the Project loses contact with the helicopter.Blake and Marfy take his crosstime shuttle back to headquarters, but it loses the settings and slips out into an unknown timeline. Blake checks the controls and finds them damaged beyond repair. Then they are attacked by intelligent turtles and lizards. Finally another shuttle detects their emergency beacon and takes them back to headquarters.Marfy knows the crosstime level to which Marva might have gone. Eric equips a small party -- including Marfy, Com, Lo Saie and Blake -- to check out the timeline. If Marva is there, Marfy will sense her mind.This tale confronts Blake with a conspiracy on the Vroom homeline. On various occasions, he is attacked physically and mentally. Only his sense of danger and his mindshield keep him alive and free.These works definitely influenced Turtledove'sCrosstime Trafficnovels. Unfortunately, this story is the last in the series.

Jordin"},{"Title":"Quest crosstime","review":"Blake Walker is a warden who is called upon to track the whereabouts of one of two sisters, who has vanished while in a transport ship on another world. His task leads him across alternate worlds and timelines, and he encounters political mysteries and intrigue.Science is lacking in this novel, and character development is non-existent. Many of Norton's books feature people or animals/aliens that are interesting and easy to like. Not so here. Telepathy is prominent in this story, but here it is strictly between humans, and it far less interesting than other Norton stories involving animal telepathy. There is plenty of action, but not enough background to care about it. Despite all the action, I experienced mostly boredom, and not suspense. This was a rare disappointment for me, with an author that I have always counted on for quality stories."},{"Title":"Quest crosstime","review":"I'm not familiar with Andre Norton beyond a couple Witchworld novels, but I do enjoy world hopping and alternative history. I picked up this book second-hand, after reading the back.I couldn't get into the story. The names were distracting. Marva and Marfy on the same page (both of which keep reminding me of Jack Chalker's heroine Mavra Chang), and Com-Com Varlt, Vroom (can't stop picturing a three-year pushing a bright yellow truck), Saur To'Kekrops, Ulad, Kyogle, and Tursha Scylias. (Cyclops, Gargoyle, Scylla.)The story happens in media res, with a long drawn out setting description that glazed my eyes. Apparently a group of 'wardsmen' with psionic powers are on an expedition across worlds. Technology consists of 'copters, rods, tapes, persona beams, and level-hoppers (large and silvery), not one of which is well-described. As a citizen of 2008, I could not picture this world (written in 1965) without modern computers.Plot? One of the Rogan twins is lost (Marva or Marfy, not sure which), and Blake Walker (the hero) is stuck helping her. Oh, and the weather is bad. The first world jump is an encounter with spear-tossing telepathic lizards (too stupid for a a dog-pile, which could have taken out Blake) and super-strong turtles (yeah, turtles). This is where I put the book down for being too silly.The prose of the novel was on the pulp side, with Norton overusing exclamation points like no tomorrow. I cannot recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Quest crosstime","review":"This is the second of the Crosstime books by Norton. Blake is well ensconced in the Crosstime life now.

In the first five pages of a keyword search using \\"Corvette\\" on this web site, there were more than a dozen listed.What makes Jerry Burton's new book, &lt;u>Corvette, America's Sports Car--Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow&lt;/u> a standout from others of this crowded market are: text which matches the quality of its pictures and a selection of gorgeous photographs and drawings from the General Motors archives and other sources, some of which have never before been published in a book.With this title, Burton brings significant journalistic credentials and Corvette expertise to the table. He's the founding Editor of prestigious \\"Corvette Quarterly\\" magazine and was just reappointed to a second term as Editor of \\"CQ\\" after spending several years in other capacities at the magazine's publisher, Campbell-Ewald Publishing. In addition, he's the award-winning biographer of the car's first Chief Engineer, Zora Arkus-Duntov. Mr. Burton was on the founding Board of Directors of the National Corvette Museum and has been involved with the Corvette community for over 25 years.If you're ever read Jerry Burton's work in \\"Corvette Quarterly\\" or read what's known in the Corvette hobby as simply \\"The Zora book\\" (&lt;u>Zora Arkus-Duntov: The Legend Behind Corvette, Bentley Publishers, 2002&lt;/u>) then you're familiar with Burton's smooth, rich prose. He has knack for focusing on the emotion and the mystique of the Chevrolet Corvette which is near unmatched in automotive journalism. Another reason I liked reading this book is: while the technical aspects of the car receive some coverage, thankfully Burton does not get bogged-down in a lot of nuts-and-bolts issues which can be the kiss-of-death in a book like this.Of course it's the eye candy aspect which makes or breaks a coffee table book. While such titles can be successful only average writing quality, they are failures when the pictures are anything less than excellent and &lt;u>Corvette, America's Sports Car&lt;/u> has no shortage of exquisite images. In fact, you'd better have this book actually on a coffee table because those reading it will leaf-through the first few pages, then want put their coffee cups down and begin to view the book's imagery intently.The book's publisher, Hugh Lauter Levin, Associates, has a successful track-record of producing high-end, large format, hardcover books like this and the match of Jerry Burton's writing, his insightful selection of photographs and drawings and the publisher's execution of the coffee table book style makes for an outstanding Corvette reading experience. I marveled at the book's use of an actual C6 Corvette emblem on the cover. I also couldn't help but marvel at Levin Associates' timing of &lt;u>Corvette, America's Sports Car--Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow&lt;/u> (published Fall 2006) because it makes a wonderful Christmas gift for any Chevrolet or Corvette enthusiast."},{"Title":"Corvette: America's Sports Car: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow","review":"In Corvette: America's Sports Car-Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow, Jerry Burton shares the comprehensive story of Chevrolet's longest running model and one of America's all time favorite sports cars.

His book The Great Dirigibles, Their Triumphs and Disasters (formerly titled ships in the sky, The story of the Great Dirigibles)is sure to please even the most knowledgeable airship reader. Toland investigates the origins of airships and includes many of the pre-Zeppelin era narratives. The book is full of first hand accounts and includes an excellent index and an acknowledgement section (which will be of interest to serious readers). The strength of the book lies in the fact that it is not another re-telling of the Hindenburg disaster. The Norge, the Italia, the Shenandoah and other airships get equal treatment. There are also over two dozen pictures with captions. This is an easy to read book that will thrill the novice and please the serious studentsof airship history."},{"Title":"The great dirigibles;: Their triumphs and disasters","review":"This is the first book I have ever come across that painstakingly details the demise of airships. Toland has recreated conversations and personal details from countless sources and testimony. Each accident and triumph is covered in detail. I loved this book. It is a must-read for any airship enthusiast."},{"Title":"The great dirigibles;: Their triumphs and disasters","review":"Most books on airships are written by specialists, experts, or those who had a part in the development of the great dirigibles. John Toland is a interesting exception, an extreamly accomplished author who turned his attention to the subject. This book is a re-titled (and only very slightly re-edited) version of his book 'Ships in the Sky' from the fifties. Due to the original publication date, he was able to interview many of the principle figures in the stories, most of which took place in the twenties and early thirties. Most everyone is familiar with the Hindenburg disaster of 1937, but this book will introduce them to many other facinating accounts. He covers the R101 disaster, which was the British avaiation equivalent to the Titanic. Also included is a excellent account of the Italian 'Italia' drama at the North Pole (get Wilber Cross's 'Disaster at the Pole' if who want a book entirely dedicated to that event). Also covered is the United States Shennendoah, Akron and Macon crashes. Perhaps the highlight is a minute by minute (more like second by second) account of the Hindenburg crash."},{"Title":"The great dirigibles;: Their triumphs and disasters","review":"John Toland's dated but compelling history tells the story of Zeppelins and dirigibles during the early 20th Century by retelling several moments of triumph and disaster, from the experiments of Solomon Andrews in 1865 to the crash of the Hindenburg in 1937. The narratives stick closely to the source material and provides only descriptions and dialogue gleaned from interviews and eyewitness accounts. The book's age is apparent through its stylistic quirks, such as Toland's annoying tendency to refer to the few women in the book by the names of their husbands. These complaints aside, \\"The Great Dirigibles\\" successfully evokes both the romance and danger of lighter than air ships during the early age of flight."},{"Title":"The great dirigibles;: Their triumphs and disasters","review":"A well written account of what went right and what went wrong with the great airships. As more went wrong than went right,it is mostly an account of the disasters. The chapter on the Italia and Gen. Nobile was long and a little tedious as it was more an account of how they survived after crashing their airship in the arctic than about the airship that took them there."},{"Title":"The great dirigibles;: Their triumphs and disasters","review":"This is one of a relatively few books covering the aviation history of the dirigible, or rigid airship. In the last century it was pioneered by the Germans, then experimented with by other nations. It ended with the Germans as well when the Hindenburg exploded in front of newsreel cameras. Most books look only at the Hindenburg disaster, ignoring the crashes of the R101, Akron, Shenandoah and others. Toland tells the story of them all, including accounts of ten disasters. It will soon become clear to any reader that the airship had more 'tragedy' than 'triumph' of course. It is a wonder they lasted as long as they did.The only fault I found with this book is that Toland devotes all his efforts to telling individual stories. These are necessary and interesting, but more attention could have been given to other aspects of the matter, such as parallel aviation developments or political events."},{"Title":"The great dirigibles;: Their triumphs and disasters","review":"Perhaps you have never heard of Dr. Solomon Andrews of Perth Amboy, New Jersey, who occupies the first chapter of John Toland's \\"The Great Dirigibles.\\" Andrews claimed to have invented an Aereon balloon that could be flown into the wind, thanks to taking the advantage of the \\"differences in specific gravity\\" between the Aereon and the air.Yeah, right. News reports from the 1860s claimed that Andrews flew his ship in figure eights and against the wind over Manhattan. Only John Toland, who later in life proved himself to be a perfect gull over fanciful claims about the attack on Pearl Harbor, and -- this is a group I had not known existed before reading this book and doing a little side exploration -- a body of kooks devoted to the history of occult flying machines in the Gilded Age believe this.Ah, well, as a belief it is no sillier than chiropractic and a lot less dangerous to your well-being.The remainder of this book is unsatisfactory though not as crazy.Hydrogen has gotten a bad rap in connection with dirigibles, because of the fiery crash of the Hindenburg in 1937, the first time a transportation disaster had been captured on newsreels. But while a big bag of hydrogen is undoubtedly dangerous, hydrogen explosions were not what brought down most dirigibles. Almost all the United States Navy's big airships crashed, and they didn't use hydrogen.You might suppose that a book subtitled \\"Disasters\\" of dirigibles would explore the underlying cause of all these disasters. Not here. \\"The Great Dirigibles\\" was originally published in 1957, the 20th anniversary of the end of the dirigible, but it is not a mere catchpenny tract culled from old newspaper files.Toland, a trained (although not very competent) historian, interviewed scores of participants in the dirigible madness and examined a thick pile of documents. And produced something not very much better than a mere catchpenny tract, although written with some style.Toland later became a famous historian, as nice an example as one could wish to find of the triumph of style over substance.His book is one of personalities, without taking much interest in the technique of something that its promoters claimed was a -- sometimes, the -- technological marvel of the age. The personalities are sometimes vivid, although Santos-Dumont, who is still imagined to be the inventor of the airplane by many Europeans, comes over as an insipid character. He invented an actual dirigible but could not think of any better purpose to use it for than to make showy entrances to Parisian cafes.The most attractive character in the book is Umberto Nobile. Italians are not usually thought of as dirigible masters, but Nobile was extremely successful, the first and last man to fly a dog over the North Pole in a balloon twice. He was victimized by the Fascists, and his adventures take up more pages than anyone else, even Count Zeppelin.Since most of the book is made up of escapes -- the dead tell no tales -- \\"The Great Dirigibles\\" makes a good read if you like that sort of thing. Unlike contemporaries, Toland does not shy away from sordid behavior, like the looting of the corpses of American flyers by the salt-of-the-earth Ohio farmers when the Shenandoah crashed.But, except by implication, you will not find out why these big beasts went down. The inherent problem of the rigid dirigible is that its light (duh) structure cannot withstand racking forces.

Camille Claudel's soul found it's path into mine and I felt all the hate towards August Rodin that she was incapable of because of her love for him and breathtaking passion for her own and his work. In a lot of ways this book resembles &quot;One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot; in revealing how a human spirit will not bend...."},{"Title":"Camille Claudel: Une Femme","review":"Ann Delbee's nonfiction treasure introduces us to one of the most compelling personalities of recent history. Camille Claudel was, in trite terms that fail miserably to serve her, a contemporary, colleague, and lover of the famed sculptor Auguste Rodin. Not merely a biography, but an unabashed dissection of the life, loves, and works of a true Renaissance woman, this biographical masterpiece illuminates every nuance of an extremely complex persona. Detail and development are so extensive that it is difficult to remind oneself that this is not AUTOBIOGRAPHY. We are thrust into the midst of the stormy relationship between Claudel and Rodin and learn of her influence on the great artist's life and work. At the same time we reflect on Claudel's own place in the art world of her time. The artist paints a vivid portrait of Camille's home and family life, particularly the special bond she shared with her brother, the poet Paul Claudel. Delbee succeeds with splendor in developing an understanding of Camille's unique positon as a woman in her society. Ultimately, Camille Claudel rises from these pages both triumphant and tragic."},{"Title":"Camille Claudel: Une Femme","review":"I was there in Paris in 1983, 1986 and 1989 at one of the hot spots of her life and have pictures of my X in the garden. I've been compared to this artist and only now understanding why. I've studied art history since I was a very young and am always gaining a little more as I go about that continual work; pickin' up every stitch I can. Sometimes and artist is abused and used and left no shred of acclaim or respect; just milked by those with power over them and cast aside; left for dead and disregarded and forgotten. This I know in a very personal and hellish way. Maybe I was drawn to those spaces in spiritual way by unseen forces? Maybe there's more to all this than science can explain. I understand why she shut it all down; not wanting to have any more of her soul desecrated; to toil in slavery to her art alone without anyone really in her corner. There are a lot of Camille type people out here in the shadows. I've met many of them in my travels. Her mentor thievin' abuser was a very typical kind of personality type that dominate much of the art world; sadly. (The Law of the Jungle), is as present in that realm of human activity as in any other. All men and women who create in such a way as she did must give a concerted and powerful lot of love as they blast away that often borders on madness. I'm sure she had much more in reserve; a victim who suffered long with P.T.S.D.; no doubt; but more sane could anyone hope to be given the circumstance. Maybe having the clout to get your feet planted on that high-wire she was so great at traversing in the circus of art isn't a prize worth seeking; a lesson to youngsters that will mostly be overlooked; leading to the cycle being repeated by others until, (The End)."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Soul: Cartoons for Teachers","review":"Bought this as Father Day gift for Dad.

She has come to this position after walking away from a position as an assistant chef in a thriving, well regarded restaurant after being passed over from promotions one too many times. Lydia has been hurt by unfulfilled love in the past and comes to the company to focus on her potential for opening her own restaurant and with no thoughts of looking for love. This all changes on the very first day at camp when she meets her cabin neighbor and camp sports director Kennedy.Kennedy has walked away from an illustrious career in sports at the height of his popularity and money-earning potential; he is owner and sports director of this camp that fulfills his dream to help those who have had fewer successful opportunities than he. He, too, has been scarred by romances gone wrong in the past and has sworn off serious commitments with women. Something about the gutsy, confident Lydia shakes his resolve on that point however.In this book, Alers explores the coming together of these two wounded and mature souls in an all-satisfying way that explores both their friendship and burgeoning romantic interest. The book is a 2-in-1 bonus that also contains the previously published novel \\"Home Sweet Home\\" in which Lydia was first introduced as the younger sister of the male romantic lead Quintin Lord. Although this second story doesn't rise to the same level of greatest as the newer one, it is a nice touch to include it in the same book."},{"Title":"All My Tomorrows (Arabesque)","review":"Every little girl dreams of growing up and finding just the perfect man to love and to be loved by.

As a reviewer, after reading a book, I sit back and think about the story. This is a story that I couldn't seem to get out of my mind. Instead of this being the authors words, it was like a movie. I could almost visualize all of the people in this character driven novel and in today's literature, that is definitely a refreshing twist.Ms. Alers really outdid herself. Although, the scheme of this story was romance, it was refreshingly clear to see that the little people (children) in this book had voices as well.

Glass, MAed, author of Mediumship To Go (www.thelotuscircle)Mediumship To Go - Kit.Legends In Blood, The Vampire in History and Myth is a clear, well written study, which brings together the myth, legend, history, and literary analysis of the vampire. The authors thoroughly examine the various themes that have perpetuated the fascination with vampire lore, and how it has evolved, from the beginnings of recorded history until present day. As the subtitle suggests, the focus is on why the myth of the vampire has continued to intrigue throughout history. The authors explain the themes crucial to the vampire phenomenon and show the relationship between different areas of the occult which intensify the impact: witchcraft, setting, eroticism, religion, nature, pacts, the Magus, or wise character, etc. Aside from its appeal to those interested in the history of vampire lore, this book has much to offer any reader interested in how the vampire phenomenon has affected the psyche of the masses in religion, daily life, literature, and films.The authors define vampirism in two ways. One definition includes the two classic elements of the physical appearance of death combined with the ability to return and feast on the blood of the living. The other description is of a person who lives by preying on and exploiting others. They then research, using historical accounts and literature, the phenomenon's origins. The works cited, from Keats to Buffy the Vampire Slayer are interesting and accessible to both specialists and the general reader. The terminology used is fairly universal and easy to read.The modern mind is still predisposed by magic. Vampire films and books, although now viewed as fiction, remain spellbinding due to the construct of the aspects of life and death, of immortality and eroticism that manage to access our deepest fears. Vampire stories are centered on the power the vampire has over its victims through the link of blood. From ancient myths to the Bible, there is the belief that children will pay for the sins of the parents. This belief is part of the vampire legend as well. Vampire legends often state the un-dead will come to feed, first, upon their kin. The myth is highly linked to ritual. If burial rituals are not properly observed, the newly deceased will come back as an unclean being, a vampire. The authors make use of fascinating folklore tales which describe different ways in which a vampire is created. One is predisposition, in which an evil life is followed by an evil death. Another states the vampire is made by predestination, for example, suicides, a child born out of wedlock, or the seventh child of a family, children born with a caul, or with teeth. Yet another claims the vampire is created as a result of a violent event, nearly always the result of a vampire attack.As the Age of Reason attempted to squelch all things mystical, the vampire myth swelled in literature and theater due to man's innate need for the supernatural. The main focus of the vampire story, whether it is myth, legend, folklore, novel or film, is caused by one basic human reaction. The vampire accesses many of our major fears: pain, strangers, and death. Vampire lore opens a space where the two worlds of life and death touch. The vampire is poised between the two with access to both, but belonging to neither, exposing those chasms which will continue to enthrall mortals until the end of time. The literary vampire poses questions about life and death, about the weakness of the human mind and body.Without Christianity, the vampire myth would have died. The very perverted nature of vampirism shuns it as taboo by Christian doctrine. The authors examine how the church used superstition to perpetuate the vampire myth as a form of control. The concept of vampirism is constructed around several contrasting paradigms, particularly of women, held by society over time. What is different is to be feared. But what is different, is also alluring, exotic. The book explains how the vampire myth has adapted with time, from a cemetery haunting revenant, to a Byronic creature of mystery in a cloak.The modern vampire has transformed the myth even further. In some contemporary works, crucifixes hold no power over the vampire, much as, in life, the church is no longer a dominating force. Even the sexual taboos have changed. In Victorian vampire literature, wanton behavior, such as that of Stoker's Lucy after she was made a vampire, was considered taboo. Anne Rice's vampires deal with homo erotic relationships, as connections between homosexuality and the AIDS epidemic have become prominent.There are a range of measures in folklore on how to deal with a vampire. The book examines those and their historical significance and origin.Fear of vampires has not dissipated over the centuries, rather it has adapted to more modern fears. Fear of death is still very real and ageing is still inexorable. Vampire myth exploits these fears, even given the secularization of modern society.Several features in this extremely well organized study deserve mention. The authors provide and explain quotes from literature any vampire enthusiast will recognize, linking them to modern vampire lore. Several \\"real\\" vampires are detailed, including the story of the heinous Elisabeth Bathory who murdered 650 girls and bathed in their blood in hopes of restoring her youth and beauty. The authors include detailed notes and references. Their interest in the subject is apparent in the concise and interesting writing style. Included are comparisons to other supernatural beliefs and how these beliefs tie into and mirror vampire lore. The bibliography shows a clear command of the relevant sources. This book would make a solid addition to anyone interested in vampire lore.I have long been a fan of vampire literature and films. I was very pleased with this study and, as an enthusiast, would loved to have read more, however, the authors covered their subject matter very thoroughly and to add more would have been superfluous. I am not aware of any other book which handles the vampire myth in a historical, rather than sensational, manner. An Amazon.com search yielded only one book which dealt with modern vampire literature and films in America, and touched upon the history, but was not as in depth as this work. I believe this book would be invaluable to anyone writing vampire literature, from the romance novelist to the screen writer. It also works as a social history of how superstition and the church governed through fear, and shows the importance of ritual in our lives. In all, this was an enjoyable book which I found well researched and well written."},{"Title":"How to Fly the B-29 Superfortress: The Official Manual for the Plane That Bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki","review":"This interesting reprint of World War II original Combat Crew Manual for B 29 Crew is a real &quot;first hand&quot; report of combat capabilities of the famous bomber, as seen by the eyes of the personel responsible for manning the aircraft in operational sortie.This pubblication is different from the &quot;dash one&quot; or pilot handbook, where basic system description, perfomance, normal, abnormal and emergency checklists were illustrated for on board use. This volume was intended as an operative manual to get the troublesome B29 a viable combat machine. As such, the book was prepared to master the aircraft capabilities for planning and achieving best results in the assigned mission. In fact when Boeing designed the plane, many advanced technologies were implemented, consequently the bomber suffered some teething troubles like the nasty tendency of engines to run hot (especially along prolonged climbs) and the difficulties in exploiting the new avionics and combat systems, like the bombing aiming equipment and the defensive layout (the turrets were remotely controlled, like barbettes in a battleship); so manning all systems required technique and crew coordination.To improve combat performance, combat-like training was paramount and this book was the main reference to transform a type-rated pilots and specialist members into a combat ready crew as a whole. In this retrospect, it is much of interest the short foreword by Gen Curtis Le May, the famous Air Force General showing its personal view about the right thing to do in aerial warfare, a condensed line of thoughts that was his personal viaticum for life and career.For aircraft enthusiast, this volume is really riveting for the wealth of technical details scantly reported by the historical profiles, because the latter are dedicated to tell the bomber service life and operational history. Here instrumentations are thoroughly covered, and above all, the best procedures to use them are clearly presented, showing how revolutionary was this plane for the bombers community when introduced in active inventory.

He quietly builds the foundation for the fourth Reich, his final act? To appear before the world and stand trial for his actions.

So, what really DID happen in the bunker?"},{"Title":"The trial of Adolf Hitler: A novel","review":"The 'Trial of Adolph Hitler' sounds like a fascinating concept for a novel, and that's why I bought it. Although the writing was fair, I feel the story could have been researched & written much more thorough. It seemed to me the novel was written in spurts, because some parts seemed very suspenseful and fluid, yet others seemed like they were added to fill gaps. I got the impression the author tried to hurry and finish the story. It could have been a much better novel had the author spent more time on developing the character of the 80 year-old Hitler. For the most part, the character seemed like the stereotyped, one-dimensional dictator you see in 1940s cartoons; but a few short times, his persona seemed to take over. I would like to have seen more of that character. The first part of the novel seemed more detailed and well written; then there was a short trial, and then it ended. No big surprises. I was hoping Hitler's defense would bring up Stalin's atrocities, the US support of Castro and the Vietnam \\"Conflict\\"; I kept hoping for a 'message' but there was none. Still, a fair read. I learned a few things about Germany I didn't know. However, the trial seemed phony & the defense would have objected to the prosecutor selecting the judges. Just didn't seem realistic."},{"Title":"Common Errors in Statistics: (and How to Avoid Them)","review":"Good:-This text is written in a friendly, accessible style.-Issues covered are relevant and solutions offered are practical.-Frequent reference is made to the technical literature in support of arguments presented.-Clear rules are articulated as to when one should consider using certain techniques.-Material is fairly timely, including coverage of many recent advances in statistics.Bad:-By its nature, this book will involve the authors' opinions, with which we may not all agree.

Some of these are easily corrected when one has the knowledge or expertise to understand that a mistake has been made. These could be designated as \\"blunders\\" and are part of the everyday life of a statistician or modeler. Other mistakes though are more serious, in that the investigator fails to recognize them and believes that the techniques used are valid for the problem that is studied. In addition, one can frequently fall into the trap of believing that mathematical or computational techniques or algorithms, whether done by hand or with the use of software, are always reliable and therefore require no independent checks or scrutiny. When statistical studies or modeling is done in an area where there is no danger to human or animal life, errors only have the effect of diminishing the validity of the study (and possibly the career of the investigator). In areas such as medicine and civil engineering however, errors in statistical studies can have serious ramifications for human life and safety, and therefore it is crucial that investigators be aware of how they arise and how to avoid them.This short book is very valuable in that it discusses many of the errors that can arise in statistical modeling and gives advice on how to avoid them in practice. It should be on the bookshelf of all practitioners, regardless of their accumulated years of experience or level of expertise. Sometimes it is difficult for modelers to admit that they have made mistakes, let alone admit that they need advice for performing tasks they may been doing for years. But it never hurts to acknowledge that certain practices, even if they are carved in stone, may not be applicable to certain situations, and this book gives examples of this that are drawn from real world experiences. The authors are careful not to patronize the reader, but they do not hesitate to point out some of the misadventures that have occurred in statistical modeling. Throughout the book they caution against a religious attitude about computer software and mathematical formalism, and give explicit examples of how unquestioned use of these can result in serious errors. This goes hand in hand with their belief, usually only implicitly expressed in the book, that time constraints (such as emergencies) and deadlines may restrict an optimal statistical analysis from being conducted, but that any analysis done using improper tools should not be christened as such by the statistician community. The length of the book of course prohibits an exhaustive analysis of statistical studies that have gone awry but the authors include references for the curious reader."},{"Title":"Common Errors in Statistics: (and How to Avoid Them)","review":"The thing that matters for practical purposes is that this is an original and very informative book - a must-see, without a doubt. The appreciation is dampened, however, by a feeling that \\"Common errors in statistics\\" was not written and edited with a lot of care. Self-repeats, typos and misplaced paragraphs are one thing - a peculiar thing, in a third edition, with a $50 price tag to boot - but mishandled or forgotten topics are a bigger problem. (Simpson's paradox and Bayesian methods are two examples, of very different magnitudes). Valuable as it is, the book could have been qualitatively better if the authors really invested themselves in the project. Instead, they produced a disorganized laundry list of points, some big, some small, some general, some very specific, some original, some very old.PS.

Despite their many applications in any modern society, statistics look unappealing to most people. Sometimes, both authors get lost in esoteric debates about some statistical topics that are of limited interest to a wider audience. Furthermore, Good and Hardin give too many examples that are related to the medical field. The authors could diversify their examples in a fourth edition of their treatise to further expand their readership. To their credit, Good and Hardin repeatedly warn their audience against the servile reliance on statistical software. Software users have to check the default settings to see if they are applicable to the application at hand. The authors correctly note that the most common error in statistics is to assume that statistical procedures can take the place of sustained effort. For this reason, Good and Hardin urge their readers not to let statistics and by extension statistical software do their thinking for them.

These are very experienced statisticians who have done much research and consulting. This is the thrid edition of a very popular book. I think its popularity stems from its wisdom, experience of the authors, their writing style and the practicality and suscinctness of their expositions. It is unusual because it teaches statistics by starting out with common mistakes and misconceptions.I think it improves with every edition. Some of my work is cited. For example starting in the second edition Phil Good being impressed with my bootstrap short course lectures decided to incorporation my list of common myths or misconceptions about the bootstrap. This is the only source that has it. It is not even in my bootstrap book. Also my work on the sawtoothed nature of the power function for exact binomial tests is included in this edition. I don't want to emphasize my contributions because they are just two examples amongst a wealth of material that follow the theme of the subtle nature of statistics that the novice need to appreciate.Their is much coverage about biostatistics a specialty area of the authors. In this edition the authors have added a chapter on data quality assessment, a chapter on correlated data and new sections on factor analysis and Poisson and negative binomial regression.

Louisa didn't want to marry the boring Frank, nor did she want to live with her stepmother. She was fortunate to get, after completing her training, what sounded like a pleasant and challenging nursing job--in Norway! Louisa was delighted, even though her patient, Claudia Savage, did cause some problems--not helped by the austere unco-operative attitude of Claudia's brother Simon. She couldn't understand why he was so disagreeable...This is the first Betty Neels story I've read where the hero wasn't a doctor and the setting wasn't Holland/Netherlands. The descriptions of Norway were fine. What I didn't like was the plot. The patient is an alcoholic. No one tells Louisa that, not the two doctors, not the brother (until halfway through the book). This is the first book of Ms. Neels where the doctors actually are incompetent. What else could you say it is when the two doctors never say to the nurse what the problem is-they gloss it over with euphemisms. I never warmed up to the hero, there was just something I found unattractive. If that wasn't enough, Claudia has a miracle cure for her drinking-she falls in love. Sorry, I just can't buy this storyline."},{"Title":"Heaven Around The Corner (Best of Betty Neels)","review":"I hurts to give one of Betty Neels' books only 2 stars, but I honestly don't think it deserves anything more than that. Betty wrote about 130 books, so we can certainly forgive her the occasional clinker. But, I read reviews as a way to determine how I spend my money, and I write reviews to help others do the same. So, I have to be honest. Heaven Around the Corner is one of Neels' worst books.The best thing about this book is the location. I know little of Norway, but the description of the boat trip up the coast made me curious and I looked up the area on the Internet. It is a beautiful location! Just gorgeous with snowy mountains, picturesque villages, a modern city, midnight sun, northern lights...and so on. It was the only reason I kept reading, and I only wish the story had done it justice.The good news: This is one of the few Neels books that is not about a doctor, and no one sets even so much as a toe in Holland. The hero designs and builds bridges, doesn't drive a Rolls or Bentley (but he does drive a Range Rover, a boat, and, later a Daimler) and the story takes place in Norway.The bad news: This is one of the few Neels books that is not about a doctor, and no one sets even so much as a toe in Holland. It gave me a new appreciation for stories about a mousy nurse and a rich Bentley-driving Dutch doctor.Louisa is a new graduate nurse and wants to get away from her stepmother and Frank, the guy who has been after her. Frank is short, plump, pompous, rich, and has a weak chin. (Apparently, it breaks some sort of rule to have a nice, pleasant-looking man be a rejected suitor.) So,she takes a job as private nurse to a woman who is returning to Norway.The woman has blocked duct, or something, and doesn't seem to be sick, but she does act strangely. Claudia is an alcoholic, but the heroine doesn't find out for quite some time has passed since both the doctors in England and Norway, and Claudia's brother, do not tell nurse Louisa. As a nurse, I find that truly unbelievable. Determined not to return to England and Frank, Louisa stays on and takes abuse from her patient...and then from the hero. In a last ditch effort to dry out his step sister, the hero insists they both accompany him to a small town in northern Norway- or else he'll cut off Claudia's funds.The hero, Simon Savage (seems odd not have a 'van der Someone' as a hero), is paying Louisa, and he is not pleased since he thinks Louisa is not going to be able to handle his step sister. Well, if had told her what was going on instead of making snide remarks, perhaps she could have! Simon makes himself as disagreeable as possible, and I did not like him. I didn't care for him even at the end of the book, either, when the inevitable and sudden admission of love came and he stopped sniping at her and called her darling. He is rude, cold, and mean. Neels throws out a couple of unexpected kisses, but the whole buildup to his declaration of love falls flat since there is nothing to indicate the man is doing anything more than simply tolerating Louisa.The heroine spends way too much time bathing her patient's face, tucking Claudia in bed with books and magazines, and drinking coffee. Claudia is an alcoholic, but you would think she could wash her own face! Apparently not. Louisa waits on her like a maid and steps in every time the spoiled woman, in her thirties, pitches a fit and starts screaming and crying. It was hard to read and stomach.So, overall, the story just did not work. The whole set up is uninteresting and dry, and there's no reason for Louisa to flee the country in secret. There's no chemistry between the Hero and heroine. The hero was unlikable and a jerk, and when he declared himself in love at the end, it just didn't fit. The heroine falls in love with the hero after he shows a little bit of warmth on the premise she saw a glimpse of how he might be a different man. (This made me laugh in disgust. She falls for a rude jerk after she rejected and ran away from Frank, who only fawned over her and was, at least, polite) Really, there was little to enjoy...other than the descriptions of the area.I cannot recommend this book. If you are on a quest to read every Neels book, then find a cheap or free copy. I would not suggest you spend much money, if any, to read this one. Turn the corner and keep going..."},{"Title":"Heaven Around The Corner (Best of Betty Neels)","review":"I'm going through a Betty Neels phase & have read over 50 of her books so far (at least 60+ more to go). Some stories were extremely good/romantic keepers, others were 'eh', but to date, this is the worst story I've read.I find Betty Neel's heroines to be either outspoken (gives as good as she gets) or the Cinderella doormat (shy, mousy, quiet, will-do-anything). In this book, though the heroine had a backbone, it was for the wrong thing, i.e., making excuses for the mean & inconsiderate actions of the spoiled brat alcoholic patient (who I think was described to be 30!). Basically, she was outspoken to the hero but a doormat to the awful patient...and the hero pays her salary! This appalling excuse of a guy was always mean & condescending. Most of Betty's heroes come across as cold but display some moments of tenderness or scenes of thoughtfulness, this guy was just an a-hole.This story is so not Betty Neels at all; makes me wonder if she was forced to write this book to meet some contract agreement or if she was attempting her hand at writing a Harlequin Presents story."},{"Title":"Heaven Around The Corner (Best of Betty Neels)","review":"I\`m a huge Betty Neels fan and have been for a long time.

Neleman shows us the hard core reality female sex workers in Guatemala have been forced or simply spiraled into. The strength of this photographic body of work is that it appears non judgemental; it is neither condescending nor pitying, in fact there is an incredible dignity in how the women are portrayed. The work just feels honest. There is a huge crescendo of emotion in the portraits, some prostitutes stare into the lens with a spirit that cannot be broken, while others reveal their hurt with urgency. Hans Neleman shows us their stories through intimate revelations; bodies, eyes, scars, environments and possesions. Every detail is essential and is there for us not to pass judgement but to help us understand their lives and their humanity. Night Chicas contains some of the most important and powerful images I have seen in this genre of photography and in fact through his unique approach which is neither documentary nor artifice, he presents us with powerful insightful and visually stunning impressions which to me are simply timeless painterly observations. I could go on endlessly and talk about the beautiful light, the lush colors, and the artistic compositions, but that is not the point of this work yet they are bonuses that only support my belief in this artist's talent.Night Chicas is Neleman's third book and like his other monographs Moko - Maori Tattoo and his still life work in Silence a must have for every photography enthusiast."},{"Title":"Night Chicas","review":"A seminal photobook on the scale of a \\"Tulsa\\" or \\"The Ballad of Sexual Dependency\\".

These women are photographed, but their voices are silent. So many of them looked interesting, yet readers are robbed of any chance to hear them comment directly about their lives, work or aspirations.Yes, the photos are gritty, but there's also a sexiness to them. This fact, I think, comes out of the workers' comfortableness with who they are and what they are. A few of the subjects give us their sexy, playful side which is delightful to see when viewing these photos and, then seeing, understanding the real context of their lives.Honestly, I don't think the subjects in this book are any different from street workers anywhere else. If anything, the photos in this book, point this fact out very clearly."},{"Title":"Night Chicas","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I continue to look through the various images that are both interesting and disturbing. I was able to share the content with my 13 year old daughter as an educating tool. the photography is as even as the subjects that were photographed. I only wish that there was commentary from these sad women. This is not a book about prostitutes that you would desire as much as it is a book that depicts the sad truth about women that sell themselves because their bodies are all they have in the world of any value. still, there is text and it is written well but this book is about the photos...it almost made me want to shower after my first read."},{"Title":"Night Chicas","review":"Night Chicas is a complex, anthropological tour through a damaged landscape of various Guatemalan prostitutes. Tackling the difficult subject of prostitution with scrutiny and sensitivity, Hans Neleman traveled to Guatemalan brothels to photograph the women and girls who make their livings there. The result is over 200 color photographs, giving us a compassionate portrayal in which Neleman deftly fills the gap between documentary and rigorously staged portraiture, and ultimately restores the human value of these marginalized women. Essays by Ana Castillo, George Pitts, A.D. Coleman and Laura Asturias are featured."},{"Title":"Night Chicas","review":"*Night Chicas* is most powerful in that it presents these women silently - with no narrative from them - with no judgement against them, the people they work for or the men who give them money for their services.Hans does this with excellence.

I manage a team of consultants and nearly all of our clients are located abroad. In many of the places we work, there simply aren't books written about how to do business there. Even if there were, some have wildly different cultures from one region to the next (sudan is a great example, italy as well, though to a lesser degree) and many of our clients have a multicultural employee base themselves with their own gaps to bridge. To add to the complexity, my team is Lebanese and nearly all books written to 'explain' culture are speaking directly to westerners, in particular Americans. Nobody out there seems to be trying to explain the Egyptians to the Lebanese or the Sudanese to the South Africans.As an american, the primary target of these books, I've read many over the years and have been pretty disappointed by most. Few seem to go beyond cultural ideosynchracies and etiquette to the values and beliefs that drive those behaviors. I find that after spending a short amount of time in a place I've already figured out most of what these books contain. From my experience, just learning the the 'rules' can sometimes do more harm than good unless you understand the underlying cultural values that are behind those 'rules'. Not until you understand the motivation behind them, will you be able to apply them appropriately. Unfortunately, few culture books get to that level of depth.This is why I love this book. Bridging the Cultural Gap reviews in detail key areas where cultures tend to have differing interpretations about what is 'right' or 'appropriate' based on their underlying values and beliefs. The book also provides excellent anecdotal stories that help to cement the concepts.I found that once I understood the cultural variations discussed in the book, I was able to apply those concepts to my immediate environment and fairly quickly gain insight into the different cultures I work with. If you are really interested in understanding other cultures or need to do any kind of real business in another country (beyond conferences and trainings) I recommend reading this book first as a foundation then supplementing it with any country specific books you might find. Your ability to apply the rules laid out in the latter will be much improved by your understanding of the former."},{"Title":"Bridging the Culture Gap: A Practical Guide to International Business Communication","review":"I found this to be an enjoyable and informative read, but at the same time, I believe it is lacking a critical piece which renders it nearly useless as a reference.Each chapter focuses on a particular cultural dimension -- for example, relative vs. absolute truth; attitude about time (monochronic vs. polychronic); and preference for written vs. spoken agreements. It's well-written, engaging, and the anecdotes really bring the concepts home.However, I could see readers approaching this material from two directions: you either want to learn about cultural differences in a general sense, OR you need to quickly look up the interesting features of a particular region or culture. I consider the second to be the more important and probably most common real-world use, but unfortunately this book is not optimized for that at all.Many cultures are not referenced consistently, are only mentioned in one or two chapters, and are otherwise overlooked. The index is no help either -- you've got to either take your own notes as you read, or go back through the whole book to find what you're looking for. The last chapter does provide a helpful summary of the dimensions covered in the book, but it does not address this problem.I feel this oversight is important enough to dock 2 stars for an otherwise recommended book."},{"Title":"Bridging the Culture Gap: A Practical Guide to International Business Communication","review":"Remember freshman Global Studies in high school and the unit on colonialism? That was where many of us first learned the idea of ethnocentrism, which (in an overly-simplified definition) is the belief that our own respective culture and worldview is best. Through the lens of history we clearly see that was not the proper approach as rebellion, war and sectarian violence ensued in the colonial wake. However, there are some businesses that use similar ethnocentric principles as they expand operations into global markets. Author Penny Carte cautions in her book titled - \\"Bridging the Culture Gap\\" - that organizations that use a one-size-fits-all approach are likely to fit no one within the global marketplace. Carte further notes that the risk of cultural conflict and misunderstanding increases exponentially with each you country you enter. Sound view likes this book because the author relies on cultural preference scales, diverse cultural case studies and common sense to help businesses think beyond their own cultural norms. This mental exercise helps shift long held perceptions and habits, which better prepare any individual interested in international business. If knowledge is power, than this is a truly powerful book when it comes to cultural awareness."},{"Title":"Word 2000 VBA Programmers Reference","review":"This book is curious because it's too simple for an experienced programmer and it makes too many assumptions for a beginner.

Like all the other let's draw manga books, \\"All About Fighting\\" covers everything within its topic and much more. This book has every fighting style from fistfights to virtual reality battles. My favorite part of this book is the character design part, which shows tricks to designing characters, and also shows different kinds of characters and their traits.Some things included in this book are, costumes and uniforms involved in fighting, various poses involved in different fighting styles, a mini weapons encyclopedia, and short mangas (comics) with almost every fighting style to help interpret the use(s) of the style. Overall, \\"Let's Draw Manga: All About Fighting\\" is an excellent source of reference and inspiration.I think this book is a must buy for artists who want to pursue a job in manga making or if you just want to learn to draw a totally awesome fight scene. It substitutes having to take lessons from a teacher (even though I highly doubt you'll find one), and when it comes to what you can to do with this book, the possibilities are practically limitless! I would recommend this book to anyone who would be willing to listen."},{"Title":"Let's Draw Manga: All About Fighting","review":"This is an excellent book that has a wealth of detail, drawings, and information related to various kinds of combat in manga. There are sections on unarmed combat, armed combat, uniforms and costume design (as it relates to combat), supernatural (ala DBZ) combat, monster combat, robot combat, and even animal combat!There are a number of short 2-6 page manga that illustrate various points, and are decent examples of composition. Where this book really shines, though, is in the \\"Weaponless Fighting\\" and \\"Weapon Fighting\\" sections. There are a wide variety of techniques from various styles of fighting presented, and each section also includes a brief guide to designing characters for action manga.The book's only shortcoming is that it rarely shows more than one or two views of a particular attack type, but given the scope of the book, that's understandable.I highly recommend that beginning to advanced artists interested in the manga style acquire this book. For beginners it gives good information on techniques and tricks, and for advanced artists it provides a wealth of reference material."},{"Title":"Let's Draw Manga: All About Fighting","review":"This was a fairly helpful book.

From the perspective of someone who has been diagnosed with diffuse histiocytic lymphoma in the advanced stage, John Packo shares a practical strategy for coping with the harsh realities of cancer, based on the only True Hope."},{"Title":"C# Network Programming","review":"This is a good book if you are a systems admin (like the author) wanting to write simple network programs in C#. However, the author has a very limited knowledge of .NET programming. In most of his numerous code samples, his ignorance of CLR fundamentals shine through. For instance, on page 192 he has these lines of code in the VarTcpSrvr.cs listing:byte[] datasize = new byte[4];datasize = BitConverter.GetBytes(size);The first line of code creates a new byte array named datasize on the managed heap. Then the call to BitConverter.GetBytes(...) returns another byte array and stores the reference in datasize! The first byte array will now be garbage collected, as it is no longer referenced and was never used in the first place. The book is filled with code examples like this.If you are a professional developer, the book doesn't have much to offer, as you will likely already know nearly as much as (if not more than) the author. Not to mention, seeing all the poor coding samples will likely become a distraction. I still give this book three stars because the networking content is good and the code samples do, in fact, seem to work. They just happen to be coded poorly. Since the author doesn't really understand the platform he's coding on, approach with caution -- especially if you are a beginner."},{"Title":"C# Network Programming","review":"Overall this is a very good book. It has many examples with the entire source code to run different client and server programs. Although, I understand this might be a book for beginners, I was hoping to find out how to code a server for a very high volume of client connections. The book explains how to use the ThreadPool, but that is only good for up to 25 clients per CPU. The book also shows an example creating a thread for each client connection, but if there are hundreds of connections that will require the creation of hundreds of threads. So, the book does not really give any answers to the issue with large number of connections.Still, I enjoyed reading this book very much, but I feel that I might need to get a more advanced book."},{"Title":"C# Network Programming","review":"This book is a good introductory book to network programming in general. While it attempts to cover all the general topics that you can find in reference books like \\"TCP/IP Illustrated\\", it seriously lacks the breadth and depth of such reference books and falls short of tackling the real issues of Network Programming with the .Net frameowrk in C#.The .Net framework and the C# language bring some new design patterns and some paradigms that are definitely different from what we used to see with C/C++ or Java and I found that this book while containing a lot of source code examples in C# lacks coverage of such patterns and the .Net way of solving issues like high performance multi-client servers, performance oriented data handling over network connections, multi-threaded network applications design patterns in C# and .Net framework,...In summary, if you are new to C#, .Net and have never programmed network applications in another language and are looking for a book that covers a lot of subjects, this is your book. If you already have the TCP/IP Illustrated books and want an advanced book about how .Net and C# apply to network programming, I recommend \\"TCP/IP Sockets in C#\\", a much smaller book but extremely focused on what the title says!"},{"Title":"C# Network Programming","review":"This is a good book for learning network programming especially from Microsoft .NET viewpoint. The book has extensive coverage of Sockets which is the standard API for programming with TCP/IP. I am teaching a new course on Internet Protocols and Client-Server Programming and I am thinking of adopting the book as a reference for the programming labs we do in the course. I have few minor shortcomings on the book which I will pass to the author directly but overall the book is very good."},{"Title":"C# Network Programming","review":"This is one of those rare books that combines simple, direct, and to-the-point code examples with simple, direct, and to-the-point explanations. Both TCP/IP and UDP are covered, and there is an excellent discussion of what has to be done to interface with a non-Windows operating system. This is the clearest treatment of Serialization and Deserialization (XML, binary, and SOAP) that I've seen. I read this book from cover to cover; it is excellent."},{"Title":"C# Network Programming","review":"This is an excellent introduction to network programming. Even if you don't use C#/.NET, you may still want to have a look at this book as it discusses IP programming and techniques from first principles. For example, the book includes an overview of socket programming in the Unix world, then moves on to Winsock specifics before introducing the socket and higher-level classes in .NET. I really like the author's approach of explaining multiple ways to solve a particular network programming issue, such as how to deal with the fact that using TCP by itself doesn't preserve message boundaries.All of the code samples can be downloaded from the Sybex website and there is complete and perfect tie-in to the samples from the book. In fact, all of the code is reproduced in the book so you can effectively read it from cover to cover without a computer. Besides just listing source files, the author always explains what each block of code is doing.The code samples typically consist of self-contained client and server programs that illustrate a particular network programming topic. I found most of them can be tested on the same PC (except that you won't be able to analyze the network traffic as there won't be any). A few of them require two PCs as the client and server bind to the same IP port. To test the SNMP client programs, I didn't have access to a real Cisco router so I just downloaded a trial version of an SNMP agent simulator from iReasoning to test the programs.To reach the largest audience, the book describes how to compile, build and debug the sample programs using the command line tools in the .NET Framework SDK (which is a free download from Microsoft). I used Visual Studio .NET 2003 instead and had no problems with building any of the samples.Overall, the book does a great job of explaining what can be a complex subject area. It would have been good though if the author included an advanced topics chapter that discusses popular network-aware applications (such as chat programs, file-sharing systems, etc) and how they are implemented architecturally."},{"Title":"C# Network Programming","review":"I really found this book to be highly informative. I credit this one for helping me learn most of what I know about C# socket level programming. Topics covered various non-blocking methods including asynchronous processing via delegates, using threads both manually and with threadpools. He even included sections on how to handle incoming connections by polling. I also liked his &quot;when TCP goes bad&quot; chpater which discusses how to use .NET to circumvent errors and inconsistencies in transmission.Yes, this book does tackle tricky programming issues - but that's the nature of socket programming. If you want to get the most out of this book, read it several times and start writing your own programs using the techniques described. I spent quite a bit of time with this book writing a light-weight custom HTTP server using what I learned from this book."},{"Title":"C# Network Programming","review":"The author takes a bottom-up approach and gave a nice treatment on the underlying details of how TCP/IP networks operate, and then (almost) seamlessly moved up to how to write actual programs to handle common network related tasks, in C#.The examples are concise and to the point. Richard definitely gave a lot of thought to the structure of contents, and whenever I have some concern about a subject, an answer is often given right in the next paragraph.(There are just a couple typos but most of them are quite apparent and do not pose a source of confusion.)"},{"Title":"C# Network Programming","review":"I used a number of books as references for a server project in C#, including the \\"TCP/IP Sockets in C#\\" book referenced in another review, but that book is more geared toward academic use (though to his credit I emailed one of the authors of the book regarding multithreading issues that were not addressed in print and he was very responsive, so I support the purchase of that book to round out your sockets library as well). Blum's book provided far more practical advice relating to my project and was the one I consistently returned to for reference. I had an issue not addressed directly in the book, did a Google search on it and found the answer...by the book's author in an online discussion forum!In short, it is virtually impossible to find a book that addresses every last real-world gotcha inherent in starting any new project with a new language and class library as vast as .NET's, but if you have a C# sockets project to do then I can't recommend another book more than this one."},{"Title":"C# Network Programming","review":"I'm a computer science student as well as professional developer. I bought this book for a school project and immediately read almost the entire thing. The way that Mr. Blum describes and takes you through networking from simple to advanced is very helpful and explanatory. He describes the way networking was originally done in the socket paradigm on Unix and translates that into the object oriented world of C#. He explains how you can make the best use of the C# helper classes to make network programming much less painful. Thanks for a great book."},{"Title":"C# Network Programming","review":"In response to :&quot;I was hoping to find out how to code a server for a very high volume of client connections. The book explains how to use the ThreadPool, but that is only good for up to 25 clients per CPU...&quot;Actually, there is a technique to handle hundreds of clients, but the way to communicate with them all requires them all to be in an array. Then, like in a merge sort algorithm, divide and conquer with separate threads working on each division, sending and receiving data. If you think this out, it would end up becoming a pretty well optimized way to handle this amount of workload. Hope that helped."},{"Title":"C# Network Programming","review":"I was always enthusiatic to read a good book on solid network programming which is also easy to understand.

This fact is also mentioned by the author but nowhere in all the example codes explicitly do this conversion. Thus all the example codes are incorrect. This is very important because 99.9% of people developing software in C# will be running a little endian machine. I wonder if the author ever try to use his software to communicate with other software running in big-endian computers.Also, most of the examples are too simple for the experienced developers. I'd expect more from this book."},{"Title":"C# Network Programming","review":"This is a good book for learning network programming especially from Microsoft .NET viewpoint.

This book is like a USNA reunion, with former Mids from the Class of 1931 all the way to the Class of 1994 trading tales and sparking memories. It's particularly interesting to see the same story told from two different perspectives, as happens several times between these covers.The subtitle declares this \\"A Ring-Knockers' Bedside [or, as the title page has it, 'Bedtime'] Companion\\" and that's appropriate on two counts. First, while this is entertaining reading for anyone with an interest in the Naval Academy, its primary audience is definitely USNA grads themselves. There is a helpful glossary of Annapolis argot, but many of the stories will undoubtedly mean more to someone who's been through the Academy. I can think of at least one tale, involving a bowling ball, that while funny will still be largely incomprehensible to anyone unfamiliar with the internal geometry of Bancroft Hall.The second reason the subtitle fits is that I think this volume works best as a \\"bedside companion\\" for quick dipping-into before falling asleep. While I read the volume straight through from end to end, it seems like shorter, more leisurely visits would be more rewarding. In that sense, and given the vast number of alums who apparently didn't submit stories, it's a shame this book isn't two or three times longer than it is.If I do have a complaint, it's with the organization and arrangement of the stories. The chapters are divided up based on \\"The Laws of the Navy\\" Mids memorize during Plebe Summer, but I seldom saw the connection between a given story and its placement in the book. Also, some submissions are quite long and contain many reminiscences, while other contributors have had their stories divided up among several chapters. This results in, for example, Jeff Conklin ('93) making reference to \\"the same upperclassman who caught my 'Go Army' blunder\\" nearly 100 pages before the story of that blunder is told. Similarly, Bob Osmon ('60)'s entry on page 248 begins with the cryptic sentence, \\"The second episode didn't have such dire consequences\\" -- cryptic, that is, until the reader remembers to flip back to page 142, where Osmon mentions \\"Two events that happened to my roomie and me,\\" but then only relates the first of the two.Those complaints aside, it was nice to see both familiar names like Joseph Taussig (a hero of Pearl Harbor who died very recently), James L. Holloway, and Sumner Shapiro (a household name in my home, anyway) as well as many grads not so well known. These are some funny stories, and a look inside the Academy at things most visitors never see and most books never relate."},{"Title":"Tales from Annapolis","review":"_Tales from Annapolis: A Ring-Knockers' Bedside Companion_ (Omega Resources) by Rich Zino ('67) and Paul Laric ('49) is an amiable collection written by former midshipmen about the antics (and some of the antics are more serious than others) of student life at the Naval Academy. The contents will be best enjoyed by former midshipmen, but those who know little about Academy life will get to learn something of what the middies put up with. This is especially true of descriptions of fourth class (freshman) or \\"Plebe\\" year, which seem to be disproportionately represented here. My own memory (I am '72) of that year is really rather miserable and not much fun at all. The accounts here are generally upbeat, brightened, I suppose, by many years of chipping away by selective memories. There is a useful glossary which includes some of the tortures upperclassmen used to put us through, like \\"Shoving out: Positioning one's self in a sitting position without the aid of a chair; also referred to as sitting on infinity.\\" (...)The most surprising thing about this volume is how similar the tales from fifty years back are to my own memories or to the more recent classes. Mids were always, it seems, crawling down the steam pipe alleys underneath Tecumseh, zipping back just under the wire at curfew, and thinking up get rich quick schemes. The great difference in stories, those with no precedent, are those that involve female midshipmen or officers. Just a hint of sexual scandal is included in these pages.However, an episode like rolling a bowling ball into the Rotunda through the ranks of the Watch Squad while it was in formation is a unique and classic prank for which a member of the class of '63 takes credit (for a \\"mystery bowler,\\" of course). This tale was a legend even when I was there, and long may it and the other jolly stories in this book be retold and grow in the telling."},{"Title":"Tales from Annapolis","review":"This book is something a little different from what you might ordinarily read. It tells the tales of men who served our country in the Navy, from none other than the very people who lived them. It gives a more personal look at the accademy, and paints a warm picture of what happens &quot;behind the scenes&quot; at the accademy.I would certainly recomend this book of memories to any other retierd officers or alumni. I can assure you that it will bring a smile to your face, and bring you back to those golden days of Annapolis."},{"Title":"Tales from Annapolis","review":"I am a fan of the U.S. Navy and especially the Academy. For anyone who wants a glimpse of what life is like there for the Midshipmen, this book is for you. The stories are funny, some sad.

It would have been very helpful to look up words and phrases that he used so naturally.However, I found this book to be informative and very well written. Ragle talks to his readers and explains as he goes along. I like that. I also like the crime scene scenarios where he talks about a case and how he investigated it, how the evidence was found, how the suspect was captured and his prison sentence.I think this book is helpful for writers because he talks about real investigators and real crime scenes. You can get an idea of what they do, when and how for a more realistic portrayal of your character. There is also inside stuff that happens at a crime scene and during an investigation that you wouldn't get unless someone on the inside, like Ragle, told you.However, I do reccomend you find this in your bookstore, flip through it and see if it answers any questions you may have. It's fairly cheap if it were to be used for a reference book, which is why I bought it.

A 1st edition was published in 1995."},{"Title":"Crime Scene: From Fingerprints to DNA Testing - An Astonishing Inside Look at the Real World of C.S.I.","review":"Dr. Larry Ragle paints the true portrait of crime scene investigation that the television series, CSI, Law and Order, Cold Case, Cold Squad, etc. don't show on television in a forty minutes episode. Dr. Ragle is an expert in crime scene. While he tells the truth, he writes about the crime scenes in this book for those aspiring crime scene investigators. Sadly, I think we live in a society where many crime scene investigators who mean well will jump to conclusions and have tunnel visions. Dr. Ragle explains in detail about crime scenes and explains how to approach them properly. His book does contain a glossary in the back with explanations of such. It would have been better to have an index but it's not necessary. I think this book is not for everybody. It takes away the myth that crimes can be solved so easily. For me, I have never watched the shows that became clones from Law and Order because there are just too many of them on the air, not much different from another. Although Canadian show Cold Squad is filmed in Vancouver, the show is similar to his American counterparts. DNA is not easily explained away that it can happen in one in a billion. Ever since the O.J. Simpson trial, people have been armchair quarterbacks in watching and solving crimes but Larry Ragle is an expert on the crime scene investigation. Crime scene investigation can take months and even years to solve the crimes."},{"Title":"Crime Scene: From Fingerprints to DNA Testing - An Astonishing Inside Look at the Real World of C.S.I.","review":"This is an excellent overview of the forensic world.

It is not comprehensive (what really is?), but it is surely a god buy, and a good intrduction to basics, what really is a drawback though is that the author is too sure about his things, and with the development of forensics the last five years, some of the info has been outdated, but I still find it a bargain at this price."},{"Title":"Crime Scene: From Fingerprints to DNA Testing - An Astonishing Inside Look at the Real World of C.S.I.","review":"This is one of the best books i have ever read!

(That's why I didn't give it 5 stars-lack of the above-mentioned.).. I'd still recommend the book. However, in case my later review didn't make it in Mr. Ragle's criticism of CSI, unfairly, categorizes the producers of the show, and the actors, as not following \\"true\\" scientific methods, according to him.

She is very open and specific when relating the events that lead up to and after her classes. Revelations about her teaching, purpose in the classroom, and relationship to her students are clearly related in concrete description.Kahn spends a significant amount of time in her text addressing ethical issues in practice. She speaks of the responsibility she bears as the teacher of the class, the power that that role automatically assumes and the importance of not misusing that power. Kahn also includes specific class discussions in which her students questioned her power and/or tested it and she describes her responses in detail.Of course the most pronounced voice is that of Kahn. The text is told from the first-person perspective and intentionally invites the reader to participate in the dialogue she is offering by positioning the reader as both \\"teacher\\" and \\"student\\" in her examples. She states \\"your participation in this book will be, like my experiences of my own classes, usually engaging, at times confusing, often startling, and ultimately thought provoking\\" (Kahn, 2005, pg. 6). In addition to Kahn, the composite students have a voice and they are represented through 10 years of her classroom notes. A particular strength of this text is the fact that Kahn avoids specialized language. Although she speaks about teaching and teaching literature, she does not load her text with vocabulary that represents pedagogy or critical theory. The entire text is a reflection of the practice of teaching and specifically, teaching literature. Kahn provides specific examples in which she describes various teaching techniques she utilized.The interests of Dr. Kahn are served by the text as she able to express the questions that emerged in her years of teaching at Mills College, as well as her feelings and understanding of how those questions impacted not only herself but her classes. Her text is also serving other teachers whether they teach only women or both sexes. Kahn's descriptions and insights into her own experiences resonate and represent examples of common experiences. Mills College seems to be served by the work of Dr. Kahn as well. Students are represented in a positive light, struggling to understand who they are, how their education will serve them and what the connection is between them and the texts they are reading.The models of practice used by Dr. Kahn are not ratified in any way. She clearly admits to experimenting with her classes in an effort to understand the issues that they are bringing up during discussion. However, once she saw the results of not controlling the discussion and allowing students to express their thoughts, even those seemingly too personal as a result of the texts under examination, Kahn continued to follow this \\"model\\" she saw emerging.Dr. Kahn presents in the text that the model created and practiced is not an individual act but a group one. Without her students contributing, voicing their opinions and sharing their experiences, her insights regarding the importance for female students to speak out and think critically would not exist. The contribution that Kahn's text makes to the understanding and realization of democratic forms and processes is that it openly advocates that female students typically don't feel as if they have a voice and more importantly, \\"at women's colleges we think about women-it is crucial to what my students learn about themselves and about the roles they might crate for themselves\\" (Kahn, 2005, pg. 4). In learning about themselves, these women create \\"new and provocative versions of the books we have discussed, along with new possibilities for both teaching and learning in collaboration\\" (Kahn, 2005, pg. 6).Kahn, Madeleine Dr. (2005).

Boulder, Paradigm Publishers."},{"Title":"Why Are We Reading Ovid's Handbook on Rape?: Teaching and Learning at a Women's College (Cultural Politics & the Promise of Democracy)","review":"Madeleine Kahn invites readers behind the scenes of a college class to discover how a teacher teaches. Readers learn her goals, her methods, and how actual classroom reaction alters planning. It's a Must Read for those planning a teaching career; Kahn reminds us what the teacher's job really is and how to bend without losing sight of the real goals.Literature is her field, but any teacher will learn from this insightful book."},{"Title":"Why Are We Reading Ovid's Handbook on Rape?: Teaching and Learning at a Women's College (Cultural Politics & the Promise of Democracy)","review":"This book does something both unique and important: it really listens to women students, and it takes them seriously. In describing her own learning experiences as a professor of English at Mills College, Madeleine Kahn is honest and open about her own anxieties and her role in her classrooms. As a result, this book has much to teach professors and teachers of fields outside of English.Kahn's great contribution here is to recognize that young women students these days (and some not-so-young students) are reading literature and examining art with an eye to finding positive role models for themselves. Even when such an approach is patently inappropriate, as when students criticize an 18th-century actress for not being independent enough, it is so common a phenomenon that college teachers should take it into consideration when preparing to teach. I have encountered the very reactions, in my classes, that Kahn describes: women students become enraged at a female character in an ancient text for being \\"passive,\\" or at the male author of a text that they consider hostile to women. They then become enraged at the teacher for giving them the objectionable text. In my experience, this sequence of events is universal in all-female classes (which can occur even at co-ed institutions). But I have learned that women students, even in co-ed classes, have strong and hostile reactions to literary depictions of sexual abuse and exploitation, and they don't hesitate to aim their hostility at their instructors (probably more at female teachers than at male teachers).Kahn shows, painstakingly, with sympathy and humor, how she learned to maneuver through these very personal, motivated readings, and how she learned from them. Her open-ness to learning from her students, and her readiness to be challenged by them, allowed lively, challenging, and exciting discussions. She also demonstrates that these students brought out new and useful insights into some very old works of literature, precisely because of their almost overwhelming tendency to identify personally with the female characters in these texts. Further, she shows how many of the questions and issues raised by her students are the very questions addressed by complex, sophisticated literary theory: how can a woman \\"read\\" male-centric texts? Is the author responsible for every reader's reaction?Highly recommended for anyone who teaches the kinds of literature that deals with issues of gender, violence, and other disturbing subjects."},{"Title":"Tracking & the Art of Seeing: How to Read Animal Tracks & Sign","review":"Got this book because it doesn't just cover tracks, but also discusses other signs and the animals' behaviors that might provide important clues. The book is too short to go into much detail, but nevertheless provides a lot of good pictures of the animals and their signs (prints on different surfaces, scat after eating different kinds of food, marks on the ground and on vegetation etc), and sketches of typical track patterns (including a lot of measurements). Two issues (and possible improvements for future editions of this book): The format of the book is more suited for browsing than for use as a quick reference, and there is no mention of some western favorites such as the Pika and Mountain Goats."},{"Title":"Tracking & the Art of Seeing: How to Read Animal Tracks & Sign","review":"A great book. I had the privilege of taking several courses with Mr. Rezendes and he explains well what you need to look for in your tracks. A very careful observer, he makes certain of the creator of the animal sign before he will say that something was caused by a particular creature. The book carries this through, and the new edition has some added charts which make it easier to check your own findings. Small enough to carry with you, but with high quality production values, you can use it as a very effective field guide. The photographs, most of which Mr. Rezendes has taken, are wonderful. He's traveled extensively and you will be able to identify the animals found just about anywhere in the US.This purchase replaces my original book which I lost a number of years ago. I've missed it mightily, and have no excuse for not picking it up sooner."},{"Title":"Tracking & the Art of Seeing: How to Read Animal Tracks & Sign","review":"This book is detailed and thorough showing you various methods of tracking ranging from track patterns to prints to scat droppings to what/how animals eat. Not to mention the author is from Massachusetts so it's always good to buy local, right?"},{"Title":"Tracking & the Art of Seeing: How to Read Animal Tracks & Sign","review":"This is an outstanding reference, written with love for his subject. Terrifically insightful, written from the standpoint of someone intimately tied to his subject. I would not be without this book. Only 2 minor problems. 1. References to photos and illustrations are unsupported by labels numbering them. Photos are referenced in the subcaptions, but it would have been a simple and very helpfull matter to number the photos and illustrations. 2. It would very nice if he had included distribution maps. Distribution is vaguely referenced in the text, so you must read to discover if a particular animal is in your area of interest. No problem if you have reference books for that area, or a knowledge of your outdoors, but a trouble if you don't. There are several animals in my area that I have never seen, and am on the margin of distribution for several. A distribution map would be helpful, and shouldn'e be too difficult to post. I have maps for my state (the Great Commonwealth of Virginia), which help me focus on what I might find. Nonetheless, this is a great book, very useful to a Master Naturalist (me), great photos, great descriptions and insight into the lives of animals. It's not everything, but you should have this book. Absolutely."},{"Title":"Tracking & the Art of Seeing: How to Read Animal Tracks & Sign","review":"This is a fantastically good little book. It teaches developing awareness, even more so than just tracking. I wish books like this were in the high school curriculum."},{"Title":"Tracking & the Art of Seeing: How to Read Animal Tracks & Sign","review":"HANDS DOWN THE BEST. If I could only own one book on tracking this would be it. The author includes a plethora of detailed photos that help aid his descriptions of specific animal tracks. Furthermore, he includes typical measurements, eating & sleeping habits, locale of the animal, and even general habits. There is such an immense amount of detail that one could easily learn all the information needed about a specific animal (of North America) to get started. The introduction clearly gets you acquainted with terminology and methods of measurement. Perhaps the most useful tool included in the book is a section of charts at the end of the book that is a quick reference for all the measurements of foot prints, trail width, patterns, etc. I was enthralled by this book and would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone considering getting into tracking. MUST OWN BOOK!!!! I'm already reading it a second time!"},{"Title":"Tracking & the Art of Seeing: How to Read Animal Tracks & Sign","review":"I teach tracking, and this is the book I most often recommend to beginners. It is well organized, and contains most of the essential, basic information. This is one tracking book which can be read cover to cover, because the conversational style with personal accounts makes it most readable. After reading it cover to cover, use it as a reference to review what you see in the field. If used in this way, the book is an excellent tool to help you become a fairly competent tracker.As others have mentioned, there a photos of the bottoms of the feet of many of the animals, which aids in visualizing tracks. It covers all the basic trail patterns, and then some, but does not bog down the reader with too much esoteric information. For that, you will need Mark Elbroch's much more comprehensive Mammal Tracks and Sign, perhaps the best reference for the intermediate to advanced tracker.While great for basic track, trail, and sign identification, the book does not contain much information about the habits, habitat, reproductive biology, etc., for the species. This is forgivable, for the most part, since it keeps the book shorter and manageable for a beginner. But, you might need a field guide or your laptop by your side while reading it. The one thing that is not forgivable is the absence of a range map for each species. Those could easily have been fit into the wide margins, without adding pages and heft to the book.Bottom line: great for beginners when used alongside a good field guide. Does not include some of the less common trail patterns and sign, so a serious tracker will quickly grow out of this book."},{"Title":"Tracking & the Art of Seeing: How to Read Animal Tracks & Sign","review":"This is an important book to own if you love nature and appreciate the specialness of being in the quiet woods. As a photographer, Paul learned how to read animal sign to know where to find and photograph wildlife. This knowledge has helped him earn a living as an exceptional wildlife photographer. In this book, he shares his vast knowledge of animal sign and tracking. Well written, factual, filled with great illustrations and a book you will refer to again and again. As a photographer, nature lover, and active member of KeepingTrack.org who spends a lot of time in the woods, I appreciate this important reference book (which happens to be an enjoyble read!) and I believe that it belongs in every naturalist, conservationist and photographer's reference collection. I would love the opportunity to do a field day with Paul sometime. But in the interim, I am fortunate to own most of his books."},{"Title":"Tracking & the Art of Seeing: How to Read Animal Tracks & Sign","review":"I find this book very good, and the author clearly has spent time in the woods, learning the info needed for this book.

The author has learned much about tracking animals because he's a wild-life photographer.

A book you will want to keep a long time."},{"Title":"Tracking & the Art of Seeing: How to Read Animal Tracks & Sign","review":"As everyone has stated, this is a good book with lots of good information. One thing to know about it, however is that the information is presented more in a 'conversational' style than an 'encylopedia' style. If you are looking for a traditional 'field guide' type style with color-coded cross-references and the like, you may want to look elsewhere. However, if you don't mind a more casual presentation of the information - and it is that way in this book - then this one is for you. In other words, you'd be more inclined to pick up this book for some casual reading than you would a traditional field guide."},{"Title":"Tracking & the Art of Seeing: How to Read Animal Tracks & Sign","review":"Paul Rezendes not only provides awesome photos of tracks in different types of soil (substrates) and snow but beautiful ones of the animals themselves as well. Included is abundant info about animals' habits which adds to one's knowledge on how and where to look for tracks. A must-have for your shelf on nature."},{"Title":"Tracking & the Art of Seeing: How to Read Animal Tracks & Sign","review":"I have used a copy of the original edition of this book for several years, first in VT and more recently in NE Penna, and I've found it to be so useful that I've never felt a need to purchase another animal tracking guide. What makes this publication so effective is that it goes far beyond simple drawings of individual tracks of animals, which historically was the focus of most other tracking guides that predated this one.Although the book does have excellent drawings and photos of individual animal tracks, very importantly it also includes illustrations and photos of the track patterns of the different mammals featured, and understanding these patterns is essential to really enjoying and being successful in ID'ing animals through tracking (learning these patterns will be most relevant and useful to those living in regions of the U.S. where there is snowfall in winter).Complimenting the track patterns are measurements (in inches) of many different important parameters, including the size of individual tracks and lengths of stride and straddle, etc. Mr. Rezendez has obtained these through painstaking measurements in the field so that he could arrive at a max., min. and average that you can expect to encounter for the different species of mammals covered.Also very useful is coverage of the many often subtle, yet important differences and similarities that exist between animal tracks and track patterns among mammals, both within the same and between the different families (weasels, cats, dogs, etc.).Although the idea may put some people off, there are also measurements, notes and photos differentiating different types of mammal scat - this is also very useful info in ID'ing animals by the sign they leave behind and can be particularly helpful for the more serious tracker.Finally, the book includes some natural history info on each animal featured, including where they build lodges and locate dens, sign they leave when feeding and during the mating season, and how to differentiate between herbivores based on the evidence they leave from browsing on vegetation.Although I consider myself to be fairly accomplished at ID'ing animals by the sign they leave, particularly when I have a layer of snow to work with, I would not be anywhere near as advanced as I am in the art and science of tracking without this book to guide me.The only potential drawback to Tracking and the Art of Seeing is the book's relatively large size (\\"7 X 10\\") for a field guide. That minor issue aside, whatever your interest, whether it be learning the tracks of animals in a suburban backyard or making a hobby or even a vocational pursuit of the wonderful world of animal tracking, this book is a very worthwhile investment you will enjoy and benefit from for years to come."},{"Title":"Tracking & the Art of Seeing: How to Read Animal Tracks & Sign","review":"This book is very good at helping you understand the animals that are in it. Most of them I could care less about. It mainly tells about the animals traits. For the animals I'm interested in I know all of this stuff. This book tells nothing about following tracks at all. It talks about gaits and patterns, and that's about it."},{"Title":"Tracking & the Art of Seeing: How to Read Animal Tracks & Sign","review":"I usually check out tracking and reading sign books from the library because I would rather spend my hard cash on backpacking gear, fuel, and tires to get up and down those rocky roads, but this book was one that I had to buy. Most tracking guides have sketches and if they have photos they usually are not very good quality. This book has amazing photos that will aid you in scat and sign identifying. It is a great book for begginers and just a pleasant read. I would have to agree with another reviewer that he does tend to focus on northern or eastern animals. Learning about Mule Deer sign would be more pertinent than learning how to read Moose sign. There is also another book on Amazon that is PACKED with photos and has more photos of dens, tracks and sign. I would have to rate that book higher than this one, if I had to choose one, but this book definately earns 5 STARS!"},{"Title":"Tracking & the Art of Seeing: How to Read Animal Tracks & Sign","review":"I bought this book before Amazon even existed. Paul Rezendes was the first to take field guides out of the realm of sketched sound bites, into expanded, photographic essays.

I especially appreciate Paul's emphasis on using all of your senses effectively, which is the most difficult skill to master.Sounds like a 5 star review so far, right? Unfortunately, I feel compelled to warn those who live west of the Mississippi that Paul does not discuss some of the West's most noteworthy animals, including mule deer, bighorn sheep (he does discuss Dall sheep), pronghorn, prairie dogs, badgers, and so on. Likewise, Paul does not include domestic cattle, sheep, goats, and horses, although I've discovered that novices can often mistake these for wild ungulates.Nevertheless, &quot;Tracking and the art of seeing&quot; is a wonderful example of what an outdoor reference can be: a source of both information and inspiration.

This book covers in detail what it means to be serious about animal study. Not too many other books out there that go into the detail this one does on animal scat!!Although there are many impressive pictures, it's not just a &quot;cute animal picture&quot; book. The need for conservation of land and habitats is implicit with this book.

The detailed descriptions of individual tracks and the explanations of the differences between similar tracks has proven a great assistance while on my own expeditions.

In the first chapter the author explains why we should try to understand the tracks around us in the forest, and what we might see. He then delves into the kinds of observations we need to make, such as trail widths and trail patterns and scat. The rest of the book is divided into chapters by animal family, including chapters for rodents, rabbits, weasels, dogs, cats, bears, and hoofed animals. There is also an extensive bibliography and index.Each chapter is comprised of short articles about the specifics of tracking the individual animals that make up the family covered in the chapter. Rezendes provides a short informative description of the animal with a color photograph. The descriptions cover behavior, range, and diet. Rezendes also includes black and white photos of the animal's feet, both front and back. The next section of the article covers tracks and trail patterns, and it includes illustrations or diagrams, photographs, and typical trail width and stride measurements, as well as a lot of information to help you sort out this critter's tracks from all the others out there. He also includes short sections on signs, such as dens, food caches, kill sites, and scat, also with photographs or illustrations.I purchased this book after moving out into the country because I wanted to identify the critters that visited at night leaving their tracks in the snow around our house. I found Rezendes' approach captivating and easy to understand, even as a beginner. Rezendes explains how tracks can tell us much more than just the identity of an animal- -through a careful study of tracks, you can determine how fast the animal was moving, whether it was browsing, being chased, or chasing another. This book is a highly informative reference; it's also a delightful read on a blustery winter afternoon."},{"Title":"Tracking & the Art of Seeing: How to Read Animal Tracks & Sign","review":"Excellent, easy to read and understand.

But the real meat of the volume involves Yuki and Kyo, who each find out secrets about someone close to them.Although he has never loved Kagura, she is still important to Kyo, having been his only real childhood friend. In this volume they finally hash out their relationship in a surprisingly serious and emotionally draining conversation in which Kagura reveals with startling bluntness the reason why she's forced herself on Kyo for so long.Yuki, meanwhile, visits Rin in an attempt to play matchmaker and repay Haru for always having his back. Their conversation takes a wild turn, however, when Rin changes the subject - and Yuki learns the truth about a critical moment in his life when she reveals that it was Haru - and not Shigure as he'd always been lead to believe - who saved him from his miserable existence in Sohma House.Another fine volume with some great character development."},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 12","review":"That book is so amesome!! I can't put it down. When I bought it, I started read it about an hour. Believe it or not?Let me tell you...I don't mean to spoil the story... Yuki, Kyo, Shigure and Tohru went back to the house from vacation. (Oh man, Kyo and Yuki gotta TALLER! Whoa!) Kyo wanted to be with Tohru until the end of his life. Tohru made a call to Kazuma which Kyo's father..err foster father!? She wanted to talk with him about how to break the curse. Tohru thought she was really selfish, but she really wanted to break a curse. Kagura realized why she pushed herself to Kyo and it called force love. But she does love him. She told Kyo everything and Kyo didn't say 'I am sorry;, just say thank you. Kyo was only the one friend to Kagura. Kyo never \\"like\\" Kagura. Kagura remembered when she saw Kyo's true form, she just ran away. In volume 6, Kagura watched Tohru ran after Kyo when he was true form. That made Kagura realized how she was stupid because of running from Kyo. Anyway, Kyo was just now single and wanted to be with Tohru and love her a lot. Of course, Tohru didn't know...YeT!? Hmm at school, the parent-teacher conferences, Tohru's grandfather couldn't go there because he had thrown his back. (I think.) So instead of, Shigure would go to her grandfather's place for parent-teacher conferences. Shigure wanted to see how Tohru's teacher's face when she sees Shigure. Between them, it was so funny. Um in the end page, Saki liked Kazuma when she saw him walked with Kyo to parent-teacher conference. Kyo shouted that he don't want to her be his mom. Hahaha! ^^ I hope you don't mind that I told you too much...ehh...If you don't read this Fruits basket, go read the volume one. If you don't read this volume, go buy it!!! IT IS SOO MUCH!!! YiKes!!! =D"},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 12","review":"it's amazing that furuba has managed to stay so funny for so long, as I have read the entire series and I must say-- it's all down hill from here. I don't mean the quality of the manga goes down--the story line gets sadder and sadder, but some of it remains gutbustingly funny. In this volume, Tohru-kun, Kyo-kun, and Yuki-kun prepare to go back to school and for their parent teacher confrences. Tohru visits her grandpa in the hospital (he threw out his back)and he brings up painful part of her past. Tohru also pays a visit to Shisou-san (whom Hana-chan may have a crush on)and learns the more about the Sohma family's eternaly patronizing curse. kagura and kyo have a heart to heart about why kagura has forced herself on Kyo all these years, and Yuki starts his term as the new class president--could he have found a new love interest? it's true that the mystery surrounding the Sohmas is yet to be uncovered, but when Akito reveals a shocking secret in a later volume, a clue to their existence begins to unravel. Furuba is not--as I once suspected--'fluffy'-- it's hardcore, heartbreaking, and hilairious, and it succeeds on very level. One of the greatest manga series ever."},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 12","review":"Well, let me just begin by saying that i am totally in love with fruits basket!!! (especially kyo...and kureno, i suppose)This is by far, my favorite book in the series. This volume is filled with drama, especially when yuki meets up with rin, and realizes something about her that he never knew. and what happens when haru shows up? Also, kagura takes kyo on a date, and has an emotional confession about the reason why she always loved him. It truly brought tears to my eyes. and of course, it's hilarious when shigure goes to tohru's parent-teacher conference in place of her grandfather. (her teacher is mayuko, shigure's ex-girlfriend) well, you're just going to have to find out the rest for yourself.

The final members of the student council have been assembled, and this brings about the introduction of two new characters: Naohito (who declares himself as Yuki's rival) and Kimi (who is known for stealing men's hearts). With the parent-teacher conferences coming up, Tohru goes to see her grandfather; while she's there, he brings up a part of Tohru's past that she's tried to forget. Also in this volume, there is some more character development for Yuki, and Tohru secretly goes to see Kyo's teacher for advice on how to help break the Sohma's curse.This is another volume that focuses more on character development than on progressing the overall plot, but the character development that's included help the reader to better understand these characters and to help progress the characters a little further.

I begged my parents to buy me the second volume, and once I got it, I loved it! Now I have up to 7 volumes and am saving up my money for the 8th volume.

Take note that the book is edited and not written by Lorain Tamara Elbert.

Growing up in Nova Scotia,lighthouses were as common a sight as a post office,church or a fire station. All through the years, whenever I was travelling,I always made a point of looking for lighthouses and spending a little time with them.I often thought it would be fun to really \\"get into\\" lighthouses,making a special effort to search them out ,read up on the history and things that have happened in the area,maybe sketch or photograph them,talk with the locals,and on and on. I imagine there are people who do just that,but surprisingly,I have never encountered any of them in my travels. As an avid Birder,I naturally gravatite to them in my search for birds. Over the years ,I've seen many. To say which is my favorite is difficult. I guess the answer that Roger Tory Peterson,North America's most famous Birdwatcher,gave when asked,\\"what is your favorite bird?\\" His reply was;\\"the one I'm looking at ,at the time.\\"; applies just as well for lighthouses.I guess I'll just have to take lighthouses as I come upon them,because with all my other intreests,there's just not enough time to go around.Being a Birder ,and familiar with Field Guides,I was very happy to find this Guide for lighthouses. So much so,I bought one for my friend,who is much more \\"into\\" them than myself. Needless to say.he was thrilled to get it.For anyone who is fascinated by lighthouses all over the US and Canada,I can tell you now ,you'll want it. The book is excellently constructed,was published in 2005,will last a long time,and won't go out of date,simply because they're not constructing any new ones.

The book is a long letter, written to a researcher years after the times related in the prose. Especially enjoyable if something of Patagonia is known - its history, ledgends, myths. The man \\"Jack\\" writes of his friendship with Jemmy Button, the native Fuegan picked up (stolen/kidnapped)on an exploration to Tierra del Fuego by HMS Beagle. Button and other Indians are taken to England - and then returned years later, on the same ship, with the same captain, and this young man, Jack, who has been assigned to shadow Button especially. Jack is now a good sailor and, more importantly, tries to bring Button into modernity - and be his friend, in England and aboard the Beagle.On this return voyage scientist and naturalist Charles Darwin comes along as companion to Captain FitzRoy - a religious assertive and gentleman of unstable mein (who almost dismisses Darwin because of the shape of his nose). The issue between these two (who are not named) is more than just personalities, and is related pretty well.The last quarter of the book is the trial of Jemmy Button for murder of helpless men in November of 1859. A lone witness, Alfred Cole, the cook, gives star testimony - and Parker Snow, captain of an expedition to convert natives before his ship is assigned to another man, sounds a long deserved castigation of the Rev. G.P. Despard, who has only good intentions but lacks a sensible outlook. From official transcripts we hear the sorry excuses men use to justify folly.

This one stands apart because it focuses on implementing SCM as a set of processes and procedures, and shows how to integrate it into your development environment.Mr. Moreira leads you through every milestone of implementation from realistically assessing your needs and how to fit SCM into your development processes, to establishing an SCM infrastructure, to defining SCM tasks tailored to projects.One of the best features of this book - and why it is invaluable to anyone who is seriously pursuing a viable SCM function - is the wealth of plans, templates, and process documents contained in the appendices and on the accompanying CD ROM. These will save a substantial amount of time to accomplish an implementation.Other aspects of this book that I like include the chapters on SCM in general, the process- and task-oriented approaches, and the in-depth knowledge the author exhibits throughout.If you are buying this book to guide you through an SCM implementation, or are merely exploring the level of complexity such an endeavor entails, I also recommend &quot;Software Configuration Management Patterns: Effective Teamwork, Practical Integration&quot; (ISBN 0201741172) because the patterns provided in that book add a layer of depth and refinement to an SCM implementation and ongoing SCM management."},{"Title":"Software Configuration Management Implementation Roadmap","review":"I pass this book around a lot at work! It's good stuff, and one of the only books of its kind. Most SCM books talk about the SCM function and process/procedure definition and design, or a particular tool. This book covers all that and more. It also talks about the team and the roles that make-up an SCM *organization*, how to manage it and how to deliver, deploy and support a complete SCM solution (not just a process but supporting tools and environment too).The writing style is very clear and readable. Admittedly, the price of the book is a bit steep. The accompanying CD with the forms/templates/checklist will more than make up for the cost if you are someone who is trying to lead or manage an SCM team undertaking these responsibilities.Software Configuration Management Implementation Roadmap is one of the few SCM books that give complete information beyond processes/procedures into the organizational aspects of CM: how to lead it, deploy it and support it across the organization and the development tools/environment."},{"Title":"Software Configuration Management Implementation Roadmap","review":"Mr. Moreira is an accomplished writer.

I assumed, if he was someone influenced by the New Renaissance man, I would enjoy his plays. I've read 6, and hate them all. Zoo Story isn't too bad, the rest are good plays, just not my cup of tea. However, this is not what this book is about. Like James McNeill Whistler, he speaks his philosophy when he is SPEAKING it far better than when he is painting, or, in this case, writing. Albee is a genius, and his conversations inspired me and helped me formulate much of my personal views of theater and life."},{"Title":"War of Another Kind: A Southern Community in the Great Rebellion","review":"A book not fully appreciated without a first hand knowledge of the Albemarle region of North Carolina, Mr. Durrill certainly delves into the (sometimes remote) interests of social historians. The author chose as the location for his study, a small town inside a very rural county in North Carolina. The town, Plymouth, located in Washington County, was not only a military objective of two opposing armies, but a focus of division between many economic classes. Mr Durrill presents the county very accurately as a region of very rich and very poor struggling for political and social power during the period immediately prior and during the 1861-1865 war. Presented as a war within a war, the book documents many conflicts betweeen planters and yeoman farmers, between civilians and soldiers, and not most inconsequentially, between armies. Tracing the removal of the planters' slave labor forces from the Albemarle region behind Confederate lines and showing the effects of a social upheaval, the author has shown the importance of all classes of people in maintaining the inequities of the Southern agricultural antebellum economy. Wayne Durrill has presented the economic ideals that each social group manipulated in their own interests through the war years, and shown how ideals changed with each advance or retreat of a military force."},{"Title":"War of Another Kind: A Southern Community in the Great Rebellion","review":"I found this to be the best civil war documentation so far for this region. My own research turned up a great great uncle who fought for the Union Army after my great great grandfather was imprisoned. The Unionist side has never been told as well as Durrill's studies have brought it to light.

The book was easy to read and had very frank, practical suggestions to improve my own writing and what to do to make what I write more likely to be published and sell. Some of the advice is &quot;common sense&quot; but Stableford did not dwell for long on these areas and kept the pace of the book moving along--I tend to find myself skipping around when reading &quot;how to write&quot; books, but this was the first I've read cover to cover (and in one evening)."},{"Title":"Writing Fantasy & Science Fiction, and Getting Published (Teach Yourself (McGraw-Hill))","review":"Teach Yourself Writing Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction is more focused on the philosophies of writing instead of the actual act of writing. It depends on what a person is looking for.Mr. Stableford's own artistic science fiction/fantasy writing style seems to saturate the book, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It just makes the book as a non-fiction a little bit difficult to follow sometimes.I enjoyed his occasional touching on the subject of themes (or uses of certain themes) that have been over used in the history of Fantasy and Science Fiction. I also liked his discussions on how even though Fantasy and SF can take places in worlds very different from our own, there has to be some amount of reality or plausibility in them for a reader to understand and feel comfortable reading about it."},{"Title":"Writing Fantasy & Science Fiction, and Getting Published (Teach Yourself (McGraw-Hill))","review":"This is a good book if you're not very familiar with writing techniques in general, but if you've taken even one college course in writing, forget it.

It's not that it isn't a useful book, or that it's badly written; what I disliked, was that half the examples were telling you what you could and could not get away with rather than how to write high quality fiction and best captivate your readers. I went through the book constantly thinking &quot;Gosh! I could write better than this guy, what does he think he's going on about?&quot;Despite that, there is still a lot that the beginning writer can learn from this book, and does give you a decent idea of what level you need to be at in order to get published.

I have read a few novels and a short story of his recently, but I read this book before all those. Stableford's advice is extensive and used a lot of examples to illustrate points about speculative fiction writing. However, his book falls short in presentation because it uses a lot of continuous text, which can be tiring and monotonous for those whose attention control needs an extra kick. There is a lot to learn from this book, but its presentation could be greatly improved by using a graphic manner. There certainly are some perspectives and points about science fiction and fantasy writing that can be garnered from Stableford, though, so I don't think I wasted my P279.

Every mother apparently wanted their boy to be as selfless and precocious as the title character, so they dressed the innocent boy in the absurd outfit of the book - the velvet, lace collared affair that scarred a generation.But that misses Burnett's point. She creates a world where a child of American sensibilities - raising all boats as his own tide increases - counters the old British guard which, at the time, was the lord had it all, the villagers had nothing.My two favorite childhood books are A Little Princess and Secret Garden. And while Cedric is a little too perfect, the message and the characterization of sudden wealth leading to actual kindness is refreshing."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"This is a quick read and very well written. The first time I have read anything by F H Burnett but I will read others.This would be good to read to or with a child but great for an adult also.I saw the movie and that is how I found out about it and a book is always better than its movie."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"This is another book that I can hardly wait to read to my grandchildren, so exciting. Our kids need to read good books, to be good people."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"Cedric Errol is a seven-year old boy who lives with his mother in the mid-1880s on a \\"New York side street\\" that is described as \\"shabby.\\" His father, also named Cedric Errol had died when the boy was a toddler. It turns out that Captain Cedric Errol was the third son of the very wealthy English Earl of Dorincourt who, when his son went to America and married, cut him off. But the Earl's two older sons have died childless, and now little Cedric is his only male heir, known as Lord Fauntleroy, so he sends his lawyer, Mr. Havisham, to America to bring Cedric and his mother back. Cedric is to live with his grandfather in his castle-like manor house to be trained as an aristocrat, while Mrs. Errol, whom Cedric calls \\"Dearest,\\" is to live in another house on the estate. Cedric can visit her whenever he wishes, but she is not to come to the manor house.During this time, Cedric writes his friends in New York, Mr. Hobbs the grocer and Dick Tipton the bootblack. Then a woman comes, claiming that she was the wife of Bevis, the Earl's oldest son, and had a boy by him who is the real Lord Fauntleroy. What kind of influence will young Cedric have on his crusty old grandfather? How can Dick the bootblack help to determine if the boy of the woman who claims to be the mother of Bevis's son is whom he's claimed to be? And will the Earl ever become reconciled to his daughter-in-law? We have read and enjoyed author Frances Hodgson Burnett's The Little Princess and The Secret Garden. However, Little Lord Fauntleroy was her first children's novel and perhaps best-known title. It was originally published as a serial in the St. Nicholas Magazine between November, 1885, and October, 1886. The accompanying illustrations by Reginald Birch set fashion trends. Also the book set a precedent in copyright law in 1888 when the author won a lawsuit against E. V. Seebohm over the rights to theatrical adaptations of the work.The story is perhaps best known today from a 1936 film starring Freddy Bartholomew as Cedric and featuring Mickey Rooney as Dick Tipton, the Brooklyn bootblack. Like Pollyana and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, Little Lord Fauntleroy has been misunderstood, and the term is now sometimes used in derision to describe a pompous spoiled brat, usually a young male, who takes his wealth and privilege for granted. However, this is not consistent with the original character, whose personality could be described as naturally and innocently generous, kind, and friendly. I enjoyed reading the book. There are a few minor references to drinking wine, smoking a pipe, and dancing, but there is also emphasis placed on going to church services and praying. Some people today might think the book hopelessly outdated and completely irrelevant to modern life. However, I believe that children need to read books with characters who exemplify good behavior. The fact is that young people don't have to grow up spoiled and bratty as they're often pictured in many books nowadays. They can be raised to be polite and kind, and Little Lord Fauntleroy is certainly a role model of that kind of deportment toward which we can aim."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"This is an excellent book. The man who wrote the book is called F.H.Burnett (Francis Hodgson Burnett).I read this book because my sister was telling me all day long to read it. Now I have to say thanks to her, because it's a great book, what's more, is one of the best books I've ever read.It is about a boy called Cedric Errol. He's not only intelligent but also kind and beautiful. He used to live with his father and his mother, but his father died, so he started trying to make his mother happier.One day, he was in the corner with her close friend Hobbs (he is a man, not a boy), when the woman that works in his house, Mary, went to the corner to tell to Cedric that he have to return to his house. There he saw a man... This man was called Mr.Havisham, he was the lawyer of Cedric's grandfather. This man was there to go with Cedric and his mother to Dorincourt (that was the castle of his grandfather). Cedric would become a Lord, Lord Fauntleroy. At first, he doesn't like that but then...all the things change.The lawyer of his grandfather gave him a lot of money to do what he wanted. The surprise was that Cedric, instead of buying things for himself, decided to help other people. For example: he helped the old woman that sold apples in the street to buy a shop.When Cedric met his granfather, he thinks that his grandfather is the kindest man in all the world, but this opinion is not the same that the poor people that lives there have.Cedric and the countess become very close. But suddenly, a woman appeared telling to all the people that her son was the real Lord Fauntleroy. This new Lord was very stupid and he was not what we can call \\"beautiful\\". Obviouslly, the countess doesn't accept that this stupid boy was the son of his son, and he starts investigating.Here I have to stop, if not I will tell you all the book, no?.

This one is undoubtedly a classic, it is indeed very good literature, excellently written -- everything the other reviewers have said. Nevertheless, its story, its conflict, its central preoccupation revolves around a very British idea of class: one's \\"quality\\" as a person is determined by one's birth. This is antithetical to the very idea of America and will be much too hard to explain to a child. Yet if I wait until he is older, he will probably be turned off by the idealized, syrupy characterization."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"Of course, his Little Lordship was a tad too good to be true (and I've a sneaking suspicion that he'd be what one would consider nowadays as queer - not gay, just weird -- what with sunshine just emanating in smothering waves from him).This story makes for a light, amusing escape. Escape from the ghastliness of how people nowadays treat each other: often with suspicion, bluntness, and - dare I say it - parasitism. \`User-friendly' is practically a code to live by. A person is approached with an eye out for what s/he could possibly *do* for you. Don't know yet what that favor could be? Then just keep that person in one's \\"social network\\" \`til he can prove to be of some worth one day.But the little hero of this story frighteningly succeeds in shaming that aspect of the human condition. And he does nothing more than be naturally warm, steadfastly friendly and loyal, and blessedly oblivious to the coarser nature of those around him. He collects friends *not* because he yearns to be that person who is known to have the \`most-number-of-friends-in-his-friends-list', but because people irresistibly, inevitably, find themselves charmed and absolutely tickled to make his acquaintance.This 7-year old boy is the delight of nannies and the nightmare of school bullies. The first for the obvious reasons: a sweet yet mature disposition; and the second because, even if he gets pummeled at school (which, let's face it, would be more than likely - remember, he calls his mother by the name \`Dearest'), he would just as soon turn to the bully and offer to rehabilitate him, proffering a hand of friendship, honest sympathy and earnestness on his \`golden handsome' countenance. A look of horror would then creep on the bully's face as he gapes at this sickeningly sweet boy who just refuses to cry uncle and is now offering to befriend him. The bully then turns and flees as if the hounds of Beelzebub were at his heels.Taking aside the improbability that someone of Cedric's nature exists anywhere or anywhen in this world (think 'Children of the Corn' gone eerily good), this story is actually more suited for consumption for its message of redemption, friendship, and - bear with me on this - contentment in all things simple."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"Not only is it a flimsy book with no illustrations (when the illustrations are quite important to the story), but my copy was missing a page, right before the end.

Cedric Errol, an all-American boy, discovers to his dismay that he is the heir to an English earldom, and has to go to England to live with his stern old grandfather, who despises Americans (he must have been reading the Guardian, I suppose). Gradually they learn to like each other, and the grandfather even comes around to liking Cedric's American mother. There is a melodromatic sub-plot involving a false heir, but the story is really interesting enough without it. The best character in the book is Cedric's friend Mr. Hobbs, a staunchly Republican grocer who despises earls \\"I'd like to catch one of em inside here; that's all!\\" he tells Cedric, before he knows Cedric is one of them \\"I'll have no graspin tyrants sittin round on my buiscuit barrels!\\" By the end of the book though, he has become so attached to Cedric that he sells his grocery business and settles in England, where he becomes an avid follower of aristocratic doings. He says he'll never return to America \\"It's a good enough country for them that's young and stirrin - but there's faults in it. there's not an aunt-sister among em - nor an earl!\\" Which pretty much sums up how I feel about America too."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"This is an example of the difficulties of shopping online.I had read the book several years ago and wanted to give a volume as a gift.

You will do better with the purchase of a used hardcover volume"},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"I found this book in my school library a year ago...and i think it was indeed,a very pleasant heartwarming story.So nice was that i even managed to catch Burnett's other titles!Basically,this novel is about a boy living in America who realises that his long dead father was actually a lord's son back in old England.The story goes back when the lord's (youngest and favourite) son fell for a young maiden in America.So madly in love with her that he even dare to forsake his home,his title and his father to be with her.Despite they being poor,the trio led a fulfilling and wonderful life,that was,when the son was contracted with some incurable disease and died.Back in England,the old sire (the lord,of course) never forgave his youngest son for his action.He never liked the maiden,either.Coincidence as it may be,the Lord's two oldest sons either died or ran away(sorry,but i can't remeber this part).Knowing that his time was up,and he needed a heir,the Lord called for his long-lost grandson to come stay with him in England.For a boy who was born and bred in America,and had friends like the baker,the apple seller,the barber and roams round the street during his leisure time,moving in with a stern and grouchy old man in a cold castle was a far cry from his life in America.The old Lord found children a nuisance,but had it not been a fact that he needs a heir,he'd have probably wished his grandson to continue rotting away in America.Cedric Roy (the protagonist and grandson)was nevertheless,the sweet and innocent 7-year-old.He never questions why his grandfather was old and bitter,or why the servants were extremely afraid of their master,or why the castle was cold and dark and empty,or why his mother could not come and live with him (the Lord refused the maided to be within his castle grounds).Overtime,as Cedric Roy discovered more of his grandpa's self,the latter too,was amused by his grandson.A boy of 7,compassionate and caring for others,the old man began to open up...and change his perspection of life...It was amazing indeed,that this lovely bond between a boy of 7 and an old elderly man could get along easily.Burnett's novel was extremely well-written...depicting the childishness and innocence of a child,as well as the black-hearted old Lord.I give this book two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"I wanted to read this book because the idea of Little Lord Fauntleroy is such a part of our culture, but I knew nothing about the original. The child is sympathetically drawn (except for the fact of calling his mother \\"dearest\\" which I found odd) and charms all he comes in contact with. He is just an ordinary boy in the US when news comes to him that he will inherit his grandfather's title and is to go to England to learn to be a lord. The grandfather is wonderfully curmudgeonly, the mother is too good to be true, and of course there is a happy ending. There was gentle humour and I liked seeing the change in the old man. A pleasant read."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"I had never read Little Lord Fauntleroy, and after reading The Secret Garden recently, which was completely enchanting and full of metaphoric wisdom, I wanted to read more of Francis Hodgson Burnett's work. Personally, the title of this book had become associated with a rather pompous characterization as in &#34;who do you think you are, little lord Fauntleroy?&#34; so I had no idea what the book was even about.To my surprise and delight, just like The Secret Garden, her drawing of the characters in the midst of their circumstances was vivid and real, and completely drew me in. With good reads such as this, I have to force myself to put the book down, so I can prolong the pleasure. From the very beginning all the way to the end, not a scene was wasted or uninteresting. Some writers spend a good deal of time explaining why their characters act the way they do, which becomes tedious.Ms. Burnett's characters speak through their actions, and the story of the little boy who becomes a lord is simply about living spontaneously from the ideals of highest character. So much of the stories in the world today shows us humans who are tortured within by what they can't quite integrate in their lives. They don't touch the realm that this book simply opens one into, the part of humanity that is giving and loving without cause or reason. Reading this book was very refreshing. It's characters are uniquely portrayed and Ms. Burnett, in my opinion, never moralizes. Had she done so, the book would have been far less engaging.If you want to remember your childhood feeling of delight and innocence, if you want to be filled with simple joy and delight without requiring that you be perfect, if you want to remember a part of who you are as an eternal child, I believe you will relish this book."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"One again I'm embarrassed to say I've made it to fifty and never read this book.

If you've enjoyed The Little Princess and The Secret Garden, you surely will want to read her third famous children's classic. The seven-year-old American protagonist is simply too sweet and good-natured to be true; his widowed mother is a study in patient suffering.Suddenly informed that her son is the heir to an Earldom in England, the mother gives up her homeland to restore her son to his rightful legacy. But his crusty old grandfather(who cast out his youngest son when he married a mere American) proves mean and selfish-universally hated by his tenants. Now this unexpected grandson may be his last chance--not only to continue the family name and honor, but more importantly, for the old man's personal growth.It's a challenge for American readers to understand the dialogue which Burnett often presents in dialect, while ignoring the distinction between New Yorkese and British peasant slang. Neverthless, this book is a gently told tale which will touch those unjaded readers who remain. The underlying theme may be that of the restorative power of innocence."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"First, its so sugary sweet as the interwebs say 'diabeetus' will be imminent. you have the basics, poor father-less kid makes friends with EVERYONE, crotchity relative they never knew about is richer then Midas it seems and suddenly wants poor kid to come be the heir.

The quality of the writing is very good and makes for a great reading. Yet it is so syrupy and idealistic that my head was somewhat spinning. Here are several excerpts from Little Lord Fauntleroy. \\"Oh, the house is so beautiful!\\" exclaims Little Lord Fauntleroy. \\"Oh, Dearest, the pony is so beautiful!\\" \\"You are the most wonderful, kindest man I've ever known!\\" Like I wrote, these are few examples, but in the book, there are a lot of them. Mostly, the tone of Little Lord Fauntleroy is that England is a better country than United States of America. The characters of the book are one-dimensional, but there is a good play with positivism and negativism. However, the values set forth by the book don't fit me well because people just can't buy other people's way out of their miseries. Although the therapeutic effect is short-lived, it is unrealistic and condescending. Little Lord Fauntleroy arouses jealousy in the readers that this boy will inherit the vastness of the treasure in forms of money, house, property, and so on and that he has the power to change people's lives. Really, changing people's lives doesn't require any money at all. At the same time, Little Lord Fauntleroy introduces the idea of materialism that it is deemed to be cool to possess a lot of stuff (and why? I ask). Again, the book was written in 1886, and it is difficult for the author to foresee the effects of materialism have on the environment and living space. Another terrible crime committed by the author is that her book is literally about beautiful people. So, the idea is that it is very important that you look beautiful as possible. Hm...sure. All in all, Little Lord Fauntleroy is an okay book, but I have no desire of reading it again."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"I ordered this audio CD because I like childrens' classic literature and because I like to listen to audio books while on trips.

Then you've got to love a professional e-book production. Thanks Amazon for high standards."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"Little Lord Fauntleroy is a story about a little American boy, Cedric who suddenly finds himself the heir-apparent to a title in England. His grandfather, the present Lord Fauntleroy, (who originally disowned the boy's now-dead father for marrying his American mother) sends for the boy to live with him. His faultless mother of course agrees to let him take this opportunity, while she goes to live in a nearby cottage.Then a woman appears with a boy she claims to be the son of an older son, apparently displacing Cedric as heir. It is a testament to Little Lord Fauntleroy's sweetening effect that his grandfather unites with his mother to fight against this alternate claim (successfully, of course...this is no book for bittersweet endings--the good always triumph, the evil always meet they're downfall, and the good and the evil are always on opposite sides).Enough sugar to gag a horse, but no story. From the start, the little boy is perfect...charitable, pretty, strong, and smart--but infinitely oblivious of others' defects. He does not grow or change. He does not wrestle with problems. He does not even realize there are problems. He is not a character--he's a pro-American fantasy.The real protagonist is the present Lord, the boy's grandfather. His transition from conceited grump to true grandfather is mildly interesting. However, far too often Cedric's perfect little self takes center stage, constantly presenting himself to be admired by the other characters, who were not so fortunate as to be perfect or American."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"I got to know this book \\"Little Lord Fauntleroy\\" through the President of SGI, Daisaku Ikeda. This book tells us how a pure, innocent and kind-hearted boy, Ceddie, changed his ill-tempered grandfather. Little Ceddie's mother played a very important role in bringing up his son into such a good character, who always look at people's good points. This good quality of Little Ceddie is what a society need."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"Little Lord Fauntleroy is the fable of a young boy (Cedric) who is nothing short of saintly. His arrival in England as a new lord replacing his grandfather casts off the contrast of dark and light. The Earl is nothing short of a brute. Cedric is a saint. Cedric's charm, handsome looks and demeanor evolve the Uncle into a saint himself. That's the story. There really isn't a plot or some great cause and effect drama. The author's gift is the ability to tell a fable -- good can conquer evil.The problem with Little Lord Fauntleroy is of course it's dated. Since contemporary themes were inserted into the tale and contemporary characters were inserted (unlike Secret Garden or Little Princess) that really crunches teeth together. Were this book published today as-is civil rights groups would be up in arms and I wouldn't blame them. Francis doesn't have King's English speak and some of the characters speak with their accent making it hard to understand.Many have called the book sentimental and I didn't feel that. Too many stereotypes and too many shallow characters with not enough flavor made the book flat.On the positive end the language is richer than expected and I liked that insertion and even politics and class warfare get the light of day.Personally I liked the later reads better than this one."},{"Title":"Complete Guide to Microsoft Excel Macros","review":"The book has made me e very good writer of Ecel macros.With the book I have written many and very useful automatic programs."},{"Title":"Complete Guide to Microsoft Excel Macros","review":"It was the oldest book ever.

Maybe that IS reality, but it's only part of reality!

While I consider myself fairly old-fashioned in my viewpoint about motherhood, I was pretty embarassed by this book. In a nutshell, this author seems to view mothers as equal parts drill sargent (mom tells you when to stop, when to go, when to say 'excuse me,\\" etc.), chauffeur (mom drives you where you need to go, woo-hoo!), and nurse (mom cooks, bathes you, and brushes your hair). While there are certainly days when I feel like that is indeed all I do as a mother, I guess I would have appreciated a few fun things thrown in that moms can do as well. Also, there's a page in the book that says a Mommy can \\"look like a rose\\" and sometimes \\"have a baby inside of her.\\" This seemed oddly out of place, which another reviewer stated as well. I would have preferred to see some mention of how sometimes Mommies go to work (similar to the \\"Daddies\\" book). Even though I am a stay-at-home-mom, I know that a lot of women are not, and it would have been nice to see a reference to working moms. Overall, this book wasn't in any way endearing or sweet. I'm going to give the author the benefit of the doubt and say that maybe she wrote this book after a particularly exhausting day with her children."},{"Title":"Mommies are for Counting Stars (Lift-the-Flap, Puffin)","review":"This little book is a delight, leaving your little one feeling safe and secure having the loving care of a Mommy.

Now he can repeat what is under each of the flaps, unprompted, and even though he is now 21 months it is still one of his favorite books.Subsequently, I gave it to my daughter last year for Mother's Day and my son-in-law was given, &quot;Daddies are for Catching Fireflies&quot; on Father's Day.

According to this book, Mommies are for fixing boo-boos, making breakfast, driving kids around, and my personal favorite \\"TAKING CARE OF EVERYONE!\\" While this may be the reality in many households, I don't think these are concepts that need to be reinforced in a book. I find this book particularly annoying when contrasted with the Daddy version, in which Daddies apparently fix broken toys (I'd love to see my husband fix anything that's broken...he's got NO mechanical sense), \\"GO TO WORK,\\" read books \\"and fall asleep, too.\\" These books might as well have been written in the 50s.

The daddy book is adorable, it's all about how great daddy's are, how they do all these fun events with you. Then I read the mommy book.

Then, I received the grandma and grandpa books as a gift a very short time later.

It's what made me buy the book. The short poems are oblique or boring and usually both. And the whole thing reeks of his Christianity and his apparent desire to be British. He uses more British slang and place-names than any native-born Brit I ever read! He's old enough to use rhymes and have a feel for rhythm - Prufrock certainly has these qualities.

They were eventually translated into English and were/are wildly popular.Basically it's a book of a few well-known and high-quality fairy tales that have appeal and appropriateness for all ages. The language is a bit old fashioned, as is some of the spelling ('inchant' rather than 'enchant,' for example) but it's definitely worth reading.Although, the word 'faggot' is used in the text to refer to sticks, which is historically what it meant, but if you're sensitive, that might be something to consider.There's an active table of contents, no illustrations (but the captions are left in the text to tease), the page numbers are left in the text, and the first letter of every story is mysteriously dropped. Oh, and the very last line of the last story was in an illustration, so that's missing.The stories included are:Little Red Riding Hood (Sans woodcutter)The FairyBlue BeardThe Sleeping Beauty in the WoodsThe Master Cat; or, Puss in BootsCinderilla; or, the Little Glass SlipperLittle ThumbThe Ridiculous WishesDonkey-Skin"},{"Title":"The Fairy Tales of Charles Perrault","review":"I bought this because I was looking for ab original version of \\"donkey skin.'

I admit that I didn't read the corresponding original language text, because my Latin was never all that good, and I have no Greek. I wish that I did, though. Just in English translation I can see where these teachings transport you to an entirely different sort of mind-set, an entirely different world.Indeed, you will either come to develop a sort of intuitive understanding of the spiritual principles being discused here, or you will simple give up in disgust and dismiss it as meaningless and incomprehensible. Perhaps it is incomprehensible to modern sensibility, but it is far from meaningless. If you are familiar with Plato and Plotinus it will help. I also find that a familiarity with the concept of the Tao helps with understanding what is meant by Kosmos. I suppose that there could be esoteric teachings encoded and hidden in the original text, but personally I find the exoteric spiritual and metaphysical speculations to be quite interesting and valuable in their own right.There was a reason that these teachings were preserved through so many centuries, while so much else was consigned to flames or left to rot...."},{"Title":"Chronicle of the Conquest of Granada","review":"Washington Irving is known to most americans as the author of Rip Van Winkle and Sleepy Hollow -but he was also a hispanophile and historian, and wrote this account of the 'reconquista' - the series of events and military campaigns that led to the expulsion of the moors after 700 years on the Iberian peninsula.Despite his obvious love of all things Spanish, the account is quite balanced even showing sympathy for the Moors.

Edwin Hartill (1) names the principle, (2) defines it, (3) illustrates it, (4) provides notable quotes about the advantages gained by using it, and then (5) provides Biblical examples of how to apply it. The book's outline format does not require long, academic reading assignments. Instead, it encourages the student to practice the principles the book teaches by reading and studying the Biblical text. Both in an academic setting and within the Christian Education program of the local church, Hartill's book lends itself to courses in Bible Study Methods. Each principle links easily to a study skill, allowing the student to learn multiple skills simultaneously. For instance, by assigning a short word study along with practice in &quot;the First Mention Principle,&quot; the teacher helps the student discover the authorial intent for the meaning of the word or concept, and then see it borne out through &quot;the general teaching of the Scriptures.&quot;During a teaching trip, I once was asked to teach a Bible study for employees of a large corporation in Honolulu. None of the participants had any background in Bible Study methods, let alone a grasp of Biblical interpretation. So I recommended they get Hartill's book and use it as a study manual. Several years later I met one of those people at a seminar on the mainland. Some of the Bible Study participants had gone on to become teachers, and all had grown in their Christian walk. My friend attributed their growth to the principles they learned by studying the Bible using J. Edwin Hartill's book."},{"Title":"Principles of Biblical hermeneutics","review":"I'm glad I bought this book. It had good information and its format made it easy to digest (outlines) without a lot of effort.

A number of analysis and applications in the text did not appear to follow good practices and therefore generated concerns about the validity of the author's conclusions.With that said, I believe in the sincerity of the author.

But she didn't use the talent in this book. The heroine,Marian,was so exasperating I was clenching my teeth. She was described as someone who was independent and could take care of herself, but she did the stupidest things that got her into trouble and then she needed to be rescued. So much for being able to take care of herself. This was not Christina Dodd's usual writing style. Her heroines are usually pragmatic, strong women who can handle problems on their own. My personal favorites are Castles In The Air, Treasure of The Sun, and Once A Knight."},{"Title":"Outrageous","review":"The heroine is truly outrageous - and not in a good way. that she does not at all act like someone from her time can be forgiven - but in addition, she gets herself, and others, into trouble in the most exasperating way. is she really so stupid - to go out in the dangerous countryside BY HERSELF, carrying a toddler straight into danger, escaping the the safety of shelter for the flimsiest of reasons? And she is depicted as having to carry her own baggages too. It is so unbelievable it doesn't just stretch, but tears the imagination (as anyone who has carried a child would know - it would be impossible to carry several pieces of luggage, plus a baby, through the wilds, for crying out loud - especially when it's not out of necessity but just out of your own whim). She is so selfish and thick headed I found the hero to be a saint for putting up with her antics. But all in all, she stretches one's credulity too much - not because i can't believe in the overwhelming courage of the lady, but because she does not even seem to have the SENSE of the period - of what is hazardous, of what is possible and not possible to do ON FOOT - it just turns out not to be believable.too bad, because i was enjoying the background about the wars between kings richard and henry."},{"Title":"Outrageous","review":"This medieval romance by Ms. Christina Dodd takes place shortly after the Richard III/Henry Tudor battle for the English throne. Marian of Wenthaven is the saucy ex-lady-in-waiting, living with her two year old son at her father's keep. Griffith ap Powel is the Welsh warrior sent by King Henry to protect Lady Marian and her son, but from what?While I enjoyed many aspects of this story, it is, after all, a romance novel, and in that area, I found it a bit lacking. The hero seemed to leap too quickly from his near animosity toward the heroine to all-encompassing love, with no real insight into what made him change his mind. The heroine, for all her demands that she is independent and self-reliant, still ends up in so much trouble as to require the hero to save her on more than one occasion. I never felt a strong chemistry between them.The story moves along well, and although some points of the plot are easily guessed, there were still some surprises. All in all, a fun read, but not a keeper."},{"Title":"Outrageous","review":"Bold and spirited, Lady Marian Wenthaven could wield an impressive sword. Living on her father's estate with her two-year-old son, Lionel, she harbors a dangerous secret. Marian is the close friend, and was once chief lady-in-waiting to the future Queen.Griffith ap Powell was no stranger to battle, and he helped insure Henry Tudor would be king of England. Now the King has sent him to protect Lady Marian. It doesn't take long to discover treachery is afoot. But strong-willed Marian is not the easiest lady to protect, and the threat may be originating from someone close to Marian. Together they will have to confront the danger, and their feelings for each other.When I pick up a book by Ms. Dodd, I just know it will be wonderful, and this was no exception. I loved the fact Marian was such a skilled swordsman, an attribute normally associated with men. Griffith was a strong, determined character and it was refreshing he knew he and Marian were meant to be, before she figured it out or accepted it. Art, Griffith's loyal, wily as a fox servant, was a real treat. Liver-spotted, snaggle-toothed and one-eyed, he could still easily seduce women to gain information if needed. The intrigue subplot was engrossing, believable and well done. If I had to come up with something negative to say, it would be the fact Marian did tend to make impulsive decisions, that would put her in dangerous situations requiring rescue. Although other reviewers have already pointed this out, I wasn't bothered enough by her behavior to lower my opinion of the quality of the story. I have read nearly everything Ms. Dodd has written. And yes, I do agree she has written better, but this was still a worthy book, and I do recommend it."},{"Title":"Outrageous","review":"The most fundamental problem with this book has been touched on by the other reviewers. Basically, it's really difficult to like Marian, the heroine. She does lots of stupid things. She's not helped by the author who only reveals her motivation at the end of the book, long after I'd ceased to care about Marian.Griffith isn't much better. I've been reading romances for decades and remember the bodice rippers with fondness. Still, he treads an awfully fine line between seduction and rape.Finally, as a big fan of Josephine Tey's &quot;The Daughter of Time&quot;, I was really annoyed with the blind following of Dodd in her treatment of Richard III. Tey's book very convincingly states that Richard's reputation is not deserved and that the propaganda that created the reputation didn't start until many years after this book was written."},{"Title":"Outrageous","review":"After reading the book, I was shocked to see the horrible reviews!

It's set at the beginning of the reign of Henry VII, the father of the notorious Henry VIII, though none of it actually takes place at court. However, Henry VII does play a large role. Political intrigue is the driving force behind most of the plot. The romance between Marian and Griffith could have been a little more developed -- they went from lust to love very quickly -- but there were things I enjoyed. The dialogue, though not completely historically accurate, is more fitting than the speech patterns of today that are often used in historical romances. Also, I like the twisting intrigue of court. I'm liking Christina Dodd, and I'll definitely be reading more of her books."},{"Title":"Outrageous","review":"The other 2 Dodd books I have read were well written with characters you cared about.

In this dispensation of God's grace, no serious Bible student may leave this treasury unread, for it draws the heart heavenward as perhaps no other work ever has. It is obvious that the writer had not only a deep and abiding love for Christ, but a thorough-going understanding of the personal application of most of the key doctrines of scripture. A must for any who would mature in their experiential knowledge of Christ. C.H.M.'s unfolding of truth in terms of its application to the life of the individual is unparalleled.

CHM's work in bringing these pictures/types(symbolism)out from the pages of Scripture will give new meaning and encouragement to the Christian reader to more fully explore the Old Testament for another glimpse of the Great Prophet-Priest-King.

These stories in this series are not as compact as those in other books, notably \\"The Innocence of Father Brown,\\" but they have the same magnetic power to draw the reader in.As ever, Chesterton is interested not only in delivering first rate detective stories, but of describing human nature. His characters are flawed and biased, all blind in their own way, which is what makes it so difficult to see the truth that lies before them. Father Brown, ever kind and imperturbable, nearly always sees right through to the heart of the matter. Posing as a humble parish priest, which he is, he somehow sees beyond the class boundaries which it is Chesterton's special gift to point out and puncture.Not all the stories are murder mysteries. \\"The Scandal of Father Brown\\" is about a man in pursuit of an errant wife; and \\"The Insoluble Problem\\" is about crime, but not the one Brown is called to investigate. In all of his stories, would-be detectives, constables, lovers, actors, academics and men of means cross paths in ways that are befuddling to all but the dumpy little priest in the round spectacles.Listening to this collection was a wonderful way to pass several long commutes.In the version I heard, BTW, reader Tom Whitworth did a great job with one exception.

Underneath the prosaic, seemingly trivial and everyday situations depicted in many (although not all) of these poems is an underlying turbulence and subdued violence that must reflect the reality of living at the end of the twentieth century in Ireland.

An excellent choice for lovers of good contemporary poetry."},{"Title":"Nutrition of Finches and Other Cage Birds","review":"Black's book is a good, readable, general text on nutrition. However, at the time of its writing (1981) only economically important species had had any real, through nutritional research done. So it really doesn't tell you the specific needs of finches or other cage birds. It does go into good detail about the roll of all the vitamins, minerals, amino acids, fats, carbohydrates etc, the importance of various nutrients in the diet, how they interact, some information about deficiencies and excess and their symptoms in birds (and other species), what foods are good sources of various nutrients (or useless to birds), what nutrients are or are not of particular concern in captive birds, but it can't tell you the specific nutritional needs of a specific species or how to design a diet.I have not yet read Blacks 2007 update (Avian nutrition) nor his other book, Parrot Nutrition (also 2007)Klasing's 1998 Comparative Avian Nutrition goes into a more detail regarding metabolic processes, digestive physiology, the needs of birds with different diets (insectivores, frugivores, carnivores, etc.) as well as how growth, environment, reproduction and other factors affect nutritional needs. It's also very readable."},{"Title":"AdvancED Flash Interface Design (Advanced Design)","review":"AdvancED Flash Interface Design is the latest installment from Friends of ED. Incidentally, while reading an interview with Chris Mills, I recently learned that the ED in the title is capitalized for a reason. \\"Friends of Every Designer\\" is what the company name stands for. Read blogs folks, you'll have many serendipitous moments. Anyway, this book was very practical, filled with an enormous amount of information, all of which is very applicable on a day to day basis. This quote from Chris' blog sums it up quite nicely...\\"You know those tech books you read and go 'yeah, this is all well and good, but would I ever REALLY do any of this in my work?' Well, this book isn't like that - it's nothing but real-world Flash design teachings for those of you who have already got past the basics, but want to take your work further, with creative, inspirational techniques.\\"Since my official job description is Web User Interface Designer / Developer, I figured it would be right up my alley. I chimed in with a comment on his blog post regarding this book, and he was nice enough to send me a review copy. It was written by a trio of talented Flash guys: Michael Kemper, Guido Rosso and Brian Monnone. What I like is that while this series is geared towards Flash, it covers fundamentals that are essential to any sort of visual or graphic design.Like any book, it starts with an overview of the topic, pointing out some of the benefits of Flash, while also acknowledging a few of its drawbacks. They are quick to point out that long loading times and inaccessible content are a stigma which Flash is helping to overcome. Loading times can be avoided through smart planning of content (ala Ajax, loading things as needed) and Flash can actually be used to add sub-titles to video and such.Chapters two through five focus on user experience, color theory, interface design and vector drawing. The content therein could be used for a design class as a textbook. Seriously, it's that good. Also, I like the way the book is planned out. Most of it is black and white, with figures that are contained in a color section. This is a great compromise between keeping printing costs low, while not missing out on some design nuance, because there are color pages too.Chapters six and seven delve more into the Flash interface itself, covering advanced uses of the timeline and layers, and showing how to use Flash for vector drawing. In the past, these tools were considered to be sub-par, but as of version 8 it has really come into its own for creating non-destructive effects. These same effects can also be manipulated, created and removed with ActionScript. It should be noted that there is also a fair bit of Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop techniques covered, throughout the entirety of the book.Chapter 8 was a departure into the realm of video, talking about the various codecs that can be used. It also showed how to do green screen effects with Apple Final Cut Pro. Once you have isolated the video clips you want to make use of, they can then be taken into the Flash environment for seamless integration with your site's interface. Think of Adobe's own site, which has many full-motion video narrators who walk you through their varying content.While Flash's forte is vectors, occasionally you will find yourself needing pixel-precision. Chapters 9 and 10 are about achieving this with Photoshop, and how to make raster (bitmap) images with the smallest footprints. This is usually done by exporting PNG files with the correct amount of compression and opacity. One of the nice things about Flash is that IE6 has no problem rendering PNG opacity when used in conjunction with Flash. Many of you CSS guys will know what a headache this is to do otherwise, using inelegant GIF files.The last few chapters cover creating animated effects, Flash textures, and finishing off a site. They cover some nice tweening and transformation effects, and also show how to make water textures with distortion filters and a background image. If you've seen water in games like Unreal Tournament, you will know what I'm talking about. The final chapter covers attention to detail that will make the difference between good work and great work. It teaches how to sweat the small stuff, without being too much of a perfectionist.My one and only complaint is that this book focused so heavily on Illustrator, when Fireworks is perhaps a more seamlessly integrated tool, and many people who have purchased Studio 8 for Flash and Dreamweaver already have it bundled. Nevertheless, many of the concepts carry over to whatever graphics program you prefer. All in all, this is a very strong title and a must-have for those who do a lot of cross-disciplinary work or just want to branch out into another aspect of web design. I like to think of Flash as SWAT - You don't call \`em in for just anything, but it's great when you really need high impact."},{"Title":"AdvancED Flash Interface Design (Advanced Design)","review":"When i first got this book, I didn't really know what to expect. I didn't know if it was going to be a design book or an animation book for interfaces. I guess what I eventually ended up getting was a little bit of both.The early chapters of the book are definitely not \\"AdvancED\\", but give some good insight on some topics that are normally overlooked. The one problem with this book is that it was trying to fit information about a lot of combined programs, such as Final Cut Pro, After Effects, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Flash. However, this HAS to be done because of the way Flash interfaces are designed these days, so as a downfall it can be excused because sometimes it is unavoidable (and sometimes very handy) to know how to use all those programs.There is a chapter on colors which is great, but the end of the chapter (page 56) talks about the Color class. The Color class is deprecated as of Flash 8 and I wish they would have went more in depth on using the new classes in 8, such as ColorTransform and the likes.Now that we've got the negatives out of the way, it's time to cover all the very formidable positives that this book has to offer. It has great explanations in every chapter of how to deal with good user experience and interface design. It's obvious that the authors (award winners in this subject) know what they are talking about. For instance, on a personal level, I hate bringing in graphics into Flash from Illustrator and seeing all the miscellaneous graphic symbols that it makes while importing. Some people don't clean this up in the library and it's VERY frustrating to see all those symbols and have to go in and clean them up. These guys stress highly the importance of a clean library and have a great section in chapter 7 that shows how to clean these graphics up. I can't tell you how many times I'd wished that people who work with me could make nice, clean libraries before they hand files over to me, but sometimes thats too much to ask for.There is a chapter that makes mention of video and the best part about this chapter, after having recently made a project for AT&T; that used Flash video, is the fact that it makes mention of the Flash 8 Video Encoder that comes bundled with Flash 8 Professional. It's a stand alone application and nobody in my office actually knew what it was or how to use it (which for a large company such as I work for could be a bit mind boggling). They take you through the encoder and show you example usage, which is VERY handy when working with encoding FLV files. This chapter also boasts a great explanation (which I actually wish I had read before looking like a fool in an initial project meeting) of the video playback options that Flash has to offer (Streaming, Progressive, and Embedded video).The middle of the book has a great color pullout (it's not really a pullout, but ya know...) that demonstrates examples from the book and coincides with the color chapter (since obviously you want to see colors in a color chapter...). Chapter 9 is also an outstanding chapter which takes you from start to finish on how to design an interface in Photoshop (and 10 follows up with the proper way to import it into Flash so that you can work with those graphics). There is a section in this chapter titled \\"Moving from Photoshop to Flash\\" (pg. 232) which is a HUGE bonus. EVERYONE in the world who is a Flash designer/developer should convert graphics in the way that is described in this section. It saves a lot of time and headaches later on when you use the process outlined here.Overall, the book was a treat. It started off a bit slow but definitely picked up a lot of momentum by the end. I'd definitely recommend it to someone who normally takes graphics from programs such as Illustrator or Photoshop and brings them into Flash. Conversely, I'd recommend it to designers who design for Flash developers as there is a lot of good information to learn from here."},{"Title":"AdvancED Flash Interface Design (Advanced Design)","review":"There are plenty of Flash books out there to show you how to work with XML, scripting complex animations, learning Object-Oriented techniques, using components, etc. but there are only a few that deal with interface design.This book deals with design in a very cool way - walking you through color theory, some mild 3D, shooting and using video, lots of photoshop design techniques, general rules of thumb for good UI and design, etc.The book really deals with visuals over code, so this is perfect for those who don't need to be burdened with lots of coding to get the results they want.I've been designing interfaces, sites, applications, etc. for quiet some time, and I was able to refresh some of my own thinking by reading through each chapter.A chapter called \\"Flash Textures\\" dives into BitmapData in a nice way, I wish that chapter would have been a bit longer. Its one of the new things in Flash 8 that isn't always easy to get one's head around, especially when it comes to different kinds of animation one would like to generate with it.I might have my own techniques to get things done, and the book doesn't present material in a way to make me feel like if its not done per the book, it's incorrect thinking. Its very open in that way which I like (not preachy).This is the first FriendsofED book I've seen with a color section - and its wonderful :) I can easily see another book coming out of this from different designers... something like Flash Interface Design 2.In all, a very solid book thats nice to look at and isn't heavy on code. The Photoshop techniques are useful for those who may be a little new to using it for anything other than photo retouch, etc. I like this book a lot, and I'll keep it in the side pile of books on my desk (if a book ends up in my bookcase, it means I won't use it).

The difficulty I blame on my background and not on the author's writing skills. As a Southern Baptist, I know almost nothing about the beliefs and practices of Judaism and very little of various themes, writings, and rites of the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox religions. The author relies strongly on sources I am unfamiliar with, and the text does seem more geared toward Catholicism than Protestantism. It was quite a learning experience for me to be introduced to the Talmud, rabbinical sources, and early Christian church writings not included in my Protestant Bible. I was rather amazed at the complex arguments and ideas about Adam and Eve in the Jewish and early Christian worlds; the author presented me with many thoughts and ideas that make sense yet had just never occurred to me. The basic argument I took from this work is that Adam and Eve can only be properly understood in conjunction with the \\"ends\\" of Jewish and Christian goals, which center on the giving of the Torah to the Israelites at Mt. Sinai and in the birth and crucifixion of Jesus Christ, respectively. While I have seen Christ described as the second Adam, I found the comparison of Eve to the Virgin Mary quite interesting. There has obviously been much debate among religious scholars about the events and meanings of the Fall and exile from Eden of Adam and Eve, and the author seems to address every thought and suggestion possible in this regard. He also provided me with interesting information on the rebellion and exile of Satan, drawing largely from sources outside my own religious jurisdiction. As a Christian, the concept of Original Sin has been an idea I have always accepted without question, and it was interesting to see how the full concept of Original Sin was actually developed by Saint Augustine. The author helps illustrate his points with discussions of religious artwork such as that of the Sistine Chapel and the illuminating epics of Milton's Paradise Lost and Dante's Inferno. Overall, I learned a lot from this book, information which I cannot fully digest without further study.

It is from here, then, that I wish to set out and discuss Gary Anderson's fascinating book on the many different readings - the many different variations - of the myth of Adam and Eve. My usage of the word \\"myth\\" should not be seen as derogatory or as intended to undermine the readings of Adam and Eve that have been informative to both Judaism/s and Christianity/s. Rather, I use the term as a way of referencing via a singular noun what is, in fact, a cluster of stories that all center on a particular narrative: the narrative of Adam and Eve.The subtitle of the book is \\"Adam and Eve in Jewish and Christian Imagination.\\" For this reader, placing religion within the realm of imagination is a welcome step, as it removes religion from epistemological disputes that ground themselves in certain notions of knowledge as \\"certainty\\"; furthermore, it gives room for hermeneutics - the interpretation of texts - and recognizes that different interpretations need not necessarily be seen as antithetical to or divergent from a larger tradition.It is interesting, for example, to compare St. Augustine's readings of Genesis with St. Ephrem's readings. Although both early Christian thinkers are Doctors of the Church in Roman Catholicism and considered by the Orthodox and Anglican churches to be among the greatest of all Christian theologians, their understandings of the Adam and Eve narrative - particularly the fall and sexuality - are quite divergent. What becomes apparent is that context and cultural tendencies play a role in their interpretations; in particular, St. Ephrem's interpretations very closely parallel those of Jewish beliefs that were widely held in Syria, where Ephrem lived, at the time of his writing.The book is neither limited to Christian readings of the story nor do Jewish readings simply serve as a stage on which to present Christian interpretations. Anderson spends a good time detailing both Rabbinic and non-Rabbinic writings; while he spends less time detailing Rabbinic (= normative Jewish) sources than detailing normative Christian sources (such as the aforementioned interpretations of Augustine and Ephrem), this does not mean that he spends less time on Jewish thought as such: he spends quite a good time discussing so-called \\"apocryphal\\" Jewish and Jewish-Christian literature, neither of which ever became normative in either tradition, but both of which are important for understanding the context/s and the spectrum of belief/s that were a part of the Jewish and Christian worlds during their formative periods. And, as can be seen from the example of Ephrem, such seemingly distant \\"apocrypha\\" may, in fact, be far more a part of the larger understanding of such a seemingly simple text as Genesis 1 - 3 than would otherwise be assumed.This is a great book that works on multiple levels: historical, theological and socio-cultural. By bringing in so many voices - Jewish and Christian, normative and distantly normative - Anderson shows the incredible ability of \\"the\\" standard text to be read in ways that are both insightful and imaginative. It is in the imagination that the space for reading exists, and Anderson illuminates this almost perfectly."},{"Title":"The Genesis of Perfection:Adam and Eve in Jewish and Christian Imagination","review":"I found this to be an enlightening yet difficult read.

Anderson gives attention to the reception history of the Adam and Eve narrative in Jewish and Christian thought. He writes that, \\"Genesis is not only about the origins of sin; it is also about the foundations of human perfection.\\" (p. 8, italics author's) Yes, Adam and Eve's \\"fall\\" in the early chapters of the Book of Genesis explain why the world is the way that it is now, but it also provides an ideal humanity toward which the readers should seek to return or even surpass.Anderson reads Jewish and Christian sacred texts, later comments, and even art. He examines what works of art like the Temptation and Fall of Adam and Eve by Michaelangelo in the Sistine Chapel or Anastasis in St. George's Greek Orthodox Church in Toranto say about the story. He spends some time commenting on John Milton's Paradise Lost. He gives attention to the writings of the apostolic church and early church fathers, as well as their theological gleanings from the Adam and Eve story. The reader will come away seeing how much influence the characters of Adam and Eve have had on the human imagination.Some important subjects that Anderson covers include the serpent/Satan figure; views of early human sexuality (if the Garden of Eden was God's temple, and Adam and Eve his priest, how could they have had sex before the \\"fall\\"?; Mary's relation to Eve; what it means to be embodied; and the eschatological destiny of humanity based on the beginning of humanity.If you are searching for a solid book on the Adam and Eve story, the use of the Book of Genesis in other Jewish and Christian literature, an example of hermeneutics and reception history, or just an awareness of what stories have grown from the biblical text that may influence your own thinking without your knowledge, this is a fantastic read. It is an easy read at one hundred and eighty-eight pages excluding the preface and the appendixes (plus it has a fair amount of pictures).

Look no further. \\"12 Strong Women of God\\" which focuses on Biblical women of the Old Testament, and \\"The Jesus Women,\\" which focuses on the New Testament, will provide much inspiration and food for thought and discussion. Marci Alborghetti creates a compelling portrait of each of these women. Where the Biblical record is more comprehensive, such as with Ruth or Esther, she sticks very closely to that record. Where the details of these women's lives are more elusive, Alborghetti uses more imagination, but nevertheless remains faithful to what is in the Bible. Her first-person narratives place the reader directly into the story and invite the reader into a personal relationship with each of these women. Her portraits of \\"The Samaritan Woman,\\" \\"The Canaanite Woman,\\" and \\"The Adulteress\\" in \\"The Jesus Women\\" are particularly riveting.Alborghetti also includes a set of probing discussion questions at the end of each woman's story.

While it kept my interest, I found it painful to follow the multiple veiwpoints.As a general rule, it seems like this is a rather risky and unwise way to write a novel. I have read novels told this way which were delightful, like 'The Poisonwood Bible'. In that novel, each character has a distinctive voice and they are telling differant parts of the same story.Whereas in East many of the character's voices are so similar that it's hard to know who's talking in some parts, except for the White Bear, whose haiku-like, disjointed thoughts seem painfully overdone. In modern literature, this sort of spare, poetry-like writing works, but juxtaposed in a story this traditional, it seems extremely jarring.Beyond this, the varying storylines are a bit confusing at the beginning, although if you know the story, it's not hard to figure out.Just so you won't think I'm completely down on this story, I'll admit I like the character of her father, and the idea of using him for a viewpoint, since in children's literature adults hardly ever tell the story. Also, I like the character of Rose, but I agree with what someone else said- I would be a little more freaked out if I were riding away with a strange bear."},{"Title":"East","review":"A very fairy tale kind of book. You basically know what is going to happen, what the ending will be.It was some what enjoyable, although so long winded at times that I felt like screaming.Not a memorable book but sufficently entertaining.The conclusion was dissapointing."},{"Title":"East","review":"I'm a big fan of fairytale retellings and am always exited to find something new I've never heard of before but I have to say, East wasn't my absolute favorite. The problem was that the original Norwegian story this book was based on was written purely for little kids and had a lot of repetition witch really didn't give the author all that much to go off of. I guess my biggest complaint was that the book was just too long, there was too much empty space for the reader to get bored and though it was kind of a nice change that the girl saves the guy I have to say it was a little slow."},{"Title":"East","review":"The book is an adaptation of the fairy tale East of the Sun, West of the Moon. As it's been a long time since I've read that tale, I can't recall if all the details are covered. The dresses aren't in walnuts, which is one detail I remember.The book is told with multiple narrators. Rose (the main character), her father, her brother Neddy, the white bear, and the Troll Queen all take turns telling the tale.The story begins with the father recounting Rose's birth. It seems his highly superstitious wife believed that one's personality could be determined by the direction the mother was facing when the child was born. She wanted a child born for each point of the compass--except for north. North-born children were wanderers. Also, she had been given a prophecy that if she did have a north-born child, the child would die buried under ice and snow. Guess what accidentally happens? Rose is born facing north.Meanwhile, the teenage (?) Troll Queen has fallen in love with a \\"softskin\\" (human) boy whom she wants to take to her palace. Her father is furious (because the boy is a prince and she smuggled him home) and turns the boy into a white bear, placing conditions on him for his disenchantment.Toddler Rose is rescued from drowning by the white bear, and this bear later reappears in the story to ask her to live with him (somewhat like Beauty and the Beast) promising to restore her family's fortunes and her sister's health in exchange. Rose's desire to save her family and her spirit for adventure lead her to accept the white bear's offer. The time in his castle allows Rose to get to know the bear and to weave and sew, two things she dearly loves.Things go wrong, as things often do in fairy tales, and Rose's curiosity causes the Troll Queen to come and claim her prize. Not to be put off by an unknown destination in the Arctic North, Rose sets off to find her white bear (she realizes that he is an enchanted man) and rescue him with predictable consequences.The book didn't have anything objectionable (swearing, sex). The \\"softskins\\" are enslaved by the trolls and daily drink a mind-numbing beverage. When ill or old, the slaves are left in the cold to die. Magic is implied (the Troll Queen mentions her \\"arts\\") and, of course, changing a person into a bear is an example of magic!This was not the best fairy tale adaptation I've read, but this fairy tale isn't one of my favorites. I like my princes to be active and adventurous, not passive and drugged for most of the story. But, I don't think a fairy tale fan or someone who enjoys a strong female character would be disappointed by the story."},{"Title":"East","review":"I liked this book because it was about a girl (...) in Norway, or Njord, as they called it back then. The book is a fantasy, so it takes you away from real-world drama. Another reason i liked this book is because of the way the author wrote the book from several points of veiw. This feature let you know what was happening in other parts of the story.The best part of the book, was when the main character, Rose, is a captive in the mountain castle with the white bear. She explored and found a room full of thread, needles and most beautiful of all, a large loom. The loom was carved with intricate designs and was the color of chestnut. Rose chose the prettiest thread and wove three dresses of these colors:gold, silver and moonlight. All of these dresses are useful in the rest of her journey and save her from poverty and capture.The setting of the story was very vivid, as the author explained the soft, purple heather and the ice figures of Gronland. The characters were deftly explained with their actions, dialogue, and thoughts."},{"Title":"East","review":"I thought the book was quite interesting when it came to the plot, but the narating was horrific. Each character tells their own story of the present, past and future, not allowing a lot of detail regarding the surroundings and an out of the box point of view. It doesn't give the story the credit it should aquire from the reader. The thought is there but that is all. The plot is an exquisite and labyrinthine addition to the notorious fairy tale of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\"; allowing you to grasp a little more of the story behind the beast and the beauty. Though the writing is annoying, reading this story is a must."},{"Title":"East","review":"After a while, the reading gets mundane. There were many passages that read:'I walked through the darkly lit hallways. It was cold. I pulled the lamp in front of me to see better. The wind died down. I shivered...\\"Much of the story was in 'essay-speak' form and didn't read like a story at all. The plot itself is interesting which is why I gave it 1 star.I think the story would have been better written in third person rather than from the many viewpoints of the characters in the story. This format would have been fine if each character had a distinct voice but all of them sounded the same. Really, it almost seems like Pattou made more of a book-mache of journal entries or even drafts and just put them together. The characters were only two dimensional and the writing with no feeling or character.Your better off reading the actual fairy tale itself, with all it's loopholes and consider that a satisfying read versus 400 or so pages of this."},{"Title":"East","review":"I wanted to like this book, I really did. It sounded great, loved the whole \\"Beauty & the Beast\\" thing, being a big fan of fantasy and fairy tales in particular I thought it would be a great book.... sadly I was wrong. I thought 4 view points might be interesting... but all it did was repeat the same scenario's over again from everyone's viewpoint and you never seem to really GO anywhere, or to really know anyone to care what happens to them. You never get attached to any of the characters because you never have time to bond with them before your ripped into someone else's viewpoint. All the head hopping made me nauseated."},{"Title":"East","review":"I liked this book alot, but it is almost an EXACT copy of my favorite book \\"The Golden Compass,\\" by Philip Pullman. His book is about a girl who goes to the North to cross a bridge made by the northern lights (might I add she is accompanied by a pansbjorne: aka. polar bear) even the words are similiar: philip pullman's polar bear is called a pansbjorne--hers is called an isbjorne or something similiar. It is mention more than once in Edith Pattou's book a bridge that connects the spirit world to the regular world made out of the northern lights: that EXACTLY the same thing in \\"the golden compass!\\" What really makes me angry is that in all of her interviews they ask \\"What books inspired you?\\" she doesn't even mention \\"the golden compass!\\" and OBVIOUSLY she read it cause its EXACTLY the same!!!!"},{"Title":"East","review":"East is a book that will imediatly grab attention. They way the book is written will leave you wanting to keep reading until the end. THe main character Rose goes on a adventure with a polar bear with many secrets to his life, while Rose is figuring out secrets and lies about herself. Her family has kept things from her her whole life, and it took the full filling of her destiny for her to find out the truth. This book I would recommend because it holds interest easily, but the ending could have been more informative about what happens after."},{"Title":"East","review":"I'm a teenager. That being said, I usually steer clear of long books that seem to hold no promise keeping my interest. My friend told me about this book and after much deliberation I agreed to read it- it was the best decision I've ever made.I absolutely, positively LOVED this book! I've read it three times and still can't get enough of it. It has adventure, romance, love, betrayal, suspense, mystery! Everything you could ever ask for. I recommend it to everyone. It is my favorite book.Read it. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"East","review":"I was really surprised when I read this book. After the reviews I thought it was just going to be another YA book. However, I really enjoyed this book and it has become one of my favorites. I have reread it at least twice and still enjoy the characters and plot. The only complaint I might have is that there is no sequel. I think it would have been really interesting if the author had continued the story into a series."},{"Title":"East","review":"What would you do if you found out that the story behind your birth was a lie? Coming from a simple life, Rose has yet to learn her true identity. Her mother, a very superstitious woman, has told Rose her entire life that she is an East born, the gentle side of the compass. Rose has a way of proving this theory wrong. She is a free spirit that likes to roam, and her actions always indicate that she is North born. Her journey begins one night when the white bear first knocks on her door. Soon, Rose finds herself in an adventure she never could have imagined. The white bear takes her to his \\"castle.\\" Rose, though a prisoner, learns to enjoy life with the white bear. She comes across rooms full of books, musical instruments, and fabric. Rose, being an avid weaver, is soon making dresses of silver, gold, and pearly moon. At the close of each day, the lights go out and as she lies in her bed she can feel a person get in beside her. Who is this mysterious visitor? She takes upon herself to find out whom it is. But is it worth it?Then one night she risks lighting a magic candle and that innocent task is now her undoing. The Troll Queen quickly whisks away the white bear, she being the one who gave him his curse. Now the race begins to find and recover her beloved white bear. She would search for him, \\"in the land that lay east of the sun and west of the moon.\\" But there was no way there. Soon Rose will find herself going to new and foreign lands and meeting new friends along the way. She will travel on her own compass to the palace made of ice in the far North. With the help of her beloved brother, a drunk Viking, and a local Iceland woman, will Rose be able to save her beloved white bear and stop the Troll Queen from ruining his life?This book is a fantasy, and it kept me turning the pages all night. Edith Pattou first found her idea by reading the Norwegian fairy tale \\"East of the Sun and West of the Moon.\\" She says she loved the spirit of the heroine of the story. She then wrote the book East in her own way. I loved Pattou's description of the magical lands of the North. The folklore was nothing I had ever read before, and I thought it was simply delectable. I was compelled on throughout the journey with Rose. I experienced her faith and loyalty to her most loved. I think anyone who has a love for romantic, adventure, fairytales, will enjoy this book. This book is a sweet rendition of the classic Beauty and the Beast. This book will catch you up in it's swift, tide turning adventures, as you travel East, South, West, and North."},{"Title":"East","review":"Had to buy this one it was so good. A great fairy tale retelling. So sweet and what an adventure. 14 and up."},{"Title":"East","review":"I'd read East of the Sun, West of the Moon, the fairy tale this book is based on, in a fairytale book when I was little, and it was my favorite. I've read the other retellings like Ice and Sun and Moon, Ice and Snow, but this was THE BEST. The alternating character point of views and the extraordinary journey Rose, the main character, endures made this one of my favorite fairy tale retellings EVER. The use of poetry for the POV of the bear was my favorite...it gets you right into the head of the bear and really makes you empathize with his misfortunes. I also like the fact that Rose is a really strong, really courageous woman character...it's a nice break from the traditional \\"damsel in distress\\" thing.EPIC WIN for this book! :)"},{"Title":"East","review":"Have you ever read the story of Cupid and his wife? She was never supposed to see him, but she lit a candle and accidentally poured wax on his sleeping shoulder. This book is like a Scandinavian form of the old Greek tale, though much more elaborate and entertaining.Combining legends, folklore, romance, insanity, desperation, and family love, this is a great read that you will enjoy if you're thirteen, thirty,or a hundred years old. When I read certain parts of the story, I caught parts of well known legends that many people know of today. Have fun trying to find them!"},{"Title":"East","review":"I absolutely loved this book!..

I would recommend this to anyone who loves fairy tails. I'm also interested in reading more of her books. East is a wonderful story full of memorable characters and a great storyline. Do pick it up it is really worth reading. ^_^"},{"Title":"East","review":"The fact that this book has close to 500 pages may be quite daunting, but I have to say it is well worth it. In fact, the only negative thing I can think of about this book is that it ended, and I didn't want it to just yet. Having said that, it is quite obvious that I am in love with everything about this book. I love that it tells an old-fashioned story -- almost like a classic fairy tale. I loved the complex characters; they are empathetic and as multifaceted as characters can get. I could not help but root for each of them. I particularly loved the writing as well; its flow and its pace are both smooth and effortless. It is unique, and never did it seem forced or contrived at all. The details and descriptions are simply perfect; never too much. I also loved the fact that though there were multiple narrators, I didn't feel once confused by them as their voices were very distinct. And like I already mentioned, though this book has 500 pages, not once was I bored.So as not to make this review even longer, I'll just go ahead and give East 5 stars. I highly recommend it to readers of all ages; children, young adult, and even adults. It is one grand story you should not miss."},{"Title":"East","review":"I have read all the books out by Edith Pattou. I have to say my favorite is either this latest one \\"East\\" or \\"Fire Arrow\\". I love the way she portrays the female heroines. They are completely believable: strong, determined yet not without fault. It is easy to identify with them. Her writing has this uncanny quality to me: I know it is fantasy but it seems so utterly believable.As soon as I heard \\"East\\" was coming out I asked for a copy of it for Christmas and read it right away. For the first 70 pages or so I was a little confused with the character point of view switching so quickly but as soon as it settled into the meat of the story I was absolutely drawn in.Edith Pattou is one of very best young adult fantasy writers I have read. The only problem I have is waiting for her next book to be released but I understand that it takes time to create a high quality story and I appreciate all the research and work she does to make each one of her stories so satisfying, unique and beautiful."},{"Title":"East","review":"I have read this book about 8 times and i have to say that i can never get enough of it! its a really great story about a young girl named Rose who is taken from her family by a white bear and is to live with him for two full moon phrases. I absoulty loved this book and recomended for people of all ages!"},{"Title":"East","review":"There are to the best of my knowledge five retellings of East of the Sun, West of the Moon. Dennis L. McKiernan's \\"Once Upon a Winter's Night\\" starts out wonderfully romantic if plagued with purple prose, and devolves into a morass of cliche-ridden quest fantasy. Jessica Day George's \\"Sun and Moon, Ice and Snow\\" is decent but uneven. Nancy Madore's adult take features in an erotic short story collection (yes, I went there). \\"Ice\\" by Sarah Beth Durst is a modern variant, also decent but uneven. \\"East\\" by Edith Pattou is the best version I've read so far, albeit not without faults.First of all, Pattou knows how to take a traditional story and tell it in a very unique way. The book is a series of short chapters told from alternating points of view of heroine Rose, the White Bear, the Troll Queen, Rose's brother Neddy, and Rose's father. The unique perspectives more than make up for the constant point of view shifts. Pattou portrays Rose's family as a loving one. The book is full of subtle but haunting moments that strike a sad chord in the heart. The trolls are fascinating. Rose's interaction with them is heartfelt. I loved the Troll Queen's perspective and wanted to see more of her. There are also some moments of comic relief to lighten the tone (Thor the drunken sailor comes to mind).I wish I had only good things to say about \\"East,\\" but there are glaring missteps here in plenty. The book is so compelling that my inability to entirely connect with it frustrated me. A list of the many things that hit a wrong note:1. The metafiction conceit at the beginning of the book (I found a box in the attic etc.) is confusing and pointless. Is this meant to be a peasant in medieval Norway? A modern narrator discovering a manuscript of ancient diary entries? (How would Rose's and the Troll Queen's diary entries, assuming they wrote any, make it into the same box?) Is the narrator an authorial insert imagining the book as a gift of supernatural inspiration? Now it's just getting silly. There is no context or explanation for the meta- prologue. It never pops up again.2. Charles, the prince, is a younger son of a historical French king--what? We're having trolls abduct the (fictional?) son of a historical figure? Alternate history meets fantasy. Why the fixation with France anyway? McKiernan shifted his setting there, too. What's the logic? The trolls went to France to kidnap slaves, apparently. Why can't we keep this in mythic Scandinavia where, you know, trolls actually live?3. The chapters were too short. While the different POV's were interesting, we never got enough sense of place or character before switching to somebody else's head. The chapters often felt as if they were static, written in passive voice, repeating things we already knew without furthering the narrative.4. Charles. In bear form, he remembers nothing. In prince form, he's drugged into amnesia. Trauma? What's that? It's good to see him interacting positively with the Troll Queen, but if he doesn't remember anything of his enchantment, why is it such a terrible experience? What's at stake here?5. Charles. He and Rose fall instantaneously in love despite the fact that they never speak to each other and sleep at opposite ends of the bed with no interaction whatsoever. I never got a sense of his character. Rose is a strong heroine. Why is he worthy of her love?6. The Troll Queen. There is simply not enough of her. I appreciate Pattou's decision to write a non-traditional, sentimental villain, but if she was going to hint at emotional complexity, she needs to give us more than what we get. The Troll Queen's chapters are usually told in summary not scene, and the extent of her thoughts run along these lines: \\"Soon I shall have my way in all things.\\" Wonderful. Just why does she love the prince so much that she's willing to wait centuries for him, wants to marry him for life and crown him king in one day against the wishes of her people? This is never explained. There's a truly beautiful chapter detailing their first meeting when the prince was a child, but that's all we get.7. The climax and resolution was far too sudden. It was over before it began. Trying not to spoil anything, I wanted to cry over the trolls, yet I get the feeling Pattou was billing it as a happy ending. If it was meant to be bittersweet, she didn't spend enough time on it to draw out all the emotional power she might have.\\"East\\" misses the mark to being the perfect retelling, but the book was fun to read. I recommend it. I would read it again. Prepare to be entranced by the subtleties. You'll be looking at sentences twice, imagining intriguing possibilities only hinted at in the spare prose. Just don't expect a lot of detail, backstory that makes any sense, or deep characterizations. You'll get a little impatient with the book as I did. It's a shame, because the story is a lot more intelligent and morally ambiguous than most YA fantasies out there. Edith Pattou has a solid foundation; she might have delved a little deeper to make her characters truly shine."},{"Title":"East","review":"East is an awesome book, at first I was skeptical because it's 500 pages and I thought I would never finish it.

It's a sweet story with delicious twists, exciting adventures and a heart-wrenching love story... to me, the perfect combination."},{"Title":"East","review":"Here is another book for \\"children\\" that I really enjoyed, and I'm 42. The book moves along at a gripping clip, and Pattou's use of language is stunning at times, and always effective.The story is a good one to begin with, and the retelling adds unique details that justify it very well in becoming a novel.The only real flaw in the book is the similarity of the characters as they take turns narrating. Each chapter is named for a character, and that character then narrates that chapter in the \\"first person.\\" This is a unique approach, and it largely works, but the characters do tend to sound quite similar. Though I was aware of this, it rarely, if ever, bothered me or upset the story.Pattou is very adept at crafting characters in other ways, though, and the major characters in the book are distinct and clearly written.I heartily recommend this book to any lover of fantasy, fairy tale, or just plain good reading."},{"Title":"East","review":"I got this book and figured it would last me my whole two week vacation.

Rose has always wanted to have an adventure and one day she gets her wish when a mysterious white bear appears in her family's home making her an offer that she feels as though she can't refuse. Since her family is poor the bear offers them wealth, a map making opportunity for Rose's father, a man who once trained to be a map maker but had to quit his dreams to raise a family, an apprenticeship for Neddy, Rose's favorite brother who is smart and has determination but not enough money to give him an apprenticeship, and good health back to Rose's eldest sister and in return the bear wants Rose to live with him forever. Rose who is eager for adventure and wants the well being of her family agrees to the deal that has been proposed by the bear, thus embarking on adventures across the sea where she lives with the kind but mysterious bear, traveling to the coldest corners of the Earth to find a long lost prince, and having to outsmart the beautiful yet cold hearted troll queen that wants to marry her prince. This book was written very interestingly giving the reader little portions of each main character's mind and explaining how they feel. It is mostly written from Rose's point of view, but the author keeps it fresh by giving you glimpses of other character's mind. A good story, but it dragged on a bit and could have been about a hundred pages shorter. Overall a good fantasy/adventure with meaningful looks into characters minds. Definitely worth reading if you are a fan of adventure and fantasy from the ages of 12 to 16.Grade: B"},{"Title":"East","review":"Maybe i was too old when i read this, but I've read fairytale retellings that are a lot more complex.

I do recommend this book! :D"},{"Title":"East","review":"I first read \\"East\\" when I was in high school and closer to the target age than I am now (20), but I recently re-read it and it was still good- I could still relate to it. It's based on the Norwegian fairy tale \\"East of the Sun and West of the Moon,\\" my favorite fairy tale since I was about seven and first read the Rainbow Fairy Book by Andrew Lang.Pattou adapted the tale well, I think. It is complex enough that she didn't need to add a lot of extra stuff to flesh out the plot (likeElla Enchanted- a wonderful book, but it's only recognizable as a Cinderella story for about the last fourth).The author's additions to the story were woven in seamlessly and served to answer or explain confusing or vague points in the original story. I thought the idea that a place that is east of the sun and west of the moon must be the North Pole was ingenious. Whoever originally created the tale (I have a theory that it is at least partially based on the Greek myth of Eros and Psyche, but that's a discussion for another time) probably would not have had the same concept of east and west, or of the relationship between the earth, the moon, and the sun as we have now. Although, you never know; I think we often don't give past societies as much credit as they deserve. But I'm getting off topic again.\\"East\\" is an engrossing read, and the fantasy elements kind of sneak up on you so subtly that you don't even blink at the mention of a talking bear. It is utterly, for lack of a better word, believable. In casting this enchantment, it helped that I was listening to the second disc of theMarie Antoinettesoundtrack, especially the parts in the castle-in-the-mountain and the ice palace. I strongly recommend it, even for adults. Especially for adults who could use a little more magic."},{"Title":"East","review":"My daughter really enjoyed this book.

He takes her to his castle where after awhile he is taken by the Troll Queen and he turns into a man. Rose goes to search for home and she has to be a servant and has to endure the trolls to try to rescue him from the evil Troll Queen.I like the book a lot. I liked it because it has adventure and fantasy. I think this book is good fro girls the ages of 11-13."},{"Title":"East","review":"I remember passing this book so much in the library. Mainly the cover, with a girl and a polar bear, which seemed like a animal book. But one day I picked it up, quite surprised that is was a Beauty and the Beast retelling.The story is told in 5 points of views just to let you know. It starts out with a man and a woman having another child. The woman believes when she has a child, whichever way they....come out, is a point on a...Compuss. (spelling?) When she has her youngest daughter Rose, she is horrfied to learn she was born in the east. The East point is said to hold Death. The mother picks another sign on the compuss(sp?) which is a little more...calmer. But as her daughter Rose grows up, she becomes quite the adventurer. One night, she is saved by a huge white polar bear. Her oldest brother sees, this and takes this into memory.Many years later, the family is in need for money. All of a sudden, the polar bear comes in and says that if Rose comes with him to his home, luck will come onto the family. At the same time, when of the sisters has taken ill, and can be cured, says the polar bear. Rose agrees, and goes with him.With many plot twists, East is a great read for any age. But what about faults? Why there are some faults in this book.Romance is lacking. Yes, the romance is there in a sense, but this book is not a great 'romance' book. Rose at first in the home of the polar bear, is scared and hates him. Over time she takes a liking to him. In one of the plot twists, Rose's feelings for the polar bear are brought out more. But I wish I could have felt the Polar Bears love for Rose a bit more.Speaking of the polar bear, His character should have been fleshed out a bit more. When he (spolier) becomes a prince, he lacks any personailty. It was hard to ever like him when he became a prince.East is a great retelling of Beauty and the Beast, but is also a retelling of a folk tale, East of the sun and moon.What is interesting, is that there is a movie that was made in the late 90's which you can get. You can find it herem on amazon! It's called The Polar Bear King. it is only on VHS though."},{"Title":"East","review":"In my mind, no book should be rated 5 stars. Every worthwhile work of fiction has flaws, and East is no exception.Don't get me wrong; I loved \\"East.\\" The plot is interesting and, unlike \\"Eragon,\\" which received more attention, the plot twists of \\"East\\" do not feel forced. They occur as natural parts of the story.The only part where \\"East\\" fails is Pattou's use of the different characters in the book to tell different parts of the story. In the afterword, she admits this was a difficult part of her writing process. Unfortunately, it is also a difficult part of the reading process. Many times I was left scratching my head and trying to figure out what on earth had just happened.East is definitely worth your while as an exceptional work of literature. It makes a great read-aloud book."},{"Title":"East","review":"I love a good fairy tale. In East, Edith Pattou creates a unique retelling of Beauty and the Beast that is imaginative -- and addictive. I honestly couldn't put this book down. It's shelved young adult, but its written in a way that readers of all ages should enjoy."},{"Title":"East","review":"Edith Pattou's East was an enthralling read. The story is told from changing character's point of view in each chapter. In this fairy tale, a child's future can be foretold by the direction they were born. The mother swears that her daughter is an East child (complacent), but really she was born facing North, meaning she will be a wanderer. Very soon the daughter meets a talking, magical polar bear, who promises to make the family rich if they give their daughter to him. The girl decides for the family, leaps onto his back, and they travel very far away to a magic, luxury-filled cave. The young girl tries to figure out who the mysterious polar bear really is, and battles against an ice queen. Great adventure! It's a fascinating retelling of a Nordic fairy tale. One reviewer likened it to Beauty and the Beast, and I would agree. No sex in this tale.See her other books, too,Hero's Song: The First Song of Eirren,Fire Arrow: The Second Song of Eirren: medieval adventure tales similar to Lord of the Rings. Fight evil, complete tasks, female archer!If you're interested in more adventure tales about young adults, teens and tweens, please read my recommendations on my blog.

Rose, the youngest child in a family headed by a poor mapmaker and his superstitious wife. Before Rose was born, the mapmaker's wife had heard a prophecy that if she had a north-born child, it would die under an avalanche of snow and ice. Rose was a north-born, but that identity was concealed from her until a white bear came knocking on the family's door one night. The white bear wanted Rose. He promised the family good fortune if they let him take Rose in one week. About halfway through the week, Rose overheard her mother and father arguing about who she really was. That was when she found out that she was north-born and not a south-born like her mother had told her. Having known this, she fled into a forest that bordered their farm. Her brother, Neddy, came to find her and saw that, in her anger, she had torn up the cloak that she had spent the whole summer weaving on the neighbor's loom. At the end of the week, the white bear came back and Rose left with him. Pattou adds suspense as the pair travel through forests, fields, and oceans. Rose still can't figure out where they are going, or what will happen once they get there. The suspense ends when Rose and the white bear come to a jagged rock face. The cliff suddenly opens and reveals an entrance hall to a magnificent castle. It is cared for by a servant, Urda, and her son, Tuki. Rose is fed and shown to her bedroom. Through exploring the castle, Rose finds a room with a loom and a vast supply of threads and fabric. She then spends hours weaving in the room.The day after Rose left with the white bear, the landlord of the farm visited them and brought great fortune, Before Rose left, the family was going to be evicted from the farm that they lived on, but on the day before they had to leave, the landlord came to visit and helped their father start his own mapmaking business.Since Rose first got to the castle, she had a nighttime visitor that slept on the other side of her huge bed. When the year was almost up, she had plucked up enough courage to light a candle and look at her nighttime visitor. (Here is another spot where Edith Pattou demonstrates good suspense) She was just about to blow the candle out and go back to bed when she spilled wax one the young man that was her nighttime visitor. The boy wakes up with a start just as a magnificent sleigh with what looks to be a troll who snatches up the boy and speeds off into the night. Rose is left standing in the cold snow in her night gown. Then she embarks on a journey to save the boy who was the white bear. Along the way she meets many people that help her on her journey. Once she gets to the troll land, Huldre, she blends in with the soft-skins (humans) that are enslaved by the trolls. She finds out that the boy that was the white bear is to be married to the troll queen. Rose sneaks into the wedding and at the sight of her, the boy who was the white bear remembers who she is. To find out the rest you have to read the book.Edith Pattou's East uses many literary elements in his novel like suspense, imagery, and personification. Therefore, I would highly recommend east to readers who like fantasy."},{"Title":"East","review":"When I was a little kid,one of my favorite fairy tales was East of the Sun and West of the Moon,so I was thrilled to find a retelling of it in the library.I started reading it the moment I got home,and almost immeidietly I was sucked in.The style the novel in written in is interesting-multiple first-person POVs-something I haven't seen since Elizabeth Kerner.This story is a tapestry,colorful and intruiging.I found it to be both fresh and unique."},{"Title":"East","review":"this was a refreshing version of the east of the sun, west of the moon story. i found the characters to be well composed and believable. in other variations of this story, the mother has been portrayed as evil or as hating the daughter, as happens with so many mothers in fairy tales, but in this version the mother's actions were explained and even after she did what she did she showed remorse, and the birth direction thing, almost like a horoscope, was used very effectively in explaining the mother's passionate reactions, as she followed it like a religion.the main character, rose, was well done. she was a 'north born' which means she's high strung and likes to travel. i think the author did a god job in constructing her character as that personality is very much what one would expect of the heroine of this story. this personality type also explained why she would go off to help the guy. in some reviews of this book people commented that the platonic relationship lessened the connection between the main characters and while i agree with this to some extent, i also feel that for the characters to have had sex would mean something different in today's society. in antiquity women were seen as more connected to the body, but in reality would you go running off to save someone just because they had sex with you? probably not, its the relationship. and while sex enhances the relationship, rose didn't know who the man was and only later made the connection that he was the bear. so while i believe that if crafted properly, the sexual aspect of the story would deepen the connection between the two, i think that the way the story was portrayed here doesn't leave much wanting.overall, worthwhile read."},{"Title":"East","review":"East is an extraordinary book that contains meaningful life lessons. East is about a 15yr. old girl named Rose who ends up going on an extraordinary adventure throught the frozen tundra to help the so-called polar bear. The 3 main lessons stated in the book are to never lie, to always keep your promises, and to do what you know is right. I give this book a 4 star rating for many reasons but mainly because I learned and liked the book at the same time, which is hard to find. The book also had a great story and an adventurous ending too. I believe that many people would enjoy this book but mostly people that like fantasy, fiction, and adventure, and people who just like to read a good book. Poeple who also like the book, The Golden Compass would like the book East as well. These books are alike in many ways, but mainly the books take place in or around the same region, they both are about adventures including polar bears, and are fantasy books. The books are also different, like East is about an adventure to help a polar bear, as The Golden Compass is about a girl on an adventure with a polar bear to find a golden compass."},{"Title":"East","review":"My 11 year old son and I just finished reading East last night. At 500 pages, it took us many evenings of reading aloud, but it was a story we thoroughly enjoyed from cover to cover. Despite the fact that the book features a young girl as the heroine, there is plenty to keep the interest of a young boy as well. Mythology, the high seas, an incredible account of a wrenching journey, a family tragedy, and more. Loved it."},{"Title":"East","review":"Are you getting tired of the girl-meets-talking-bear theme yet? Yeah, me neither. This was a terrific novel that wove in elements of Nordic mythology and fantasy together with a strong heroine and compelling story.

This would be a great book to curl up with on a cold, snowy day."},{"Title":"East","review":"This is verbatim from my 11 year old daughter: \\"I loved this book. It kept me captivated and wanting more. Great adventure book with fantasy mixed in.

If you are, East is great book for you. Who says you can't judge a book by its cover? This great fantasy novel by Edith Pattou holds you from the mysterious front cover to the last suspense filled page. This book is set in the North Pole where Rose is a young teen who sets out on an unknown journey with a mysterious \\"white bear.\\" Her only reason to trust him is that he promises to make her sister better. When Rose begins living in a castle with the white bear and mysterious servants, she is shocked to find out he is under a curse.

The only downside of this book is that it is rather long (about 500 pages) although it is an easy read. So if you're ever in need of a book that will keep you holding your breath until its very last page, East is definitely the book for you."},{"Title":"East","review":"As a K-6 librarian I am always looking for new authors to recommend to students.

Combining elements of Beauty and the Beast, Norse mythology, and East of the Sun, West of the Moon, Pattou tells an enchanting story of Rose and the Great White Bear. The story is told from several \\"voices\\" as not only Rose and the Bear tell the story but also her brother Neddy, the Troll Queen, and Rose's father. A definite \\"good read.\\""},{"Title":"East","review":"I will not bother to write a synopsis on this beloved book, as there are amazing reviews that shall tell you already. However, I shall try my best to list the reasons I give this a full 5 (if I could... a 10) stars.The writing is fantastic. It is simple, polished, refined and almost lyrical if I may add. The writer's voice comes out wonderfully and is simply refreshing. Must I add the originality of the retelling? The idea of compasses, maps, etc. is phenomenal. I never knew that geography would be delightful (as I dreaded trudging through world geography class).The characters, oh my goodness. The writing and plot was astounding, but the characters were such a breath of fresh air. I simply love main/supporting three-dimensional characters that are realistic and do not have a full-fledged black-and-white mindset (although Mother came close to it). I found a reason to love every one of the main/supporting characters. Rose is one of the most likeable heroines in my opinion because she is one of the few lately in the ever-growing fantasy genre realm that is practical and logical and realistic. She is quite mature for her age, but considering her circumstances in the novel, it is understandable. Also, the White Bear's character is such a sweet relief from the typical sexy love interests with mysterious dark pasts because he's mostly... a real young man frozen in time (almost one because he's a White Bear to begin with).The romance might not be to the general audience's liking because this novel has NO KISSING whatsoever in it, or any action that follows up with it. This novel shows relationship and character growth in a beautiful manner, true love so to speak.All in all, I would recommend it to all ages because this is a beautiful book, I cannot stress it enough how much I love it. Also one should definitely give this a try because it is a relieving breath of fresh air that you would most likely need from this hectic world we live in. Originality in a retelling at one of its finest."},{"Title":"East","review":"This is an excellent piece of young adult fiction in the fantasy genre. What I liked most about it was the way that it reversed traditional gender stereotypes. In the typical fantasy/fairy tale, a young maiden/princess/girl is placed under a powerful enchantment and the young man/prince/knight must prove he is worthy and rescue her. Here, the enchantment was placed on the boy and Rose decides that she must rescue him. Rose is a great character, honorable and strong and decisive. She decides she is under an obligation to try to rescue the white bear/man even though she barely knows him and has no real knowledge of who enchanted him, where he is being held or what it will take to rescue him. She is one of the best female characters I've seen in fiction (particularly young adult fiction) in a long time."},{"Title":"East","review":"In the book East by Edith Pattou Ebba Rose is the last born to replace her dead sister. Her mom Eugenia is hiding the fact that Ebba's real name is Nyamh and that she is a north-bairn (northern born) not an east bairn (eastern born).\\"Eugenia, she is no east child. You and I both know it.\\" says father \\"Nyamh?\\" There was a pause. \\"She is not Nyamh, She is Ebba rose.\\" \\"Nyamh begins with an N not an E.\\"(80)Nyamh goes through many conflicts including herself almost drowning when she was a very young toddler, being a part of a poor family with barely anything but some food they can make into a broth of some sort, they have to give up their (near dead) horse, and potentially their farm that they have lived in for many years. But one night a bear comes in and changes their lives forever.I like this book because there is constant suspense and very detailed sentences. Edith Pattou helped me envision what was going on in the story, I actually felt like I was listening to the horrifying screeches, pangs and yelps of the instrument she was playing whether it was a violin, piano, or recorder. You could feel the curiosity as she walks in the corridors and explores the various rooms. Edith Pattou has a very curious mind and has put quite the imagination and determination that can be found in this book. I give this book five stars. By Cassidie Jones"},{"Title":"East","review":"What a fantastic book! I've probably read it three or four times already. The plot and characters really reach out to me and I was immediately pulled into Rose's world.While I was reading, I was very pleased and stunned to figure out the troll language. The language, in fact, is Finnish. Since I speak Finnish, I was able to find a few errors in the author's writing, but it didn't really bother me. I've just been wondering if anyone else noticed that.All in all, though, this was an amazing book!"},{"Title":"East","review":"East is a wonderful tale. Somewhat of a 'Beauty and the Beast'. I had seen the cover many times, and finally bought it at Borders with a gift card I'd recieved for my 14th birthday. The book is very slow moving in the beginning, but I love the quickened pace as the book draws to a close. It's written in a style I've never experienced before, the story told from 5 different viewpoints. I'm not saying it was a bad style, I quite enjoyed it, but I was very confused for the first three 'chapters' and had to return to read them again once I realized the three people were telling the same story! But, all in all, this book is an amazing fairy-tale."},{"Title":"East","review":"This book was absolutely wonderful! I remember picking it up at the school library. It was the beautifully painted cover that drew me in - and the story did not dissapoint! The characters were well written and avoided cliches so often found in fairy tale retellings. And the settings were amazing. I've always loved the Norse culture, and Rose's family life is full of that. The book is so well thought out, and I recommend it to anyone who lives \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" or just fantasy in general."},{"Title":"East","review":"This is a wonderful book based on the Norway version of Beauty and the Beast. It is the story of Ebba Rose and her family, a family that inludes six other brothers and sisters, a mapmaking father, and a highly superstitious mother with a secret to hide... They all live in the old Norway countryside working as poor farmers who barely have enough to get by. Then, disaster strikes when Sara, the third eldest child, becomes deathly sick. The family dispairs of ever nursing the girl back to health when, one night, a talking white bear darkens their doorway and claims that he will make Sara well again and give them the life of wealth and ease that they've always dreamed of. But, in return their youngest daughter,Rose, will have to leave her family to live with him. Seemingly forever. Rose, unlike her family, has always dreamed of an adventure. Mainly, to travel the world. She accepts the bear's offer to give up the life and family she's always known and loved to save her sister. Thus beginning a fantastic journey when she travels to a castle embedded into a mountain. While there she comes to know possibly love the white bear she has come to live with. But all is not as it seems. As you might have guessed the white bear is truly a man imprisoned to take on the form of a white bear durning the day but is changed back into a man at night. In order to break the curse put on him by a cruel but beautiful creature and her father he must have a maiden live with him for one year, of her own free will of course, who never sets eyes upon his human face. And if he can't? He will have to marry the creature who put this curse on him in the first place. But before the year is up Rose DOES look upon his face one night and the man who she had come to know and understand is suddenly ripped from her without a trace. The only clue he tells her before he disapears is that he is going to place she can never follow him to. A place East o' the Sun, West o' the Moon. So Rose must travel to the ends of the Earth to rescue this man she's only known for so little a time and to set things right. This book was absoulutely amazing and was the first Beauty and the Beast Retellling for young adults I read and was hooked. The author Edith Pattou uses an interesting narrating approach: ever chapter is narrated by a different character. Some people have found this confusing or boring because sometimes it's different characters narrarating the same event but I've found it very refreshing. It shows the different reactions and feelings that different characters have. The thing I enjoyed best about it was it showed how both Beauty and the Beast are feeling about the trials that fate has thrown them. We all know the old story of Beauty and the Beast but I've always found that the ending isn't the most important part of the story but the middle, because the middle is where the characters really find themselves and where authors can really breathe new life into old characters and that is exactly what Pattou does. Wonderful."},{"Title":"East","review":"This book was about a young girl who lives in a family with a mother that believes in way to much superstitions.

I think I started reading it during my last class of the day and didn't stop except to drive home and eat dinner until I finished it late into the night. I have read it multiple times since then and it never loses it's charm. It is such a different type of story and romance than most stories out there and I think that is why I love it so much.

The whole theme of the book was just amazing! I love retellings of fairy tales, though I have never read the original. I'm having fond memories of being curled up in the library, reading this for maybe three hours. I only took one break, and that was to get a glass of water. I like Rose's motivation--most characters don't have much of one. I felt her anger at the lie she seemed to live for all those years. I saw her mother's motivation for wanting to keep her close, and I feel I have much in common with Rose, though if I had to classify myself, I'd think Northeast. Anyway, since this isn't about me, I want to say something about the prophecy, which came true in a way.I liked pretty much everything about this book, except Thor. That's just me, though. The characters were multidimensional, not just descriptions on thin paper. Next time I visit family, I'll loan this (grudgingly) to my cousins. I hope it becomes a classic that is remembered by many. (It'll then be a classic I'll be happy to read again and again, unlike the ones gathering dust on my shelf) However much it's listed for, I suggest you buy it and share it with almost everyone in your family!Thanks for reading my review!~Harpingonforever"},{"Title":"East","review":"I'm on a big fairy-tale-retellings kick, and this is far and away my favorite.

I did NOT want to put it down, but at 500 pages, I was forced to occasionally.East is very loosely based on East of the Sun, West of the Moon. The author has a very thin outline of the original, but she fills in most of the details herself. This is definitely how I prefer my fairy tale re-tellings! I especially love how she portrays the trolls. She added her own little twist on most of the characters.When I first started reading it, I was very briefly hesitate about liking the writing style. The chapters alternate between Rose, Neddy(her brother), Rose's Father, The Troll Queen, and the White Bear. It almost came off like a reality show interview initially. Don't let that turn you off, though, because after a few chapters, I quickly realized how much I liked this method. I enjoyed getting the different viewpoints of what was happening, especially with The Troll Queen! I think it was an amazing way to fill in all the little extra details I otherwise wouldn't have known.East is most definitely going on my keeper shelf!"},{"Title":"East","review":"EAST is the tale of Rose, who sacrifices her freedom to save her sister, grows to care for the cursed white bear who is her \\"captor,\\" unwittingly betrays him, then goes beyond the ends of the earth to make things right. It's a classic folktale that never fails to move me, but Edith Pattou's retelling of \\"East of the Sun, West of the Moon\\" went above and beyond, astounding me with its magical rendering of a traditional story and simple literary elements.EAST is not extraordinarily sophisticated in writing style: narration alters between several different voices, and none of them particularly stand out as individual examples of great literariness. However, the magic of EAST lies in how these common elements--straightforward prose, a retelling--fit together. The multiple narrators adds a unique rhythm and scope to the story that makes the whole so much more than the sum of its parts.Edith Pattou sets EAST in historical Europe, and the story traverses lands, cultures, seas, and languages for an astonishing and engrossing read. This is the second retelling of \\"East of the Sun, West of the Moon\\" that I've had the pleasure of reading, and I'm astonished at the different directions in which each author took this folktale. I'm no history buff, but I was mesmerized by Edith Pattou's description of the various people that Rose meets on her journey, by the variety of people and cultures that existed over great distances at the same time.Words fail me when I try to describe an extraordinary book; indeed, there is no part of this book that was not amazing, and thus there is no part that I can describe well. There is a reason I still see this book in bookstores: it has the rare lasting power that only the most accomplished of fantasy reads possess."},{"Title":"East","review":"While reading this (long stretched) fairytale, I was surprised by how the author switched from person to person. From my point of view it might have seemed annoying, but once I got to thinking about it I realized it must have been a challenge for Edith Pattou to do it that way. When someone does right like this (switching from person to person) you always have to make sure that the chapters are lined up correctly so nothing sounds strange or out of place.This is a very interesting book (and that is all I have to say)."},{"Title":"East","review":"This is a retelling of East of the Sun and West of the Moon. To readers unfamiliar with the Norwegian fairy tale, think of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" with an extra adventure tacked on to the end. (The main character is even named Rose.)I'll discuss Pattou's version at the end, but the bare bones of the fairy tale goes something like this: In exchange for her family's future well being, the youngest daughter offers to live with a bear in a distant castle, whom she suspects to be a prince under a spell. On a visit home (this is a very gentle confinement: our heroine has servants, good food, and can visit her parents if she promises to return), her mother and sisters question her easy acceptance of everything (rightly so, in my opinion) but can not convince her to stay home and forget the bear.Here is where the story diverges from Beauty and the Beast. Finally, the girl's mother and sisters convince her that her situation is weird, to say the least. They tell her to sneak up on the bear after dark with a candle and see if, as she suspects, he really does turn into a man at night. Our heroine agrees with predictable results: the bear's human form is very nice but she spills wax on his shirt and wakes him up.The bear's response is one of the things I've never understood about the fairy tale. Shortly put, \\"You've ruined everything, now I have to marry a troll and it's all your fault! Bye.\\" When pressed for details, the bear (now in human form) explains about the spell and says if she had waited only one night more, it would have been broken. Now, of course, he has to marry the Troll Queen. He leaves wearing nothing but the night shirt with wax stain, but before he does, he mentions that the troll kingdom lies \\"east of the sun and west of the moon.\\"This is very helpful and our heroine sets out immediately to rescue the bear. She has many adventures and finally hitches rides with the west wind and his brother the north wind to get to the Troll palace. After some more adventures, she rescues the prince (with no help from him), kills the queen, and destroys the palace, but not before rescuing some travelers waiting to be eaten. They return home (somehow), The prince formerly known as the bear marries her, and they live happily ever after.*********************************************************What makes Pattou's version interesting:Pattou brings the stock characters of the tale to life and creates backgrounds and motivations for everyone Rose meets, from her family to the Queen to the new patron who helps her family after she leaves with the bear. The book is narrated by several different characters in turn, making for a facinating read. The bear's chapters, for instance, are told in poems.The best part, though, was finding out how Pattou incorporated all of the unanswered questions of the original tale in. Why did Rose and her family first agree to let her go but later wanted her to stay? Who was the prince and how could he go missing without anyone caring? Why was the Bear living all alone in his house? What did Rose do with herself there? How does Rose find the troll palace? How does she get home? How can you ride on the back of the West Wind? What kind of troll would want to marry a human? Why would a queen willing to wait a hundred years to marry a man agree to let Rose have one more shot at him when she's already won?If you liked \\"Wicked\\" by Gregory Maguire, you'll like the Troll Queen. She hates that her hands are so rough compared to a human's skin and doesn't understand why the rules of her land say she can't marry whom she likes but must allow a human girl a chance at her prince.My only criticism of this book is that it ends so abruptly. I understand the the book is nearly 500 pages long, but I would have liked a longer chapter about the trip home and what happens to her family."},{"Title":"East","review":"Ebba Rose - known simply as Rose to her family and friends - was different from the day she was born.

So, one evening, when an enormous white bear appears at Rose's home, asking the teenager to accompany it on a journey to a magical castle in the woods, in exchange for her sister's health, and wealth for her family, Rose accepts the invitation - much to her family's chagrin - and travels the long distance atop the bear's back, to an empty castle, where, each night, a mysterious stranger joins her each night. But when Rose discovers the stranger's identity, she realizes that her journey has only just begun, and that she is destined for even more adventure.I was instantly attracted to EAST by its wonderful cover illustration, but when I read the back cover, the promise of adventure sealed the deal, and I purchased the book. I think it was one of the best decisions regarding literature I have ever made. EAST reminds you greatly of the story BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, though it is truly based on the fairytale EAST OF THE SUN, WEST OF THE MOON. Rose is an exciting heroine, who takes her daily life in the castle in stride; and the other characters dappled throughout the tale, from Rose's immediate family, to various evils lurking, and a few kind souls, all add to the stories pace, and keep the reader on the edge of their seat. Written in differentiating viewpoints by Rose, her father, older brother Neddy, the Troll Queen, and the White Bear, EAST is a story that will be eaten up by all who love a great fantasy novel. An epic novel that cannot be missed.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"East","review":"Contrary to what most of the reviewers seem to think, I really enjoyed the book. I love the way Pattou lets us see through the Troll Queen's eyes as well, and thus, she becomes less of a villain, and more of a character you can sympathize with, while recognizing she was wrong. It was great how Pattou put little snippets of the bear-man's memories in the beginning and then we get to see how it all ties together.A lot of people don't seem to have picked this up, but I felt this was a compilation of three fairy tales: East of the Sun and West of the Moon [which I've always wanted to read, but haven't had a chance to yet], Beauty and the Beast, but also, Psyche and Eros, the greek myth in which a young girl is whisked away to live unknowingly with the goddess of love's son, Eros, who's been smitten with her through his own arrow. The girl becomes curious and gazes upon his face one night and as the hot wax drips on the young god and wakes him, all is thrown into turmoil.Anyhow, I liked East, and I would recommend reading the Psyche and Eros myth as well. I'm sure the link is quite obvious."},{"Title":"East","review":"\\"East\\" is Edith Pattou's retold and fleshed-out retelling of the folktale \\"East O' the Sun and West O' the Moon\\", a tale that most cultures and countries have incorporated into their mythology throughout history. Motifs such as the animalistic husband, the vengeful sorceress, an interfering mother who gives dangerous advice, the taboo upon seeing the mystery-man's face, the task that only the \\"true bride\\" can perform, and the young woman's quest to reclaim her husband can be found in everything from the Greek/Roman \\"Cupid and Psyche\\" to France's \\"Beauty and the Beast.\\" Details change in every version, but the core of the tale is the same each time.Edith Pattou uses the Norwegian version as her template, which has the prince changed into a polar bear through the designs of an enamoured troll-queen. In order to break the curse the bear must take a human companion, who is forbidden to see his face for an entire year. Of course, the young heroine Rose breaks this rule; she must do this of course, or else the reader would be deprived of the quest to undo her wrong and save her beloved.Pattou puts her personal slant on the tale by adding in the superstition concerning \\"birth-direction.\\" Rose's mother Eugenia lives strictly in the belief that the direction in which an infant is brought into the world has a bearing on the personality and fate of that child. She plans to have only seven children, one for each direction (beginning at north-east and ending at north-west), and missing out on the final compass point: north. The reason for this is that north-born children are wild and reckless, liable to go wandering far and wide. But when her east-born daughter (east-borns being the most sturdy and reliable characters) dies, Eugenia bears another child to take her place. But you guessed it, Rose is a north-born child and so struck with wanderlust.From here come the typical elements of any fairytale: Rose is a free spirit and comes into contact with a strange white bear, who offers the family wealth in exchange for their youngest daughter. With another child deathly ill and the family set for eviction from their home, Rose takes up the bear's offer and is carried to his underground mountain home. Here she keeps company with the bear and his two strange servants, and each night is visited by an unseen bed-fellow that is gone before the morning light. Curiosity gets the best of her, and with the aid of an ill-favoured gift from her mother, she steals a glance at the person beside her...resulting in him being whisked away by the troll-queen. Needless to say, Rose heads off on a rescue mission.Pattou saves us from a dull, predictable retelling by telling the story through the points of view of several characters. Thus the tale is told in first-person narrative by Rose, the white bear, the troll-queen, Rose's father and Rose's brother Neddy throughout the book, forming a story that must be pieced together from several different lives and viewpoints. Perhaps most interesting of all is Pattou's take on the troll-queen; not just a vicious creature out for power, but someone who genuinely loves the bewitched young man for himself alone. Likewise, her young heroine Rose is a fine example of a strong, realistic protagonist, who has to *work* for her heart's desire.However, there are some elements that simply don't work. Often the narrative is plodding and inevitably predictable, and the fairytale plot element in which Rose and the troll-queen were forced to test their sincerity by attempting to remove a stain from the young man's shirt was handled awkwardly and confusingly. The fate of the troll-queen and the ice-palace was quite abrupt, and if one reads carefully, the turning point of the story (when Rose looks at the young man's face) doesn't make a lot of sense. The conditions of the bear's curse are that he mustn't let anyone see his human face. And since he and Rose are not married (his nocturnal visits are strictly rated G), then why does he even sleep in the same bed with her in the first place? In the original folktales, the man and woman are wed, and thus have a very good reason to share a bed, but without this rather crucial plot development both the bear's and Rose's actions before and after the event have no reason to them. Pattou's desire to draw out the love-story, with marriage at its end rather than at its middle makes it somewhat unconvincing overall.Yet despite this, \\"East\\" is still a fine example of a well structured and re-interpreted folktale. The old myths and legends of the world are always fascinating, and therefore in the hands of an adept author nothing major can go wrong."},{"Title":"East","review":"I was shocked and appalled to see some of the reviews this deliciously chilly book has received. True, the point of view changes, but I never had any trouble following or being bored by the story. Pattou's prose is crisp and clean, but still evocative. The story is set in a Nordic landscape, but the tale is still heartwarming, and in some instances, heartbreaking.This is one of those books that you finish all giddy and exhilirated. You know, the kind that stops time and pokes at all the shivery places in your soul."},{"Title":"East","review":"This classic fairy tale, intertwined with the story of Beauty and the Beast, is a truly heartwarming tale. Weaving through the minds of four characters, we get a true narrative from different sides of the story. I am not normally a fan of multiple narratives, but Edith Pattou is brilliant at capturing your attention through this technique.It all begins with the birth of Ebba Rose. Lies encircle her birth for the sake of her mother's superstitious need to protect Rose...from her true destiny.As it turns out, covering over Rose's birth does not stop the lies from unfolding and her true destiny being played out. A White Bear offers to exchange good fortune for Rose's family in return for Rose herself. As it turns out, she leaves with the white bear and a whole new adventure begins.POSITIVE POINTS: Very cozy and adventuresome. I highly enjoyed the use of descriptives and emotions. Pattou did an excellent job at recreating the feeling of a true (classic) fairy tale.NEGATIVE POINTS: The only reason I gave this book four stars instead of five is because there wasn't much development in friendship between the bear and Rose. At least not much that I could see. And I felt that it could have been better if Edith Pattou had chosen to do it all from the viewpoint of Rose-even though she still did an excellent job at the multiple viewpoints.RECOMMENDED? Definitely!!!AGE RATING: [G] All ages. There were no crude or sexual references. The farthest point the characters get to is holding hands. :DREAD WITH: Ice cream. ;) I'd choose peppermint. If you like listening to music while you read, I suggest something with bells and harps. Or classical twists."},{"Title":"East","review":"I was disapointed by East. My number one reason being that i never felt any connection between Rose and \\"The Man who was a White Bear\\". The person with the most emotion in the book was Rose's brother Neddy, not the girl who was treking the globe in a search to find her lost \\"friend\\" who seemed to forget her a bit to easily if you ask me, slank or no slank. Not to mention there just always seemed to be to easy a solution at hand for every problem. I mean, sure there always has to be SOME solution but the way she got into the Ice Palace? *shrugs*. The story definately had it's good points. It was a breeze to read once you started it, and the journey itself was exciting (i loved Malmo the most)."},{"Title":"East","review":"East is one of many books targeted toward teens that reimagines a well-known fairy tale that can either make or brake. While many authors tend to stray away from the material, East has done an excellent job of recreating the Norwegian tale \\"East to the Sun, West of the Moon\\" and creating a worthy fantasy novel that anyone can deeply enjoy.The novel tells the tale of a young teen named Rose who is the youngest child of a farming couple. Her mother is extremely superstitious, sighting that all of her children must be born within the compass range (she believes that the points of a compass determain the personalities of her family). When she gives birth to Rose, she is shocked to discover that her daughter is a \\"North\\" born (North children are restless and explorers by nature). Fearing that her daughter will die a premature death, Rose's mother sites that her daughter is an \\"East\\" born and attempts to raise her as a quiet, patient girl.But when a white bear arrives at the family farm years later (admit a string of unforunate events, including a seriously ill family member), he requests that Rose must travel with him to his castle. After arguing with her mother and father, Rose decides to take the bear's offer and goes to his castle, where she discovers a terrible secret about the bear and ultimately begins her journey of self-discovery and purpose.East is told in a varity of voices, including Rose herself and of the white bear. Many pervious reviewers have complained that this makes the overall pace of the book choppy. I disagree. The various narrators is what gives the novel it's character. It makes the whole reading experience rewarding and provides a wide-range scope on the events that lead up to the ending (which, as many before me have stated, is predicable). Plus, each narrator is very descriptive of thier enviroments and makes the reader engaged in the material. You want to keep reading on what will happen next to Rose and the other characters!I cannot find anything wrong with this novel (except for the ending, but this is a fairy tale after all; every fairy tale traditonally has a happy ending). If you want a novel that will keep you enterained through a long winter (or a boring summer vacation), East is the book for you!"},{"Title":"East","review":"Me being a fantasy/adventure lover, the book \\"East\\" really perked my interest. The author, Edith Pattou, also known for \\"Hero's Song\\" and \\"Fire Arrow\\", did fantastic on this book. She made me feel like I was right there with Rose, traveling the barren ice lands of Norway.5 viewpoints make up the book and make it that more interesting. The 3 main viewpoints are that of Rose, who recounts her adventures, Father, who tells of his worries for his youngest daughter and Neddy, who tells of how the farm is doing and how much he fears for Rose's life. The 2 other viewpoints belong to the large white bear, whose entries are mostly in the form of a poem, and the evil Troll Queen, who tells of her past and her lusts.Rose's journey is the whole reason why you keep flipping the pages. Being the youngest daughter, born to replace her dead sister, She never could keep her feet in one place for long, to the dismay of her mother. When she was born with deep, clear, and rich purple eyes and brown hair the color of chestnuts, her family knew she would be different.Neddy, Roses older brother Always knew rose was different than the rest of the 7 children, he included. He always thought of himself as Rose's guardian, so he was very protective of her. He too, was born with chestnut hair, so he could relate with her a little bit. They were both the only brunettes in a family of blondes. In spite of this, he leaves his sister to her journey, to go to Oslo to become a scholar.The whole story, regardless of the viewpoints, is centered on Rose and the white bear. When Sarah falls deathly ill, and is close to death, the white bear comes into the picture and promises to help, but with a price. The family must give him their youngest daughter rose. Father is very hesitant to this, but rose dives at the chance for Sarah getting well and soon finds herself riding on the broad back of the white bear, to a distant and empty castle. The story doesn't end there when a mysterious stranger is visiting Rose at night. When finding out his identity, she loses everything she loved, but also finds her purpose.This book is one of the best I've ever read and would give it 5 stars easily, but it deserves 10! I would recommend this book to those who loved beauty and the beast and the story of east of the moon, west of the sun. And I would also recommend it to all fantasy and adventure lovers alike. Edith Pattou really outdid her self this time.-Amanda D. 12"},{"Title":"East","review":"Well written.

The youngest daughter, Rose, is intended to replace the \\"East\\" child that has died, but she is born facing North, to the dismay of Eugenia. It is prophesized that the North born child will travel far away and be lost in the snow.Rose's sister falls ill, and a white bear appears. To save the girl, Rose travels with the white bear to faraway lands to his castle in the mountain. There, she discovers an enchantment and through trials, hardships, and many miles in the Arctic Circle, plays an important role in the white bear's fate.This touching story has elements of Beauty and the Beast. Both women discover the humanity within the beasts and do all they can to save them. There are many narrators, and the most poignant is the white bear who is so lost within himself. He tries to discover who he is, and with Rose's aid, he eventually finds himself. Edith Pattou is good with page-turners in the novel: just when the story is reaching a critical point, the next page has something else. East is heart-warming and magical, and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"East","review":"I always love the 'East of the Sun and West of the Moon' story and was curious to read this one. It turned out like reading a fairytale put into the real world, with places and time in history. It was so amazing :) and the heroine not just win the white bear then married him, happily ever after. This book gave a more believable start, process, climax and ending with help from magic since the cursed bear was born out of magic (the goblin's) too so it was only fair.I only have small problems in reading it. There were some dialog/thought not properly put into a character and they sometimes made me stop for a while to think it over. I also feel the start was kinda slow. But overall, I enjoy this story of Rose and her White Bear, specially about the birth-direction myth.A fairytale came to life :)"},{"Title":"East","review":"Jan. 17 2004A reader from Columbus Ohio.This 494 page book is the best book I have ever read. East is a exciting book and it is a wonderful story. Though it occasionally gets a little bit borring I recommend this book."},{"Title":"East","review":"There is a Norwegian fairy tale, about a prince who is turned in to a white bear by a witch, when he refuses to marry her. He can turn back into a man by night, but no one should see his face, or else, he'll have to marry the witch. He falls in love with a princess of a northern kingdom, and marries her, but when she falls to her curiosity of seeing his face, he's claimed back by the witch. Then the princess must rescue him.Edith Pattou took some of the basic elements of this story, and made an altogether different one. The main character, Rose, is a farmer's daughter who loves weaving almost as much as exploring the world. Pattou adds some new important elements, such as the superstition of the girl's mother, who believes that the nature of every person is determined by the orientation of his/her birth. Although Rose is meant to be born facing East, due to some confusion, happens to be born facing North. Thus, although her mother tries to hide it from her, and make her believe that she is an \\"east girl\\", she cannot deny her true nature. When the White Bear comes to claim her, in return for the health of one of her sisters, she willingly accepts to go with him. The bear takes Rose to a hidden castle in Fransk (France), where she is allowed to weave as much as she likes, and although lonesome, she becomes fond of the bear. When a Troll Queen claims the bear, in very much the way of the original story, Rose embarks in an epic journey into the deep Arktisk (the Arctic), where the Troll kingdom is, in order to rescue him before the wedding.The story is reasonably well written in simple language, in first person, alternatively by Rose, who has the longest chapters, the White Bear, who has the shortest, Rose's father, her brother Neddy, and the Troll Queen. The story is convincingly conveyed, as can be seen in the following excerpt:\\"The farther north we went, the colder it got. Before then I had thought I knew about cold. But the winters in Njord [Norway] were springlike compared to the bitter, lancing cold of that frozen land. It was like a predatory, hovering beast, bent on sucking every bit of heat and life out of a body\\".Although the book is recommended for ages 12 and up, I find the story perfectly appropriate for younger children. It is enjoyable reading that can be enthusiastically recommended to young readers."},{"Title":"East","review":"The heroine saves the hero.Enjoyed this lovely book. Rose is a strong and adventurous young woman."},{"Title":"East","review":"Some of my friends would say I have an unhealthy obsession with books, excpessially after I ditch them to read.

I read it in a few hours and I carried it around for weeks afterwards. I made my friend Mooch read it and I didn't get it back until I had to break out the idle threats. Read it. Now."},{"Title":"East","review":"The only thing about \\"East\\" that I had a problem with was the slightly rushed ending and the extremely notable similarity to other books. Pattou is a good fantasy writer, and this was a pretty difficult tale to tackle. Though it has its flaws, the setting is believable and the circumstances conceivable. It is not overly violent or sexual, just mythical and mysterious.The mother and the father are very real, their personalities conflicting and understandable. The other characters have good traits, though some are a little too odd to be true.The plotline was befuddling at times, and some of the most climactic points would have been easier to understand if they had been told from one character's standpoint. Switching from one character to another every few pages gave me a headache. Plus, the plots, though they interwove beautifully, got confusing because there were too many.A note to all: Do not try and tackle this book for a book report. It is far too confusing, and it would probably take too long to explain it. Also, do not pick this book up if you are incapable of following a plot well. This book has around five, each more confusing than another.This is a wonderful read if you want to be taken into five hundred pages of pure romance, fantasy, and intricate plots. I would recommend it for ages thirteen and over."},{"Title":"East","review":"I read this book for the first time about a month ago, when I should've been concentrating on my school books a little more instead of pleasure reading.

Only thing is, this version is better. I love it when authors take a well known fairy tale and expand upon it, and Edith Pattou has done an excellent job at the expandage. ;)Creatively written from the point of view of several of the characters, this book takes a long time to read because it is so big and thick (almost 500 pages!) and yet at the same time it doesn't take very long because it catches your attention and keeps those pages turning! :)There are some parts where the story line seems to dip and drag a little too slowly and other parts where I wish the author had expanded a wee bit more, but overall, I think she did an awesome job at transforming a well known, traditional fairy tale into a not so traditional novel set in a not so well known place in time, Norway in the first part of the 15th century.If you have a little time (or even if you don't, as in my case) I would definitely recommend you to read \\"East\\"! :)"},{"Title":"East","review":"This fantasy book is a must-read.

Different characters and interesing sub-plots make this a memorable book.Each chapter is from a different person's point of view about what is going on.

I have read plenty of fairy tale retellings before, and their most fascinating points are the ways in which the author takes the tale and add relatable human reasons for the character's actions and fleshes out the world to seem real. East starts out promising, with the idea of cardinal directions and the main character's superstitions, but sadly, the characters are never allowed to transcend the source material and make the story their own.The book is told in various 1st person accounts of Rose (the main character), White Bear (the Prince), Neddy (Rose's brother), Rose's dad, and the Troll Queen (the antagonist). The chapters that make up each point of view change are rather short, and the story comes off as rushed as a result. The characters don't really seem to develop their own voices, which renders the multiple points-of-view pointless, and to add to this, the narrative is told in a very passive manner, leaving out any evocative imagery, dialogue, or settings. We never get any sense of why the pretty girl falls in love with the Prince, or even of her remarkable personality that we are so often reminded of. (In fact, the most well-drawn of the characters is Neddy, her brother.) We never get a real sense of the incredible magic or the horror (of the Prince being under a spell).Without any real defining characteristic, or twists of the tale, the tale sort of runs as an incredibly tepid and drawn out version of the fairy tale. My recommendation: Skip this book, read the original. Or even better, read Psyche and Cupid. Better fairy-tale retellings: Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine, Zel by Donna Jo Napoli, Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister by Gregory Maguire, and Briar Rose by Jane Yolen (just off the top of my head). You can do better!"},{"Title":"East","review":"Edith Pattou shifts from generic Celtic fantasy to an old favorite fairy tale in &quot;East.&quot; It's a retelling of the old &quot;East of the Sun and West of the Moon&quot; story, set in Norway, with insights into plenty of supporting characters (including the villain). While fresh at the start, it goes too fast and too choppily.Rose was an &quot;East&quot; baby (her mom believes that what direction a baby is born facing will determine its personality). Or so she thought. Actually, she was born facing North, but her superstitious mother brainwashes everyone into believing that she's an East baby. Her family is poor and rapidly decaying, since her sister is very ill and they're about to be evicted from their farmhouse.Then a white bear appears at their door and informs them (very painfully) that if Rose comes with him, the sister will be cured and the family will be well-off. Rose comes with him, to a palatial lodge full of everything she could need, including a strange servant, and something that sleeps near her every night. But a trip home ends in disaster, when she accidently discovers a curse on the bear -- and learns of a troll princess's magical plot.There isn't much that's new in &quot;East,&quot; except for minor details like the wind roses (whatever those are), &quot;birth direction&quot; superstitions, the dresses that Rose weaves, or the presence of Neddy. Overall it begins and ends more or less as you'd expect. It's prettily written in many places, with plenty of descriptions of nature and the outdoors.The multiple points-of-view are what make and break this book. On one hand, it's interesting to see the same events from the points-of-view of Rose, her father, her brother Neddy, and the bear (the troll princess's thoughts serve mainly as backstory). On the other hand, most of the humans sound alike, and the transitions from one chapter to another are painfully choppy. It also goes by too fast. The book starts at a leisurely pace, then suddenly speeds up (the months Rose spends in the bear's castle seem more like a few days).Rose is a good enough heroine, although she doesn't seem as freaked-out as you'd expect. Her father is wonderful, a man who is haunted by a vague sense of guilt that he has lied to his daughter. And considering that most of the bear's thoughts are rendered in very short sentences, they're very evocative. What's even better, the bear (unlike in many stories) had already encountered Rose before asking her to come with him.Fans of fairy-tale retellings will eat up &quot;East,&quot; but many readers might be put off by the abrupt pacing. Flawed, but worth checking out."},{"Title":"East","review":"Pattou uses the lesser-known fairy tale \\"East of the Sun and West of the Moon,\\" which combines notable elements from the following: Beauty and the Beast, Cupid and Psyche, The Snow Queen, Snow White and Rose Red, and All-Kinds-of-Fur. I had never read \\"East of the Sun and West of the Moon\\" before, so I only recognized parts from those classic fairy tales and was surprised to find out that it was, indeed, a classic itself.Pattou did her history homework. She includes the very old names of the countries of the region (France is Fransk, for example) and the languages and customs of the time. Maps are a big theme, as Rose's father is a mapmaker and most of the world is unexplored. Trying to find her way north, Rose becomes the central figure in an epic journey to save the White Bear, whom she damned to the embrace of the Troll Queen. Thus Rose becomes a strong and noble character through her trials and journey, while the White Bear remains a weaker character who must be rescued.This dependence of White Bear upon Rose undermines his character somewhat, as he is not able to help himself or Rose, and she must do all of the work. I have found that the least loved male romantic interests in the books I read are those who are not strong enough to match the woman in her quest for him. By the end of the novel, the woman is admired and the man is (typically) considered unworthy by the reader.Pattou's design of this novel (for it was carefully crafted) is to be commended. The only failings I see in it are the weakness in White Bear and the complimentary weakness in the romance aspect of the novel. I enjoy fairy tales mostly because of the romance in them, but readers should be warned that romance is a lesser theme in this story. It is present, but if you (like myself) read fairy tales for the romance rather than the adventure, you will be somewhat disappointed."},{"Title":"East","review":"As a related fairy tale to Beauty and the Beast, I pounce on East of the Sun, West of the Moon retellings. It might have been overkill, but I decided to read this novel and Sun and Moon, Ice and Snow by Jessica Day George, one right after the other.Outcome: While East is engaging and well-written, I think it suffers by comparison with Sun and Moon, Ice and Snow. I had trouble getting into East at first because of the meandering way it began, but once the story got properly started, I did enjoy it very much. It has a different tone from Sun and Moon, but nevertheless offers a satisfying retelling of East of the Sun, West of the Moon."},{"Title":"East","review":"This is one of my absolute favorite stories! I never get tired of reading it over and over again. This is just one of those books you'll want to read to your kids. A mix between \\"The Polar Bear King\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" this story will enchant you into a world where directions have meaning, the first baby gift has significance and where a young woman goes on an adventure of finding new worlds and falling for a most unexpected creature."},{"Title":"East","review":"I saw this book at my local library, and being a fairytale/mythology nerd, I decided to check it out.'East' is a Cupid & Psyche/Beauty and the Beast retelling with a twist. Set in the far north, the story follows Nymah Rose, and adventurous young girl. When her family falls on hard times, a great white bear comes to the door to make a deal with Rose's family. If Rose comes with him, her family's fortune will change for the better. Against her parent's wishes, Rose agrees to go with the bear to protect her family.The bear lives in an enchanted castle even farther north, and Rose tries to discover the mystery behind the bear. Why does he seem so human at moments? Why does he talk, but never speak of himself? And who is the stranger that comes into her room each night?What I liked about this book:I love fairy tales and mythology, and this was an interesting merge of a few classic fairy tales and Nordic mythology. Instead of facing off against a jealous Aphrodite, Rose faces the troll queen, who is in love with the enchanted bear and wants to make him her king. She travels through the harsh Arctic, a nice twist on Psyche's trials to get back to Cupid.What I didn't like about this book:Five different points of view. Seriously? It was too many different voices, and some gave (what I thought was) irrelevant information. Chapters alternate between Rose, her brother Neddy, her father, the troll queen, and the bear. I found it jarring going between chapters like this. I don't mind reading books with alternating viewpoints, but five was way too many.Final verdict:If you're a fairy tale nerd like me, this was an interesting take on a few classics. 3 stars (I'm dinging a few for the five POVs)."},{"Title":"East","review":"One of my favorite fantasy genres is that of the \\"retold\\" fairy tale -- a book that takes an old classic and puts a new spin on it, either retelling the story from another character's point of view, setting the tale in another time or location, or otherwise giving us a fresh perspective on a well-known tale. I've enjoyed many alternate retellings of old favorites -- \\"The Snow Child\\" by Eowyn Ivey, \\"Rapunzel's Revenge\\" by Shannon Hale, just about anything by Gail Carson Levine, etc. But for some reason new interpretations of one of my favorite fairy tales, \\"East of the Sun and West of the Moon,\\" seemed few and far between.Coming across \\"East\\" by Edith Pattou was a pleasant surprise, and it proved to be a rich and wonderful retelling of my favorite lesser-known fairy tale.Nymah Rose is a young seamstress, born to a mapmaker and a superstitious mother who holds that a child's personality is determined by their \\"birth direction.\\" Despite her mother being convinced that she's a pliable, obedient East-born, Nymah has the wild and stubborn temperament of a North-born... which leads her to agree to a bargain made by a mysterious, talking white bear when her family falls on hard times. Though she befriends the bear and even grows to love him, her stubborn and curious nature leads to tragedy and their sudden separation. But Rose refuses to give up, and will pursue her bear prince to the icy wastes of the north... and come face to face with a Troll Queen who is determined to claim the white bear as her own.A deft weaving of an old fairy tale with Norwegian mythology and culture, \\"East\\" expands on the original story without once feeling padded or dragging. It alternates viewpoints between Rose, her brother Neddy, the white bear, and the Troll Queen, using distinct voices for each and letting us see the tale from many points of view besides the heroine's. This allows for some true character development beyond the original tale, and even lets us sympathize with the villain of the tale -- the Troll Queen is not a wholly despicable character, even if we may despise her actions.Rose, too, is a wonderful character. I am always appreciative of a heroine in a fantasy tale who is able to rely on her own wits and strength instead of magic or a supernatural boyfriend, and Rose fits the bill quite well. She is determined not to sit back and let fate dictate her life, and while she makes mistakes, she tries to do the right thing and do what is best for others as well as herself. It's refreshing to know that there are intelligent, self-reliant heroines out there among the slew of Bella Swan copycats that seem to be permeating modern young-adult fantasy.A rich and exciting retelling of an old classic, \\"East\\" is perfect for those wanting a fantasy with a strong heroine and a fleshed-out story that expands on the original tale. If you enjoy the works of Shannon Hale, Gail Carson Levine, or Gregory Maguire, you'll love Edith Pattou's book."},{"Title":"Venganza: El Relato Veridico De Una Mision Contraterrorista Israeli (Spanish Edition)","review":"Venganza nos adentra en la persecuci&oacute;n y cacer&iacute;a de los supuestos 11 terrorista que planearon la masacre de varios atletas Israelitas en las olimpiadas de Munich en 1972.

As Gretchen Cassel Eick so ably demonstrates, Wichita, KS was itself a center of the struggle in the critical period from 1954 through 1972.From a 1958 drugstore lunch counter sit-in that predated the more famous one in Greensboro, NC by two years, to agonizing struggles for school and housing desegregation, this mid-sized city far from the national headlines had all of the elements.As reviewer Randy Bradbury said in the Wichita Eagle, &quot;Gretchen Cassel Eick's book is a well-documented reminder that Kansas has been and is a place divided along racial lines, where opportunities differ depending on skin color.&quot;Professor Eick creates a compelling narrative by weaving Wichita happenings in with those on the national level. So we see Wichita events in a context of changes in social beliefs, political leadership and even how they shaped and were shaped by infighting in the national leadership of the NAACP.She also introduces us to a fascinating cast of activists at the center of the local struggle, a few of whom also played national roles.The book works on two levels -- both as a narrative for the lay reader and as a well-documented study for academics.As Bradbury wrote in his Wichita Eagle review, the book &quot;must be considered an essential read for anyone interested in the history of race relations in Wichita or hoping for a foundation to begin understanding where those relations stand today. Additionally, however, the book is an exceelent primer on the national civil rights movement...&quot;"},{"Title":"Dissent in Wichita: The Civil Rights Movement in the Midwest, 1954-72","review":"I am a Wichita native.

Suzuki. 192 pp. London : Rider and Company, 1974 (1950) and Reprinted.Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki was no ordinary man. A Buddhist scholar, and proficient not only in Chinese and Japanese, but also in Sanskrit, Pali, Tibetan, English, and other languages, after attaining his Enlightenment at the age of twenty-seven he imposed upon himself an extremely difficult task - that of bringing a knowledge of Zen Buddhism to the West, and of somehow trying to get over into English, a language which was quite unprepared to receive them, the ideas and insights of the great Zen Masters.For over two thousand years, many of Asia's most brilliant intellects have been actively engaged in exploring the mysteries of mind, an exploration which Jung himself was to admit could hardly be said to have yet begun in the West.Anyone who has looked, for example, in one of the huge collections of Buddhist Scriptures such as the Taisho Tripitaka, or in a comprehensive Sanskrit-Chinese-Japanese Dictionary of Buddhist technical and philosophic terms, will have realized that, Buddhism has developed tens of thousands of words, many of them expressing the finest shades of meaning, for which English has no real equivalents.This fantastic profusion of ideas and vocabulary, a sort of higher mathematics of thought compared to simple arithmetic, has generated a literature of extraordinary subtlety and sophistication.One of the fruits of Suzuki sensei's sixty-five years writing, translating, and teaching, is the present book, the object of which, as he states in his Preface, is &quot;to inform the reader of the various literary materials relating to [Zen] monastery life&quot; (page 11). We are, in a sense, being invited into a Zen Monastery, and granted the privilege of viewing a selection of its literary and artistic treasures.In the case of an actual applicant for admission to a Zen Temple or monastery, no-one would think of simply breezing in and saying : &quot;OK. I'm here. What can you guys offer me?&quot; Applicants, as is well known, are kept waiting at the gate, often for many days, before being allowed the privilege of meeting with the Master.It's a test, a test of the applicant's humility, respect, and determination. And when the applicant finally does get to see the Master, he is expected to show the same respect, not perhaps so much for the Master as a person as for what he stands for - for the state of enlightenment and for the vast ocean of Buddhist knowledge he represents.Suzuki sensei, would, I feel sure, have hoped that we ourselves show a similar respect for the contents of the present book - for its Prayers and Invocations; for its selections from the Sutras and from the Zen Masters; and for its fifty interesting plates and illustrations which depict Chinese and Japanese statuary, scroll paintings, woodblocks, etc., of a kind one would find at any Zen Temple in Japan.All of them are standard Zen and are standard Buddhist fare, but just as at a feast we are not expected to eat everything on the table, readers are free to select whatever most appeals to them, without necessarily being dismissive of items that don't happen to suit their taste.The more devotionally inclined may be strongly drawn by some of the Prayers. Students of the sutras will be delighted to find one of the key sutras of Zen, the Prajnaparamitahrdaya or Heart Sutra, a sutra one could spend one's life studying (as did Edward Conze), along with extracts from the Lotus, Lankavatara, and the mind-boggling Diamond Sutra, and a useful resume of the Surangama. Those drawn to the early Masters won't be disappointed either.Personally I was happy to discover Suzuki sensei's fine translation of Seng-ts'an's 'Hsin-hsin-ming' ('On Believing in Mind,' pages 76-82), the very first verse treatise on Zen - which in the original Chinese takes up just two thirds of a page in the more than 100,000 pages of 'Taisho' - a text which embodies the quintessence of Zen and that deserves to be far better known. Here is the first of its thirty-one verses, with my slash marks to indicate line breaks:&quot;The Perfect Way knows no difficulties / Except that it refuses to make preferences; / Only when freed from hate and love, / It reveals itself fully and without disguise&quot; (page 76).I don't know how long Suzuki sensei spent on his translations, but I do know that Peter Haskel spent ten years to give us his marvelous translation of Bankei, and I myself, inspired by the version in the present book, spent three years working on a translation of the Hsin-hsin-ming, a text which has yet to yield up its full lode of meaning.There are many other deep and wonderful texts in this book, including two versions of 'The Ten Oxherding Pictures.' Some of these texts will appeal to one kind of person, others to another. But all will repay careful study by the serious student, and by one who approaches them in an attitude of humility and respect.Many other Zen anthologies have appeared since Suzuki sensei's pioneering effort, some of them with more 'up-to-date' (though not necessarily superior) translations, but his 'Manual of Zen Buddhism' has always had a special importance for me. After three years spent studying just one of its texts, I wonder how long it will take me to assimilate the rest? And there must have been many in the past, in both China and Japan, who were happy to nibble on much less than the feast provided here."},{"Title":"MANUAL OF ZEN BUDDHISM.","review":"This was fully intended to be an actual Zen manual, full of liturgy, ritual and explanations.

The Dharanis are somewhat confusing, but the Gathas are nice and work well as liturgy. The Sutra excerpts are pretty run-of-the-mill, not worth comprehensive study, mainly liturgical. There is the Diamond, Heart, an excerpt from the Lotus, as well as some from the Lankavatara and some from the Surangama (more a paraphrase). Then there are numerous teachings from Chinese &amp; Japanese masters. These are pretty good too. The Pictures are interesting as well, but perhaps more suited toward Deity Yoga. The Indian pics have a Tantric, Vajrayana feel to them. This book is not a &quot;How-to&quot; manual. I don't know if D.t. Suzuki actually ever wrote one. It is more of a daily recitation and/or devotional. The kind of thing you read in the morning &amp; evening, or memorize. If you really want a good Zen Buddhist Manual, there are many to choose from, and if you want a good assortement of text, there are many more comprehensive and better organized than this.

Along with writers like Alan Watts, Suzuki was at the forefront of introducing Zen to young people in the West. The only real criticism I have of the book is that no work by Dogen was included. My guess is that Suzuki was influenced more by the Rinzai school of Zen, so perhaps one shouldn't expect to find any works by Zogen included in this manual.I am not a Buddhist of any school, but I still like to read certain Suttas from the Pali Canon, the Dhammapada, a couple of the Sutras used in the Zen Schools, as well as Dogen, what we have by Bodhidharma, and some of the writings of a few other Zen Masters. I recommend Suzuki's Manual of Zen to anyone who wants to learn more about Zen Buddhism. For a different flavor of Zen Buddhism, I also recommend \\"Chanting from the Heart: Buddhist Ceremonies and Daily Practices\\" by Thich Nhat Hanh and Monks and Nuns of Plum Village. But the best introduction to Buddhism that I've found is Walpola Rahula's What the Buddha Taught and a good second book after this is \\"The Heart of Buddhist Meditation\\" by Thera Nyanaponika. Or, you can follow the suggestion of the Zen layman who suggested I read \\"Zen Flesh, Zen Bones\\" when I only had basic information about the 4 Noble Truths and the 8-Fold Path.

Even though I don't suffer from depression, I have worked closely with those who do in the television and film industry. This book helped me understand what goes through these peoples' minds and how they approach day to day things. I commend Ms. Brackney for her courage to write such an introspective piece of work. It had me laughing in parts, crying in others and shaking my head in disbelief at times. If you have depression or know someone who suffers from this affliction, the Lost Sole Companion is a great find!"},{"Title":"The Lost Soul Companion","review":"I am not a student of Carl Jung. However, I believe that if you have found this review, regardless of what you may consciously believe, you need to read the Lost Soul Companion. It is a wonderful declaration of self. In many ways reminiscent of &quot;Generation X&quot; before the marketing people took over. It exposes a very real community of people to each other. If you are a lost soul you may realize that it is not so lonely out there. If you know a lost soul, you might gain a small persepective on a wonderful person. In any event, I only came across the book because I had the author in my taxi as a passenger. If you have tripped upon this review, you were meant to read this book. I am here. . . where are you?"},{"Title":"The Lost Soul Companion","review":"While on an island, ironically traveling alone, I remembered that I had packed a book before I left the house. During the next few days I found myself with book in hand everywhere I went. I was looking for solitude, but found myself with a companion that was so incredibly honest and witty that I could not imagine this recent vacation without The Lost Soul Companion. The book has a brutal charm. It drives into you like a grandmother's tough love. It comes across so comfortably that I felt beside myself when I would look up and realize I was still on a vacation of solitude and laughing out loud, in fact very loud--almost wildly. When I finished, I was pleased to have read such an engaging book, but also fond of something that was, as it said, a companion."},{"Title":"The Lost Soul Companion","review":"As much a lifestyle survey as a set of spiritual and practical tips for struggling musicians, artists and other free spirits, The Lost Soul Companion may prove hard to easily categorize but is packed with intriguing concepts and excellent tips.

I wish the author had covered in more detail her own experiences trying to make it in the California art world. What was that like, and what made her give it up and return to the midwest? That might be something she could cover in Volume II, which I hear is now in the works.Also suggested: interviews with artists at various levels of &quot;success,&quot; meaning ability to support themselves. Also, interviews with other creatives on their way of solving the problem of art vs money.Still, thanks Susan, for your honesty and your desire to create community for other artists."},{"Title":"The Lost Soul Companion","review":"ridiculous, useless, and written very immaturely.

The experiences of a young US Infantry Officer, during three years of combat in Vietnam, reflected in the form of photographs, essays, and poems. The most important question asked at the time by everyone was, whether the communist or the democratic way of life would remain standing. All of those who fell were very young, for the most part handsome young men, who followed the orders they were given to obey, and the examples set for them by their fathers, and grandfathers. Fear and death were hard to confront, day in and day out, when the ones at home, who could have lent moral support, ridiculed and abused those who did the fighting.

He seems uncomfortable with the bisexuality aspect, which is a rather integral part of the whole Glam scene, to be honest. He also doesn't go into much depth in actually describing Ziggy-the-character as *he* sees him, which is a little disappointing. The writing is quality, but unrevelatory for the most part.On the bright side, he's often quite funny, and there *are* several juicy little stories to catch one's interest. The meat of the book is, naturally, Mick Rock's beautiful photography, which just can't be beat if you're a whore for Ziggy images (like me). The oodles of rare photographs from the very beginning to the very end of Zig's short life will be sure to delight. There are also several of Rock's hand-written articles and Bowie's lyric pages reproduced within, as well as many (often hilarious) on-tour memos from the camp leader. Also included are typical set-lists, and complete gig listings for each of the U.K., U.S., and Japanese tours.For fashion-lovers, this tome is a must-have; better visual documentation of the fantastic costumes and outfits worn by this notoriously fashionable creature would probably only be found in Masayoshi Sukita's book, which is sadly not available in the West. Despite its lack of written detail, this is a fabulous book for Ziggy-lovers. David is simply stunning in his satin, tat, mascara and rouge, and you'd be a fool to pass by such beauty.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Moonage Daydream: The Life & Times of Ziggy Stardust","review":"Ten Thousand Stars for living legend Mick Rock ********** Inspiring, fantastical, beautiful and even hysterically funny, [yes David Bowie is quite funny here in his rare act of putting pen to paper].

On a scale of photography books on David, 10 being the highest rating, I would rate this about 7.2. Artistically rendered, it's a great book on the creation of Ziggy Stardust (but there are better photo books available). Ziggy, an iconic rock figure, was developed and performed by Bowie in the early '70's. You get great photos by Mick Rock, almost all in color. Can't say I really liked David's look during the early days of that period. He was supposedly \\"into\\" his bisexuality by this time, and workin' it. He should have been exploring the refrigerator! Because he looked malnourished and simpering, as if he hadn't had a decent meal since he lost his first manager, Ken Pitt. Honestly! No, I'm sure he wasn't eating: he was starving. So I believe his brain was hungry, and that's the reason his recall of the time is distorted. (That's what I'm telling myself about this book.) He was in a process of developing Ziggy, who got better with the next few years of performance. By the time the dream of Ziggy was perfected, Bowie trashed him. (David Bowie is not someone to be trapped.)The writing is Bowie's, so you get some fun anecdotes. But I was severely disappointed that The Man didn't tell the truth. He didn't give his first wife, Angela, any acknowledgment about her participation in his creative enterprises whatsoever. I take that stuff personally and find it hurtful. Still? After dwelling on it for 6 months, I can't blame him. Celebrities have to be careful, or they will be sued. God knows, Madonna has had to pay-off everyone in her life... And Bowie has had to pay everyone off not once, but twice. Bowie has paid through the teeth! And that's just the sad fact of walking in his high-heels."},{"Title":"Moonage Daydream: The Life & Times of Ziggy Stardust","review":"The product ordered came quick. It was exactly what I wanted.

Publishers, LondonI fell in love with Nadine when she was six years old. Nadine is the daughter of an English miner with a large brood who's having a hard time in the 50s making ends meet and settles questions with his belt. The youngest of the lot, Nadine was, by circumstance, \\"part of the wallpaper\\". But she was also, through necessity, independent, inventive, slippery, and belligerent. My kind of girl. Walker's book is somewhat reminiscent of Dickens' OLIVER TWIST: hungry children, neighborhood boys trained to steal for a living, a lady who does \\"the business in the night\\", cold-hearted men. Her trials and how she copes will fascinate you.Losing her mother at the age of ten, and having sisters much older, who move away leaving her alone with her distraught father, Nadine learns to be even craftier than her natural instincts have led her to be. A presence she recognizes as her mother comforts her.Her father takes to drink and leaves her alone days and nights. He molests her. In pain from the molestation, and terrorized by her father's threats to kill her if she tells, she runs away. She survives with help from one of her sisters for a couple of years and then strikes out on her own.The man Nadine marries cleans out their bank accounts and abandons her and their two little girls. With no source of income, she loses their home and property and is left destitute. Heartbroken and without food for her children, she calls on her estranged father for help and is turned her away.Her husband returns to kidnap the girls and take them to America. For Nadine, this is the last straw. She breaks down and is locked away in a mental institution, where she refuses to speak or eat. In her hopelessness, she again envisions herself as \\"part of the wallpaper\\". Not until the police have located her children in America does she begin to recover.Her in-laws step in and steal the girls back from their son and return them to Nadine in England. With two young girls to care for and unable to work, Nadine winds up on the dole. The only housing available to her is in the worst project in town. There she learns more survival skills. She finds she is able to accept gifts and \\"discounted\\" items she needs without question.\\"DON'T MIND ME, I'M JUST PART OF THE WALLPAPER\\" could benefit from a bit more editing, but the story is so engrossing that I soon overlooked that. This book will find an adult audience among those readers who appreciate an author who is intelligent enough to tell such a story with humor and passion without having to resort to profanity, gratuitous violence, and explicit sex.Younger readers, mature enough to handle abuse and supernatural situations, will find adventure, heroism, and a ghost in Nadine's story. Walker handles the molestation with sensitivity and without unnecessary detailSome terms may be unfamiliar to American readers, such as \\"golly\\" (a cuddly toy), \\"stickleback\\" (a small fish), and \\"plonk\\" (a cheap wine). But as they are presented, one pretty much gets the meaning.Nadine's very survival is a miracle itself. Will she ever rise above poverty, abuse, abandonment, devastating onslaughts to her pride, depression? Will the girls ever amount to anything? Dismal prospects, you say? Nay. Nadine is a survivor. It takes more than hunger, humiliation, and fear to stop this feisty girl.Christine Walker lives in Warwickshire with her husband, Dave, and two \\"crazy\\" rescued dogs. She is a nurse, a counsellor, and is know on national TV, radio, and in the news media as the founder of \\"With Dignity\\", a support organization for men and women who have been abandoned by their partners. She's also an artist. (She created the cover for \\"DON'T MIND ME, I'M JUST PART OF THE WALLPAPER\\", her first novel.) Her warmth and her sense of ironic humor begin to show even in the preface, and are evident throughout the book."},{"Title":"The Simple Truth: Poems","review":"Philip Levine writes in the title poem of this collection:&quot;Some things/you know all your life. They are so simple and true/they must be said without elegance, meter and rhyme,/they must be laid on the table beside the salt shaker,/the glass of water, the absence of light gathering/ in the shadows of picture frames, they must be/ naked and alone, they must stand for themselves.&quot;These lines capture many of the themes of this Pulitzer-prize winning book. The poems in this collection are deceptively simple, &quot;naked and alone&quot;. They generally involve an incident or person, recollected by the poet from his past. The incident is recounted in bare unrhymed lines, without hyperbole or judgment. We are encouraged to see the incident, as we see the still life reproduced on the cover of the volume and to let it &quot;stand for itself&quot;. The poems are elegaic in tone and the effect of the memory is generally one of deep sadness.Many of the poems have a deliberately pictorial quality, as reflected in their titles, that remind one of a photo or of a painting in a museum. In many cases, the reader is tempted to conceive in the mind's eye a painting to accompany the poem. This is true, particularly, as the book progresses into its final section with its descriptions of the poet's mother (&quot;My Mother with Purse, the Summer they Murdered the Spanish Poet&quot;), father (&quot;My Father with Cigarette Twelve Years before the Nazis could Break his Heart&quot;), and others (&quot;Edward Lieberman, Entrepreneur, four years after the Burnings on Okinawa&quot;) One of the poems of the collection is title simply &quot;Photography&quot;. Ironically, this poem is less pictorial than many others. It relates a sad incident from the poet's childhood involving his Aunt, and others, and focuses on the ravages of time and memory.The poems also focus on the role imagination plays in constituting our reality. The first poem of the collection &quot;On the Meeting of Garcia Lorca and Hart Crane&quot; relates a meeting between these two romantic 20th Century poets and alludes to Crane's apparent suicide in jumping from a ship bound from Vera Cruz to New York. Crane's tragic but romantic death is juxtaposed with the vision coming &quot;to an ordinary man staring/ at a filthy river&quot; as he contemplates not only Crane and Lorca but his son falling to his death &quot;from/the roof of a building he works on.&quot; With a voice of irony, the poet asks us to &quot;bless the imagination. It gives/ us the myths we live by. Let's bless/ the visionary power of the human-- the only animal that's got it--&quot;These poems have a multi-layered simplicity realized through an understated voice of sadness and illuminated by imagination."},{"Title":"The Simple Truth: Poems","review":"Philip Levine once vowed to be the voice of the poor, the simple, those without voice--a vow he has not broken in his sixty-plus years of writing poetry. In 1995, Levine was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in Poetry for his collection of poems, &quot;the Simple Truth&quot;. That prize would mean less to him than the knowledge that thousands of people have found enjoyment and comfort from reading his poems--that from his work, they came to better understand our common vulnerabilty to the state of being human. Levine's poems are an echo of the emotions trapped in the reader's heart; they are a friendly voice giving substance to what has been lived, but not spoken. Levine's title poem &quot;The Simple Truth&quot; invites the reader to recognize and celebrate the stark beauty of simple things. Each poem in this collection builds on the other to introduce the reader to the poet, who in turn introduces readers to perfect poetic expression, so personal that they will stop and say &quot;Yes!! That IS how it is!&quot; Anyone who cannot relate to or reconginze themself in at least half of the poems in this fine book, have not read it. That's &quot;the simple truth.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Simple Truth: Poems","review":"Levine's poetry often moves me. In my opinion, this is his best book. His poems strike me as being very honest; they make me accept the complicated mess of joys and disappointments that it means to be human. The title poem, &quot;The Simple Truth,&quot; explains exactly what I mean (and in a better way than I'm doing here). Please read this book."},{"Title":"The Simple Truth: Poems","review":"Poetry, to many, brings to mind names like Shakespeare, Eliot, Milton, Yeats--figures of artistic genius who crafted intricate texts laden with complex (sometimes private) imagery and embodied in a nearly-inaccessible form. To them, the interpretation of poetry is best left to career academics who spend lifetimes working out such complex systems of words and images.Philip Levine to the rescue! That is, for those resigned to avoid poetry he rescues the immense pleasure it is capable of giving regardless of literary background. His prosaic verse-columns give themselves up to the reader with no fight, laying bare and accessible the truth Levine hopes to convey. Setting is given usually within the first line, as Levine constructs an everyday scene animated with very human characters who live life day by day--trying to make it from this one to the next. From this the poem (often a narrative) builds piece by piece using bits of conversation, natural observations, personal thoughts, and other snippets of life through whatever drama is present to end as simply as it started--sometimes in a whisper, sometimes with a raised voice, but always with simplicity.Without complex formal elements, Levine's poems are forced to rely on their simplicity, their commonality for what is not an ornate beauty but a simple one. Such verse shows its Americanness with every word, with every image as it articulates simply the truth it lays open--there for the taking. In The Simple Truth is an artist at the zenith of his poetic genius--an artist who is, at the same time, true to his self and to his roots as an American. This is what poetry should be and is meant to be."},{"Title":"The Simple Truth: Poems","review":"'The Simple Truth' is a wonderful collection of poetry. I don't consider myself a very literary person, but I keep reading this collection because of the way Levine captures the human experience so powerfully.

Burgess' Bird Book for Children so I was already familiar with this author's style.Burgess creates animal characters and a storyline for his creatures.In The Burgess Animal Book for Children the woodland animals gather each morning to attend school with Old Mother Nature, who serves as the teacher for both the animals in her school and for the readers of the novel.Each of the forty chapters covers several animals in the same family group and describes the habits and characteristics of those animals in a story format.At first read, I thought the narrator's tone came across as too formal - too \\"teach-y\\".But my young listeners did not think that at all - and as they were the target audience, I set aside those first misgivings.And I am so glad that I did.I used this book as a large part of our nature and science study curriculum this year.Twice a week I would read one chapter of the book to the children.While they listened, London, Mosely and Bergen would draw the animals in their personal nature notebooks.One of the main animals attending the school with Mother Nature is Peter Rabbit - a curious, outspoken rabbit who has loads of questions for his teacher.(Apparently, he also has a lame British accent. Or at least - that's what my kids will grow up remembering I guess.)I am always surprised by how much detail the kids put in their drawings, just by listening to the descriptions given in the writing.And I think by hearing about the animals in a story format they are able to retain so much more information than a list or a textbook would have offered.After each reading I ask the kids to narrate what they remember about the animal.Mosely drew the grizzly bear from the reading but asked to narrate about the polar bear we read about instead.Although I recorded the words for her - I added nothing.This is just what she remembered on her own.(I love fact number four - \\"The polar bear can actually blend into the snow and it doesn't mind attacking people.\\")Since London can write, she usually records the narration on her own.The stories have certainly stuck in the kids' minds too.They frequently talk about the subtle differences between certain similar animals - such as the sheep and the goat or an antelope and a deer.Bergen is often asking, \\"What family is that animal in?\\"After almost every chapter they invent games of \\"polar bear\\" or \\"fox\\".My favorite is the game of \\"possum\\" where all the baby possums (Piper, Bergen, Mosely) try to ride on the momma possum's (London) back as long as they can before they fall off and play dead.And Piper has even taken to addressing me as \\"Old Mother Nature\\" whenever I begin to read a new story.Based on the popularity of the first two Burgess books we have conquered, I am already scouting out Amazon for a few more selections.I think he has written a series of additional books featuring some of the animals in this particular novel as well.Bergen requested more stories from Unc' Billy the possum, so I guess I'll make that fella the next priority."},{"Title":"The Burgess animal book for children","review":"As a homeschooler, I've seen this book listed on many book lists for those who prefer the use of 'living books' over textbooks. The book uses story form to convey facts about animals, a method which can sometimes be effective, and sometimes be too dry. In this case, it was the latter. There were simply too many facts crammed in, to the detriment of the stories. My then-6yo daughter and I very much enjoyed Burgess' 'The Adventures of ....' (e.g. Bobby Coon and others) series, and I had expected this book to be similar stories, but these lacked the adventure that we had enjoyed in his other books. My 8yo asked if she could please not read it (I had assigned it), and after reading a chapter myself, I agreed. If you enjoyed Thornton Burgess' 'The Adventures of ...' series, you may enjoy the 'Among the ... People' series by Clara Dillingham Pierson."},{"Title":"The Burgess animal book for children","review":"We hardly even realize that reading this book is &#34;science class&#34; and we are learning about animals, because we are caught up in the story of Peter Rabbit. Thornton Burgess is a wonderful writer and this book is another outstanding example of that."},{"Title":"The Burgess animal book for children","review":"All of Burgess' books are fabulous! They are great books for young children and for older and for parents and grandparents to read to their children or grandchildren.A classic!"},{"Title":"The Burgess animal book for children","review":"Anything that has to do with reading for the Kindle Fire is awesome! Great product and the girls love it!"},{"Title":"The Burgess animal book for children","review":"The stories are wonderful for children and for people who like to read to children. This is an older book which that has no pictures to go with the birds. I suggest that you search pictures of the birds for the children to look at while reading. If you are creative enough and feel inspired drawing some pictures would be great for the visual learner. Another thought would be to provide some coloring pages of the birds for the kinestic learner. Overall it is free and the content is great, just not the features."},{"Title":"The Burgess animal book for children","review":"fab stories and just ol fashion story telling such memories just hope more kids read and well put together thx"},{"Title":"The Burgess animal book for children","review":"This is a great book for animal lovers, children and those of you who like to encourage learning!!

It teaches animal classifications, habitats, diet, various species, etc. it is a great book to use in science or nature studies and is really a wealth of information!"},{"Title":"The Burgess animal book for children","review":"When I was in second grade in 1957, I found the Burgess series of books in our school library, each one titled for an animal. There were probably 20 of them. I read them all through second and third grade almost exclusively. When I got to fourth grade I had Mrs. Goble again. Teachers took their classes to the library and acted as librarians in those days, so she recognized my obsession from second grade. She declared I could read any book from any grade level of the library, but NOT Thornton W. Burgess books.I lived without Reddy Fox for a year, reading Black Stallion books instead. By fifth grade-- even without Mrs. Goble's eagle eye--I was reading everything I could lay my hands on. But Reddy still came home with me until sixth grade. I stopped only because the new junior high opened.Now my granddaughter will have a chance to meet my friends. Give your child the opportunity as well.Kim L., a former children's librarian, school librarian, and preschool teacher."},{"Title":"The Burgess animal book for children","review":"My 7-year-old daughter loves listening to the stories in this book! Factual information about various mammals is presented by Old Mother Nature to the curious little animals who come to her \\"school\\" to learn about their relatives. My daughter loves looking at the pictures and retains quite a bit of the information, thanks to the imaginative way the animals are discussed. Makes a great read-aloud, and could serve as a handy reference in the future."},{"Title":"The Burgess animal book for children","review":"I got this while waiting with my 5yo at the dr office. I was expecting alittle more kid friendly with good pictures. Well it wasnt anything that held my daughters atention thats for sure, but I could have probably enjoyed it if she hadent been annoyed with it."},{"Title":"The Burgess animal book for children","review":"The cover had a beautiful color picture that suggests color pictures within the book, but it's all in black and white and the animals are very difficult to see. Not At All what I was expecting. I will not give this book to my niece."},{"Title":"The Burgess animal book for children","review":"These Burgess books are so wonderful in many ways. I had gotten them because of the reviews of other CMers. But on almost every page there are references to Mother Nature. We have decided to get rid of these books because God is the Creator and we do not want our children indoctrinated with that phrase over and over again. They actually brought the book to me and told me we needed to get rid of it. They are aware of the creation/evolution debate and discerned this problem themselves.Parables from Nature by Margaret Gatty would be a better choice."},{"Title":"Free to Learn: Lessons from Model Charter Schools","review":"Whether you're a parent, an education professional, or simply a concerned citizen, Free to Learn is a valuable resource on top-performing charter schools, and how they've raised the standards for scholastic achievement. Izumi and Yan offer a collection of compelling case studies that give hope to teachers and students still struggling under the yoke of classroom bureaucracy. The model charter schools profiled are well researched, and provide an insightful look at how breaking the public school orthodoxy with charter school reform can make a difference in the lives of children everywhere. Free to Learn was an enjoyable read, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Free to Learn: Lessons from Model Charter Schools","review":"I found Free to Learn insightful, as the authors navigate through several different charter school success stories, highlighting inefficiencies in public schools and the mechanisms that allow charter schools to more adequately handle these situations, without superfluously extolling virtue. Yan and Izumi deftly touch upon both commonalities and differences between these successful charters - emphasizing the fact that there is no \\"one size fits all\\" solution. Yet, comparisons with non-successful charters are included for a balanced viewpoint. Lastly, the personal stories of those students lives affected or the principals and teachers driving positive change give this policy book a very human feel."},{"Title":"Free to Learn: Lessons from Model Charter Schools","review":"Breathtaking in its scope, dazzling in its depth, \\"Free to Learn\\" is a must-read for anyone who cares about our educational system. Whether you are a veteran in education policy or a newcomer to the field, Yan and Izumi's enthusiasm for the subject matter and cogent writing style will keep you glued to the pages. The comprehensive analysis makes it a powerful resource for educators and policymakers alike. This is simply the most articulate and best-informed book you can buy on the timely and compelling subject of charter schools."},{"Title":"Free to Learn: Lessons from Model Charter Schools","review":"Not being involved in education, I was pleasantly surprised to find Free to Learn very accessible and informative. Izumi and Yan write in a very engaging way, and I came out of the book knowing quite a bit about the ins and outs of charter schools. I definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in meeting the educational needs of our children."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"this was a very great book to read. i read it before the movie ever came out. if you saw the movie and liked it, i think the book is even better. buy it because you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"&quot;interview with the vampire&quot; is a great book and i loved it. i could not put it down and read it in two days. this is a book in which you relate to, even though the main character, louis, is not human. when i read the bok i felt happy when things went his way and i cryed when sad things happened. i personally think that i way way better than the most resent harry potter book and will be well worth you time."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Great book. I first watched the movie when it came out and loved it. Then I just had to read the books. I must say I loved the book more than the movie. I guess there is only so much you can put into a 2 hour movie. If you are thinking about reading the chronicles go for it you will not be sorry."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"One of the very few classic novels of the 20th century. Anne Rice creates a beautifully rich universe that is irresistible and loveable, no matter what kind of books you enjoy. There isn't any way you couldn't love this book"},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Honestly, no amount of review reading can give you a clear idea of whether or not you will like a book. I loved this book despite all the bad reviews. But I'm not alone. Similarly, I hated Lord of the Rings, despite all the good reviews...and I also wasn't alone there. I think this book is more for people who enjoy getting to know characters rather than a quick-paced plot. It's more about feeling empathy for something supposedly evil than being amazed by story twists. Some people like this sort of thing, some don't. I recommend you at least give it a try; you may discover an awesome read for yourself. I finished it in only a few days and it usually takes me at least two weeks to finish a novel if it bores me. And definitely watch the movie. The movie is REALLY good."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Growing up, reading books was quick and simple, but as time went on I grew up, and it became an awful school assignment, and I hated it.Now, with a much re-newed love to read, thanks to Anne Rice, and her glorious story of Interview with the Vampire, I look forward to sitting with a good book.Interview is a wonderfully written, and massively creative piece of art in words. In the words of Louis, the beloved main character, he leads the reader through many passages and times with his haunting and hypnotic stories of Paris, Claudia, his quest to find vampires with answers, and his beloved brother. Accompanied by Lestat, the vampire who gave him the \\"dark gift\\", he describes his hatred for immortality, and questions the existence of God, the Devil, love and loneliness.From start to finish, Louis will captivate you with his mystery, and his ongoing journey for meaning."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I don't know how Rice did it, but she had managed to elevate the genre of horror, eerie weirdness, seduction, evil, and the whole field of 'vampire-ism' to a literary level. In this debut novel, she introduces the Vampire Lestat, and voila! an entire new world opens up, a new genre practically: 'Vampire Literature!' Lord, the woman can write, and although I'm a fan of neither horror nor vampires, I was sucked right in.Read this before you read her others, and then read everything she writes."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"I've read this book several years ago i believe, and i guess i can say this is a so-so book. Reason i'm rating this book 3 stars is because there are a lot of confusing parts and i had to re-read most of them to get some sense in what they meant. And her language was very confusing. Still it was so and so, not good not bad.LOuis becomes a vampire by Lestat and the two live together with Claudia."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice's fascinating novel catapulted her into literary superstardom and redefined the vampire for the modern age. A trio of vampires--Lestat, comfortable with his nature and capable of reveling in his power and cruelty; Louis, conflicted by his dark cravings but unable to resist them; and Claudia, tortured by being forever trapped in the body of a six-year-old girl--provide the prism through which we are introduced to a meticulously crafted vampire underworld that exists parallel to our own. Those who are put off by the dark, mopey, tragically romantic, gothic cliche that the vampire has become should not be deterred from reading this book, even though it is responsible for launching that cliche. Rice's prose is lovely and there is much interesting contemplation on the nature of evil and redemption. Not to mention a great story as well."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Magnificent! This story takes you aflight on wings of incredible imagination so like a god or goddess you can cast your eyes upon an enchanted world of vampires...The tale memorizes, and its characters speak to the most intimate heart. This is a glimpse into the existence of a vampire named Louis, of his search for unattainable salvation in an eternality of damnation. His endless night is the soul of this book, and such a journey engulfs yet two other vampires in its curse, the vampire Claudia doomed in the body of a child and the vampire Lestat shackled in chains of unbreakable loneliness. Together they roam the world in a haze of sorrow, and each time the vampires take life for sustainment, it is not blood that fills them, but the hellish acknowledgement that they are forever children of the darkness. The gauntlet of each vampire to obtain what cannot be obtained gives them the quality of being human, and in their struggle for resurrection they themselves are unknowingly made beautiful...I highly recommend this book for readers who love to suck all the marrow out of a story's life, because Interview with the Vampire will stir both the romantic and the philosopher in each of us and open our long-shut eyes..."},{"Title":"Interview with the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice's original novel of vampires, Interview With the Vampire is stunningly beautiful. If you have only seen the movie, you are missing about three quarters of the story and the wonderful emotion included in the book. As the story unfolds, the reader can watch the characters take on their own lives (or deaths) and become real. You see Lestat becoming hard to control, so obviously a part of the real world, like someone you might meet anywhere, yet someone you would never forget. You can see Louis' pain, his struggle with wanting to be good, but needing the evil of blood. In Claudia, the reader can see the pain of wanting to have a lost child back on any terms, no matter how severe for the child, then the final acceptance that the child is better off where she is, than to suffer an eternity of being evil. This novel is the best that has been written in years, and is definitely a classic. If you enjoy this novel, I recommend that you finish the series.
