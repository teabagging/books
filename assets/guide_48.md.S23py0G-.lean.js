It was a difficult time for me, and I really wasn't looking for anything in particular as my mind and soul were scattered. I saw this little book standing on a shelf all by itself, and picked it up. I could find nothing wrong with it to warrant the &quot;discarded&quot; title, and as I was intrigued by its cover design and burgundy inside front cover, I bought it if for no other reason than it was a good deal.One day, I picked it up and started reading it. At that time, I could only get through a half a page before my mind wandered (those weeds!) and I lost interest. But somehow I kept going back to the book. It is such a humble book that I was intrigued. You would expect that a book titled as this one is would be much more onerous.I eventually was able to read a section at a time. I also was able to &quot;sit&quot; for short periods, but the most important achievement that was inspired by the book was to live each moment as it happens.Since then, the book inspires me to continue with my writing, as well as guiding me through my daily challenges. I am slowly unearthing the person I know I used to be as a child.Someone wrote in a review prior to mine that this book &quot;is Zen&quot;. They are right. The practice of reading the book is Zen. Such is the magic of this little book."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"This is perhaps the best book for a westerner interested in zen buddhism to read (though Steve Hagen's Buddhism Plain and Simple is also excellent). Neither of these books really teach you much about Buddhism, rather they teach you how to be a Buddhist (or at least how to find the buddha nature which is already inside of you)Don't let the first section discourage you, it gets much better. I was initially turned off by this book because it begins with an almost harsh description of how one should practise zazen (meditation). For example I did not like hearing that there is only one correct way to do it (you must sit in a lotus position with your hands in your lap, your head perpendicular to you shoulders, and so on and so on). However, it was a misunderstanding on my part as to what the author meant about meditation and what it is you are trying to achieve (or not achieve for that matter).It was only after realizing the author's description of zazen is the best way to realize the illusions we have created in our minds about the world around us (not to sound like a nutball or anything)."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"It is March, 2000, and I have just ordered another 6 copies of this classic book on Zen sitting meditation. I first read it shortly after it was published in 1972, borrowed from the Cleveland Heights OH library. Since then I have returned to it many times and given many copies away to friends.Some are grieving a loss, some are facing a major personal challenge, like cancer. Some are simply searching for truth or a sense of themselves.In any case, I do agree with those reviewers who point novices toward a more traditionally instructive book like The Three Pillars of Zen. That book speaks to the logical structure of Zen study, its emphasis on teaching, practice and enlightenment. It is important to understand Zen in this historic and traditional light if one is to pursue it seriously. But Three Pillars is a &quot;study book&quot; - it is not a description of the sitting zen experience. Shunryu's lectures were &quot;live&quot; and directed to the experience itself.As in the old Zen saying, his words are fingers, pointing to the moon.Certainly, there may be purists who find dogmatic contradictions in some of Shunryu's comments. But he did not set out to teach the dogma!This is an excellent book the serious zen student will return to again and again. And for the &quot;everday man&quot; among us, the &quot;beginner&quot; Shunryu spoke to, it is much better than a handbook of Hazleton platitudes, an erstwhile koan or a list of Covey's rules.Sit up straight!

When reading, children are easily distracted. Perhaps they do not feel a connection to the story. The story is certainly not an expression of themselves. Writing about the story helps. Then it becomes part of their own expression. Their interests and experiences can become part of the story. But when we paint, it is a different &quot;story&quot; altogether. Then you see beginner's mind in action. The object of their study is certainly part of them. Focus is inherent in the activity. The paint, the paper, the child all become one event. And since I have only started teaching art recently, I am beginner's mind at work!In the prologue, Suzuki-roshi tells us: &quot;This is the real secret of the arts: always be a beginner.&quot; Why? It is because &quot;in the beginner's mind there are many possibilities; in the expert's mind there are few.&quot; The joy of perpetually being a beginner!Is _Zen Mind_ about education and art? Yes. No. {Mu?} _Zen Mind_ is a book about mind and life. Big mind and small mind. Small life and unencumbered life. Maybe you are a gymnast. Maybe you sell real estate or groceries. Maybe you work in a factory or in an electrical power plant. Maybe you write the questions for &quot;Who Wants to be a Millionaire.&quot; Whatever you do {even if you do no-thing} and wherever you are {right here right now}, this book will speak to you if you have an interest in the freshness of beginning and the beauty of everyday life."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"I picked up this book because of the title...bad move. I thought it would be a good for someone, a beginner, who is trying to learn Zen Buddhism. There really isn't much here for beginners. Caveat emptor! It really is a book for seasoned practicioners of zazen, who want to comprehend &quot;beginner's mind&quot;. But even then, you find words on beginner's mind only in the prologue and the epilogue, for the most part. A lot of it is incomprehensible to neo-phytes. However, there are pieces of insight which a simpleton like me could understand. Parts of the book which called for straightforward practice, without being misled by distractions, were great. When you cook, cook! When you fish, fish! Don't try to be multifacted! Just tend to one task, just do it! Good stuff. There were words about the need for awareness which were helpful. Shunryu Suzuki wants his reader to always be practicing zazen. He emphasizes this. There is no way I can get myself into a lotus position and then undo it on the same day, but I could appreciate the words about breathing. And how breath is the gateway between the inner world and the outer world. Great stuff! Most of the book, however, did not make sense to me. A better title would have been &quot;Thoughts on Zen Practice&quot;."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"I read this book when I was in my mid-teens. I was perhaps 15 at the time. I have been exploring \\"spirituality\\", mysticism, meditation, and various spiritual traditions, perspectives, and practices for much of my life. All this time later, this book is one that has always stood out in my memory. I feel a great deal of respect and admiration for this book and its author.I only read it that once. I have not read it since. It is likely the only book I have read on Zen. For me it was really the only book I needed to read on Zen. It cuts to the essence of Zen and the Zen aspect of Buddhism.This review is based on the impression this book had on me at the time I read it.The lasting impression that I have from this book is that it provided and explained a very clear, simple, and direct approach to meditation. It also played a key part in inspiring me to pursue meditation at that relatively early age. I don't recall it going into much detail of the practical elements of meditation (such as giving instruction on specific techniques), but rather Suzuki takes the reader into an eloquent review of the state of mind one should bring to meditation or at least aim to cultivate through meditation practice and daily living. In my own experience Suzuki's elaboration on the nature of Zen Mind~Beginners Mind was more valuable and inspiring than giving detailing a meditation technique and practical instruction. Since reading this book, whatever technique of meditation I might be engaging in, I always (and quite habitually) bring to my meditation a state or intention of Beginner's Mind. This has helped me immensely. The specific technique one happens to be practicing ceases to be so important (not unimportant, just less important) and the approach to the technique takes precedence.So what is that approach?Reading this book gave me the lasting impression that a key to my path inward is to maintain an open, clear, and \\"beginner-like mind\\" (a mind that has no expectations because a beginner has no history of experience from which to draw any such expectations). In some way that I can not really put my finger on (I'd have to perhaps reread it to do that) this book changed my appreciation of life and reminded me of something key to my ongoing awakening and my spiritual journey.I've just taken a look at one page in ZMBM whilst writing this review... And I am instantly reminded that the other aspect of how this book impressed me was not only by giving me some valuable keys to how to approach meditation, but also how to approach life itself. To clarity that, I will add that when I say \\"how\\" I mean \\"how to approach living life and how to approach meditation\\", in a way that is wholesome and conducive to inner peace/stillness.I can see from some of the reviews I have read that, in my experience, a few reviewers have approached this book from a perspective of \\"how well does it portray various Buddhist traditions, or elements of certain Buddhist teachings and paths etc.\\" For me, in 15 years of hindsight, that all seems completely irrelevant, except perhaps to those for whom meditation and spirituality is simply an intellectual pursuit. The value of this book could easily get lost to anyone that brings a whole lot of intellectual religious knowledge to it, and therefore fails to receive the simple yet beautiful message held within its pages and embodied by the man that wrote it. Even now when I see the author's photo I feel a deep sense of love and respect for him... all as a result of the impact that reading this book (and applying it to my life) had on me when I was around 15 or so years of age.I don't think this book should be approached as some kind of traditional Zen text or Buddhist text. There are now plenty of these available--I suggest looking elsewhere if that's what you are seeking. I recall a simplicity about this book that moved and touched something deep within my spirit. Obviously Zen Mind has left a lasting impression... I read it at a time when the Internet as we know it didn't even exist... yet here I am all those years later writing this review !!In closing, if you are interested in understanding how to approach meditation, prayer, life, relationships, and just about any other human endeavor, in a way that brings about stillness of Being, then read this book. Not just once, but as many times as needed to really feel the essence of its gift within you.With blessings,Jonathan EvattPS. I will add that since reading this book I have awoken to and remembered a great deal with regards to the journey to Liberation and Inner Peace. Hence I will share that this book explores a small piece of the big picture... yet I recall that it does so in such a way that it's exploration of that small (but important) piece is of great value.People who enjoyed or are interested in this title might also enjoy the following titles. I most certainly did (read my reviews there for more info):The Supreme Source: The Fundamental Tantra of the Dzogchen SemdeSelf-Liberation: Seeing with Naked AwarenessIntroduction to Tantra : The Transformation of Desire"},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"This book, based upon a series of lectures, was not intended as a meditation guide by Suzuki-roshi...and perhaps that is why it is such a good meditation guide. I will not quibble with a recent reviewer who said that this is not necessarily the best book for those who are just encountering Zen--although I do quibble with that reviewer giving this only one star, partly based on the subjective observation that it isn't \\"fun\\" enough--as I can easily see how it can be a little befuddling for newcomers...but if you are interested in Buddhism, and have studied it a little, this is a great book for beginning your meditation practice.Like the aforementioned reviewer, I am sometimes bemused with the air of excessive solemnity and reverence of many books on Zen, Buddhism, and meditation--especially the way this air is reflected by their \\"fans,\\" followers, and reviewers-- but I, personally, do not find such an air in this book. I find Suzuki-roshi's style to be very straightforward, accessible, and warmly human, and this book is a quick and easy read from which you will get something new at each point along your path that you return to it. If you are interested in starting a meditation practice--and please don't concern yourself too much with what \\"school\\" of Buddhism to follow: imo too much discussion about this \\"school\\" or that, only serves to obscure a subject that's supposed to be about clarity--I suggest that you read this book; Mindfulness in Plain English by Ven. Henepola Gunaratana; and Peace is Every Step by Thich Nhat Hanh, first. There is nothing unique or revelatory about my choices for recommendations, but I have been meditating for more than eight years, I have read a lot of books on the subject, and these are my favorites by far; for their clarity, brevity, conciseness, and accessibility to westerners. Namaste."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"This is a priceless book. Suzuki has managed to distill Dogen's message and present it in a way which is both grounding (one into the moment of reading) and inspiring (one to be ever more aware). I have had this book for many years and it would probably have been the first choice for my Desert Island list.I am very impressed by the subtlety with which Trudy Dixon managed preserved Suzuki's impishness and her skills in conveying to us his genuine, good and compassionate heart as well as his unyielding dedication to practice. This is no shouting, riddle-making and stick-wielding rinzai guy - no, in these pages we encounter a gentle, self-deprecating and deeply compasionate master who is teaching us the wisdom of being in the moment, and helping us to find beauty in simplicity and kindness. There is a lot of dharma-power behind these words - Suzuki has been responsible for founding perhaps the largest and most successful zen community in the Western hemisphere. Why? because the sincerity and depth of his practice imbued unshakeable faith in zazen practice to anyone who met him, even for a moment. It will do the same for you. I strongly recommend this book ."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"Yes, if you spend yer time studying Sutras &amp; whatnot you'll find alot of contradictions between this book and those same sutras. But, I don't think that's so bad. Why should it be? The Sutras have alot of useful information, but alot of [stuff] too. For example, the Surangama Sutra would have you believe that drinking milk or eating meat or wearing leather would prevent you from enlightenment. &quot;Well, that's just put in there by a copyist!&quot; you might say, but still, it's obvious you cannot take a 100 percept literal interpretation of the sutras and still call it &quot;Zen&quot;. If you read the Sermons of Bodhidharma translated by Red Pine, they will tell you that even being a butcher does not hinder you so long as you realize the Mind. So, Bodhidharma, the supposed founder of Ch'an (Zen) in China contradicted the Sutras. You'd also have to deny all Tibetan Buddhism too, because if you want to stay alive up there in the cold mountains, you better eat some Yak. That having been said, this book is about Soto Zen Buddhism. The methods taught in this book are used by Soto Zennists. If you want another school of Zen, then buy another book. This book is not about Buddhist Metaphysics or Esotericism. It is about daily practice, attitude and understanding. It's not a meditation manual, or a daily devotional or liturgy or anything like that. It is a bunch of talks. And what extraordinary talks they are! You really get a feel of what it's about while reading this. Sure, the practices may contradict other forms of Zen, but you have to understand who he (Suzuki) was talking to and that time period. There is a bit of compromise there. That's Upaya, skillful means. He still teaches to obey the precepts, and that Zen is not just sitting [around]. He teaches you should have a Zen mind even when you are laying in bed. And he doesn't condemn studying Buddhism, he simply points out that practice is better than just studying. In fact, Bodhidharma himself taught this. So, despite the frothing-mouthed railings against this book by a confessed &quot;Theravadan&quot; (meaning Hinayanist, meaning one of the lesser vehicle), you ought to by this book if you want to learn about Soto Zen. It would do you good though to not just restrict yourself to this book and look into Chinese, Tibetan, Korean, and Vietnamese forms as well. I especially recommend Sheng Yen's &quot;Subtle Wisdom&quot;. This book does neglect such practices as Koans &amp; Huatous, but they are not the main practices of the schools. Soto school came from Cao Dong, and they emphasized Silent Illumination, which is pure awareness. Go buy it! It's cheap, and worth more than the money."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"A whole lot of zen - though don't be fooled, for a short and highly recommended book with \`beginner' in the title it's not as crisp and accessible as it appears.

(Or, if nothing else, by the end you'll have read \`This is a very, very important point' enough times to bludgeon buddha unconscious.)But if you're curious and just looking for a good book to learn about zen, you've got a beginner's mind already -- don't need a book to see that!

For me, this book was a personal adventure giving a shot at Zen but ending up not practicing it.If you like to try out Zen, pick up this book.

The book is quite thorough and saturated in practice. The title of the book, in essence, almost conveys the entire meaning of the book. The sections on posture are helpful, as are the various other areas the book addresses. The book is probably the most popular in the history of Zen, and I guess rightfully so. I personally have found more kinship to other teachers along the way, but Roshi Suzuki was always at the very least-and excellently insightful teacher. I simply have more of an affinity to, for one reason or another, his succesor Jakusho Kwong-roshi, or Zen Masters Seung Sahn and Taizan Maezumi.

It is a direct transmission of the Heart of the matter, the mysterious whisper of the Soul to Itself: Awake, Beloved! That which you are seeking has always and only been this very one who now peers through your eyes!"},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"Please refer to the criticism of this book as well as this review. You will notice that all of the negative reviews dwell on classical Buddhist doctrine, are replete with Buddhist jargon, and display an aspect of bitterness and destruction towards Suzuki's words. All of these points of contention are irrelevant to the nature of Zen and they are made in a way which is anathema to the fruition of Zen. All show ignorance of the presence of the aspect truth in all things. Including doctrines. And all are from encapsulations of truth themselves.Zen is not discovered through doctrine and is certainly never found in choosing between contradictory arguments. It is found in the realisation of the uniformity of all aspects of experience. The unity of experience found in the pluralism of experience. The contradictions exist because of how oneness implies otherness, so the concept of unity itself is a paradox. Making meaning, in the conventional sense, is a process of encapsulation. This is grammatical understanding. It cannot convey Zen understanding, Zen understanding removes the capsule.Negative reviews of this book exhibit the reinforcement of conceptual borders between concepts which do not exist in Zen understanding, but are always present in the discussion of concepts. Hence good Zen may dissuade you from love of all doctrine. Good Zen will even dissuade you from following Zen. Good Zen will not dispute. Good Zen doctrine will not be persuasive. When there is no persuasion, there is no doctrine, then there is Zen. Zen cannot be understood until after interest in good and bad ideas have dissolved. Good Zen will never tell you in which direction to look. Any particular direction is &quot;nonzense&quot;!Forget Zen! Just celebrate all things occuring and then walk freely. You have no need to chase truth. The enigma of truth exists in all places. You can experience Zen just by being where you are without complaint (hence meditation!). You cannot ever experience Zen understanding with dispute. Zen is non-dispute. Dispute with circumstances, whether here or there, obliterates understanding of Zen. Only the experience of the absolute truth which all things address is the true understanding of Zen.So bow down gratefully to ALL things.Discussing Zen with words is like offering a drink of water served in a seive!All your sensibilities have passed through you as clouds pass through sky. When you realise the sky is always air and water is never poison you may begin to understand Zen. You are changed in life and death in the same way that air changes in light and dark, as life in changed in wakefulness and sleep. You are changed by death in the same manner that writing changes when you stop reading. In the same way that meaning changes when you stop writing.If you know the original nature of things, then you will know you can recieve Zen by watching American Gladiators, or by being mugged in the street just as well as you can by reading Suzuki's book or this review. Probably much better! : )Trying to convey Zen in a book review is as practical an exercise as carrying water in a seive.Maybe instead of buying a book, buy a Simpsons video and experience Zen through that!If you read Suzuki's book, forget the doctrine and the Buddhist jargon, the meaning of Zen is not conveyed this way. It's much more effectively discussed in metaphor.I have never read a book that made a better job of conveying Zen metaphor than this one. A better book does not exist. To contradict the truth of this is to know nothing of Zen. To resist the contradiction is to know nothing of Zen. In Zen there is no dispute; in Zen the aspect of truth present in all things is known.Unfortunately, words are as apt a vessel for conveying reality in the mind as a crate of bottles are apt for transporting your reflection. Reality cannot be encapsulated in any way. Reality doesn't come in capsule form! How exactly is the notion of reality conveyed with the word &quot;reality&quot;? It really doesn't mean a thing!Writings carry meaning like little trays of broken glass. Zen is a mindstate that sees reality by looking directly at it, by dissolving ones particular notice of these fragments of glass and becoming aware of only the ether. Suzuki's book therefore is just a flicker in the ether. So is this review. So is the space you are sat in. So are the walls. It's all just breeze in the vapour. Pain and death. Gusts of air.Metaphor for mind and body: When the vapours that perturb the candle flame are removed, what happens to the candle flame?... The vapours that perturb the candle also provide fuel for the flame. Remove the cause of the buffeting and the burning ceases!"},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"I use this modest, beautiful book of Dharma talks as a daily devotional.

His book is very simple. Duality of life is referenced in every page and sometimes you feel like a ping pong ball, which I think was his point. The true value of Zen is to just sit, that's all.

Within this book, you will discern some beautifully poetic lines concerning everyday life. Rather than describe the book, I want to list a few of these precious gems with the intention that we should all implement these teachings in our daily life...\\"In your mind you create an idea of place separate from an actual time\\". How true is this? Nobody is saying not to plan ahead. Everyone must plan for school, work, everyday life etc. On the other hand, as human beings, we overdo everything. There is only one time - here/now. Stop wasting your life and appreciate the only moment you have -- this one.\\"The true purpose of ZEN is to see things as they are, to observe things as they are, and to let everything go as it goes\\". This is much easier said than done. It almost gives a feeling of resist nothing but just let things happen. Of course, we have to determine in life when and where the right time to step in is, but again, I think as human beings, we think we can control everything. Instead we should realize how things fit together, and simply watch them come and go of their own accord.\\"When you can do everything, whether it is good or bad, without disturbance or without being annoyed by the feeling, that is actually what we mean by form is form, and emptiness is emptiness. Knowing that your life is short, to enjoy it day after day, moment after moment, is the life of form is form, and emptiness is emptiness\\". This one truly speaks for itself so, must I go on?Needless to say, this book will be reread..."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":":This was read in college 1996. Highlighted key parts and now It has been working it's way back to me because it has been going form one person to the next because they have seen how at peace I have become and those that have followed in my foot prints.It is a good feelinging.

It gave some history and theory. He is humorous and easy to read. I will use it as a reference and am glad to have it in my library."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"This is clearly one of the best books I have ever read. I found page after page full of deep thoughts and ideas that I have often wondered about throughout my life. This was my first book on Zen and I chose it because of the numerous excellent reviews and I must say that I concur. I will also admit that I did not understand all of the teachings. On one page I would find deep answers to the questions I have long asked in my life and then on the next page I would have no idea what the author was talking about. Most of the confusion comes on the subject of non-dualism, which for a Westerner is probably the hardest concept to comprehend in Zen.The book is formed from a series of talks given by Shunyru Suzuki over many years, each comprising a short chapter of the book usually 4-6 pages long. The layout of the book is very straightforward and I found it beneficial to read one or two chapters a day. Although it does touch briefly on meditation (zazen), this book focuses primarily on the philosophy of Zen. Because of this, anyone can read and appreciate the book. You don't have to be a Buddhist or meditate on a regular basis to enjoy the knowledge found within \\"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind\\". Fundamental concepts such as \\"the only thing we can change is ourselves\\", \\"we have suffering in our lives because of our attachments\\" and \\"let everything go as it goes\\" apply to our everyday lives in a very powerful way.It is important to realize that according to the teachings of Zen, enlightenment is found through the practice of zazen. A Sensei at the Zen Center told me, \\"If we could reach enlightenment through intellectual understanding, there would be no need for meditation\\". To fully understand the difficult teachings found in this book, such as non-dualism, we must realize them over a long period of time through meditation. This is why I don't think anyone can fully grasp everything within this book, the first time they are exposed to the concepts of Zen.Regardless of your religious beliefs and whether or not you ever intend to meditate or further study Zen, this book offers a wealth of knowledge in a very practical, every day setting.Good Luck and enjoy the journey."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"I can't count how many times I have read this book. this book is the rudder in my life."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"This book is a great into to Zen.

It's a great book for those who have read a lot of self help and are looking for something 'deeper' and more challenging. Something to flex your mind muscles! The language is clear and the book is not as esoteric as other Zen writings. The ideas are sometimes complex and therefore difficult to absorb, but this is why you want to read it, because once you get it, the wisdom is priceless. It definitely is a good, serious read on the subject of Zen."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"This book was recommended to me by my meditation teacher. I am enjoying it very much.

It's one of those books where a single line can change your life. It's worth reading and re-reading because the content must be penetrated experientially.That's Zen."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"As it so happens, even non-SFZC-affiliated American and European Zen centers typically advise their students to read this book as a primer on contemporary Zen/Ch'an Buddhist practice, and for ample reason.Reading this book is not a monumental brain exercise so much as a thawing and relaxing of one's own rigidly cherished preferences. Shunryu Suzuki's carefully edited lectures come across as fatherly and truly encouraging, while also being somewhat remarkably BS-free. Suzuki was a character, often called \\"Crooked Cucumber\\" as a lazy pond-frequenting boy by his own teacher in Japan. He relates to us that it is important to take care of the total self while still being strict on oneself in Zen practice, which, as anyone who has tried knows, is exceptionally difficult to do. Goals and accomplishment-seeking is thrown out the window as it is more popularly today, due in no small degree to his influence. A strking, instructive personableness and benelovent modesty are what persist in my mind of this man, from reading this book. The impact is remarkably subtle. It advances and retreats as we do, refusing to be fully framed in a way I still can't account for. I go back and read it sometimes when in need of a Zen \\"reality-check\\" and it typically does the trick."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"Every time I pick up this small book to read a short chapter or two, Shunryu Suzuki's words are as fresh and new as if I've read them the first time. And I come away thinking of life, not in our society's terms of goal-oriented productivity, but in terms of the quality of my self-expression, the sincerity of my behavior in the present moment. In that respect, the author's view of zen practice is not of a process whereby one can arrive at enlightenment, but as a way of being deeply in touch with what is going on right now. And through-out he reveals how precious and sacred the present moment really is. I highly recommend this book; it is a tribute to life itself."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"There are several books about meditation that I have enjoyed. This is my favorite. Shunryu Suzuki speaks from a freshness and a directness that allowed me to get the living flavor of Zen meditation. It does not feel \\"about Zen\\" but \\"from Zen\\". I would ponder single sentences, usually intellectually paradoxical, for weeks and find my experience of my present moment was thereafter deeper, more silent, and richer. I learned to value \\"beginner's mind\\" and stay a learner, to come from not knowing into the moment, and be okay with learning as I go. Over 20 years later, what was learned has still been useful. My favorite chapters are \\"God giving\\" and \\"Constancy\\". To me, these two chapters are the whole book in condensed form."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"I found this book accurate, interesting and enlightening (no pun intended). I have been studying Zen meditation with a Zen Buddhist monk for a short time and found this book to accurately echo the basic teachings I have been learning. The lessons in the book are clearly explained, and as the title depicts, even a beginner's mind will get the messages without any trouble. Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind is excellent for the Zen novice, but I'm sure even practiced Zen students will learn something from the simple, beautifully written text."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"I practiced Zen Buddhism for many years and over that time accumulated a small library of books on the subject. I found ZMBM by accident in a bookstore in the 70s' and bought it. After reading it I literally threw all of my other books on Buddhism away. There was no longer any reason for me to own them unless I wanted some encyclopedic information and that is not what Buddhism is all about.The information in this book can change your life. I mean profoundly. Relax. Read it. Enjoy it. It's simple to understand and will prove itself a lifetime companion. If you lost a loved one - get it. If you know someone in prison - get it for them. If you want to live a better life - get it. Don't worry. It won't make you quit your job or join a cult. On the contrary. You will do a better job wherever you find yourself."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"As a '60's flower child, I purchased my copy of this gem when it first came out in 1970. It was my mainstay through all the years that I practiced zazen meditation (often now referred to as &quot;Mindfulness Meditation&quot;). Over the years, my practice fell off until now - when I find my mind continually racing between work, home life, managing a couple of websites, keeping up with e-mail and music practice! I found myself remembering the sustenance and simplicity this book offered and purchased a copy, my first edition having been lost somewhere many years ago. I was delighted to see that the original publisher has kept it in the exact same format and paper quality as the first edition, so I felt the literal presence of an old friend in my hands. Although written from a Zen Buddhist perspective, it is truly non-denominational, and its practice of stilling the mind complements any religious/spiritual tradition - or none at all, if that is your personal choice. Especially for the modest price, this is the best. You need search no further - it's all here."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"After reading several reviews where the reviewer got this mistaken impression from the title, I felt I had to say something.I love this book, but it is NOT a manual for how to begin the practice of Zen. The Beginner's Mind refers to a state of being, an attitude that Suzuki-roshi urged his students to adopt - one where the mind is open and supple and able to receive the wisdom of being in this world in this very moment.I truly love these essays and what they reveal of Suzuki-roshi's heart and his understanding of Zen. But if you want a &quot;how to&quot;, this is not the place to start. I might recommend An Invitation to Practice Zen by Albert Low as a short, beginner's manual for how to actually practice."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"I purchased this book in 1985 when I began meditating. It has been my closest companion ever since. I also own the audio tapes - now completely worn out from listening and re-listening to this book. I can't recommend any book more highly than this one for those seeking to develop themselves through meditation.Over thirty years of meditation, and I was so fortunate to get this book at the start. This book became the heart of me, and I often recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"ZEN MIND, BEGINNER'S MIND is the most easily accessible guide to Zen practice, and is usually the first book that new practitioners and the Zen-curious approach after reading the more general \\"What's Zen Anyway?\\"-type books. Thus, it has developed an almost canonical reputation. Shunryu Suzuki (1905-1971) spent only a few years in America, was less than fluent in English, and taught in a way that was both simple and yet profound. With his easy intensity, Suzuki had a seminal role in establishing Zen as a viable spiritual practice in the United States and beyond.Notable for its brevity, the thesis of the collected \\"informal talks\\" in ZEN MIND, BEGINNER'S MIND is that in order to know Zen we must know the self; that in order to know the self we must reattain the \\"beginner's mind,\\" that unclouded, intuitive understanding of life that was ours in childhood; and that this sense of newness is the linchpin of enlightenment. Although ZEN MIND, BEGINNER'S MIND only spans a whopping 138 pages, the length of this book is no guide to the quality of what lies within. It invites many readings.***AUDIOBOOK REVIEWDramatic actor Peter Coyote has been a Zen practitioner for three decades, and here reads Suzuki-Roshi's classic in his well-modulated stentorian voice, without flourishes, but with a fine appreciation of Suzuki-Roshi's words. The print edition of ZEN MIND, BEGINNER'S MIND is a collection of transcribed spontaneous Zen teachings (teisho); Coyote returns those words to their original medium. A fine recording for teaching, meditation, or contemplation, the only drawback to this CD is that it abridges the book, though at three hours it is more than sufficient for most listeners."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"After I read Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind I looked at the front cover for some inspiration for writing my thoughts on it and noticed - for the first time - that it says \\"Informal talks on Zen meditation and practice\\" and that's exactly what it is - and it's very important to keep that in mind as you're reading.I've never been to a Zendo, but this book is exactly what I imagined the chats or talks that are done after meditation would be like.Shunryu Suzuki has a wonderful perspective and shares easily about what the practice is. I left this book with a different view on meditation as the practice - as the actual doing of the practice.I liked that there's no smoke and mirrors that you tend to get with Zen content. This is very straightforward and exceptionally helpful for those who are doing or thinking of doing the practice - meditation."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"This book is about western pop-psychology for depressed materialists who are seeking some form of \\"spiritual\\" self-help in the guise of \\"religion\\". Shunryu Suzuki's book appeals to a certain class of Guru-loving types. This book is entirely devoid of any content whatsoever as concerns scriptural Buddhism and what it did or did not teach by the historical Gotama circa 550 BCE India, Ganges river valley.If you threw Confucianism, Taoism, Shintoism, Japanese spiritual materialism and western psychology-cultism into a blender, THIS book would be the result. If your interested in Buddhism, as it exists in ITS teachings, purchase a non-secular translation of the Nikayas/Suttas published by CAF Rhys Davids thru the British Pali Text Society or read the Upanishads to learn about the Monism that was and is Buddhism.Buddhism was a 5th century BC Sramanism, or commentarial school of Vedanta (Upanishads). Sadly so say, those American who DO want to actually learn about Buddhism see stuff like \\"this\\" on the bookshelves rather than the teachings of the Buddha. Sadly to say for this book \\"Zen mind beginners mind\\", Buddhism, after 100 schizms and passing thru both china, Tibet and finally into Japan 1400 years later,...this is far removed from the oldest texts and philosophy we have to say what is or is not the \\"doctrine of the Buddha\\". If you want to know about Buddhism, get Dr. Coomaraswamy \\"The Living Thoughts of Gotama Buddha\\", and avoid the pop-psychology books written in the ilk of Japanese Zen, which is 179 degrees from Buddhism."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"I read with interest all the other reviews and thought this would be a good book to get some insight into Zen meditation. Please...... what a joke. The most obvious thing is that there are no drawings to help with various poses that are mentioned in the book. It would help to make sure you are interpretating the instructions correctly to have a drawing or better yet a picture as a reference. Nooooooo.... that would be neither here nor there. If you understand that then you have this Zen thing down. There is nothing beginning like about this book and further more the examples don't really get over the concepts very well. Well although there is no good or bad in the Zen world... in my world there is and this is it. It stinks to high heaven.

Like some form of Anti-Buddhism the late Authors lack of any understanding of Fundamental Buddhism as put forth in Buddhist Scripture, this books is the anti-matter of Buddhism laid down by the first Buddhist council regarding essence and nature of the Anagamin path laid out to the Aryan Disciplehood who laid down the path of self-deliverance in the Scriptures. In no way shape or form can this book be regarded as anything other than Trite Soto Sectarian formalism under the guise of Buddhism. not only is nothing within the covers dirrectly AFFIRMABLE through Scripture but there are countless spots upon which it contradicts the Buddhist Suttas completely. This is Modern Zen. it is not Buddhism in even the most loose sense of the definition. The state of American Buddhism is in direct correlation to the popularity of this horendeous book which has nothing to do with the Ancient Buddhist Dhamma laid out in the Nikayas or the Agamas (Buddhist Scriptures). More Ironic than can be imagined is that this book is defended so highly by the same people that ALSO hold the Scriptures to be correct on the teachings of Buddhism, but when pointed out that the Scriptures in no way shape or form agree with the esoteric ranting of the Author, its supporters are dumbfounded and remain silent and or change the subject. More pure Irony than this is impossible to find in Buddhism."},{"Title":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","review":"This book is factually the pinnacle of depravity of those few books that attempt to propagate the Dharma but end up Blaspheming it instead. Completely and utterly lacking the Jewel mind of an awakened Master of the Buddha Dharma Shunryu Suzuki has managed to produce the Dictionary equivalent of a Successful Disaster in the Buddhist English Literary world. Countless points of innumerable contention lie hidden like Mara in the pages of his book for those of ill equipped comprehensions of the Dharma to enslave the minds into having a wholly incorrect and vile misconception of the Dharma as put forth by the late Shunryu Suzuki. Cross comparatively the book sinks like so much rubbish to the bottom of the swill pool when the intrinsic nature of the book is even loosely examined. Suzukis shallow understanding of the transmundane antithesis of humanistic doldrums and philoanahilistic prose make Buddhism highest goal to be nothing more that sublime misery manifesting itsself as Zazen as opposed to unparalleled enlightenment breakthrough of understanding of the Dharmakaya through unconditional practice of the profundidty of insight through grasp of the Orthodox Dharma and continuous manifestations of faith from determination to uncover the great Matter and come to profound enlightenment through successive multitudes of Kenshos (breakthroughs). Suzukis OWN WORDS that are laughable and yet at the same time sorrowful for his pathetic lack of understanding of the Dharma are as follows: &quot;THE MOST INPORTANT THING IN OUR PRACTICE ARE OUR POSTURE AND OUR WAY OF BREATHING,WE ARE NOT SO CONCERNED ABOUT A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF BUDDHISM. AS A PHILOSOPHY BUDDHISM IS A.....&quot; this is one among a MULTITUDE of pathetic examples of his lack of any grasp of the holly Dharma. Where can you sort out the trash from a mountain of trash? IF you wish to practice shikentaza (blank minded meditation) this is a fine example of it to buy. I truly CRY however honestly cry at the thought that SO many people searching for info on Buddhism find this book and read it and reread it. Buddhism dear friends is NOT a philosophy nor is it nihilistic self indulgent meditation. Meditation is small facet of the innumerable expedients to achieve profound understanding in Buddhism. The Buddha himself on countless occasions you can read will tell you forthwith that UNDERSTANDING is paramount and yet people praise Suzuki for his Blasphemy. But i understand that most praise are from so called &quot;casual&quot; Buddhists that have never even picked up a Sutra much less read one page form one. I lay now my life down to you in promise that this book in no way is the Buddhism of the Ancients, my life i swear to you on this. pick up a scripture if you wish to find out about Buddhism and dont be mistaken by this book or its New Age popularity.

Shipler describes this country in a way that is captivating to the reader. He talks about the everyday lives of many ordinary people, the corruption and the harships that many faced in this fascinating and mysterious country. Chapter 4 is a somewhat sociological study on class and social mobilty, but this chapter and the rest of the book read like a non-fiction novel.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Performance by Design: Computer Capacity Planning By Example","review":"This team of authors has produced yet another invaluable book for practitioners who perform capacity and performance planning, as well as students who are introduced to this topic for the first time. Unlike earlier works by the authors, which addressed performance in specific systems environments such as client/server, e-business and web services, this book is more general. Therein lies the true value - it teaches the fundamentals and will not be soon outdated.The book is structured into two parts - Part I consists of four chapters that lay the foundation. Chapter 1 covers system life cycles, Chapter 2 moves the reader from systems to descriptive models of the systems, and Chapters 3 and 4 delve into the essence of performance - quantifying performance models and giving a performance engineering methodology. This material is reinforced with five chapters, each of which is a case study of a specific performance problem. These include database services, web servers, data center, e-business services and help-desk services.Part II, The Theory of Performance Engineering, addresses the underlying knowledge that performance and capacity planners will need in order to approach their tasks using true quantitative methods. The six chapters in this part of the book cover the following topics in detail, and are clearly and succinctly written: Markov models, single queue systems, single class MVA (Mean Value Analysis), queuing models with multiple classes, queuing models with load dependent devices, and non product-form queuing models. Armed with a knowledge of these fundamentals you should be able to tackle complex performance and capacity problems, both in the software engineering domain when a system is being designed, and in the operational support domain when service level management and availability are the goals. In addition to the way the authors step you through complex math in a clear, easy-to-understand manner, this material is augmented by Microsoft Excel workbooks that bring the material to life. Nearly every chapter has associated workbooks and spreadsheets that can be downloaded from the web site that supports this book, adding considerably to the value of the material.If you are new to performance planning as a discipline this should be the first book you read on the subject. If you teach performance planning, this is an ideal text around which you can base a curriculum that will prepare your students for real world challenges."},{"Title":"Performance by Design: Computer Capacity Planning By Example","review":"&quot;Performance by Design&quot; provides both a conceptual and a practical framework for experienced software developers that want to get started building quality applications using performance engineering techniques.Performance engineering is a discipline that attempts to integrate concerns about the responsiveness of computer applications and their capacity requirements into standard application development practices, which otherwise focus almost exclusively on meeting functional requirements. Just like not getting the functional spec right in the early stages of the application development lifecycle can lead to a cascading series of design and implementation decisions that are difficult to reverse in later stages of the development process, neglecting performance considerations until after the applications has met its functional requirements is often too late to tackle them effectively.The first part of the book surveys a wide range of performance modeling and capacity planning techniques, served up in clear, concise language with a minimum of mathematics. It is a gentle introduction to analytic queuing networks written at the level that any advanced undergraduate Computer Science student ought to be able to master. The heart of the book, representing Chapters 5 through 9, is a series of Case Studies that rounds out and concludes Part 1. Each of the case studies deftly illustrates another analytic technique that a performance engineer needs to understand how to apply. Chapter 5, for instance, steps through descriptive statistics and cluster analysis as it discusses what is involved in deriving model parameters for a simple database transaction workload. Chapter 6 builds upon this discussion by solving a simple multi-class model, delving into confidence limits and the use of a factorial design to limit the number of trials of a benchmark experiment. Finally, Chapter 9 illustrates using software performance engineering techniques to model a new application during its initial development phases, beginning with the database design.The first half of the book is designed to stand alone if the Reader doesn't have the stomach for the rigorous mathematical treatment of analytic queuing models that characterizes Part 2. The second half of the book should be familiar territory to readers of Menasce's other books on performance modeling, beginning with Markov chains and proceeding through Mean Value Analysis. The final two chapters describe approaches to modeling serialization delays and servers that have load-dependent performance characteristics, two topics that are essential to accurate models of application-level performance.The great challenge of the performance engineering approach is how to persuade experienced applications developers to adopt these techniques. &quot;Performance by Design&quot; is aimed at getting software developers to pay closer attention to performance concerns throughout the application development life cycle. Compared to other books on the subject, this may be the best attempt yet to promote the practice of performance engineering as a discipline that deserves to be integrated into the wider context of application development."},{"Title":"Performance by Design: Computer Capacity Planning By Example","review":"I purchased this book on sight, having had Dr Menasce's class. It is a reasonably easy introduction to his brand of performance modeling. I don't understand why this approach isn't more well known.His operating systems class was one of the most memorable that I took at GMU (over a decade ago). I don't know how many other Operating Systems professors take his approach in focusing on queuing theory in modeling performance problems, but his approach is enlightening.Using one of his performance models, we were (in class) able to tweak the performance characteristics of the various (modeled) components and watch bottlenecks move from one device to another, underscoring how you can reach a point where improving performance in the wrong component can be a waste, while making small improvements in the bottleneck can provide much better (often linear) improvements."},{"Title":"Performance by Design: Computer Capacity Planning By Example","review":"Capacity and Performance management is a very complex subject. I have read a couple of books. Most of them had dry theory without supporting examples. In some cases, I abruptly stopped reading. These type of books may be good to people who are quite fresh from the academic world. Having worked for sometime, one would desire a book with simple but strong fundamentals and more of relating examples.This book stood out to my quest. The pace of the coverage was gradual from Gear 1 to Overdrive. Every ounce of theory was supported with examples. Normally I would skip theory and look for examples. But here I enjoyed reading theory. Well Written!The Case Studies were real world examples. I gained a lot reading this book. Would recommend this book for Technology professionals who want to switch to Capacity and Performance Management.I would definitely want Mr Menasce and his team to write books on the same topic to address real world end-to-end and new challenges like Petri Nets, Technology Consolidation, Data Warehousing, GRID, Utility Computing, Virtualisation etc. This should definitely help the Technology Community at large."},{"Title":"Performance by Design: Computer Capacity Planning By Example","review":"You can get all the basis about performance, quality of services, an additionally can go indeep in that concept.

But his mind is full of the voices of 78 people who died in a train wreck almost 25 years ago. Peter feels responsible; he is sure he caused their deaths but isn't certain how. In the lighthouse, as the coast tears away at the shore, he hears their voices, accusations and sometimes even their kindness. Peter lives like a hermit, going to town only for food and supplies and talking to no one. But the arrival of Imogen Doody forces him out of his exile and back into the world of the living.Clare Morrall's sophomore effort, following ASTONISHING SPLASHES OF COLOUR (a Booker Prize finalist) centers on Peter and Imogen as they navigate a tenuous and emotional relationship that makes each deal with their tragic past and their hopes for the future.Imogen, or \\"Doody,\\" is a school caretaker, an angry woman with no friends and a strained relationship with her family. She discovers she has inherited a cottage on the Devon coast from a godfather she never knew. The cottage is a dream come true, a place to be alone with her thoughts and perhaps even finish the novel she half-heartedly has been working on. But the cottage is also a disaster, abandoned and decrepit, and she has neither the money nor the know-how to fix it up. It is her activity in the cottage that attracts Peter, and he talks with his first living person in years when he meets Doody. Her anger flashes again and again and he retreats to his lighthouse again and again, but they eventually come to something of a truce and begin to work on the cottage together.Over time they open up to each other and discover that both were emotionally scarred and damaged 25 years ago --- Peter with the train wreck and Doody when her husband abandoned her never to be heard from again. Could the events be related? And why does the discovery that Doody has also inherited a small plane make Peter so upset? What happened to Doody's husband, and what happened when Peter last flew a plane almost 25 years ago?Although Morrall's book is not a mystery, these questions and others haunt the narrative as they do the characters.NATURAL FLIGHTS OF THE HUMAN MIND is a beautiful, thoughtful and thoroughly successful novel. Morrall's characters seem and act real; while the foundational events are quite extraordinary, Peter and Doody are just normal people who are lonely and guilty and more than a little afraid of relationships and the future.Morrall's prose is lovely and quite readable. This is serious stuff without being heavy, and character-driven without being dull. And there is resolution without easy answers or clich&eacute;s. This is also a novel that is creative in its description and use of setting. The lighthouse seems to be crumbling along with the shore as Peter explores the truth of his responsibility and the world at large intrudes upon his solitude. Doody must clear away the years of misuse to find the beauty and functional space in the cottage.Guilt, grief, family, forgiveness, tragic pasts, drama, an unforgettable setting and uniquely drawn characters --- this novel has it all.--- Reviewed by Sarah Rachel Egelman"},{"Title":"Natural Flights Of The Human Mind","review":"After reading Clare Morrall's 'Astonishing Splashes of Colour', which was fantastic, I was thrilled to see this second novel published so soon.

Barbero, an Italian historian, offers a synthesis of the battle that provides unusually equal coverage of all the participants without taking sides. Barabero's narrative ranges from the perspective of Allied and French commanders Wellington, Blutcher, and Napoleon down to the level of individual soldiers, without letting any one perspective dominate the story. Barbero's method of recounting the Battle of Waterloo is also unique in focusing more on the experiences of different units and less on the normal but arbitrary division of the battle into five phases. This method emphasizes the continuity of the combat and highlights the incredible strain this day-long battle placed on those units that were in the very thick of the fighting. In particular, Barbero brings out how desparately close the Allied line on Mont Saint Jean came to breaking in the closing hours of Waterloo and how the Prussians overcame a variety of challenges to reach the battlefield. Barbero's synthesis of events leaves the reader with a sense of the sheer horror the survivors must have felt at what was an incredibly bloody battle, even by the standards of the Napoleonic wars.Barbero passes perhaps too quickly over the preliminary combats at Quatre Bras and Ligny that set the stage for Waterloo. His contention that the deployment of Lobau's corps to the French right flank was in support of D'Erlon rather than a response to the advance of the Prussians is a plausible if different reading of events. His assertion that the Imperial Guard advanced in square rather than column or mixed order during its final assualt on the Mount Saint Jean line is bold but seemingly at varience with the battle drill of the day and with the interpretations of most historians.Barbero's prose flows smoothly. John Cullen's translation of the text into English is very nearly seamless; this reviewer noted only a handful of passages with awkward phrasing.This book is highly recommended to both the casual reader of history and to the devoted student of the Napoleonic Wars. The casual reader will find it both entertaining and educational; the keen student will find a different perspective on Waterloo worth pondering."},{"Title":"Mental Reality","review":"Strawson's book is noteworthy for its declaration of faith: faith that naturalism-monism-materialism is true. (Naturalism-monism-materialism is the doctrine that there is no supernatural realm and that everything that is real is material or made out of matter. From now on I will refer to this simply as materialism.) Noteworthy because Strawson insists that materialism cannot explain or understand conscious experience as material, but that no sane person denies that conscious experience is real.All declarations of faith raise the question Why this faith rather than some other? In Strawson's case the pertinent question is Why monism rather than dualism, and, indeed, Why not a supernatural realm as well as a natural one?With respect to the former question, Strawson is ingenious, though, as he brings out, Locke was there first. The essence of Strawson's ingenuity here is this. Dualism comes under severe pressure to posit an immaterial stuff that the mind is which somehow makes possible thoughts, memories, etc. This immaterial stuff turns out to be such that one does not and cannot know its nature. But this allows that this allegedly immaterial stuff may, for all we know, be material, for \`matter may very well have properties of which one has no idea and that can indeed be the basis of...experiential goings-on.' Once Strawson has made this argument, I believe that, though he himself does not say this, considerations of simplicity favor monism, not to mention the avoidance of the notorious mind-body problem.I am not entirely happy with Strawson's answer to Why monism rather than dualism? But space does not permit me to bring out why here.I conclude with the question about a supernatural realm. Strawson says that there is no satisfactory account of mental phenomena to be found in contemporary science or philosophy or anywhere else. He suggests that this is either because some mental phenomena are fundamental, like electrical charge, or because we do not have the revolutionary physics needed to give such a satisfactory account. But why not think about a supernatural explanation for mental phenomena? There's much precedent here: What explains the Big Bang? What explains life's origin? Etc. If there's no natural answers to these questions, why not look to supernatural answers? Perhaps the reason not to is brought out by paraphrasing William James: Supernaturalism is an outbirth of that sort of philosophizing whose great maxim, according to Dr. Hodgson, is: \`Whatever you are totally ignorant of, assert to be the explanation of everything else?'"},{"Title":"Mental Reality","review":"Not really an introductory text, but useful for putting one'smind in order after reading around the subject.

In this series the first Studs Terkel book reviewed was that of his \\"The Good War\\": an Oral History of World War II\\".Strangely, as I found out about the recent death of long time pro-working class journalist and general truth-teller \\"Studs\\" Terkel I was just beginning to read his \\"The Good War\\", about the lives and experiences of, mainly, ordinary people during World War II in America and elsewhere, for review in this space. As with other authors once I get started I tend to like to review several works that are relevant to see where their work goes. In the present case the review of Working: People Talk About What They Do All Day And How They Feel About What They Do serves to reflect on a time a couple of decades ago when people may have been resigned about their working career but had a feeling that it did not express all of what they were. Given today's uncertain economic climate and the wider fears about the effects of the long term trend \\"globalization\\" which particularly threatens many lower- skilled or easily transferable jobs I am not sure that such interesting reflections on their work experiences would be forthcoming from today's working population.Although Terkel has cast a wide net on the range of occupations and types of work that he presents here it is weighted toward blue collar working people: the waitresses, bartenders, service personnel and the like with whom he had such affinity. The most interesting aspect of this effort is that almost universally the work that people do does not reflect on their capacities. In short, the job is not the measure of the person. That said, I believe, intentionally or not, this little treasure trove of interviews is one of the great arguments for socialism: the creation of a society where an energetic waitress or a well-read steelworker, for example, could break out and become a leader of society. A place where every cook can take a turn at governing. That is the real message that these interviewees are trying, unsuccessfully for the most part, to articulate. How to successfully do that, however, is a separate and frustratingly hard politcal and organizational question that I have argues about elsewhere.One thing that I noticed immediately after reading this book, and as is true of the majority of Terkel's interview books, is that he is not the dominant presence but is a rather light, if intensely interested, interloper in these stories. For better or worse the interviewees get to tell their stories, unchained. In this age of 24/7 media coverage with every half-baked journalist or wannabe interjecting his or her personality into somebody else's story this was, and is, rather refreshing. Of course this journalistic virtue does not mean that Studs did not have control over who got to tell their stories and who didn't to fit his preoccupations and sense of order. He has a point he wants to make and that is that although most \\"ordinary\\" people do not make the history books they certainly make history, if not always of their own accord or to their own liking. Again, kudos and adieu Studs."},{"Title":"Working","review":"This culturally significant novel is a must for anyone interested in American studies, labor issues, oral history, etc..

How about the last time that you said hello to the person at the drive-through window? The postman?

These people help us continue with our everyday lives, yet we do not awknowledge them, thank them, or commend them on a job that would get done if they were not there. Instead we look down upon them, our kids do not want to become them, yet thousands of people go to work everyday loathing their jobs, because they never seem to get a pat on the back, a smile, or a simple thanks. This book has made me want to go back in time and thank every person that is apart of the working claas, that has ever helped me."},{"Title":"Working","review":"His words still announce the worlds and words of people. One frequently sees references to the common (wo)man, as though they are \\"the other people\\" and not \\"us\\". Terkel writes of what were then current events, vocations, and hopes and dreams. Now, approaching a half century later, many of those jobs no longer exist; the hopes of dreams of people like those interviewed have scarcely changed. Now Terkel's tome is history, rather than current fodder for conversation of the common condition. Work is still work; dreams are still dreams; hope remains unfulfilled for many. It may be a ripe time for rewiring of this classic, so in reading it, we can become better acquainted with those who set the cornerstones for the world we know today."},{"Title":"Working","review":"Studs Terkel's \\"Working\\" is simple genius on multiple levels. On the surface, it is a demographic report, cataloging the work and the workers. Then, it is a social experiment, tracking the connections from person to person and from job to job. Additionally, it is an historical perspective, chronicling the times and its enterprise. Still deeper, it is a therapy session, recording thoughts, feelings, and thoughts about feelings. And at its core, it is a commentary on being human, witnessing the juxtaposition between have-to and want-to.This book is at once predictable and surprising. A reader could be tempted to read selectively, skimming through some professions or personalities while absorbing every word of others... but he won't want to. The similarities from job to job, worker to worker, attitude to attitude are uncanny. It seems undeniable that, regardless of the times, the labor, or the laborer, the more things change, the more they stay the same. The reader will be amazed by the number of times he finds himself sympathizing with, agreeing with, laughing with, and commiserating with each jobholder. The stories are well-known; the reactions are startlingly insightful. To quote Mike LeFevre, a steelworker: \\"What do I think of on a Sunday night? Lord, I wish . . . I could do something else for a living.\\"The universal truths of the working reality are eloquently expressed in the inward reflections of the collective. As humans, we are always overworked and underpaid; we never seem to get enough sleep. Each thinks that he's working harder than anyone else and that if it weren't for him, the whole operation would crumble. The old-timers think the whipper-snappers have zero respect and even less work ethic; the whipper-snappers think the old-timers move too slowly and are too resistent to change. Management thinks the subordinates are constantly attempting to get away with something; and the subordinates think management just doesn't get it. There is invariably that one co-worker who is just simply obnoxious/annoying/incompetent/lazy. There is simultaneous pride and shame in our work and a nagging need to justify or defend. And underneath it all, there is an eternal conflict between plans, dreams, and realities that never seems to be reconciled.And therein lies the golden nugget in \\"Working\\" - Terkel's ability to take the spoken word and edit onto the printed page in such as way as to connect speaker and reader in a meaningful space. Terkel plays the role of therapist as each patient reclines on the couch of working America and offers a stream-of-consciousness outpouring of his soul. The reader gets an education about jobs he has heretofore never pondered and about daily life in the early 1970s while also getting a momentary glimpse into the psyche of his fellow man and into himself."},{"Title":"Working","review":"Put it by your bed. Read the stories of a couple of people every night."},{"Title":"Working","review":"This is a great book. It shows how real people feel about the job that they perform by interviewing them. Terkel describes his legacy of taped interviews this way: &quot;It's the ordinary people, so called, who have things that they wanted to say all their lives, so this is something of a treasury I'd say.&quot; You read about it all, from waiters to teachers, from people who play sports to the people who work in offices. You learn that in order to be happy in life you must follow your dream and not do something based on status or salary. Many times people are being deprived of the potential joys in work when we are trained to focus too much on status and salary. Its better to wake up every morning looking forward to working than living a life full of regrets."},{"Title":"Working","review":"This is a fascinating book. Filled with brief, antecdotal stories of people narrowing down their lives to reflections on their jobs, the very souls of many of these people shine through. People good and bad, generous and selfish, greedy, self-absorbed, charitable and open-hearted, Terkel has captured more than just an historical document chronicling the present-past-tense viewpoints of a handful of citizens, but has exposed a universal understanding of differences of opinion throughout the nation. People speak, sometimes angry, often full of regret and a sense of meaninglessness or loss, and they tell the story of human aspiration and dreams. For all the increasingly irrelevent references to issues and phenomenon of the early 1970s, for every comment on times gone by dimming increasingly into the past, there remains a profound relevence for every civilization to come (and no doubt every one that preceded the subjects) regarding the very search for meaning in our lives.I could rarely recommend a more powerful book dealing almost esclusively with the conscience and so I urge you, when times look either up or down, to browse through this rather hefty tome and think deeply down into yourself and wonder if you are truly pleased with the direction of your life. Herein some of the most brazenly arrogant and humbly neglectful people relate both their triumphs and regrets. Somehow master-interviewer Terkel was allowed access to all of these demons pigeonholed beneath the romanticized personas people tend to put on when attempting to define themselves.Buy this, read this.

What struck me about the people in this book was that almost all of them are busy doing work they don't really care for, and which many of them downright hate. They feel trapped and are unhappy, but they stick at it because they have bills to pay. The people who in contrast were doing work that they *loved* had a magical time of it. They were also few and far between. After I read this I questioned why people choose to make themselves unhappy at work they hate, when they could (as we say these days but didn't, then) \\"follow their bliss\\" and find what gives them joy.

This was my first in terms of reading a book like this, a sort of oral history as the author/publisher puts it of a multitude of Americans in different fields and professions primarily during the 1970's.Watching old documentaries and interviews just doesn't really do it for me when it comes to learning about the past and I was looking for something that would. So I happened to be in B&N; one day - this was under the bargain priced books and I picked it up. Among the more exciting/interesting interviews are the life of a policeman, truck driver, car salesman, airline stewardess, hooker, garbage man, janitor, pharmacist, baseball & tennis players, fireman, and librarian.I'll just briefly recap a few of the ones above that really caught my interest. The truck driver was fascinating because at times I'd like to drive a truck for a few months at a time, but you learn just how involved you have to be and just how hard it is on your family over the long haul. It pays fairly well, but you have to contend with it just being me, myself, and I on the road for hundreds and hundreds of miles every few days. The driver makes it sound like if you enjoy talking to yourself and having intelligent conversation, then truck driving is indeed the job for you. I found that pretty amusing since I enjoy talking to myself [don't worry, I've concluded I'm not crazy! ;)]It's also interesting to learn about the life of a cop. Sure, you have all the jokes about them being overweight and eating donuts all the time and then the minority that abuse their power and make it into the news from time to time that give cops a bad name. Yet, in this book you really learn just how hard cops work to protect the general public and the politics that go on with being a cop and serving the public at the same time. I admit I still struggle with the stereotypes of cops being people that just abuse their power and look to pull people over for no reason, but it's accounts like those from this book that keep me open-minded about the profession.Last of the highlights is the garbage man. It's interesting in that I'd read in the past few years that they actually make a decent salary but who wants to put up with the stigma and dirty garbage that comes with the profession? Well, if you read the account of the garbage man interview from this book it might just change your mind a little bit. During the interview, Roy Schmidt talks about his family being well-taken care of and that he actually enjoys his job overall. Now that's one garbage mans account, but still the fact that this guy can provide for his family (at a relatively comfortable level) and respect himself at the end of the day really won me over during reading it.If nothing else, give this book a purchase for no other reason than the fact that now you can buy it for under $10 with shipping and for the interviews and snippets of them that I listed above. It's what a lot of us want to know about other jobs and how other people deal with the daily struggles/joys/tasks of their professions. I'd give this book a 4 out of 5. Not quite a 4.5 because I'd say one con is that it is semi-dated (but not badly dated, kind of like a good Dale Carnegie book) being primarily focused and written on/in the 1970's. That being said, it was a great peek at American workers and with a lot of the interviews the only things that are updated are labor conditions, salaries, and some of the tasks they perform.For a more updated version (that I'm currently reading) that focuses more on the 90's I believe, checkout Gig: Americans Talk About Their Jobs by John Bowe, Marisa Bowe, and Sabin Streeter).-Travis S."},{"Title":"Working","review":"This is simply a tremendous work - on many levels - that may even have more relevance now than it did when it was first published. Initially, though, I almost passed it up - I suspected that I would enjoy the book, but that it would function on such a superficial, folksy level that it would almost be more of a novelty than a serious effort. I can only say now that I'm very happy for the circumstances that led me to read this.'Working' is an oral history - and its extended title sums up the scope of the book. But something odd happens almost immediately once the interviewees begin to speak about their work and, as a corollary, their lives. Suddenly it's no longer simply a matter of relating details of particular jobs or even about the individual's hope for the future. Instead it becomes an inclusive chorus of lonely voices which contains surprising - and I think often unintentional - glimpses into the interior lives of the subjects.There are several broad conclusions one might take away from a book like this; there were two I thought especially pertinent to myself. The first was the physical difference between the work environment of 1970 compared with that of today. Anyone who subscribes to the theory that market forces will eventually compel businesses to treat labor justly and fairly, and that the gains made by organized labor in this country do not deserve continual defense should at least read this document of actual conditions from a mere 40 years ago. It may not change anyone's mind, but I do think it paints a picture that deserves consideration. The cynic in me says be careful: Studs Terkel was certainly a bit of a populist, and surely that's reflected somewhere in 'Working'. The only problem is I could barely sniff any out. The interviewees run the gamut from washroom attendant to plant manager, from waitress to editor at the 'New Yorker' - all presented in their own words. Regardless of what editing Terkel was forced to do, the result does not strike me as editorializing.But the most fascinating aspect of 'Working' is the deep and rich portrait of the subjects, their private dignity, and their sometimes lyrical, expressive descriptions. This is exactly what I did NOT expect to find in the book (and it isn't exactly pervasive, though it is consistent) - a familiarity beyond superficial backgrounds and conditions, and a nearly perfect encapsulation of what it meant to be part of the American experience at that time, though what weight that will carry probably depends on one's background and interest level. Although circumstances have substantially changed since 'Working' was published, for myself, I found the book to be an overwhelmingly positive experience, and over and over again I was surprised at my affinity for these stories. It was actually eye-opening; my attitude toward the general culture of the 1970's and toward today were essentially the same - that they were (and are) shallow and unfulfilling. To know that the individual story from forty years ago was critically different from that idea is refreshing, and makes me reevaluate my assumptions about today's society. I can think of nothing better I can get from a book than that.One negative I've seen associated with the book is that it is 'dated'. Of course it is. Despite this, I believe that the book has as much or more of an impact than when it debuted. I've described what I think it's positives were for me, in the here and now; then I imagine it was revelatory because of its egalitarian claim that everyone had an interesting story to tell. Reality television has proved that is only true by degree - nonetheless, if one didn't glean any other information from the book (or insight, such as the one I had), it still functions as a interesting document of how people viewed their lives, and of an employment landscape that no longer exists. To the casually interested youngster who is just entering the workforce, this is an excellent and entertaining way of learning about that history. If I myself were to level any critiques in the book's direction, I might say that it could have probably been cut some and lost little if any effectiveness. Otherwise - highly recommended."},{"Title":"Working","review":"40 years ago Studs Terkel toured America, as had become his habit. He sat down with people and talked to them and he listened. These people came from all over not just geographically, but also in terms of class and race. We hear the stories of business men and bankers and pro athletes and models; we also hear the story of cabdrivers and the men on the factory floors and the people trying to organize those workers into unions. We get to know people who work with their hands and people who get to work with their minds.Terkel's project is wonderful, as it shows a snapshot of the hopes and worries of Americans on the edge of the social upheaval of the late 60's and early 70's. What may or may not be surprising is that many are the same. The hope for a better future for our children, worries about change in automation and computerization causing the elimination jobs, these are contemporary and illustrate the tenuous nature of living in a capitalist society where we work to live, and very few are allowed the opposite. Terkel's book shows these men and women's stories as a beautiful still-life, giving everyone the quite dignity that is elusive when you are Working."},{"Title":"Working","review":"Studs Terkel was a genius at finding interesting individuals from all walks of life, getting them to open up and then excerpting from their words to tell a universal story.100 individuals in 1974, mainly in everyday jobs, told their stories. Terkel arranged the stories into a portrait of middle America. The stories seem older, but the tale tellers had lived through the 1920's - 1970's and reflected the history and social standards of the times.Work was at the center of life. Most individuals meandered through life without concrete plans, holding on to their dreams without taking actions. They also held onto work tightly as a central role. They looked at life through the lens of their work and experience, placing all things into perspective.The book is uplifting when it shares the common humanity and the familiar stories that we know today from our friends and co-workers. There are success stories large and small. However, the overall portrait is rather depressing, with time passing by relentlessly and meaninglessly for most. I think that the author's political views shaded the picture.Nonetheless, the stories reflect the experience of a significant slice of the country and collectively challenge the reader to appreciate the work of others and find meaning in their own work."},{"Title":"Working","review":"I came across \\"Working\\" while I was in the library getting another book, and I took a serious look at this book because I want to know what other people spend their time doing. Sometimes I have a surreal feeling when I'm downtown and wonder what all the people walking around me and shopping in the stores do for a living. There are lots of books that give one a good enough understanding of one person, and there are books that talk about people as a collection, but this was the first book I've come across that gives some idea of what a large selection of people do and think.I think the method of having interviews with various people about their jobs done in a casual way is excellent. In the Introduction, Terkel quotes his earlier book \\"Division Street: America\\", \\"I realized quite early in this adventure that interviews, conventionally conducted, were meaningless. Conditioned cliches were certain to come. The question-and-answer technique may be of some value in determining favored detergents, toothpaste and deodorants, but not in the discovery of men and women\\" (p. xx), and explains that \\"The talk was idiomatic rather than academic. In short, it was conversation.\\" (pp. xx-xxi).I feel like the book has too much of a focus on the traditional working class, which may just be because the book was published in 1974 and more Americans had blue-collar jobs then than have blue-collar jobs now. I imagine that it would be hard to be satisfied with a job that didn't either do something tangible (fixing a piano, building a car, teaching a person, performing surgery, writing a book) or give a position of authority, and I hope to read more stories about people with different jobs and to see the different ways they get satisfaction from their work. We need more books of anecdotes like this."},{"Title":"Working","review":"I wish I hadn't bought this. With all the hype it was impossible to live up to the expectation. I would have liked to watch the show instead, because I don't believe everyone has the same opinion about unions, like Terkel presents in this book. You'll hear a lot of people complaining about how everything needs to be unionized in every field, because everyone is treated so unfairly. Jeez."},{"Title":"Working","review":"This was for my Work and Society course, but it's actually interesting. It explores different jobs from the perspectives of individual workers of many professions, including a hooker, a farmer, a government worker, a professor, and Rip Torn, among many others. Can be read in sections, by chapter, or all at once. I only had to read five interviews to write papers for class."},{"Title":"Working","review":"I think Studs Terkel really nailed what it is like to toil away at a job you do not like, all the while pining for a job that got away, or one that you wished you could get. I would highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"Working","review":"Studs Terkel's classic book \\"Working\\" is nothing more than a large volume of transcribed confessions of working people. The concept is deceptively simple, but what it reveals about a common activity that unites all of humanity is often truly surprising. Do you hate your job? Guess what. Most people do! Terkel gets workers from waitresses and steel workers to dentists and ad executives to confess what's really in their souls and how they really feel about what they do to make a buck. The surprise is how universal many of the feelings we have about our jobs truly are.One of the most striking things to me is how little has changed in the intervening 40 years since the interviews contained in \\"Working\\" were first collected. When describing work, nostalgia runs rampant among Americans. We look back longingly to the days when America was a mighty manufacturing powerhouse, when we domestically produced much of what we consume. We often think about steel or car manufacturing through a gauzy haze. \\"Working\\" clears the haze away and reveals a far less rosy truth: manufacturing work is often robotic, dehumanizing, and physically punishing. Men who do this work have no love for it and their bodies often pay a steep price for it. They didn't view it as romantic or noble then and they probably don't now. It's just a means to make a living wage.Of the dozens (and dozens) of interviews in the book, a series of common themes are present. Here are the ones that caught my attention.There's a recognition among long-time workers that profit is king over all. The people who produce product are mere cogs in the machine.Everyone has a secret dream job, what they imagine they'd rather be doing, where things would be better somehow.Even if people don't like their jobs, they're often proud of their personal ability, how fast they can complete a task, how accurately, tips they've learned through years of experience. They possess hard-won knowledge that took years to accumulate.Laborers often see management as oppressors who play for a different team. They're to be thwarted in petty ways whenever the opportunity presents itself. It's often a game to occupy time or a way to build camaraderie amongst peers. \\"How can we get back at the Man?\\"People recognize there own limitations and don't necessarily want to be treated as equals, but they do want to be respected, no matter what their station. They want others to recognize their value, that the product or service being offered by the company wouldn't be viable without their efforts. They know that society couldn't produce a steel beam or a car or serve hot meals to people who demand them if it weren't for them. These jobs lack status and glamour, but the world would stop without them.The \\"old days\\" are always better, no matter what era you grew up in. Nostalgia for a better past is universal. There's a feeling that \\"back in my day, there was craft to the job, now work's just robotic or talentless.\\" Also, \\"kids today!\\" and how they lack drive or commitment is a common refrain. There's nothing new under the sun.40 years ago people were already complaining that the days of company loyalty were over, the idea that you could work for one firm for a lifetime and be rewarded or valued were a thing of the past.Corporate life is empty, and corporate success an illusion. Big money managers are petrified of the hotshot youngster nipping at their heels, angling for their job. They worry about their age, that they're disposable once they're over 50. Executives report feeling a moral hollowness about their work. As one of the interviewees put it \\"in the business world, in order to do a better job, you have to become ruthless. In order to make more money, you have to care for people less. In order to succeed, you have to be willing to stab your competitor in the back.\\"People who have found ladder-climbing to be an empty pursuit stop hungering for status and no longer care about it. When that happens, they're free to pursue their heart's desire, or something that makes them feel like they're truly contributing to the world in a meaningful way, in a way beyond making profit for a corporation.Many jobs are \\"too small for one's spirit.\\" People need to feel challenged in order to be fulfilled. A job which is secure and pays adequately may mean complete misery if there's no challenge or sense of meaningful contribution."},{"Title":"Working","review":"Terkel has put together a valuable compilation of interviews that share important views into the psyche of the American worker. There are pieces from all types of people - factory workers, waiters, stewardesses, even teenagers. Being able to see first hand how various people feel about their job and the behind the scenes issues they have to deal with is really interesting and in some cases, eye opening. My only issue is that the book is very limited to what Terkel wants us to see. Some sections, for example, only have stories from women when a man's perspective would be welcome."},{"Title":"Working","review":"This was an assigned book for one of my university courses, and to be honest, I probably wouldn't have even given it a second look in a bookstore if it wasn't mandatory. That being said, after being forced to read it, I found I actually really enjoyed it.The book is a compilation of interviews about people talking about their jobs, if you didn't gather that from the title. Terkel omits his own voice from it though, and instead has his interviewees do all the talking. It gives the interviews a storylike feel, instead of just a question and answer session.I loved how the book was organized and how he chose which interviews went together in certain sections. Terkel did a great job with this book, and it definitely opens your eyes to what other people go through every single day."},{"Title":"Working","review":"It's a cliche that we spend most of our lives at work, and like many cliches, a bit misleading. It's not the time at work that matters, but the investment of our spirit. Most people (especially men) ask each other, \\"what do you do?\\" and get an answer about work. But usually the answer is just a job title, and maybe a description of a current project at the office. Terkel, on the other hand, gets people to verbalize what's going on in their minds all day. And surprise, whether it's a salesperson, an engineer, a CEO, or a supermarket box packer, people all talk about the same things: the feeling of powerlessness, or of achievement. Of helping people, or competing with them. And of the effect on family, whether it's stress, or standard of living. Most important, that people seek meaning in life, and learning and doing a job is the prime way to do it. Some readers may feel that stories from the 1970's are out of date. But really they are timeless -- go have a cup of coffee with friends today and ask them what they really think about work -- you'll get the same answers. Even kings struggled with their work -- for background, read Ecclesiastes."},{"Title":"Working","review":"This is worth reading. I have not finished but am thoroughly enjoying real stories about real working men and women; the challenges, frustrations and rewards they experience on a daily basis. This compilation of stories will delight, concern and provoke thought."},{"Title":"Working","review":"I pay attention to waiters in restaurants. I am aware of the people working around them in retail stores. Recently I had a long stay in the hospital and I talked a lot to the doctors and nurses about what they do.Most people don't do this: most people block all that out. Most people don't \\"look backstage\\", so to speak; they only look at what's in the spotlight.Recently I tried to figure out where I learned to look backstage, and to take an interest in ordinary people doing their jobs: it was because I read Working in the 1970s. It really changed the way I see these things. And strangely, I really am interested in what people do in their jobs. I got that from Studs Terkel.Thanks, Studs."},{"Title":"Working","review":"I had always meant to read &quot;Working,&quot; but had never gotten around to it. Then I picked up another book loosely based on it (&quot;Gig&quot;), so decided to get the original &quot;Working&quot; as well.&quot;Working&quot; is moving and brilliant and a million times better than &quot;Gig.&quot; Somehow, Terkel lets the people do their own talking, but it's never monotonous, never repetitive, and they always have profound things to say. Reading these people tell their stories is mesmerizing. Terkel steps in just the right amount, organizing the stories into themes (sometimes very creative ones), but never drowning out his interviewees' voices.Although &quot;Working&quot; came out in 1972, it feels surprisingly recent. The world of work hasn't changed all that much in thirty years. Still relevant, still entertaining, still thought-provoking. And the professions are indexed in the back, so one needn't read them in order."},{"Title":"Working","review":"I feel compelled to respond to brothersjudddotcom.Nowhere in Terkel's book do I get the notion that he believes people &quot;don't want to work.&quot; I imagine Terkel loves his own work. The subject of the book is the way that most jobs (even &quot;good&quot; jobs) have become dehumanizing. Robotizing.One of his interviewees, a filmmaker, comments on an &quot;educational film&quot; she saw, one intended to inspire &quot;ghetto kids&quot; to pursue their dreams. She remarks that the &quot;most (financially) successful&quot; subject in the film, a businessman, spoke about his money and his possessions while a &quot;less successful&quot; sculptor led a tour of his studio and spoke about his actual work. She says that she feel people are being deprived of the potential joys in work when we are trained to focus too much on status and salary.He also interviews actor Rip Torn, who laments that actors are expected to be &quot;shills&quot; to tailor their performances to the selling of products. For example, Torn tells a story about being required to smoke cigarettes rather than cigars in a particular role. Historically, the character would not have smoked cigarettes; the sponsor was a cigarette company. Torn felt that both his art and his intelligence, as well as that of the audience, were sold out by this demand.Far from being &quot;badly dated,&quot; Terkel's critique is monstrously accurate today. Now, as contrasted with the 1970s, in many families, both parents &quot;devote&quot; 10+ hours to power games at work at the expense of family time, personal health, community, etc.I believe that Terkel believes meaningful work to be essential to the human spirit. Problem is, as amount of work increases, meaning seems to be decreasing."},{"Title":"Working","review":"Working has been my favorite book - likely the book that had the most implicit impact on the way I think - for many years. I pick it up every year and read a random section, put it back down, and pick it up again. Real stories, genuinely collected.The comments are interesting - everyone interprets what Terkel gathered in a way that meets their own worldview. Not too surprising, but read it yourself, and draw your own conclusions - maybe even new ones."},{"Title":"Working","review":"Studs Terkel wanted to write a book about working for a living. So he sat down with a grocery store cashier and interviewed her about her job. He didn't ask very many questions; he just turned on a tape recorder and let her pour her heart out. She explained what she did for a living, how and why she came to do it, what she liked and disliked about her job. She talked about the little dramas and boredom that filled her working hours and the toll it took on her private life. When she was finished talking she had created a vivid \\"snapshot\\" with words of what it's like to work as a grocery store cashier.Then Studs interviewed a bartender, a teacher, a pro athlete and dozens of other people from dozens of professions. They each created in their own words unique self-portraits of themselves at work. The book Working is like an art gallery filled with these detailed self-portraits.And just like strolling through an art gallery looking at paintings will give you a feel for the visions of a variety of artists, reading Working will give you a taste of the flavor of the working lives of it's subjects."},{"Title":"Working","review":"Working profiles the working lives of scores of Americans. From prostitute to chief executive, coal mine worker to major league ballplayer- a myriad of professions are covered. The book reads like a documentary (which it is). Terkel has included the most interesting aspects of each case study's working life, and ultimately you see why each continues to pursue their career in that chosen field- or at least what satisfaction they get from showing up everyday. It's a great book to pick up and spend 5 to 10 minutes or so reading about how someone else's working life has parallels to your own. The interviews were conducted mostly during the late 60's and early 70's but while it is slightly dated, even that fact makes for an interesting historical perspective."},{"Title":"Working","review":"Studs Terkel is a master at getting people to open up, and careful to include several interviewees whose gripes help reinforce his liberal agenda. We hear a stockbroker, trucker, priest, hooker, teller, cops, teachers, autoworkers, and many others discuss their livelihoods. Readers come away appreciating the unique challenges of each job, and the powerlessness that afflicts many employees. These interviews occurred primarily in Chicago during the early 1970's, when the workplace featured fewer women and more jobs in heavy industry. We meet Mike, a steelworker annoyed by his lack of skills who senses that his union job may vanish - as occurred a few years later when US Steel shut their Chicago South Works. Barbara is a young advertising executive forced to deal with a level of office sexism one hopes is now pass&eacute;. Ex-railroaders Bill and Louis each lament the shriveling of their once-vital industry from separate perches as retiree and washroom attendant. \\"Working\\" has many similar, compelling tales.

And whilst the stories are all fascinating, they do seem to suffer from a kind of homogeneous quality, as if, no matter who the interviewee is, the characters' voices all seem to sound like the same person, only the details determining their sex or experience, adding any differentiation. A minor point, I know, but it tends to veil the individuals beneath a worn down resignedness of whether their experiences were good, bad, or so, so.I was alerted to this book when reading a Stephen King article about banned books in American colleges, this being one of them, after a school kid used it as the basis for a homework exercise and his mother threw a fit over it. I can't see why myself, but there you are.Working, is nearly thirty years old now. Nonetheless, its just as relevant today as when Studs Terkel wrote it. And fine reading it is, too."},{"Title":"Working","review":"What's engaging about this is the stories. Studs is known for his work getting people to tell their stories. This is one of his contributions to the cultural history of America, told first person, in a way that is timeless and just as relevant today as when it was written. One way to sum it up might be to say this is about what people learned from their work, and about themselves and others in the process. The subject might sound boring, but it's alive and seething with emotions.On the face of it this is a dated survey of Americans and how they feel about their jobs. While there's some nostalgia in here in the attitudes and jobs of eras past it's also a fun read and one that I would recommend to teens, college students and anyone interested in perspectives about work and how we see ourselves and others.We all know that most people hate their jobs. Work is seen as something we have to do, and few of us seem to find a job that we like or enjoy. How we feel about work, and what we do for a living, in many ways defines who we are. Seeing people share their their perspectives on this helps us see ourselves in a different light, and taken as a whole this book helps us see a perspective of America's history.One thing I found interesting in this was the work ethic people found even in jobs they hated. Work ethics seem to be less clearly defined today in a world where ethics have gone astray, and where people tend to care less about what they do and how they do it. Seeing the pride a man took in his work, even if he hated it, tells us something about the character of a person. It's also interesting to see how people who had jobs you would assume they would have hated were content in their roles and saw what they did as a service even when others might look down on them.The construction worker who wants to make sure his son doesn't have to do what he does was one I enjoyed and remember. An airline stewardess in an era dominated by of bigoted males... the stories this books tells are about relationships and attitudes, and in a way it's still very vital and contemporary.It's about relationships with work, family, with other people, and with ourselves and or past and future. You'll probably see yourself and people you know in the attitudes within this book. In that way it's timeless, candid and informative, and touching."},{"Title":"Working","review":"I first read Working many years ago. Now I do like Scott R and read sections of it for enjoyment or to find how someone whose job is mentioned in today's news thinks compared to how someone felt about that same job back then.I've worked at a lot of jobs from farmer to space program physicist and never disliked a one of them. Now, working while retired, whether for money or just for fun keeps me fired up and ready to go every day. Terkel's book will help improve anyone's outlook on life by letting one see that there are some jobs worse than their own and probably a lot that are better, but hopefully it will show you as it did me that there are very few jobs that made me happier or that I enjoyed more than the work I was presently doing."},{"Title":"Working","review":"Those of us who have worked for many years will find this book rings very true.

I was absolutely mesmerized by the passion, the honesty, and the integrity of the author. I was at times gripped by compassion, at times almost brought to tears, at times feeling myself smiling broadly, all this because the book is written from the heart, straight to the heart.Brennan Manning addresses the issues of legalism, religion, and the need for the real love of Christ without holding back any punches. He shows himself as an unashamed, unapologetic defender of the truth, and of all who are downtrodden, alienated and sickened by the self-righteous, law-toting wing of present Christianity. He is fearless in his articulation, bold in his assertions, and deeply, tearfully compassionate in his appeals, so he wins the heart of this here ragamuffin Christian!His protrayal of Jesus will melt your heart. He supplements his own views with great quotes from many notable Christians, bulking up the integrity of this book.All in all, this is Brennan Manning at his fieriest best, but it is a fire that stands in defense for all who feel a deep need for a true sense of God's love and who aren't receiving it from the church at large. This is one of the best books on the person of Jesus Christ, as it delves deep into His heart.If you have been hurt by the church and by legalistic Christianity, then this is a book that will bring healing to your soul. Be assured, this isn't a mushy book on God's love. It is not fluff. It is a strong, clear, articulate presentation of the love of Christ and a passionate argument for the revealing of the true heart of Jesus at the same time. Take along tissue; you may laugh and cry all at once reading this!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Glimpse of Jesus: The Stranger to Self-Hatred","review":"This was the right time in my life to pick up this book.

He speaks from his heart presenting an intimate God who always loves us as we are and seeks to be in fellowship with us. I've never been a very \\"spiritual\\" person, but this book has helped to start me on a journey of relationship with God.The writing is eloquent and personal but not pretentious or boastful. Manning utilizes dozens of images and depictions of Jesus without being preachy or exegetical. He's not concerned with a particular Christological argument or with proving any points. Instead, he helps the reader to join him in considering the awesomeness of God's love and how God can remove our fears, heal our old wounds, and enable us to forgive ourselves.

Brennan Manning is a Franciscan priest who attempted to marry without being dispensed from his vow of celibacy in 1982.

This is a lie, and a defense mechanism Fr. Manning has evolved to assuage his guilty conscience. If you really want to seek the Mercy of God, I suggest you read \\"Divine Mercy in my soul\\", the diary of St. Faustina, avaulable here on Amazon.com.

This was howafter my father left us, I made her smileat the same time I told her I missed him,and how I managed to keep him close byin that house of perpetual anger,becoming his accuser and his devotedaccomplice. I learned by writingto negotiate between what I had,and that more distant thing I dreamed of.In this poem, Wesley McNair crystallizes what has been going on in his poetry for two decades. He is a poet of witness to his own closed-in coming of age in a poor, fractious family. He looks outward to an American popular culture whose offer of limitless possibility must be viewed with skepticism. In this outer world, you think you can tell the bad guys by their \\"comic-book whiskers,\\" but it isn't necessarily so. More often than not, what you see and hear turns out to be a trick. The trick can be crude and obvious, like a weight-loss ad, but it also comes in the grander schemes of Madison Avenue and Ronald Reagan.A fine book by an all-American poet, closing with a beautiful long narrative (the title poem) that is a fitting sequel to McNair's haunting &quot;My Brother Running.&quot;"},{"Title":"Generalist Practice with Organizations and Communities (Non-InfoTrac Version)","review":"Excellent text-book.

It is often the inward image of someone we love or a goal we are striving for. Media advertising techniques exploit this aspect of our nature at its crudest level. In the art of poetry, it is turned to account in a kind of apotheosis that verges on the magical. It is no accident that for millennia-when illiteracy was the norm for most people-the wisdom of civilizations was encapsulated, perpetuated and enjoyed through poetry.This collection of \\"Songs\\" is a rare find. There is no poem more than one page in length, and yet it is as though Schuon the metaphysician has crystallized the entire content of his philosophical books into verse. Even so, this is much more than simply a clever recapitulation. The ideas, the images-and the realities they manifest-spring forth with the life and clarity of a fresh inspiration. And this is the point at which those of us who are not fluent in German cannot help feeling slightly left out. One is grateful to have the original German next to the English translations, but one also longs to \\"hear the music.\\" Lacking a voice rendering of the German in the form of a compact disk, one can hope that at least a few of these gems might become accessible through an internet site.As with Schuon's prose works, one is struck by the range of subjects, and in addition with the poetry, by the astonishing variety of styles and meters. The topics include such diverse interests as metaphysics, cosmology, sacred art, celestial femininity, hagiography, comparative religion, folk wisdom, fairy tales and certainly all aspects of German romanticism. The sense of nature as theophany is a major theme here, accompanied by a lyricism of heart-melting beauty.This is the kind of book one likes to dip into, savor and come back to. Since the foreword mentions a corpus of some 3,500 poems, the only question to ask is when the publication date is for the next volume."},{"Title":"Seven Interviews with Tadao Ando","review":"Tadao Ando has created the best new museum in America, across the street from Louis Kahn's classic Kimbell, and chief curator Michael Auping has done a brilliant installation of the museum's stellar collection.

It just so happens that I grew up in Bangladesh which used to be part of India. I knew about the jungle, I knew about the tigers. I had inherited this book from my parents and grandparents and found it a delightful tale, quite similar to some of the Bengalis folk tales. My brother's best friend (Nazrul Islam was his given name)had the nickname by his family and friends of Kalo (in bangla it means black) because he had midnight dark skin. He was a terribly good looking boy (I had a small crush on him as a child) and never once did I or anyone else think of his nickname as degrading or insulting. He was just Kalo. When I returned to the US years later I was shocked to find that my little story book was the center of a great racial controversy. It was so crazy. It was a little book from India where some lady used the local customs and tales to write a story. When people criticize the book for being racist, all they are really doing is criticizing the culture of India. People are given Nicknames as descriptives in the Indian subcontinent. My nickname was Mamonie (little one). It just boggles my mind that people can find horror in even the most innocent simple things. And for those people who claim racism, watch yourself. For you are showing yourself biased against the culture of other people!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"As a child I admired Little Black Sambo!

Whatever is considered &quot;bad&quot; in this book is the manufacture of over-sensitive adults.This is a great classic and belongs in every library along with Grimm's Fairy Tales and Aesop Fables.

I found nothing wrong with this story and in fact it was one of my favorites as a kid. Many a time you would find us playing tigers running around a tree and melting into butter. To me, it is a story about a little black boy who has two parents who love him very much and give him gifts. The tigers try to eat him, he gives them his clothes and then, while they're fighting, he gets them back. I loved how the tigers turned to butter and Sambo got to eat 169 pancakes! Wow, a huge stack of pancakes loaded with freshly melted butter. I know my kids would love that. I asked my kids 12 and 10 what they thought of the story. Did they think it was mean to black people. We all agreed that it was a good story and could be written with any race and still be good. As for their names-since we haven't studied the history of how hated dark skinned people across the world have been in such depth, they don't mean a thing to us. Why wait 100 years to read the story just because some people can't get over the past? I hope you'll read the book and enjoy it with your children-that's what it was written for-and when you're done go make some pancakes together:)"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"Well, it raises enough issues to keep literary scholars blabbing on for years and years. Following in the mighty footsteps of two other recent \\"Little Black Sambo\\" adaptations (one Fred Marcellino's \\"The Story of Little Babaji\\" and the other Julius Lester's complete reinterpretation \\"Sam and the Tigers\\") Christopher Bing's version of Helen Bannerman's original 1899 children's book is perhaps the purest retelling of the tale. Using the author's own words while replacing her pictures with beautiful woodcut-like illustrations, the story is a true labor of love.Where to begin? When Helen Bannerman first wrote the story of Sambo for her children, she had no idea that her Beatrix Potter-like invention (both women began publishing children's books in similar ways) would be the source of so much controversy and contempt. So let's say that we're a child that has stumbled across this edition without knowing a thing about its history. To them, this is a gorgeous story filled with light and color and a young boy beating those more powerful around him. The book has stayed true to the original in that it is set in India but features black characters. So there's some danger that kids will believe some Africans live in an India-like country. Otherwise, there's not much fault (in terms of the book in and of itself) to find with this retelling. Bing has obviously spent an inordinate amount of time researching and questioning his creation. We shouldn't ignore the fact that the great Henry Louis Gates Jr. (the Chair of Afro-American Studies at Harvard, doncha know) not only approved of this work but encouraged its publication. So for me, it's a success (though I'm a little leery of the Bing picture on the bookflap presenting him as a colonist).For some people, however, the very names of the characters (Sambo, Mumbo, and Jumbo) combined with the history of the tale are reason enough not to approve of this book. To them, a story like this can only make it seem \\"okay\\" that children be called Sambo. For others, the true crime of the original was not the story (in which a black boy outwits nasty predators) but the pictures. Remove the offending articles and replace with far better ones and the problem is completely solved. For me, I dunno. There's little doubt in my mind that Bing's book is breathtakingly beautiful. But every adult I've showed it to so far has been unable to get past the title. I would show them the gorgeous endpapers and faux aged binding (meant, I can only assume, to recreate the book as it SHOULD have appeared those one hundred odd years ago). I would patiently explain that Ms. Bannerman did not intend the story character, Sambo, to be associated with blacks in the United States. But even today the sting of that name is as powerful as ever. It may take one hundred or two hundred more years to undo some of its damage. Maybe at that point people will be able to read this particular edition for what it truly is. A loving work of beauty and skill. If you've any problems with the idea of making \\"Little Black Sambo\\" palatable to members of the 21st century, do not buy this book. If, however, you're a little curious and incredibly aware of the potential controversy engendered by this title, seriously consider buying it. At the very least, it stands as a true testament of how far we've come, and how far we've yet to go."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"When I was young we were read this story a lot. We were read the story so much that the book wore out. After that I had to ask my older brother to tell it to me because I couldn't remember it. I don't understand how this book is racist besides Sambo, Mumbo, and Jumbo's titles &quot;little black&quot; and the artwork. But the artwork just portrays the views of the time, and I've never understood how calling someone &quot;black&quot; is racist and calling someone &quot;white&quot; is'nt. If you want to read anything into this story it should be how a little boy outwitted four tigers. If you want to read a great childrens story pick it up. But if your looking for a place to unleash your insecurities of yourself leave this book to those who appreciate it. If people don't like it they are free not to read it, and if people like it they should be free to read it."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"When my wife asked me to try and find several classic children's books for her new baby grandson, I smiled at the mention of the titles, recalling with great fondness the stories being read to me by my mother when I was a child. Little Black Sambo was one of those stories. It is, of course, a shame that there arose some time ago individuals who equated the story with &quot;racism&quot;. To the intelligent mind, it is truly a pity that some are so intent to find &quot;racism&quot; that they will envision same where none even vaguely exists.Such is the case with this fanciful, harmless classic story for children; a story that has been told to generations of children who have listened in wonder as the tigers melted into butter for (the little Indian boy) Sambo's pancakes!It is a story that returns one to a simpler time, long before child psychologists, political correctness (and who indeed is qualified to judge what is or is not CURRENTLY &quot;correct&quot;? Perhaps we're better off not knowing their identities, God help us!), shootings committed by school children, and all the other wonders of this wonderful Modern Age.Little Black Sambo is an American classic.

I have been getting other editions from England to give to children as gifts. This is a magnificent book with great illustrations by Bing. I have read the other reviews and trust me that this story stands on its own to delight children. When I taught second grade the class loved to hear it. It is not racist in the least.Sambo worries that he will get into trouble when he loses all his new clothes. And children relate to getting into trouble with their parents. He uses his head to outwit the tigers and children naturally indentify with him; like they do with other hero figures in books and television and movies. He has a loving home with two parents who sit down with him to enjoy a wonderful pancake breakfast at the end of the story. Little Black Sambo is a story of a timeless hero!

It tells of the controversy in the 1960's, and of the person who has created the new illustratons for this re-print. I have always loved this story for the story, just as I love the Jungle Book, and Tarzan, tigers and jungles are in a lot of my favorite childhood stories, the names never meant a thing nor brought any ideas of racial differences to me. I was so disappointed when it was no longer available for my children.Reading the commentary though brought into focus what this book could have meant to other people, and now as an adult, I can understand what was going on in the 1960's.

Indians aren't black and racism only involves black people. Also, I'm white and therefore am tired of all these \\"politically correct\\" attacks on things I grew up with. I mean, come on people, a couple hundred years of slavery followed by decades of social and legal inequality that only began to really wane in the 1960s and now you all have a chip on your shoulder! You'd think \\"Little Black Sambo\\" was a hurtful racial epithet people routinely used against your granparents or something!Seriously folks - I remember this story as a kid too (and I'm only 26) and I used to eat at the \\"Sambo's\\" pancake houses that used the story on their menus and such. I liked it too, it's a decent kid's story once you take the stereotypical illustrations and racist terms out of it - which people have. I don't think the objection is about the plot of a little boy turning tigers into pancakes. It's the fact that this was a story written by a white person about people that her generation thought were inferior at a time when all dark skinned people were called \\"black\\". And the fact that term \\"Little Black Sambo\\" later became, logically or not, a racist term used by white people against blacks.The book shouldn't be banned and older kids and adults should probably read as an example of our history. But little kids can do without the racist imagery that they aren't old enough to process. I don't think it will make them racist, but imagine a classroom with a mixed group of kids. Do you really want them looking at an original version, illustrations and all, possibly making comparisons. \\"Hey sammy, you look just like Sambo\\"There's nothing wrong with modernizing it to make it a little less offensive.

I liked the book and I didn't feel insulted because the book was about a little Indian boy and I wasn't Indian. Besides, Sambo was smart and won in the end so I thought he was pretty cool. Besides, at that time in England, everybody who wasn't white with dark skin was black. However, when I got older, moved to North America and learned about how the story had been twisted, distorted and used to humiliate and degrade people of African descent, my feelings changed. I still remember the book fondly, but I would have a hard time giving it to a child in this day and age. The problem isn't the story, the problem is in how the story has been used. Those people who defend the book and dismiss the feelings of those who are offended by it are the ones who do the book a diservice, in my opinion. As a non-Jew, anti-semitism doesn't affect me personally, but I completely respect and understand the feelings of those that it does.

As a child, the story was absolutely captivating for me...and I only wish that I could become even half as mesmerized by any of the young children's books being published today, but sadly I am not. Literature has been washed down terribly so in light of \\"all the fuss\\" and controversy over far, far too many books ~ and this is a classic ! Racism ? Hog~Wash !!! The name *Sambo* held absolutely no definition of even the slightest hint of a negative connotation to it when I was a child...zip, zero, zilch, nada !Fault me for loving this book...and you shall fault me for my own definition of the name *Sambo* which, to this day, only evokes wonderful memories of a story about a sweet little boy (who just happened to have black colored skin...no biggy) and instead of being eatin' up by those awfully scary and mean tigers, why he was so smart that he ended up eating yummy delicious pancakes all slathered with tiger butter !!!Oooooh, how many times I WISHED I WAS LITTLE BLACK SAMBO ! Imagine that...a WHITE GIRL from the heartland of Kansas wishing she were a BOY with BLACK skin from the jungle. Why I even remember thinking how very LUCKY Little Black Sambo was to be living IN THE JUNGLE....unlike me. Interesting, isn't it ? How this little story brought to life in me the notion that I was \\"less fortunate and underprivileged\\" simply because I was not blessed enough to be born in the jungle where those tigers lived!!! Because if I HAD...surely to goodness it would have been ME who would have been smart enough to trick all those silly tigers. And if it HAD been me....would this sweet little story have ever been ridiculed and lambasted erroneously by so many ? ? ? ? ? ? ? The answer is clear...a resounding NO !If, based on the beliefs (and beliefs are what we CHOOSE to believe to be *true*....and not necessarily TRUTH itself) that this story could be so powerfully negative and influential as to have warped my view concerning people who have much, much darker skin than myself...how is it that I have, since childhood, held black americans (well, all people for that matter) in highest esteem ???????Did I, as a child, notice that some adults did not hold the same view and opinion of me ? Absolutely YES ! And I well remember that it was mind boggling for me, as a mere five year old child, to watch a nasty old man scold a young black girl away from a drinking fountain. I was confused...and scared...because I didn't understand WHAT SHE HAD DONE WRONG. And so I asked my mother, \\"What did she do?\\", and she simply replied that the sign over the water fountain read \\" NO BLACKS \\". And THAT was my first memory of hatred, racism, harsh and unfair judgement...call is what you will ...but it was NOT because of \\"Little Black Sambo\\". It was by the hand of a man whose view and opinion of human beings differed only because of the color of their skin.And some of my innocence was lost that day. And I became a little more afraid of who might reject me because of something I could not change about myself.A M A Z I N G............simply amazing !"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"Classic story in a nice binding for the price.

I don't think this book should be banned or anything, but it should be viewed for what it is: dated, racist nonsense.Are reviewers who dismiss charges of racism unaware of the significance of the name \\"Sambo,\\" and how racially charged it is? Could they justify their claims if this tale of a dark-skinned boy was instead called \\"The Story of Little Black N*****\\"? Sambo in this book is indeed Indian, as some reviewers have noted. But again, are the book's fans unaware of the British racism that Indians faced? (If not, I recommend that they at least rent \\"Ghandi\\" the next time they're in the video store.) Bannerman was British, after all. Another important thing to note about the word \\"Sambo\\" is that one hundred years ago, it -- much like the n-word, in fact -- was commonly used by Westerners to describe ANY non-Westerners with dark skin. That's right -- Africans, Indians, Southeast Asians, and even some Native Americans. If you doubt me, get a good dictionary and check the similar usage histories of the two words.Therefore, I see little evidence that it even mattered to Bannerman or readers of this book when it first came out whether it was about Indians or Africans -- as subjects of the British Empire they all served as the White Man's Burden, did they not? The tendency to lump all non-whites into the same supposedly inferior group is itself racist. And this book is certainly guilty of doing that.Don't get me wrong -- Bannerman was no Thomas Dixon. I have no doubt that she had benign intentions when writing this book, but I am unconvinced that her opinion of the Indian race was much higher than the opinion many American whites held of black people around the same time (even if it was less hostile). Her portrayal of nonwhites as primitive cretins shows just how low this opinion was. And as I mentioned above, it's not as if she invented the same of Sambo. It already had a connotation that, at its least offensive, was condescending toward people of dark skin. (We won't even address her decision to name Sambo's parents Mumbo and Jumbo; I think you get the idea.)One thousand years from now, it may be perfectly fine to read this book as an innocent children's tale. But sadly, it apprears that today we live in a world where some people refuse to recognize how ugly the struggle could be to obtain racial equality in the U.S. or to end colonial British rule in India. Frankly, feeding an incendiary relic of these sagas to our children as if nothing bad ever happened only perpetuates this ignorance.If you disagree with me, go ahead -- vote my review unhelpful. But before you do, I recommend reading a few history books. You'll probably learn a thing or two."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"I remember my teacher reading this book to me in the first grade.

I am a 32 yr old african american woman now & I wouldn't dream of reading this to my children because it does not depict true african or african american children. It's only a stereotype of how some people, who may have some racism in them, view us. Now if you want to read a better version of this story, then you should read Sam & The Tigers. A retold version of Little Black Sambo, written by Julius Lester."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"I didn't know &quot;Sambo&quot; was a racist term until recently. I learned that Sambo, mustee and mustafa are all racist terms that were popular in the days of the Civil War and in the postbellum years to identify people by how much black ancestry they had. I like the story, but I wish the race and the color of the child and the child's parents were omitted."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"To me, it is not a matter of being offended or not. But if you can read this without any discomfort you need to review your history. Of course kids can like it, but they like throwing rocks at ducks too. What is disturbing to me is how anyone can be nostalgic for a colonial past. Sambo is very lovable, but that is the point. It paid to maintain that the 'primitive' races were childlike, endearingly innocent. This idea of a paternalistic love actually supported Western dominance. They were the 'white man's burden,' permanently in childlike relation to the West, incapable of self rule or living in a modern world. In exchange for being guided to civilization, their natural resources could be had for the superior races. The childlike, innocent native is cut from the same cloth as the threatening cannibal, or the easily scared servant, or the lazy slave. All of these stories came out of that system of beliefs. This is not an Indian folk tale, however clever and tricky Sambo is. This is not, as one reviewer writes, \\"A loving attempt to reach across the racial divide.\\" The historical record contradicts this reading. Read just a line or two from the official reports written by colonial administrators like Helen Bannerman's husband. This kind of nostalgia erases the history of colonial rule. Maintaining divisions between a ruling class (British) and a subaltern class (colonial subjects) was the whole point of colonialism, of which this tale is a product.You and your children may find this character cute and cuddly, but stop and think about that. So are puppies. It is quite possible to love your mammy or your servant, just as you love your dog. (The mother in this tale is a direct relation of Aunt Jemima and her pancake mix, introduced at the Chicago World's Fair just two years previously) Exactly WHO is nostalgic for this past? I understand how remembering black slaves and coolies as 'happy darkies' is a lot less painful than actually remembering the truth. This was not a simpler time but one in which brutal subordination of a people was sanctioned by the state. If you miss that 'simpler time' I hope you don't live next door to me. My children would not be safe."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"It occurs to me that perhaps we're mixing up the message of the story with the way in which it was presented. Helen Bannerman was a product of her time -- and from her book, which describes a boy in India given the name \\"sambo,\\" a derogatory word used to refer to people of African descent, one can only conclude that she was unfortunately a rather muddle-headed racist with good intentions. That people recall this book fondly as a story that was such an important part of their childhood is natural -- the story in itself, is enormously engaging, and that's what they remember - the triumph of the boy over the tigers. That many grandparents and older adults like this book is also not surprising; but if these same people continue to deny the fact that words such as \\"Sambo,\\" \\"Mumbo,\\" and \\"Jumbo,\\" are at best ordinary words, or at worst \\"politically incorrect,\\" they are propogating a view of the world that we would be wise to distance ourselves from. Let's call things as we see them folks: this is a racist book for the unintelligent, degrading words given to humans. Please, do read this book to children, and please, explain the significance of \\"Sambo.\\" We can't afford to run away from history -- Helen Bannerman's book makes this impossible, and that...in the end, is a good thing."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"Like most reviewers, I grew up with this book and loved it as a child. However, even then I had one question: why call him \\"Little BLACK Sambo\\"? Why not just \\"Little Sambo\\"?Many reviewers here have defended this book against the charges of racism. One guy even goes so far as to say if you think it's racist you hate other cultures. I don't have a clue as to what that is supposed to mean, but this book is racist. Just is. However, instead of saying \\"is\\" or \\"is not\\", I'm actually going to explain my opinion.This book was written by a Scottish woman living in India in 1899. The original illustrations, presumably replicated in this edition, feature Sambo, Mumbo, and Jumbo as having inky black skin and big red lips. Subsequent American volumes had drawing of the characters in blackface. As a result of these exaggerated illustrations, the word \\"Sambo\\" became a racial slur in America directed at African-Americans.Now, as another reviewer noted, this is set in India, not Africa. I'm not sure how that is meant to excuse the book, but I'm guessing that since the word Sambo was directed as a slur against African-Americans, we can safely chock that up to a misreading of the book by Americans. Not so. A glimpse at the history of race, and specifically \\"blackness\\" will show that Indians, Africans, and even the Irish were considered \\"black\\". \\"Black\\" in this sense meaning both a physical characteristic as well as a way of saying \\"other than Anglo\\". It was a claim also that was disparaging to their \\"perceived\\" level of sophistication as human beings. As such, words such as the \\"n-word\\" (I won't spell it out since this is a page for a kid's book) were levelled at Africans and Indians (and Irishmen) equally. It stands to reason, then, that \\"Sambo\\" was a derrogatory term lobbed at all who were looked upon as savage, different, or unequal to \\"white\\" folks.This cannot be ignored, nor excused. Ms. Bannerman's Sambo stories have historically done a lot of damage, and even added a racial slur to American speech. This is not just, as one person says, over-sensitive adults overreacting. If you are an African-American and have been called a \\"sambo\\" it's hardly overreacting to take offense. This book, historically, has had a place in the canon of racist western literature, and no amount of charm the story has can change this unfortunate fact."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"Until I read the history of this book, I thought Little Black Sambo was a harmless story about a little black boy who is clever enough to trick the tigers. Closer examination of the book reveals the use of hurtful stereotypes such as the pejorative name of Sambo. The Oxford English Dictionary definition reads: 1. Sambo is a nickname for a Negro. Now used only as a term of abuse. Also attributed especially with reference to the appearance or subservient mentality held to be typical of the black American slave. The qualities of a Sambo include being shiftless, dolt, lazy, docile, and happy to be a slave. Additional stereotypes can be found in the illustrations. Sambo's skin is abnormally black, like a minstrel player's black face, and he has exaggerated unnatural red lips. Other reviewers stated if you over look these two flaws, this is a good book. There is no excuses for reading this racist book to children when so many equally entertaining books that do not insult other people exist. Unless you are teaching a lesson on stereotypes, this reviewer suggests that you purchase something other than Little Black Sambo. That includes the equally flawed remakes of Little Baji and Sam and the Tigers."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"The pervasiveness of racism in American culture still has the power to amaze me. Reading through the other reviews of this book I was suprised by the overwhelming number of reviews which seek to justify and provide excuses as to why others should read this book. Whether or not the book was originally based in India, \\"Little\\" \\"Black\\" \\"Sambo\\" was co-opted by Jim Crow America as one of the many faces of racism, depicting African-Americans as passive, barbaric, lazy, big eyed, thick lipped, ignorant, smiling jesters. For the many who write that they loved the book as a child, perhaps you were unaware of the pervasive racial messages in the book. Perhaps you didnt care. Who knows. The bottom line is that if you want to raise your children in the belief that \\"all men (including African Americans) are created equal,\\" then you wont allow your children to read this book as a bedtime story. It is a lesson in racist history, as recent as yesterday, that African Americans like myself are forced to contend with. Let Jim Crow die with you. Dont raise your kids with the idea that its acceptable to view African Americans as \\"little\\" \\"black\\" barbaric, ignorant ape-like animals that step and fetch it through the jungle, meekly giving away their clothes because the master told them to."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"This is racist trash and I find myself alternately appalled and amused by the bizarrely arrogant defense of such insulting tripe, brimming with racial slander.

It is a tale of a jolly, resourceful little boy who gives away his red coat and his blue trousers and his purple shoes and his green umbrella to the different tigers who want to eat him up. Then the tigers fight over which is the grandest tiger, and chase each other around a tree, not letting go of each others' tails until they turn into butter. Little Black Sambo rescues his clothing and his father takes the melted butter home so his mother can make pancakes. They all sit down to supper and Little Black Sambo eats the most pancakes because he is so very hungry.This book has the language of story-telling which appeals to children. It is also good to let children play-act out the story. The pictures illustrate the story with humor as well. The simple words, and the highly effective repetition, capture the attention of both reader and listener, frightening them just enough to excite them.One of the most successful books ever written for the two-to-five age group, each picture exactly illustrates a moment in the story. The text and pictures present non-white people as living in entirely primitive conditions, and as having no culture. Sambo communicates with animals, which seemed to imply that he is inferior, and close to the animal world. The illustrations are crudely drawn, grinning stereotypes with clownish eyes and huge mouths. The situation &quot;Oh! Please Mr. Tiger, don't eat me up and I'll give you my beautiful little Red Coat&quot; is the picture of the always docile black. Sambo's parents are called Black Jumbo and Black Mumbo, and these names are rather apt to harbor racial and religious intolerance (as in the phrase &quot;mumbo-jumbo&quot;).At the time she was writing the story, black had no unpleasant significance. Indians were quite prepared to talk about black; the derogatory idea crept in later. Bannerman did not have any sort of color prejudice: black was used to make an interesting story for children and a black child was a more romantic figure for a white child to read about. It was inevitable that a woman of Bannerman's background and period would think and write as she did. Her outlook is certainly racist in the context of today, and would have no place in a multi-racial society.This book has been repeatedly challenged as an acceptance of white superiority, and is still banned from libraries, showing an awareness of the deep roots of racism in our history, culture, and language."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"Great classic.

This book presents a great opportunity to show children how easy it is to create a lasting negative image of people without being overtly disrespectful of them.

I always think this is a shame where an innocent children's book is subject to a ban due to political correctness. Saying that, I am white British so perhaps I just don't appreciate any offence that someone could take from this story.The story itself is a lovely, simple tale of a little boy.

Zenith and RCA were the top names in television and Ford had better ideas. It was an era that predated being politically correct and I remember this story vividly. I remember when I was 3 years old being offended by the title. My exact words were, &quot;If he was anything but black, he wouldn't be called Black Sambo.&quot; I remember I found the part about the tigers melting scary. Although I marveled at Sambo's resourcefulness, I didn't like the part about the animals melting. I found that upsetting.Folks, maybe polical correctness takes a back seat to childhood memories. Here is a memory that is conveniently overlooked. Sambo is a racist term that is used towards persons with one black parent.

Maintaining divisions between a ruling class (British) and a subaltern class (colonial subjects) was the whole point of colonialism. The story of a cute native is part and parcel of the same ideology that produces the story of the threatening savage, or the easily scared native. Even if he is clever. This idea supported Western dominance. You may find this character cute and cuddly, but stop and think about that. So are puppies. It paid to maintain that the 'primitive' races were refreshingly childlike, endearingly innocent, incapable of self rule or living in a modern world. They were the 'white man's burden,' and their natural resources could be had for the superior races. You would see this more clearly if you had a look at any of the official papers written by colonial administrators like Helen Bannerman's husband. All of these stories came out of that system of beliefs. Exactly WHO is nostalgic for this past? Certainly not Black and Brown descendants of a conquered people. This was not a simpler time but one in which brutal subordination of a people was sanctioned by the state. If you miss that 'simpler time' I hope you don't live next door to me. My children would not be safe."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"This book is a perfect example of a reigning culture ( in this case Western Caucasian ) dressing up it's post-Slavery Era losses and expanding Colonialism as benevolent towards the \\"child-like\\" races that only need simple things to be happy in their subordination to the superior white people and their culture.It stunk of racism to me when I was a child in the 1960s. And stinks of racism now. In a post-Civil Rights era, where we should all know better than excuse this smiling little culturally \\"unconscience\\" evil, there is no excuse for this propaganda."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"Whether Sambo is African, African American, or Indian, he still represents a colonized or enslaved people who are nearly always identified as childlike and ignorant. This was true for the Indians who were colonized by the British, the Africans enslaved by Europeans, and African Americans enslaved and held down by structural racism in America. And they continue to be portrayed like this main character. The problem with this book is that the racism is masked within a child's story, and is therefore entertaining. For those of you who don't see the harm in it, imagine reading a white counterpart in this story. What if the character were Polish? How would your reaction be different? It is perhaps easier now to see then that this story may be hurtful to some people? Other white counterparts of Sambo include the invariably inebriated Irishman or Scotsman, the ever questioning and unintelligent Swede, or the ever mob-affiliated Italian--all of which are extraordinarily offensive, though they have been lodged within various forms of entertainment for years such as movies and jokes. The fact that sometimes this book sells off the shelves is no surprise because most people don't understand the racial significance of this book and don't care to know (as seen in such reviews celebrating the greatness of this book). The privilege of calling ones preferences \\"not racist\\" comes with scrutinizing every aspect of things we like, and rooting out anything that is even in the slightest bit racist. If for you this book is a great book devoid of racism, well, you might want to think twice about thinking yourself as a progressive, unbiased person when it comes to race. If you're reading this book for any reason, it should be coupled with a class on racist ideology and how American culture is infused with it in the shape of seemingly benign forms of advertising and entertainment (i.e. Dairy Queen's \\"Moolatte\\", Aunt Jemima, etc). This is therefore not a children's book. For something a lot less offensive, that introduces your kids to other cultures, try Favorite African Folktales edited by Nelson Mandela."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"I can't believe Amazon is still selling this trash!!

After all the hype, I'd decided to read it myself and amazingly enough, I have no idea how they could come up with the idea the book was racist, because all it is, is just a children story and it's quite harmless to read really.This is a story about a little black boy called Little Black Sambo, the son of Jumbo and Mumbo, who gave all his beautiful new clothes away to the Tigers so they won't eat them. Little Black Sambo practically gave away all his clothes to the Tigers, filling the tigers with pride. With all these pride, trouble it bound to happened. The tiger ended up tryign to over power each other but ended up transforming in butter in which Sambo's parents made into pancakes and they ended up feeling all fulled.Overall, it is more about bullies rather than touching the issues of racisms. This should be read, not banned by the irresponsible book ban-ners."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":".Is there a stronger image in children's literature than the four angry tigers that grab each other's tails, run around the palm tree, faster and faster until they melt into a big pool of butter?The tigers intimidated the little boy (who just happens to be called Sambo) into handing over his beautiful new clothes. He is the smart hero in this classic story.The real lesson in this tale is shown in the fate of the tigers. Their greed and arrogance leads to an argument over &quot;who is the grandest&quot; when dressed in Sambo's clothes. They get so angry with each other that they forget why they are fighting but just go on getting angrier until they chase each other into oblivion. We see avarice, leading to pride, aggression, and ultimately to destruction. This is a profound lesson for all of us.The big jar of melted butter (ex-tiger) that Sambo's dad collected from under the palm tree let Mom cook up a big pile of pancakes to feed all the family.The only criticism that can be levelled at this book is &quot;tigerism&quot;.Make sure you get a genuine re-issue of Miss Bannerman's 1921 original classic not one of the bowdlerized (and supposedly sanitized) &quot;updates&quot;. The 21 illustrations in the original have a delightfully nave quality and form an essential part of this book. Look out for other books in the &quot; Wee Books for Wee Folk&quot; series.

The story of Sambo and his clever triumph over adversity with the stubborn tigers is a perfect metaphor for this original work's welcome reappearance and widespread acclaim.

We've never had any \\"black\\" or \\"white\\" questions from any of our kids from reading it, they simply want Sambo to beat those tigers, get his clothes back, and eat those pancakes!My wife and I couldn't agree more that fortitude, perseverence, and a little luck, and our children's resulting laughter and joy, are the only ideas that are advanced with this marvelous story."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"I recall Little Black Sambo from my childhood as well.

Unfortunately, despite the denial of some of the prior reviewers, it cannot be ignored that this book might be considered offensive to some. Just like the black lawn jockeys that were so popular at one time, and the Aunt Jemima pancake box before they took the bandana off of her head, these icons represent post cival rights era reality. I supppose some of you see nothing wrong with the Little Rascal character Farina with the rags tied in his head, or Buckweat either. I would not advocate banning any of the aforementioned symbols, because I think they should be cherished as a sign of just how far we've come. I have mammy salt and pepper shakers, cookie jars, etc., because as a Black man in America, I want to remember and cherish the past.

This book is about a family from India. The main character is a little boy by the name of Little Black Sambo. His mother's name is Black Mumba and his father's name is Black Jumbo. In the beginning of the story Black Mumba gives Black Sambo new clothes that she made him, and his father buys him a new umbrella and some shoes. Throughout the day Sambo ends up getting all of his possessions taken away from him by tigers that were threatening to eat him up. Each of the tigers had one of Little Black Sambo's things. They all fought because they all wanted to be the grandest of the whole jungle. The tigers were so angry that they started to chase each other around a tree so fast that they melted into butter. Black Jumbo came across the butter and decided to take it home for Black Mumbo. Black Mumo was very pleased with the butter and then she made pancakes for their family to eat that night. In the end Little Black Sambo got all of his things back and had a wonderful filling 169 pancakes.This story has no reason to be on the most frequently challenged book list because for one, it is a classic, and two, because inside of the cover there is a lesson to be learned for all people who read it. That lesson is that no matter what you have in the long run, you will end up the same way as everyone else. If the book had to do with other characters, then people would not be censoring it because they think it has to do with racism. No books, especially this one, should be banned or censored because not everyone thinks the same things about what is printed in black and white for citizens of all ages to read.

Negative attacks of this work reveal people who use the material as mirrors to guilty souls that live in irrational fear. Their solution to handle this state is empty appeasement and shallow references to stereotypical Black history. This ignores the rich heritage of \\"unpopularized\\" Black cultural artifacts. Authors of one race can write about characters of another without being racist. Racist symbols are picked from many non racist sources. The racist use of the word \\"Sambo\\" and the similarity of the illistrations to \\"Blackface\\" style is after the fact and unfortunate. The book \\"The Story of Little Black Sambo\\" is really a loving attempt to reach across a racial divide and can be used in a positive way today."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"It was wonderful to see this story in original form from my childhood.

Many did not. But to dismiss the controversy that surrounds this book as \\"political correctness\\" gone awry is nonsensical. What the reviewer raised in India and others with fond memories fail to recognize is that the Bannerman's original book was copied extensively and published in the U.S. without regard to copyright - and transformed with more crudely depicted imagery, some of which placed Sambo on southern plantations. These \\"knockoffs' were used by those of ill intent to demean and diminish African-Americans for decades.Should you read the story to your children? If done so responsibly, sure. In the eyes of children, who are color-blind, it is a wonderful story. But at least provide some context and sensitivity for your child to ensure that they do not, in turn, innocently call one of their fellow classmates \\"Little Black Sambo\\".

How many parents have put new clothes on their children and told them to keep them nice and clean. Sambo lived in a different country then then I do, his life, culture, were different. Let us embrace that Sambo has fears and can be brave, and is smart enough as a little kid to outwit those tigers. I viewed him as a hero (in the late 70's) and now I believe he is a hero to my children.Give kids a little credit they know things change and were different before they were born.

It looks like dearly-beloved books I have in my own library, treasures from my childhood. I especially loved the claw mark on the cover; a tiger has been here! And the postcards and letters reproduced on the endpapers take me back to a magical world, the world of Mary Lennox in the opening pages of \\"The Secret Garden.\\"I've loved this story for 45 years, despite its unfortunate connotations. This illustrator has tried to reclaim it. I wonder if maybe enough time has passed and the world has changed enough for that to be possible. I asked for this book at one bookstore, and the young black clerk had never heard of it. Certainly the beautiful, resourceful child in these illustrations bears no resemblance to the bug-eyed stereotype in the original. I do wish that he'd drawn an Indian child, to fit the backgrounds, but I understand why he made the child African. The story is a fantasy; if we can believe that tigers would wear shoes on their ears and turn into melted butter, maybe it's possible to accept this African family in India.I read the book out loud to my husband, and he laughed until he cried at those ridiculous tigers. \\"Now I'm the grandest tiger in the jungle.

Each tiger had a piece of clothing, and while Little Black Sambo was hiding behind a tree, the tigers began to fight each other, because each tiger thought that they were the grandest. They threw the clothes on the ground, caught hold of each others tails, and were circling around a tree so fast that they turned into butter. Little Black Sambo put on his clothes and ran home. His father came upon the butter while coming home from work and scooped it up in a brass pot he was carrying. Well, they had pancakes for dinner using the butter.

This was in a set of books my parents got me when I was two.It is a tragedy that a few politically correct knuckleheads have attempted to ban this story.Some claim this story is racist (African-American, or whatever the PC title is currently). IT IS NOT!!!For one thing, this story takes place in INDIA, not AFRICA. I went to school with a number of Indians and Pakistanis, and many of them are dark-skinned, like Little Black Sambo. Toward the end of the story, the tigers became ghee (or ghi), which is an Indian cooking fat, not African.Moreover, if that story took place in Africa, there would be no tigers. Tigers are found ONLY in Asia. The closest any African would be to a tiger would be in a zoo, and there is no zoo mentioned in the story.This politically correct drivel over something that does not even exist has led to misunderstanding of a really good children's story (to say nothing of problems with a restaurant chain with part of the same name)."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"I'd say this is a racial book only if you make your mind up beforehand and are very narrow minded.

I couldn't wait to shareit with my kids and they both love it. They call it the tiger story and they know that it takes place in another country in another time. I have my original copy so my review is based on that.I was thinking of getting it for our kindle Fire also, so I was reading reviews to see if it contains the original photos. That's when I read the crazy reviews about it being a racial book andhad to chime in.

It was same story as Little Black Sambo, with the same characters (albeit with different names) in the correct Indian setting. It had the same humor (who cannot appreciate a tiger wearing shoes on its ears), the same thrill of victory when the tigers run themselves into butter and a courageous little boy gets his clothes back, the same self-satisfied pleasure when a happy family stuffs itself with buttered pancakes. I enjoyed reading it immensely.Which is why I am disappointed with this volume. When I heard that a new edition of The Story of Little Black Sambo was being published under it's original title, I was anxious to add it to my collection. I loved it as a child, and I was ready to love it again as an adult. Now that I have my copy in hand, though, I find that I'm of two minds about it. One the one hand, it's a visual treat -- the pictures fairly hum with life. The detail work is amazing, from the proper caste mark on the mother's forehead to the south-bound end of a certain north-bound tiger. The reader is left in no doubt that he or she is deep in the Indian sub-continent.And that is the problem. Because if the plants are Indian, and the birds are Indian, and the tigers are Indian, and the buildings are Indian, and the clothes are Indian, and the personal decoration is Indian, why, then, aren't the people Indian? As I look at his illustrations, I couldn't help feeling that Bing knew exactly where his story was set, he just couldn't bring himself to let go of that old, incorrect stereotype that has plagued this story for so many years. The mixture of the two strikes a decidely peculiar note. I found myself noticing the incongruity and missing the story.In the end, then, Bing's illustrations do not so much advance the story, as illustrations should, as distract the reader from it.And that is a shame."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"The children's book was shipped in good order and the prodcut arrived promtly.

I don't think the intent of the story was racist, but of course you wouldn't think of something as racist when you are writing it and it is accepted at the time. 100 years from now people may think that it is racist to use the label African-American in books and many of you may say: &quot;No it's not, I read the story about Little African-American Keisha and how she ate 1,000 waffles and the little Indian boy made all of the lions melt into syrup.&quot; The point is, there is never going to be a time where the meaning of something doesn't change. Ideologies and stereotypes are not consistent and so they falter. The story may appeal to people who grew up reading the book because in that time anything &quot;black&quot; could be used, and abused and as children you don't really value the feelings of other cultures. As long as the story puts you to bed at night, then it's all good. The author used someone clever and he had magical adventures. But to say that it is stupid and ignorant to view some aspects of the book as racist is stupid and ignorant within itself. African people have been portrayed in so many derogatory ways, it's hard to stomach things like illustrations of &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot; no matter how innocent they may be. For us it brings back memories of minstrel shows and times when African-Americanscould only get exposure as buffoons just for the enjoyment of European cultures. Those images to us, no matter what text they are put in are UGLY, very UGLY. If you read this book, I recommend following it up with the movie Bamboozled by Spike Lee. Let your children see that also. Maybe then you can understand why people feel the way they do. All the open-minded liberal people shouldn't mind watching it at all, right? After all, &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot; isn't racist, right? But the movie will help you to realize that words and pictures do hurt.Peace...Abztract"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"This book has been the source of contextualizing American racism. Even though the book does not deal with the African American, the character's names Sambo, Mumbo, and Jumbo are certainly not Indian but Jamaican.I heard about this book originally from a rap CD Mr. Hood by the group KMD where the words &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot; were scratched in with other images of Ernie and Bert from Sesame Street. The rap group suggests that racism notions begin in innocence and progress eventually to stereotypical behavior. However, it points out that African Americans stereotype whites and pokes fun of that using Mr. Hood as the prototypical white businessman who is outwitted by the group members. By using Mr. Hood as a contrast to Black Sambo and the orange colored Ernie and Bert, KMD shows that racism by both white and blacks can be detrimental.I think that this child's book is important as a part of American memorabilia and for understanding the history of racial stereotypical. Whether or not people believe the racism of Bannermann's book, Little Black Sambo is always an essential book to read by both children and adults."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF LITTLE BLACK SAMBO.","review":"This is racist trash and I find myself alternately appalled and amused by the bizarrely arrogant defense of such insulting tripe, brimming with racial slander.

Lansdale's The Drive-In","review":"The Adaptation of Joe Lansdale's \\"The Drive-In\\" is as much about humanistic horror as it is supernatural. A devious, and visceral lab experiment with humans as the test subjects. A group of young friends in Texas decide to spend an evening at the Orbit drive-in movie theater to see an all night long horror film festival with movies like \\"Evil Dead\\", \\"Dawn of the Dead\\", \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\", and more, but the terror will soon turn all too real. Best friends Jack and Bob, along with sheepish Randy, and tough biker Willard think they're in for a long evening of horror classics and beer when the appearance of a meteor changes everything. Suddenly the four friends find themselves trapped in the drive-in with hundreds of other customers by an otherworldly force. They are virtually cut off from the rest of the world by a darkened sky and an impenetrable wall which virtually melts anyone who tries to leave.Without any means of calling for help, and dwindling food supplies from the concession stand, it is the reactions of the captives that provide the true horror. Some rage forth to try and takeover the concession stand for themselves, others decide that end of the world sex is the way to go, while a fundamentalist Christian movement starts up preaching the way of God. Jack retreats into a shell and has to be pulled out of his self-imposed isolation by Bob who has a hidden stash of food in his car. Meanwhile Willard and Randy's relationship soon turns grossly symbiotic. The pair takes over the concession stand and are struck by a bolt of lightening which should have killed them both. Instead, the pair's bodies have become virtually fused together in a twisted, corroded form that now calls itself the Popcorn King. This demonic dark lord soon has most of the residents worshipping him as a God, even as he feasts upon their bodies. Bob & Jack soon realize that they may be the only hope of salvation for the survivors as they hatch a plot to destroy the Popcorn King.Lansdale's original story is adapted by Christopher Golden who is probably best known for his Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels as well as writer of the Buffy comic for Dark Horse. He is aided greatly by the beautifully chaotic artwork of Andres Guinaldo who captures the drive-in in all its animalistic glory. The true horror isn't the demonic Popcorn King but seeing how humanity quickly degrades in the face of adversity. Typical, and outstanding Lansdale and a fine job by Golden and Guinaldo.

Recently, in my &quot;real&quot; life, I was part of an event that I believe warrants coverage as narrative nonfiction, and no one in the world is better positioned than I am to tell the story. But, how to start? Peter Rubie's book has been a great help in getting me ready to take my proposal to agents. He describes the genre and what makes good narrative. He has many helpful suggestions for conducting research--especially on conducting interviews. He offers great advice on contacting and interesting an agent. And, finally, he gives a useful tutorial on producing the killer proposal. Although I have other books on proposal writing and marketing that are more detailed, I'm glad I started with this book."},{"Title":"Telling the Story: How to Write and Sell Narrative Nonfiction","review":"Early reviews of Telling The Story: \\"TELLING THE STORY is an invaluable resource for anyone grappling with a nonfiction project.

It has a index in the back which is kind of nice even though there aint much to navigate through. The book is a very convenient size. So dont worry about the images being to small, they kept that in mind. In the beginning the author of the book includes his own personal input about the artist. After that for every painting he has included the title of the painting and a personal input from Jacek himself. Even has a couple photos of Jacek which is nice. The only thing you might need to worry about is like with all paperbacks the bindings might come loose after a lengthy period of time. Also includes some good quotes from various geniuses throughout time in here.ABOUT THE ARTISTMy personal input about Jacek is that he is more on the positive side of surrealism. He has really dreamy kind of art which I find very creative. He is one of the truthfully more creative artists. He has somewhat in my oppinion a childish kind of touch to his art. Which is not bad, yet making his art more positive then anything I guess I could say. He is highly creative from his surroundings and dreams, yet I think he might have somewhat a child aspect to his imagination. Most of his work is not bright, yet medium tone. If you like any surreal artwork, check into him.RECOMMENDATIONSLook into Beksinski if you like Jacek. As opposite of Jacek, Beksinski is more focused on the negative side of things. I really appreaciate his artwork due to the corruption, uglyiness, truthfulness, etc. in his artwork. He really has some disturbed images, yet it doesn't reallt have any symbolism in it. Just disturbed yet VERY creative mind. Even Jacek followed into his work.John Satre is supposed to be a very good author of leader of existentialism. He is in the literature and philosphy. Existentialism is a philosphy on how we were all born of nothing and how we are ultimately free and etc. You get the idea. It really emphasizes on your freedom of creativity and has some good philosphy. Even though I am Christian and his book is somewhat against religion, it is still good to learn from.LINKSJacek art - http://www.yerka.pl/Yerka-pic.htmlJacek art - http://www.imagenetion.org/cabernet/jyerka1.htmBeksinski art - http://www.beksinski.pl/Beksinski art - http://www.museummorpheus.com/contemp/beksinski/John Satre - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_SartreP.S.

This book part autobiography and part memoir, details the life of Queen Lili'uokalani the last monarch of the Hawaiian Islands. The Queen describes the events of her life in some cases in minute detail. A devout Christian and a socialite, the Queen constantly describes dinner parties as well as other social occassions she attended. In some places the Queen does detail the happenings on the Hawaiian Islands, and finally toward the end of the book she details the overthrow of her administration and the attempts by the new provisional government to annex the Islands to the U.S.The Queen makes some valid points in arguing against annexation by the U.S. The book does contain some interesting chapters detailing the resulting investigation of U.S. authorities into her regimes overthrow and how the Cleveland Administration attempted to end the wrongful overthrow of the Queen. The Queen till the end is a respectful and articulate writer and never seems as though her anger has influenced her words. Hawaii's Story is a sad chapter in U.S. History. This book contains many pieces of interesting information and is a good starting place for those interested in studying the subject.

I thoroughly enjoyed it and will now purchase a copy for my own reference. If you want to know the TRUE history of Hawai'i, I can think of no better place to start than this original source.

In the case of the Hawaiian history I believe that is absolutely true. I had this book on the shelf a long time and never read it. What prompted my interest was a biographical podcast on the life of Queen Liluokalani. In the podcast they were (I believe) extremely critical of her. The podcast said she had \\"No Mercy\\" and called for beheading of the conspirators. What bothered me was this was a random podcast by someone who did not seem to have an axe to grind, after all they did many different biographical subjects from history. Seriously questioning this podcasts facts I noticed this book on my shelf, \\"Hawaii's Story.\\" I was surprised who wrote it, the Queen herself. I was extremely impressed by her intelligence and style of writing (although her diction is dated and sounded like Charles Dickens) What still interested me though, was to know if it was true she had no mercy and sought beheading's. After reading her side of the story, I have concluded, yes someone at some time had made that accusation, even though I have not read or found the source of the accusation. But if one is to know Hawaii and Hawaiian history, one can also generally conclude that many false accusations were made at that time to discredit the Hawaiian monarchy. It is easy to believe those accusations when you come from a background were the European nations are believed superior. I can safely conclude that although displeased with the conspirators, this Christian raised, well educated women regarded the sanctity of life. I am sure wild accusations flew from all sides, seems the nature of politics. What I see is people who are not from Hawaii, years later seem to lend greater credence to the stories that she was merciless rather than examine the injustice. In conclusion I have seen that history is written by the victors!"},{"Title":"Hawaii's story","review":"This is the only book you will ever need to read on the 1893 fall of the Hawaiian Kingdom. Incredible that after over 100 years this book along with the Blount report to Congress remain the only true and unbaised account of the 1893 fall of the Hawaiian Kingdom. LILIUOKALANI was a highly regal & educated woman of grace. She was a far kinder and wiser ruler than her famous brother King Kalakua although in her lifetime this was not viewed as true.

A group of rich, influential plantation owners overthrew the government of the indigenous people and hoarded wealth and power for themselves. What happened next is predictable--the foreign rich got richer while the people of the islands tail-spinned into a state of poverty that's still prevalent today. Go drive down west Oahu, and you'll see people living in tents and under tarps on the beaches. One of the first things you'll notice is that they're all Native Hawaiians.\\"Hawaii's Story by Hawaii's Queen\\" is the that rare piece of history, an account of a great crime from a primary source. Reserved and Victorian in tone, Queen Liliuokalani, Hawaii's last monarch, recounts how the overthrow came to pass. Though the narrative meanders at times, especially when the author describes attending Queen Victoria's jubilee, she hits her mark when discussing the duplicitous and systematic stripping of power of her and her brother's, King Kalakaua's, reign. This is a woman who knows loss--she witnessed the death of all those close to her and the loss of her kingdom itself. Yet she persevered and wrote this book.

His duties were to act as sutler to the military, dispensing goods when necessary. His adventures were diverse and many along the Missouri River during this time period. To hear him tell of these experiences is close to being there personally.Later taken prisoner in Santa Fe in 1820, then his release and hard fought survival on the winter plains is just plain awe-inspiring.After returning to the states, he eventually fell into politics and ultimately became New Mexico Territorial Governor during the early 1850's. These were tough times with Indian hostilities and boundary disputes with Mexico. Meriwether weathered the storm amazingly well, all the while doing his utmost to improve all the difficulties implicated.A riveting read of a remarkable man."},{"Title":"The Woman Who Gave Birth to Rabbits: Stories","review":"Being both a fiction writer and historian, Emma Donahue has compiled a book of short stories based on events and people she came across in her research. In many cases all she had to work with were one or two sentences, a name, or a rather fantastic story. So she took it upon herself to create the stories and characters that might be behind these brief bits of information.It's an interesting idea, and the actual writing is flowing and poetic, however, the majority of these stories ultimately disappointed me. Sometimes it's because her stories are a little too obvious, as with the title story. If you are going to write about a woman who is reported to have given birth to rabbits, and you want to give a logical explanation, a scam is about the only explanation you can come up with. THe only room for creativity is in why these folks decided to try it and how they came up with it, both of which I found to lack much depth.The greatest shortcoming, however, was in the length of the stories. When the main purpose is to develop a character behind a bit of news, it requires far more words. THese stories were more on the order of short shorts. Yet because they were based on actual events, the surprise endings and plot turns required to make a short short work, are not here. Therefore the reader is ultimately left unsatisfied and wondering why the story needed to be written in the first place.Oddly enough, the only story that appealed to me was the last one, Looking for Petronella. This story was quite a bit longer than the others and had more depth. The plot was also a lot more creative. It was almost as though the author needed to build her momentum to reach this point.All in all this is not a bad read, but nothing I need to keep on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Woman Who Gave Birth to Rabbits: Stories","review":"...what the lives of others were like, the others being those figures in history you may have heard or read about, or perhaps just a no-name other, then this is the book for you. Ms. Donoghue finds snippets of information about historical women and crafts a little larger snippet of life for them. The stories are not long, and I feel justifiably so. These are just tastes, just notions of what life might have been like. They are dreams, creations on a whim to explain the life of a woman so very long ago in England.Ms. Donoghue's writing is wonderful. It has a musical quality, shows its humor and tenderness, greed and hesitation. Her imagination is rich and deep, and her research astounding for such small stories.This is a thoroughly enjoyable book that I would easily recommend."},{"Title":"The Woman Who Gave Birth to Rabbits: Stories","review":"Such an amazing short story collection - Emma Donoghue's historic fiction is gorgeously written. As a historian, Donoghue has stumbled upon brilliant sotries of extraordinary women lost over time. These seventeen vivacious tales take us back through the last few centuries in England and Ireland, fleshing out personal accounts discovered through lost letters and archives.The first story, \\"The Last Rabbit\\" is an excellent build up for the entire collection. Donoghue narrates the experiences of Mary Toft, who in the 1700's tricked her Irish town and half of London into believing that she could give birth to rabbits. While medical experts tried to desperately to disprove the hoax, Mary suffers the indignities of being a medical marvel, suffering embarrasing examinations from an assortment of \\"birth experts\\" and speculators. Her own comentary practically relates childbirth to a form of prostitution, which makes sense that in the last scene she discovers that she has been taken to a brothel to give birth to her rabbits. Marriage, childbirth and the historical low status of women take up most of the storylines. In \\"Acts of Union\\", a syphallis infected soldier is tricked into marrying an apothecary's spinster-niece. Though the soldier certainly sees himself a victim, his bride seems to have settled for worse, but is left knowing that this is her only opportunity to marry.There is a certain richness to Donoghue's writing, dealing with religious and social misogyny. Her heroines are strangely tough, vulgar and sometimes shrewd, but there is a undeniable dignity to them. Later characters include a cult leader, a wheel-chair bound woman who leads rescue teams for drowning sailors and a pregnant countess convinced that she'll die during childbirth. One added bonus is that each chapter includes the historic contents of the protagonists, lists the articles and letters that the author used in her research. Not only are the stories based on some reality, but they feel very real. You can not doubt that you have learned something.THE WOMAN WHO GAVE BIRTH TO RABBITS is an amazing piece of literature.

The sad, aching to be that person that cares so much for someone else and has the dignity to not cross the line.

I wondered how he could write 10 books a year; now I know. This guy's a joke &, evidently, he knows it. It sounds like a junior high student wrote this. I know these are teen books but that doesn't give a writer the right to not give his work the proper attention. Even teenagers have more vocabulary than these characters do.

It freaked me out then, but I was surprised that I still found it entertaining. Corky's been battling this evil spirit for a while now. In the first book, it killed her sister, and in the second book she strangled her friend over the bathtub until the evil spirit got flushed down the drain. But you know, \\"IT CAN'T BE DROWNED\\" so the evil spirit is back again like an unwanted relative, and feistier than ever in the last-and best book in the trilogy. This is an ancient evil, and the characters think various cheesy, fearful thoughts whenever they refer to it. Most of the time they just call it \\"the evil\\".The whole thing with Corky kept the plot from lagging, and this book from suffering sequel-itis. When you think about it, it's the coolest way he could have ended it. This book is laughable sometimes, the cheerleaders discuss the evil spirit sometimes like they are discussing something they forgot to pick up from the store and then get back to their \\"ra ra\\" lives. My favorite quote \\"Maybe Debra's under the car?\\". The evil spirit thinks this hopefully after trying to run this character down in the mall parking lot and missing. Also, Debra, after almost getting run over, climbs up to the top of a mill with the cheerleader who was possessed. Hmm, you think warning bells would have gone off in her head after that. These cheerleaders are kind of dumb.But this is a young adult book, and I found I still enjoyed it after I recently read it."},{"Title":"The Third Evil (Fear Street Cheerleaders, No. 3)","review":"I've read every single book in the Cheerleaders series, and this one is my favorite.

I immediately notice on the back flip cover that he was married to Lydia, much younger than Penny. In his autobiography \\"Discovering the Secrets of Happiness\\" Ken wrote on p.167 that \\"I felt that Penny's refusal to share adult films with me\\" was already the seed for future divorce.In this book, as far as I can tell, he wrote only one paragraph about his 3rd ex-wife Penny on first page of ch.21 p.225: \\"Life still sends lots of 'hurricanes' to test me. My wife with whom I wanted to live the rest of my life decided she had another agenda. A training I had set up to teach the Living Love System fell apart. People I thought I could count on let me down. my personal curriculum at the University of Life is frequently enriched.\\"In his first Appendix subtitled \\"Inventory of Childhood Survival Strategies\\" he almost got the same conclusion Werner Erhard of EST and that I redefined as 'fall from heaven story' (see 'all my review' for examples and please find your own -- to find what's clipping your own happiness wing)Although this is one of his fattest book, it's an easy read. He has some interesting & enlightened claims:p.66 (again part of my #)- \\"Sex is a crucial area that is often complicated by a parent's false-self adaptations...One out of every three women in the US have experienced some form of sexual abuse before age 18...For childhood survival, we had to perfect our performance of the strategic, false-selves required by our caregivers...every five-year-old deserves an Oscar. We had to learn the 'right' lines provided by our caretakers. We had to convince everyone (including ourselves) as we automatically responded to life situations using our false-selves.\\"p.67 \\"Many of us, in varying degrees, have lost our aliveness and spontaneity. We have become depressed, unhappy, and desperate. We can become alive again and free from depression and anxiety when our self-esteem is based on the 'authenticity' and 'wholeness' of our true-self feelings-and not on the 'performance' of false-self adaptations that helped us survive childhood. When we reclaim the anaesthetized true-self parts we had to disown, WE FEEL WHOLE. We experience that we are ENOUGH. It is interesting to note that the enlightened state of consciousness is often described as transpersonal, timeless, and being aware of what's here and now.\\"His definition of childhood abuses from the list on p. 87 include parent(s) that - physically leave you - is so busy that you get little quality time together - don't model their own emotions for you - don't affirm that it is okay for to have strong emotions... - use you to take care of their own unmet needs or desires - use you to take care of their failing marriage - hide and deny their shameful secrets to the outside world, and you have to protect these hidden issues in order to keep the family balance - do not give you their time, attention, and direction - act shamelessly with physical violence, incest, verbal abuse, etc.On both 2nd page of his introduction & p.85 Ken quoted \\"50% of female murders in the US are by husbands or ex-husbands!\\" and he wrote\\"The MOST DANGEROUS place for any child IS THE AMERICAN FAMILY...every year in the US, about 2,000 children are killed yearly by their parents - and millions are psychologically crippled.\\"To be fair to the whole human world, I will take 'the' out of \\"in the US\\" out and replace that with simply \\"in US\\" to be closer to the truth.On p.91 as example of LOVE-BASED PARENTING Ken only had one example of a lighted candle & small statue on a low table and a 1-year old moving toward the table 15-20 times and her mom rushing to lovingly pick him up and say something like \\"you could get burn by the candle\\". Ken was impressed by the mom's patience & skill.That is a mistake, what the mom did was still based on fear of the child burning his hand, thus not unconditional love. I would either shift the candle & statue away or gently let my son touch the flame of the candle.The latter is what I chose to do with my 1+year old son with the fire on the oven, his automatic reflex is to recoil his hand from the heat and I said 'hot, hot, hot'. So my son experienced and understood from then on, what 'hot' is, and at the same time he didn't get burn. That is growing with understanding & gentle guidance and is a very simple example of unconditional love.The problem is that Ken is trying to 'do' unconditional love while I am coming from unconditional love or 'being'. That's why he's 'erratic' in happiness while I can be 'consistent' most of the time. A by-product of this is, he wasn't fully aware of his own 'fall from heaven story' as I do.Ken in his autobiography \\"Discovering the Secrets of Happiness\\" didn't say anything negative about his childhood or parents and there was a lack of authenticity about it. In this present last book before he passed away on Dec. 1995, Ken only has one example beginning p. 177 subtitled LOVE IS BLIND about his mom & his 2nd wife Bonita as \\"My mother was a dramatic, fiery redhead who hurt me by either criticizing or becoming sullen and withdrawn to coerce me doing what she wanted\\".He wrote only one story or a whole chapter 10 on Lydia. He was able to shift his perception of his wife Lydia as inconsiderate to considerate. That is a very good example of Jerry Jampolsky's 'Love is letting go of fear' or I would say \\"where fear exist, unconditional love can't exist\\".The synchronicity in that story is that it had to do with an apple tree, just like in the garden of Eden.Although I gave this book 5-star, there is simply NO ROAD MAP TO HAPPINESS since happiness can't be found out there, like unconditional LOVE it can only come FROM WITHIN every ONE."},{"Title":"Your Road Map to Lifelong Happiness: A Guide to the Life You Want (Keyes, Jr, Ken)","review":"I found the book when I was in great difficulties because one of my family members was suffering serious mental illness. Although she was getting better and better with the help of her psychiatrists, I was still frustrated in how I CAN HELP HER FULLY RECOVER after she was discharged from hospital.Past experience has told me that doctors or psychiatrists mainly take their responsibilities in hospital with no more than providing medicaions. The fact is that medications can never guarantee all the time if the person with mentel illness does not know what caused the illness and how to escape. When I finished reading the book YOUR ROAD MAP TO LIFELONG HAPPINESS, I believed and still belive that I have found my lighthouse with hope.I've got the way how to help my relative heal.The author is very skillful in telling us about how our brains evolved with some limitations (he called quirks)and how these limitations work to make people sick or trapped in some way in life. The author also points out that our brains have developed to such a level that people can learn how to deal with the limitations.They can make a good use of their relatively highly developed brains by looking after themselves like a well-informed parent protecting and calming down their children when they found themselves in some separate and negative emotional situiation.As long as people master the approach, they can keep themselves unified and happy for ever..This book is actually a very practical psychological book. I have read some other books in this field but this book has really given me a map to how to find happiness both physically and spiritually. With the newly learned knowledge I have helped my relative step on the journey to recover much more effectively. The book has also saved my family all.

For me, a stay at home mom with three children, life is less overwhelming if it's tackled moment by moment. Julie Clark Robinson, has a way with writing that is fresh and inviting. She has grasped who she is, the good with the bad, inviting women to do the same. Her quirkiness is refreshing and just the kind of stories I long to read during my two minute breaks between laundry and dishes. She is inspiring, encouraging women to look beyond the spilled cereal and mounds of laundry and capture each day not by the seasons,years, or months, but moment by moment."},{"Title":"Live In The Moment","review":"Julie Clark Robinson has a very unique way of turning everyday trials into laughter. Live in the Moment is very easy reading.It is a book that can relate to any woman at any age. You catch yourself laughing one minute, then wanting to cry the next. It is a very real, raw and candid guide not to waste your life on frivilous things that we cannot change. The book has helped me put the past where is belongs and cherrish the relationships that I have today."},{"Title":"Live In The Moment","review":"Author makes a good point that if one lived in the present time and did not get weighted down by things in the past or potential things in the future, then one could live a better, happier, and more enjoyable life."},{"Title":"Live In The Moment","review":"I reviewed this book because I've always struggled to focus on the present. My personality continually pushes me to plan and prepare for the future, attempting to reduce uncertainty whenever possible. Over the years, I've forgotten how to enjoy the blissful state of being, whether it's a brisk walk in the park on a rainy day (without a cell phone) or just sitting on the beach reading a favorite paperback.Sadly, I miss out on what's really important--time with my family. Some people call me driven and ambitious, others consider me a workaholic, and my family thinks I've taken multi-tasking to the extreme. I hoped to rediscover myself and my priorities by reading Live in the Moment.Julie Clark Robinson shares her zest for life and honest account of living in the moment in ten brisk chapters. Leaving behind the glamorous and lucrative life of an advertising copywriter, Robinson discovers the joy of a meaningful writing career, the value of close friends, and the love of her devoted husband and children. Each chapter ends with journaling, sensory cues, and activities to apply lessons learned.The writing style is friendly, amusing, and optimistic. Although Robinson wrote advertising copy early in her career, it's apparent that her gift is translating personal reflections of every-day experiences into instruction we can all benefit from. I particularly enjoyed chapter eight on \\"dealing with death and dying\\" since she incorporates another culture's perspective through her experience of Mexico's El Dia de los Muertos or the \\"Day of the Dead\\" celebrated in November.In today's world of excessive technology and hassle, Robinson offers thought-provoking and life-altering insights into living mindfully, cheerfully, and peacefully. Less is often more and living abundantly is achievable when we take charge of our happiness. Live in the Moment is a valuable guidebook, like a AAA Trip Tik(r) designed to help us navigate the alternative routes we can choose in order to live a significant life.Armchair Interviews highly recommends this book for anyone who desires to change lanes from the corporate fast track to the leisurely treasure-each-moment track. Rest assured with Robinson's help and a little patience, you'll still arrive at your desired destination."},{"Title":"Live In The Moment","review":"I was given your book by a dear friend at a time in my life which my usually sunny outlook had been trampled.

The author is world famous for his pioneering efforts in identifying traits in particular traits in ethnic groups with unique genetic markers. The color plates in the index section can be helpful to those who know how to intrepret them.It's a scholarly treatment of a highly technical subject and a thorough one as well. This is ground-breaking work collected from many samples and analyzed in detail. I think this should be required reading for college students in the field of genetic research."},{"Title":"THE HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY OF HUMAN GENES.","review":"I bought and read Cavalli-Sforza's \\"The History and Geography of Human Genes,\\" and in the first chapter the author pulls out that same blarney about there being no genetic basis for racial classification. It's bull, and the author knows that it is bull. After he writes it, he goes on to demonstrate, throughout all the rest of his book, that there certainly IS a genetic basis for racial classification.The idea that race is a social construct began in 1973 with an article written by Harvard geneticist Richard Lewontin. He speculated that the genetic differences between human groups were so small that no one working with genetic data alone could tell the difference between a white, a black, an Asian, and so on. He said first what Cavalli-Sforza now repeats (even though Cavalli-Sforza knows better): that there's no genetic basis to race.That assertion has since been disproved. By the year 2000, it had become possible for DNA analysis to sort humans into their racial classifications by using genetic information alone. Studies with human samples numbering in the thousands have shown that DNA analysis can predict how someone would classify himself racially with an accuracy of about 99.9 percent.Cavalli-Sforza is probably worried about censorship, and that squid-ink in the early pages is an appeasing sop to the leftist racial egalitarians, so they won't agitate to have his book banned. Except for that intentional misstatement in the first chapter, HGHG is a very thorough and informative book on the history of the human colonization of the Earth."},{"Title":"THE HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY OF HUMAN GENES.","review":"In this book, a group of Italian researchers present their study of the repartition of a sample of human genetic sequences, based on data they collected between 1978 and 1986. This is certainly very interesting for the study of human races, even if based on only a sample of sequences, many of them being not relevant for races. Although the authors acknowledge that some scientists were able to identify and classify the majors races, they pretend the concept of race is a failure because there is much intra-class variation for some DNA sequences within given races (by saying this they already implicitly recognize the existence of given races.) This is however the fallacy of strawman - attacking a caricatured enemy - for the concept of race never meant that there would not be great inner variation for specific sequences, but only that it is possible to cluster and classify human groups and that such classification should correspond to a higher degree of common ancestry for individuals of the same cluster, as the races are the result of micro-evolution. And given that we now know that most of the genome is not used, that the active genes are a very small proportion, the intra-class variability makes sense, as these genes are not expressed and thus not submitted to the selection of evolutionary pressure. It is enough to find some sequences clusters that correspond to the existing races to show that different races indeed exist, which the authors actually do (something confirmed recently by the result of the genome projects, finding that inter-races distance is 0,1 of the genome, something enormous given that most of the genome is not expressed, and that the distance between humans and monkeys is 1%, the difference between human races being then 10% of the differences between humans and the closest animals.) Besides, the same intra-classes variability is also observed among animal races and vegetal varieties, yet no scientist will say that this makes the concept of animal race or vegetal variety useless. Anyway, this misconception allows the authors to get a green light from the politically correct thought police and avoid censorship.The book follows with an exposition of their data analysis method. The main issue is the distance measure for the genetic data, something new for me. Otherwise, they use standard methods of data mining / pattern recognition : design of classification trees, and clustering with principal component analysis (PCA, for which the authors use the PC acronym).Then, after 60 pages, come their results, which make the rest of the book, 300, p, that is most of it. It is way too much to review in detail, I will make general comments.Globally, when dealing with the main racial groups, their findings are corroborations of what was already known or supplementary information. The PCA gives a mapping corresponding to the main racial groups (Africans, Australoids, Mongoloids, Euripids.) .After 200 000 years of existence (at about -200 000), our African ancestors start to move northwards and evolve into the common ancestor of the non-African races. 100 000 years later, at -110 000, occurs the split between the Australoids and the Eurasian. And then at -80 000 the split between Mongoloids and Euripids, Europeans appearing very lately, at -20 000.In the remaining 200 pages, the authors deal with each local populations, proceeding continent by continent, and comparing the local races together. Interestingly, they add a lot of environmental and cultural information. But here they miss the most relevant, namely the history and anthropology that is relevant to the given population, which makes them miss important considerations and analysis. For example they seem to believe that the Basque are an ancient Indigenous population, failing to know the well established facts that they arrived very late (in the 8th century) and are believed to have come from the Caucasus. It would have been interesting to compare the Basques with the populations of the Caucasus, instead of comparing them with the native Western Europeans. Or they fail to know that the native populations of North-Africa (Berbers, Kabyls, etc.) were very blond and tall Nordic people, as is attested by the Egyptian, Greek and Roman antic sources, as well as by their Arabs conquerors. And when the Spanish conquered the Canari Island, the Berbers (Ganches) they found there were also Nordics. The genetic change of the North-African population occurred after the Arabs imported many African (Negroids) slaves, as they did in many other places, like Egypt, Palestine, etc. This the authors ignore, speaking only of the Arab genetic influence (which was probably insignificant.) It would have then relevant to compare the North-Africans with the Nordics and with the Negroids, and see how close they are to each, and the same for those Berbers populations in the mountain who did not so much racially mix and often have light hair of eyes. To their credit, the authors find out with their genetic analysis that the North-Africans have Caucasoid ancestors.In conclusion, this book is a mine of interesting data analysis. It would have been though quite better if the authors had teamed up with historians competent in the field of racial history, or with true anthropologists (anthropology having becoming ethnology.) Let's hope that the next similar book, which will exploit the data of the human genome, will be able to improve this. Anyway, human diversity, as long as intermixing does not destroy it, is a thrilling subject that illuminates history, as this book shows."},{"Title":"THE HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY OF HUMAN GENES.","review":"Cavalli-Sforza &amp; The Reality of Race by Steve Sailer (www.iSteve.com)The New York Times has hailed &quot;Genes, Peoples, and Languages&quot;, the new book by Professor Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, the dean of population geneticists, for &quot;dismantling the idea of race.&quot; In the New York Review of Books, Jared Diamond salutes Cavalli-Sforza for &quot;demolishing scientists' attempts to classify human populations into races in the same way that they classify birds and other species into races&quot;.Cavalli-Sforza himself has written, &quot;The classification into races has proved to be a futile exercise&quot;; and that &quot;The idea of race in the human species serves no purpose.&quot;Don't believe any of this. This is merely a politically correct smoke screen that Cavalli-Sforza regularly pumps out that keeps his life's work -- identifying the myriad races of mankind and compiling their genealogies -- from being defunded by the commissars of acceptable thinking at Stanford.What's striking is how the press falls for his squid ink, even though Cavalli-Sforza can't resist proudly putting his genetic map showing the main races of mankind right on the cover of his 1994 magnum opus, &quot;The History and Geography of Human Genes.&quot;(Here's also a link to Cavalli-Sforza's map on the website of molecular anthropologist Jonathan Marks, author of &quot;Human Biodiversity,&quot; one of the few leftists acute enough to notice the spectacular contradiction between Cavalli-Sforza's boilerplate about the meaninglessness of race and the cover of his most important book: http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~jonmarks/hgdpmap.html)This is Cavalli-Sforza's own description of this map that is the capstone of his half century of labor in human genetics: &quot;The color map of the world shows very distinctly the differences that we know exist among the continents: Africans (yellow), Caucasoids (green), Mongoloids ... (purple), and Australian Aborigines (red). The map does not show well the strong Caucasoid component in northern Africa, but it does show the unity of the other Caucasoids from Europe, and in West, South, and much of Central Asia.&quot;Basically, all his number-crunching has produced a map that looks about like what you'd get if you gave Jesse Helms a paper napkin and a box of crayons and had him draw a racial map of the world. In fact, at the global level, Cavalli-Sforza has largely confirmed the prejudices of the more worldly 19th Century imperialists. Rudyard Kipling and Cecil Rhodes could have hunkered down together and whipped up something rather like this map in honor of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.Cavalli-Sforza's new book, &quot;Genes, Peoples, and Languages,&quot; is a surprisingly readable updating of a series of lectures on his work that he's been giving for years. It's not at all a bad introduction to this hugely productive scientist. But to find out just how politically unpopular Cavalli-Sforza's findings really are, you need to crack open his tecnically intimidating but endlessly fascinating landmark, &quot;The History and Geography of Human Genes.&quot; (The reaonably priced abridged version is all that you'd ever need; the $195 unabridged volume is for libraries only.) It remains the best summary of how the early humans of Africa split apart into the countless racial groups we see today.Cavalli-Sforza's team compiled extraordinary tables depicting the &quot;genetic distances&quot; separating 2,000 different racial groups from each other. For example, assume the genetic distance between the English and the Danes is equal to 1.0. Then, Cavalli-Sforza has found, the separation between the English and the Italians would be about 2.5 times as large as the English-Danish difference. On this scale, the Iranians would be 9 times more distant genetically from the English than the Danish, and the Japanese 59 times greater. Finally, the gap between the English and the Bantus (the main group of sub-Saharan blacks) is 109 times as large as the distance between the English and the Danish. (The genetic distance between Japanese and Bantus is even greater.)From these kind of tables, Cavalli-Sforza reached this general conclusion: &quot;The most important difference in the human gene pool is clearly that between Africans and non-Africans ...&quot; As you can imagine, this finding could get him in a bit of hot water if the campus thought police ever found out about it. So, we should certainly forgive the charade he keeps up to fool the New York Times. But, we definitely don't have to believe it.Ultimately, what is a &quot;race&quot;? It is essentially a lineage, a family tree. A racial group is merely an extremely extended family that inbreeds to some extent. Thus, race is a fundamental aspect of the human condition because we are all born into families. Burying our heads in the sand and refusing to think clearly about this bedrock fact of life only makes the inevitable problems caused by race harder to overcome."},{"Title":"Complete Guide To Successful Publishing","review":"I used this book as a guide when I was starting my own publishing company, \\"Noble Publishing.\\" I have just published my eighth book.

Actually, that's just a jumping-off point for a poem more concerned with philosophical issues than the here and now, which is fairly uncommon in this age of tinny free verse poems about pretty much nothing. Ammons' imagination takes him all over the map, from musings on the trials of being sixty-three years old with &quot;an unaccomplished mission unaccomplished,&quot; to the possibility of personal immortality. Parts are a little obscure, but on the whole this is very readable, even funny at times. Ammons knows how to make philosophy entertaining; as he puts it, &quot;Argument is like dining:/mess with a nice dinner long enough, it's garbage.&quot;"},{"Title":"Garbage: A Poem","review":"Garbage by A.R. Ammons reads--almost--like stream-of-consciousness writing, except that it really consists of well-structured, paired lines that take us,with the poet, on a journey through the junk that permeates not only our world but also our minds, hearts, and consciences. As an older reader (and English teacher for almost 30 years), I identify strongly with much that he says. And I like his unpretentious, but strong use of language.

But, the next thing you know, Ammons is making you a believer with his astounding lyricism and exuberance. He then turns his romanticized trash heap into a springboard for a engaging discussion of life, art and the question of what is permanent.

He only lived 32 years but created an Empire that spanned 1000's of miles and included many cultures. He was tutored by Aristotle and raised to be a king. He toppled Darius of Persia, conquered the surrounding areas and invaded India. When he took on a task, he stayed with it with dogged determination. He was a brilliant battlefield tactition and motivator of men.The story of his life was recorded by the classic biographers, Arrian, Plutarch and Curtius. In this book, Michael Wood presents Alexander's story by compiling the different accounts in chronological order. There is very little additional text, editorial, background, etc. Sometimes, he interjects comments where the original accounts vary (due to the biases of the biograhpers). This is a simple book to read and understand.

The original texts were in Latin, but they are not reproduced here."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great","review":"Alexander the Great, by Arrian, is the modern English translation of \\"The Anabasis of Alexander\\" by Lucius Flavius Arrianus (Arrian), written in the second century A.D. There are no surviving \\"first hand\\" accounts of Alexander; however, Arrian informs us that his work is an abridgement of many other writers, some of whom accompanied Alexander on his conquest of the Persian Empire. In particular, Arrian relies most heavily on Ptolemy (an outstanding General in Alexander's army who later founded the Ptolemeic dynasty,in Egypt, ending with Cleopatra) and Aristobulus (probably a military engineer or civilian who accompanied Alexander on his campaign). Arrian is a Roman historian who lived 85 AD to 146 AD, and had multiple reasons for writing about the career of Alexander the Great. Arrian, himself, was a military leader over an entire Roman legion. No doubt, he had reason to admire Alexander for his brilliance as a leader and tactician. Also, although Arrian was a Roman citizen he was also ethnically Greek, born in the Greek town of Nicomedia. I can't help but feel that a sense of nationalism and pride may have played a role in Arrian's selection of 'Alexander of Macedon' as the subject for his books.This is the third audio book about Alexander the Great, in a row, that I have listened to. It is, as far as I am concerned, the gold standard by which to compare any other audio book on this subject. I discovered, while listening to the other two books that both authors quoted Arrian, either directly or indirectly, frequently. I decided, therefore, to go right to the source, itself, and listen to what Arrian had to say about Alexander; and I am glad that I did. I had some initial aprehension about listening to an audio book that was written (probably in 'Attic') in the second century AD; though my fears were unfounded. The translation is completely modern. I am not qualified to comment on the accuracy of the translation, either in word translation or in style; however, I can say that there are no anachronisms as a result of the translation.In addition to the main body of the translated work, comprising a total of 7 books (with only one of the original pages missing, and the narrater tells you where this occurs), there is: a brief introduction by Edwin Robert Bevin, an epilogue by William W. Tarn and a \\"copa to the epilogue\\" by Mary Renault. There are 26 mp3 tracts lasting 12 hours, in total. The Anabasis is narrated by the extremely talented Charlton Griffin. Unlike today's authors, Arrian does not spend a great deal of time discussing Alexander's family history, birth or formative years. This book focuses it's content primarily on Alexander's twelve years of conquest in Asia and India. Arrian gives a remarkably detailed account of Alexander's travels, with great attention to detail paid to both major and minor battles. For instance, Arrian will tell you how many foot soldiers, cavalry, archers and elephants each side possesed: how they arranged their troops and what the terrain and weather conditions were like at the time of battle. We learn the juicy details about who initiated the battle (usually Alexander), how the battle progresses and the ultimate outcome for each battle, with (often probably exaggerated) numbers given for the dead and wounded, on each side. We learn, not only the strategy and tactics that Alexander employed and how quickly he was capable of modifying them but also, according to General Ptolemy, the reasons why Alexander chose his specific strategies and tactics, and the reasons why he occasionally abandoned his usual methods.Arrian does treat us to some the personal stories, outside of battle, which illuminate Alexander's character. I was amazed to learn how deeply religious Alexander was, making sure to offer sacrifices to the appropriate God's even when he was ill and it was all that he could do to perform the ceremonies. Religion was not a frivolous thing to these soldiers; they took it very seriously. I caution the listener NOT to judge Alexander by modern day standards. Alexander's time, cultural values, religious beliefs and mores were completely different from our own. Selling the wives and children of a defeated people into slavery was NOT considered wrong or immoral in Alexander's time; it was the norm. Arrian, fortunately, points out copious instances where Alexander defied tradition and raised himself and his troops to a higher moral standard than any other king of the same time period. He also points out that Alexander was human (even though Alexander considered himself a living God) and subject to the same temptations of the flesh that all men are subject to. Yet, in spite of this, Alexander proved himself capable of remarkable compassion, forgiveness and restraint for a king with unlimited power.Arrian's style of writing is rather straightforward, with the occassional editorializing. Today's historians place great emphasis on accuracy of details, but the ancient historians (the Greeks, especially) focused more on the moral and meaning of the story. I find Arrian a pleasant balance between the two (though, admittedly, I prefer greater historical accuracy). I loved this book and look forward to future listenings. I give credit to Arrian for the labor he put into these seven books, before the advent of the printing press, computers or even the pen. I am also grateful that these seven books have survived the ages, that we may know Alexander of Macedon, better. The introduction and epilogues are short, but good (especially Mary Renault's). However, my greatest praise goes to the Narrater, Charlton Griffin. All I can say is...Wow. He made me feel like Arrian was speaking directly to me. Griffin brought Lucius Flavius Arrianus to life and Arrian helped make Alexander \\"real,\\" to me.Other books, which give more detail of Alexander's early life, and tutelage under Aristotle, may complement this book but I doubt any other book will replace it."},{"Title":"Alexander the Great","review":"The idea is to cut-and-paste segments from classical biographers into a relatively cohesive narrative of Alexander's life and exploits.

Enthusiastically recommended!"},{"Title":"Alexander the Great","review":"With an introduction by Michael Wood, who in the 1990s produced the BBC series In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great, this book was assembled by Tania Gergel who took the work of three famous Alexander the Great biographers--Lucius Flavius Arrianus (Arrian), Plutarch, and Quintus Curtius Rufus--and edited them into a single narrative. All the authors are citizens of the Roman Empire writing centuries after Alexander had died, but they are closer to his time then we are to theirs.Gergel does an excellent job of taking the best of the three works and making them into one single narrative. The story goes from Alexander's princely boyhood to the death of the King who was ruler of the all the world that was known to him.For years the Persian Empire had been the greatest threat to the freedom of Greece, the invasions of Darius I and Xerxes the Great had ended the polis or city-state of Greece and led various leagues and counter leagues transforming the culture of Greece from a free collections of city-states into the foundation for an empire. Alexander's father, Phillip, had brought Greece under the thumb of Macedon. Alexander takes the long-standing Greek conflicts, and brings a new war to Persia itself, invading and conquering the greatest power in the ancient world.The Alexander portrayed in this text is a young man of brilliance and inexhaustible ambition. He is viewed as good person who kind and charitable but becomes corrupted with power and does cruel things even to his closest friends. Although the would later regret some of his actions his remorse comes only after the evil deed is done. Yet his flaws are from the same source as his strengths so it is hard to tell if he could be any other way.\\"Meanwhile some of the older of his companions, and Parmenion in particular, looked out over the plain between the river Niphates and the Gordyaean mountains and saw the entire plain agleam with the watch-fires of the barbarians, while from their camp there arose the confused and indistinguishable murmur of myriads of voices, like the distant roar of a vast ocean. They were filled with amazement at the sight and remarked to one another that it would be an overwhelmingly difficult task to defeat an enemy of such strength by engaging him by day. They therefore went to the king as soon as he had performed his sacrifice and tried to persuade him to attack by night, so as to conceal from his men the most terrifying element in the coming struggle, that is, the odds against them. It was then that Alexander gave them his celebrated answer, \`I will not steal my victory.' Some of his companions thought this an immature and empty boast on the part of a young man who was merely joking at the presence of danger. But others interpreted it as meaning that he had confidence in his present situation and that he had correctly judged the future. In other words, he was determined that if Darius were defeated, he should have no cause to summon the courage for another attempt: he was not to be allowed to blame darkness and night for his failure on this occasion, as at Issus he had blamed the narrow mountain passes and the sea. Certainly Darius would never abandon the war for lack of arms or of troops, when he could draw upon such a vast territory and such immense reserves of manpower. He would only do so when he had lost courage and become convinced of his inferiority in consequence of an unmistakable defeat suffered in broad daylight.\\" p.70-1This is a great little book.

He also brings some archeological information into the equation. In all three cases he relies on the syntheses of other researchers, such as J.P. Mallory. to complete his triangulation of perspectives: geneology-linguistics-archeology.All three disciplines suggest change occurs, if by change you mean that various genes, pots, and ways of speaking evolve, or are overrun by others or overrun others themselves. What is of interest to Cavalli-Sforza is this: What can gentics tell us about change as well as its various outcomes?All the evidence seems to point to two possible causes of change, the first demic, the second cultural transmission. Demic change occurs when one group physically displaces another though migration or differential reproduction (births). Groups with violent ways may replace more passive groups. Groups with higher fertility may replace those with lower fertility. The second method of change, cultural transmission occurs when Group B adopts Group A's cultural practices - way of speaking, making pots, burial practices, and the like.Although he looks at change throughout the world, like many scholars, he focuses on the Indo-Europeans more than any other group. Cavalli-Sforza's theory regarding them (which he supports to some extent with detail from various scholars) suggests Renfrew and Gimbutas might both be right. Renfrew apparently links the distribution of Indo-European languages with the spread of farming practices making it a Neolithic event originating from Anatolia around 10,000 years ago. If Cavalli-Sforza is correct, 5,000 years later the Kurgan Bronze-Age culture described by Gimbutus which some scholars suggest probably spoke a proto-Indo-European language overran agricultural areas settled by their own ancestors.Cavalli-Sforza's book is a fascinating study that those interested in the links between linguistics and geneology might consider reading."},{"Title":"Genes, Peoples, and Languages","review":"Perhaps I was hoping for too much from this book, in which Prof. Cavalli-Sforza attempts to present the current state of knowledge about the prehistory and orgins of all of the peoples of the entire world on the basis of the combined fields of genetics and linguistics -- all in a mere 200 pages.Unfortunately, due to the vastness of this topic I found the quality of information on each point to be quite superficial and unsatisfying for my needs. For example, about the Japanese he merely states that the genetics and linguistics indicate that the modern Japanese are believed to be the product of the combination of the original Jomon people represented by today's Ainu and Okinawans, and the later Yayoi people who crossed over from Korea. And on the Hungarians, he merely says that research reflects their origins in Asia. Well, anyone with even the most basic of knowledge about the early history of these peoples already KNOWS this information and it is hardly anything new. I would be more interested in learning for example whether the genetic results on the Hungarians indicate any sort of genetic input from neighbouring non-Finno-Ugrians, etc. But none of this sort of detail is ever provided.As I read this book over the Christmas vacation, I found myself likening the experience to eating a piece of traditional Christmas fruitcake. In one paragraph, Cavalli-Sforza might begin talking about a topic of particular interest to me that I found particularly \\"delicious\\", and I would say \\"mmm\\" in anticipation. But I was then disappointed to find that by the next paragraph (or \\"mouthful\\" of information, to continue the Christmas cake analogy), he had already rushed onto another unrelated topic of a different flavour. On the whole, I found the book to be quite uneven (--or should I say \\"lumpy\\"?).This book basically condenses the information contained in Cavalli-Sforza's classic 1994 work \\"The History and Geography of Human Genes\\", and mixes it with a dose of basic linguistics. The only new information is data on the genetics of the populations of the Caucasus region, which was previously unavailable. For me, the most useful part of the book has turned out to be its up-to-date bibliography which will directly me to the more detailed information I seek, much of it hidden away in obscure journal articles.If you are brand new to the area of origins of peoples, this book is probably just right for you. But if you have any knowledge about prehistory or linguistics you will probably find this book as unsatisfying as I have. Overall, I'd recommend spending the extra bucks and getting the original work mentioned above. This is what I will now have to do."},{"Title":"Genes, Peoples, and Languages","review":"Even though this is a slim volume it is deceptively rich in content.Although a bit jaded and written from the perspectives of the late 1980's it is still a unique and rewarding book.I am surprised that no book has been written to date including more updated / symbiotic topics.It covers some of the history of 'modern man', the title subjects and more, focusing on last 3-5,000 years before present (kYrs bp). We currently only know selective fragmented sections of modern man's history (&lt; 3%).Defragmentation:Although two of the specialism, linguistics and genetics, are united there are still a lot more topic areas to unite in order to provide a fuller map to ancient prehistory, namely climate habitats over time, domesticated animals (their migration & diseases), crops, ancient astronomical/calendar knowledge analysis, seafaring, folklore and cave art.Maybe then, we will be in a position to use more than conjecture to fill the gaps by using under-utilised or ignored artefacts to see the overlays of the various subject areas thro' time.Short Comings:I enjoyed his use of PCA, however this should be moved to the appendices to minimise the disruption to the flow.Although it is well known that climate is the principal force on evolution, effecting the pulses and rhythms of crops/migrations there is no review of the climates over the period in question.Thus snapshots thro' time showing different habitat zones, groupings ( for hunters, grazers/nomads and agriculturists) and impact on cultures would be of great use.The analysis of agriculture and Mesolithic/pastoral nomads is scattered and fragmented over the pages.Unsettlingly maps of Eurasia were provided showing the migrations and influence over time there was no such map provided for Africa and Oceania/Australia.The author refers to Neanderthals and states that there was no interbreeding with modern man ? No mention is made of Java man in terms of the significance of this region, nor little reference to the, South Asian and Australian Aborigines.The author accepts that the Australian Aborigines sailed there approx 50-60kyrs bp. Tie this into the fact that the most interesting human explorers, the Polynesian , explored and traded from Madagascar, off the coast of Africa, in the West to Rapa Nui ('Easter' Island) in the East, only 2,000 from Chile. There is no analysis of their influence in Latin America. With the Humboldt current from Peru & Chile would have brought this island within a week or two sailing.Witness the Palaeolithic rock art and Aborigine remains found by Dr. Walter Neves (Univ. of Sao Paulo) and Marcello Caosta Souza in Brazil and Tierra del Fuego-Chile, see also 'Man Across the Sea' (Univ. of Texas ) by Riley, Kelley, Pennington.Only one and a bit paragraphs are focused to the Dravidians of South India, recognised as having one of the oldest linguistic branches (older than the Eurasiatic languages at least).Is it because of our Westerncentric bias, we can only see a cave-man culture in Eurasia, in Late Palaeolithic, and can't seem to enter into our 'Neanderthal' like skulls, that there were other distinctive and hospitable / tropical climates elsewhere, (e.g. Oceania, India, Middle East, Australia, etc), during the ice-age ?I was disappointed in the blind adoption of current dogma as the earliest migrations of the modern humans into the Americas via the Bering straight ? Similarly the author contends that agriculture only came about in the last 10 ky bp (page 160).To 'nit pick' further, the book refers the family structure favoured by the Celts in France as 'patriarchal', however anybody who is familiar with Celtic society would recognise that women ARE accepted as 'chief of the household' and one only has to look to female chieftain warriors such as Queen Bodica, who fought the authors compatriots in Roman times, to answer that view.Unanswered Questions:-Little or no mention was made to the hypothesis that mankind migrated on coastal routes, with it's adequate supply of food, similar habitats and fresh water supplied by river sources. Only later was the interior explored, along river routes. This provided food, water and transport mechanism, hence navigation, even to cross rivers, was an early not later skill as indicated in the book.Were there distinct patterns to distinguish hunter-gathers, nomadic herders and farmers. Such that hunter gathers were early domesticators of dogs, while nomadic herders adopted horses and farmers held pigs ?Very interestingly he indicated strongly that the Basques/Euskera were related to early Cro-Magnion Europeans and possibly related to the Hunza people speaking Burushaski language in Pakistan, this was all too brief and sketchy.Conflicting Images:I found the section the Turkish colonisation of Byzantium very interesting. What struck me was the statement that there was little genetic trace of the original conquerors, all that really changed was the 'software' (language, culture and religion).It is a young science, but it struck me how this might effect the human discourse in the trouble spots of our 'intelligent' speciesLounes Chikhi, (UCL UK), and colleagues, are looking for markers/tracers by analysing Y mutations, Unique Event Polymorphism's (UEPs).Future Research:-Can we find out a bit more information on earlier and later population contacts for the Basques, Indian Dravidians, PNG, the Guanche of Canary islands and Negritos/Aborigines of Asia.More linguistic research work of the type carried out by Joseph Greenberg on the Papua New Guneans, Aborigines of Oceania-Australia-SE Asia, and of course the Dravidians.Research into the flow of domesticated animals, such as pigs, dogs, goats, horses etc or fruit, rice, cereals, sugar cane and sweat potatoes needs to be carried out. Witness techniques such as RAPYD (Randomly Polymorphised DNA) and plant finger-printing being carried out by Dr. Paul Keim, USA.There was an all too brief section on Cultural Transmissions/Imprinting.

The capacity of Cavalli-Sforza of translating into popular science the work that he has accumulated in years of world-class research is admirable.The book features a re-adapted collection of lessons he held in Paris. It is perfectbly suitable for anyone from the layman to the scientist. In order to make the tractation more fluid, notes with more specific details are found in an appendix. The book summarizes the most important steps in the development of Cavalli-Sforza's scientific quest and projects into areas of interest for which he is less famous, namely glottology.This book is a must read for anyone interested in etnology, antropology, glottology and genetics. It is not too long and can be considered the first inspiration to continue reading on the subject. At times Prof. Cavalli-Sforza's personal comments on the social and political aspects of research on science are expressed, and maybe sometimes they result out of place. Another limit of the book is that, being so short, some topics are just mentioned, and not enough information is given. This may be upsetting, but then again, it is another reason for reading more on the subject.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in tracking the history of humanity through the differentiation of the genoma, learning about the different families of languages spoken on our planet and searching for accounts of practical achievements of population genetics."},{"Title":"Genes, Peoples, and Languages","review":"It really stuck to me these 2:- the description of the concept of race, in his view the concept of race is obsolete and it just does not have any valuable meaning, and he explains you why in the first few chapters.- the ability by DNA study to generate a migration map (like the one detailed about Europe), just amazing how it matches maps drawn by archeologists or linguistic studies.Overall a very good look at what has been done on genetics study on people."},{"Title":"Genes, Peoples, and Languages","review":"It seems that Sforza makes the presumption that most readers of this book will have read his earlier works. Perhaps he is justified in deciding thusly. The book, however, comes off as being a overture to the politically-correct in the first half of it and a piece of patchwork for his previous works in the second half. Granted, there have been great advances in the fields of genetics and mollecular archaeology since last he wrote a book marketed toward the layman and patchwork might be necessary.Sforza, as an elder-statesman in the field of genetics, is entitled to a bit more slack than others. This book, however, does not read as well as his previous works or even as well as the various books by newer authors who have disputed him on such topics as the mannerof the introduction of agriculture to Europe or the nature of race.Taken as a whole, Genes, Peoples and Languages strikes me as being half sermon and half footnote to a brilliant career. The footnote section is certainly worth reading, but only for those who have read at least one or two of his previous works."},{"Title":"Genes, Peoples, and Languages","review":"In this book you will find the first attempts to correlate the findings in genetics and glottology to explain human migrations and the actual mix of people found around the globe. The book is aimed at the general reader, so the book covers a wide scope of topics, but lacks detailed basic explanations that would be essential to the lay reader. Its three main topics, at least according to the book's title, are not well balanced: genes occupy 2/3 of the book. It seems that by including a small section on languages, Dr. Cavalli-Sforza just tried to find additional external support to confirm his migration theories, without devoting serious studies to it...Although he used a lot of examples of J.P. Mallory's workIn Search of the Indo-Europeans: Language, Archaeology, and Myth, he did not consider Archeological evidence to support his findings, which would have probably been very useful, since as opposed to languages, archaeological evidence can be tracked to the specific places where it was found and it can be dated more or less accurately, without needing to estimate or take into consideration the speed of change of a language (or of a gene). For more readThe Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry.In my opinion, the same mathematical methodology used for extracting the basic genetic components of the population should have been used to extract the basic language components of the population. This was not the case, since the author did not analyze the linguistic components himself, but rather based his maps and trees on Bengtson and Ruhlen's linguistic maps. I also would have liked that the two maps - the genetic and the linguistic ones - were somehow superimposed (maybe using transparent slides for each of them put over a purely geographic map) in order to better appreciate what the author claims. Chapter 5 \\"Languages and genes\\" had no notes or bibliographic references (maybe it was a printing mistake of my Spanish edition, but I do not think so, since there is also no reference to notes inside the main text of the chapter); being the area where the author borrowed most from other scientists, since he is no linguist, I found it somewhat strange.I am sure the spread of languages differs importantly from the genetic spread, since the reasons for adopting one language or another are very varied. Even status has an influence on the language choice (How Language Works), whereas our genetic configuration is not a free choice (ok, you can more or less choose your partner - not always true in the past and certainly not in every culture - but social hierarchies, customs, mobility and even availability of partners can limit or affect this choice even today). The last chapter on cultural transmission and evolution (language being part of it) also explains fundamental reasons why languages and genes not necessarily overlap, since cultural transmission can occur not only on a one to one basis and not only from one generation to the next, but also on a one to many basis and between members of the same generation or even from a given generation to the previous one.Definitely his area of expertise is genetics and it is here where he gives the best explanations. What I liked most was the explanation of genetic polymorphism and genetic drift, as well as how it can have a great impact in small populations. I liked his definition of natural selection as \\"survival of the luckiest\\" and his calculation of the genetic components of the population is very interesting."},{"Title":"Genes, Peoples, and Languages","review":"Genes, Peoples, and Languages is an excellent introduction to the study of how the human species has evolved and spread out of Africa.

It is reasonably clear now that the vicious attack on Burt was politically motivated. Provided that very substantial inheritance of IQ is now beyond technical dispute, author's undocumented blatant denial is of not much worth.

And the topic is interesting. However, this book is poorly written:1) Translation is generally sloppy. The English text is often funny, e.g. not sure which nouns a dangling clause actually refer to in running sentences. Either the original text is sloppy, or the translation is, or both.2) Lack of information. Not a lot of actual scientific info is presented. E.g. Maps for principal component analysis for Asia genes would be of interest I think3) Big gaps in the whole picture: the origins of both Chinese and Indians are poorly explained. It might reflect low level of scientific research in those countries; but from the writing itself, it seems the author does not really care about these people which account for ~45% of the world's population; at the same time, the author keeps pointing out that the Basques are unique.4) Putting my Chinese head on here:The language family that includes Na-Dene (in N. America), Caucasian (mainly Georgian), and Sino-Tibetan languages is called the 'Dene-Caucasian' family. I just can't help wondering how the scientific community name things. How can the Chinese language, with at least 800MM native speakers, not part of the name of the language family? It is probably not the author's fault, but as a founding scientist in the inquiry of human origins from genetic &amp; linguistic point of view, the author has some responsibity for the bias I think.5) Is the scientific evidence robust? In the early section on genetic mapping, each of the dots showing 'races' such as 'Basques', 'South Chinese', 'Dravidians', etc. are defined using considerations in 'location and languages' of the human samples. Makes me wonder whether the whole correlation between races and languages is just a convoluted tautology.6) Lack of &quot;so what&quot;. The book has no thesis.

I got this book hoping to see some &quot;good science&quot; convincing me how effective and safe vaccines are. All I got were pat answers from medical establishments akin to opinion. If you are a concerned parent who wants to make up your own mind after examining empirical, scientific evidence, you won't find any here. You'll find &quot;statistics,&quot; but no details to help you determine if the conclusions of the studies cited are warranted, valid, or statistically sound. There is no basic information on sample size or control groups, let alone data on results and statistical significance. Worst yet, Humiston and Good offer very few references, so for most statistics, you cannot even look the study up yourself to get that information.For example, take the question, &quot;...how effective is [the DTaP vaccine]?&quot; The answer is: &quot;...The current pertussis vaccines are reported to be from 59 to 89 percent effective, so it's important for young children to receive the full five-dose series.&quot; This is a typical response to this type of question. No references whatsoever. Am I supposed to just take these people's word for it? I don't even know WHOSE word I am supposed to blindly accept. Then I am supposed to act on this &quot;reported&quot; information and make sure my tiny baby gets stuck five times with needles holding bacteria just because SOMEONE said it was &quot;59-89% effective&quot;? I'm sorry, I need more than this to be convinced. What if those studies showing 59-89% effectiveness were invalid--then I'd be exposing my baby to the risks of vaccinations for some unknown benefit, if any at all.Let me explain why details are important. A study done in England in the 1940's found that pertussis occurred in 18% of vaccinated children (88% effectiveness), and 87% in unvaccinated children. These numbers appear to be impressive, until you find out that the &quot;unvaccinated&quot; group received a vaccine containing Streptococcus pneumoniae among other agents as a control. These bacterial agents in the control vaccine could have interfered with immunity to pertussis, thus confounding the entire study. The fact that the study was conducted poorly renders the &quot;statistics&quot; scientifically meaningless. [Reference: Scheibner, Viera. Vaccination: 100 Years of Orthodox Research, New Atlantean Press, 1993. P. 16] It is interesting to note that Humiston and Good spared no pains to explain confounding variables when discussing studies that questioned vaccine safety.This book offers some easy to understand descriptions of diseases and general information in an accessible Q&amp;A format. To the authors' credit, they included case histories of vaccine damage as well as of diseases in question. Beyond this, most of the answers and &quot;statistics&quot; are practically useless for discerning vaccine effectiveness and safety, unless in you have a lot of blind faith in these authors.

They glossed over real concerns about vaccines, when they might have taken the opportunity to confront and dispel them head-on. (Unfortunately, the more I research, the more I seem to find this to be the case. Those who support mandatory vaccination cannot categorically refute the arguments of those who question it.)The one positive about the book is that it does give a good overview of each vaccine and the disease it's intended to prevent, as well important info on special cases.

Christopher Herold in a objective manner analyzes and writes about the Napoleon who went to the conquest of Egypt. He had a most peculiar way of explaining the events of this campaign while throwing here and there humorous comments, for example, when he writes about a \\"the gentleman with the unforgettable name\\".His approach to the analysis of the campaign is deep, for instance, the events involving the massacre of the prisoners of Jaffa, in other biographies of Napoleon, that I own, in two of them the authors do not mention it, and the other one justifies it. But J. Christopher Herold in his objective research, clearly demonstrates that it was a war crime, he talks about other points of view of the event, done by pro-Napoleonic and anti-Napoleonic authors and he analyses Napoleon's choices and the the execution of the thousands of prisoners by bayoneting and drowning was not the only and most humane solution. (There is another previous event involving the execution of 450 prostitutes).Follow Napoleon from Toulon to Malta, Abukir, Alexandria, Cairo, Syria, etc. this book includes tons of information, and the book is not centered around Napoleon, you'll read about other players in this campaign, like Monge, Berthollet, Cont&eacute;, Desaix, you'll read even letters written by grenadiers, and learn about Middle East history: The Porte, The Mamelukes, about Murad Bey, etc. Originally published in 1962, this book is a worthy addition to the library of any scholar or \\"armchair general\\" interested in Napoleon Bonaparte."},{"Title":"Bonaparte in Egypt","review":"J. Christopher Herold is, unfortunately, a very shallow scholar, more interested in promoting his British pride over England's defeat of Napoleon, rather than objectively presenting credible scholarship. Beyond the simple historical facts which he gives, he fails utterly in any form of intellectual analysis of the various subjects which this work SHOULD be comprised. The fact that Herold is not a professor, but is one of those uniquely English self-motivated historians, at the same time knowledgeable and eccentric, should be a clue that you are not reading an objective monograph or dissertation. For the military historian, and the Nelson buff, this book could be a grand starting point for further study into this important, yet little understood, bit of French and Napoleonic history. What is most perplexing in the author's amateurish approach to his subject is his apparent hatred of both the French, as well as the Egyptians. By the end, I was wondering why he even chose the subject, considering he tripped over his own bigotry at all turns.This is not the kind of nationalistic historiography of the 19th and early 20th centuries, where the British academicians, in spite of their jingoism, could still deliver well executed, and deeply deconstructive works of important scholarship. This book, I'm afraid, was written with Johnny Bulldog Brit in mind, and not the scholar of French Napoleonic history. True, the author describes in fair detail the Nelson \\"victory\\" at Abukir Bay, and the so-called Battle of The Pyramids, with enough detail to whet the military buff's appetite, but the starting point and end-point for all descriptions is the great Lord Nelson, further hagiofied here. Regardless of the nuances of a battle's outcome, or the specious claims to victory over the French, Herold seems content to wallow in ancient British propaganda rather than to see the true outcome of the various engagements. The French didn't lose quite so badly as he portrays it, nor did the British win so decisively.While one can rightly state that Egypt was where Napoleon practiced and honed his methods of empire building, and the Cesarian propaganda required to return to France and assume ultimate power, the author only barely touches on this important feature of the Grand Army's experiences in Egypt. He adopts a rather snide tone in describing the People's army, and the quite amazing accomplishments, even in failure, of Napoleon, the army, and the savants in the Mid East. All descriptions of the French, Napoleon and his generals, and the Turks, Egyptians and Muslims in general, are offered from the victorious British point-of-view. This is frustratingly shoddy scholarship, and this work shouldn't even be on your reading list, considering the marked improvement in modern historiography over the last half century.I'll offer some embarrassing examples of Herold's poor scholasticism:Herold continuously describes Napoleon's edicts and memos to his officers as \\"peevishness\\" and as constant lies. If Napoleon were such a disingenuous general, then why did his men and most officers continue to revere him even in defeat and abandonment? When Napoleon speaks to his generals, it is all a bunch of \\"twaddle\\", from Herold's point of view. I'm not sure what the correct academic definition of \\"twaddle\\" is, but it is decidedly a British term.When he attempts to portray Egyptian street scenes, he compares old Egypt with the experiences a modern (1960's) visitor to Cairo might have as they stumble off the tour bus: In a completely subjective manner he describes a city full of noise, dirt, and the general untrustworthiness of the populace. He unnecessarily portrays \\"old women going furtively about their business..\\"Like a common non-doctoral military historian he has fine words for the French officers who died gloriously taking a broadside from the Noble and Transcendent Nelson, and these are the only chaps about whom he has good things to say. I kept asking myself as I read about this fascinating moment in history why the author even chose to write about the French and Egypt if he despised both so much.Herold takes great delight in describing the supposedly deviant sexual appetites of the Turks and the egyptian Mamelukes. He has Napoleon criticizing French soldiers for getting captured, gang raped by their captors, then daring to cry about it. The author invariably points out, as if it were common knowledge, and needed no substantiating evidence, that Muslims rape men in combat, keep boys in their harems, and that many of the French war injuries were of a violent sexual nature. While this may in fact be sort of historically accurate, the author offers no credible proof beyond the shocked first hand letters of French troops who heard about such things. He even goes so far as to mock the French people in general as hypocrites, because supposedly most French men are gay in the modern age, and engage joyfully in homosexuality. He even postulates in one of his few attempts at cultural analysis that the French became partly homosexual as a result of the experiences in the middle East. Could anything be more amateurish, and disgusting for an historian to go on and on (I'm serious) about, regardless of personal views on the subject?In all fairness, Herold does give the details relevant to this campaign from a military historian's point of view. He describes Napoleon's barbaric massacre of prisoners at Jaffa, much to the eternal shame of the French nation; he even writes this, in analysis, which I quote in an impossible attempt to redeem the author:\\"One cannot help asking, what transforms a group of fundamentally good-natured people---kind husbands, dutiful sons, sentimental lovers, and fathers of families---into ferocious, screaming beasts? The question...has not been investigated scientifically.\\" (As of 1962?) The answer, of course, is War, and nothing else. That a writer I have come to despise, because of this work, reveals a level of humanity not particularly common to the military historian, by writing these words, may be the only redeeming sentiment of this book.His comparison of Napoleon's war crimes to those perpetuated in the 1950's and 1960's in North Africa and Indo-China indicate that Herold was seeking a modern relevance for his scholarship.Unfortunately, this real contribution to the field is wrapped up in British nationalist hyperbole, much to the ultimate detriment of any understanding of the subject. I recommend a different choice if you wish to study Napoleon in the Mid East. Considering the many recent contributions to the field, a thoughtful scholar shouldn't have to wallow through this piece of drivel."},{"Title":"Bonaparte in Egypt","review":"A correction needs to made to another customer's review. Herold was NOT British; he was American. Moreover, the book is NOT Anglocentric (that, I suspect, is more a hobby horse of that particular customer). And the book does NOT fail to commend the French, the Egyptians -- anyone -- when they deserve it. Herold was manifestly a humanist.

Life has dealt harsh lessons to them all, especially the middle sister, Pepper.Just eight years old when she was torn from her home and family, Pepper became a ward of the system, moving from one foster family to another, each experience adding a layer of resolve and determination to never trust anyone other than herself.

There were details left out and it could have been put together more. I espically think that the end needed more, I wanted there to be more. Really bad. But I still liked it. It had my heart pounding and I couldnt put it down. Pepper does have a REALLY BIG chip on her shoulder, but she is not totally unlikeable. Just when she goes off on her tangents. Maybe the military stuff is a little far fetched, but for all we know, it could be more advanced then even that. I dont think anyone really knows what weapons our Special Forces units have, till after they have used them and gotten new ones. Does not seem like something that would be out there for everyone to read up on all the facts. Ya know? It is the top, most dangerous, advanced and all that of the Army. Even if it is a little made up, that is what we all read for right? A story. A fictional story. Some elements did match up really well and you could identify with them and their feelings at times. I will read the rest of the books in the series and even check out some of her historicals. This was a gripping story and I loved the effect it had on me. Oh, Dan does use the term \\"mating\\" more then necessary in my opinion. Like he was a stalion and she a mare. Odd, really.

I liked \\"Just the Way You Are\\" a lot and couldn't wait to read the next one in the series. While I usually read a book every two days, this one took two WEEKS, and that was with trying to skip past the pages and pages and pages of overdone sexual fantasies (and finally experiences). Way too much sex; it got to be sickening. Had a hard time forcing myself to pick up the book.Unlike some of the reviews I've read, I did like the plot (for the most part), but it took too long to unfold... WAY too long.

One thing is for sure, he wants to start over.OK-let me be clear on one point, I do NOT like \\"getting back together\\" stories. Ever.That said, Dodd rocks! She writes with such style how can you not love her? She is one of the few writers who can write sarcasm that carries through in a story. While this is likely NOT her best story, it is so much fun.

Her ignorance would be kinda funny if the opinions of equally uninformed readers weren't being influenced by her plot points. A few howlers: First, General Officers are not allowed to promote their autobiographies until AFTER they retire. Second, Aides de Camp do not serve for five years (they'd go insane...). Third, Lieutenants refer to Colonels as &quot;Sir&quot;. Always.It seems as if Ms Dodd attempted to throw together a book using the Global War On Terrorism to incite sales. Perhaps it will, but the lame prose and rail thin story line will probably turn anyone off before the bad guys are caught and corralled and the last kiss is smooched.My suggestion, Ms Dodd: Go back to what you know - fun, frothy, period romanced (just not THIS period!)- and lay off any involvement with the modern US military, current international relations, and the national intelligence community - not to mention counter-insurgency operations and the GWOT. You're out of your league."},{"Title":"Almost Like Being in Love (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 2)","review":"No one--I repeat no one!--writes better heroines than Ms. Dodd.

The oldest sixteen years old Hope always hoped she would one day bring them back together, but over a decade later has failed. Eight years old when her parents died, Pepper spent years rotating through the foster child system until elderly Idaho rancher Mrs. Dreiss took her in.Pepper has become Jackie Porter, successful landscaper using the motivating words of General Jennifer Napier to be all that she can be. At a book signing, Jackie meets her heroine, but when she returns to get a book signed for Mr. Dreiss, she sees the General kill her aide Major Otto Bjerke. Jennifer realizes a witness saw her commit murder, but Jackie escapes.Jackie is dead and Pepper is reborn as she flees to Mrs. Dreiss' ranch only to learn that her guardian angel died; neighbor Dan Graham has cared for the spread that she has inherited. Though Pepper wants Dan to leave her alone, they fall in love. Jennifer is coming, but so is Hope as both have found Pepper, but who will get to her first.This engaging romantic suspense will hook readers from the moment Jackie flees for her life. Pepper and Dan are a fabulous pair and the return of Hope and her now husband Zack is terrific. Readers will wonder why Pepper failed to know that Mrs. Dreiss died and also question why the general is selling top secret info without being caught (kept secret for most of the book).

I was terrified for her.It's one of those books that make you wish you had a more exciting life, and glad that you don't at the same time. It's enough to make me quit reading historicals, because you never get this kind of excitement in historicals.This is a GREAT BOOK!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Almost Like Being in Love (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 2)","review":"Orphaned at age 8, Pepper Prescott had a troubled youth, bouncing around the system and acting out a bit before she eventually pulled her life together to become a successful landscaper in Washington, DC. Her newly ordered life comes to a grinding halt when she witnesses a crime perpetrated by the military self-help author she idolizes. The one bright spot in her checkered past was the high school year she spent on a ranch in Idaho with a foster mother who genuinely loved her, so when she is accused of committing the crime she witnessed, it's the first place she runs to.Enter Dan Graham, Pepper's first and only love, who was devastated when she ran away from home all those years ago. The son of the owner of the neighboring ranch, Dan felt he needed to leave town after Pepper ran away so he joined the &quot;army&quot;. Several years later he returns home, apparently retired from the &quot;special forces&quot;, after being seriously injured while fighting &quot;terrorists&quot;. He's been looking after the ranch of Pepper's foster mother who has recently died.We see a touching romance between Pepper and Dan. Normally reunion stories leave me slightly irritated that the protagonists didn't just work out their issues at the time that they split, but things are handled so well here that I really believe these two needed the intervening years to bring them to this point where they could be together. Dan has never gotten over Pepper, and almost from the moment he sees her again, he wants to be with her forever. His attempts to lure her to his way of thinking are steamy and meaningful at the same time. I adore this love story.Things would probably be all right if that was all there was to &quot;Almost Like Being in Love&quot;. I like both Pepper and Dan. The problem is that there's a convoluted plot about Dan actually still being active in the army and working with a superior to capture the terrorist he's after. Also, throwing plausibility completely out the window, the crime Pepper witnessed in Washington, DC is in fact connected to the terrorists who are seeking Dan in Idaho. It's just ridiculous. It's distracting. I'm almost angry about it. This could have been a wonderful story. The human side is so well done, the characters are so likeable and have such excellent chemistry--why this crazy plot that detracts from the emotional story?There's so much inaccuracy here that I don't really know where to begin. Though Dan is referred to as &quot;special forces&quot; in the &quot;army&quot;, the way his relationship to the terrorists is described would mean he actually would have been involved in the intelligence community. In &quot;Almost Like Being in Love&quot;, the &quot;army&quot; is actually running battle operations within the United States, which is silly, as everyone knows their jurisdiction is only OUTSIDE of our borders--we have internal law enforcement, both local and federal to handle domestic matters--never would anyone in the &quot;army&quot; be authorized to do something like this within the US, and I'm inclined to think that a situation like this if it were outside the US would actually be handled by the CIA not the army. Dan is a lieutenant, but we're never told that he went to school to become an officer and I'm almost afraid the author doesn't know the difference between enlisted men and officers. Another reviewer covered the inter-military inaccuracies, read that review for more information regarding those issues. Also, there seems to be such an effort to remain politically correct and offend no racial, religious, or national group that we don't even know who these terrorists are or what they represent, which is irritating. It's like having a villain in a story and not knowing anything about their motivations or ambitions, only that they're &quot;bad&quot;--it's almost cartoonish. And last but not least, completely contrary to everything that we know about both characters, Dan and Pepper are deliberately drawing &quot;bad&quot; people to their idyllic little Idaho paradise with apparently no thought to the friends, neighbors, and family members who could be threatened by the presence of international terrorists bent on violence. Dan's father actually lives next door to the ranch where Dan has set up his terrorist ambush, but Dan never considers what could happen if the terrorists (who surely are capable of it) hurt his father to get to him.Really, I'm torn about giving this story three stars. On one hand, the romance between these two great characters deserves to be recognized for how wonderful it is; on the other hand, the laughable terrorist plot deserves a zero. I'm a big Christina Dodd fan, I enjoy her historicals very much and I liked the contemporary prequel to this book, &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot;. In the end, I'd say I liked this book more than I disliked it, but I have a hard time recommending it to anyone. If you're a Dodd fan, I'd say check it out and like me you'll probably revel in the romance and try to overlook the other problems. If you've never read Christina Dodd, though, I'd steer you toward &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot; if you want a contemporary or if you want historical romance try &quot;A Well Favored Gentleman&quot; or &quot;Rules of Surrender&quot;."},{"Title":"Almost Like Being in Love (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 2)","review":"What a fun and charming book!

Orphaned, and torn from her family at the age of eight, she had been parceled out and lived in various foster homes, none for very long as her rebelliousness caused her to be tossed around quite often. Only once, - the final foster home in Diamond Idaho, where she had stayed the longest did she feel some sense of belonging, but even from there she ran. The years in between, after reading an inspiring memoir of a woman's accomplishments, she turned her life around and started a thriving landscape business. Discovering and witnessing her hero, General Jennifer Napier, killing her aide after he accused her of furnishing government secrets to terrorists, Pepper who had been living under an assumed name herself, knew she had to run for her life because who would believe her word over that of a General. Running to the last place that had felt like a home to her, Pepper discovered that her long lost lover Dan Graham, had taken up residence and was now keeping up the ranch. Not only was Dan there, but her foster mother had died and left the ranch to her. Years before, Dan was the reason she had left, and the years in between hadn't lessened the attraction they both still felt, but trust was another matter entirely.In this sequel, Dodd turns up the heat in some very passionate and exciting sensual laden encounters. Brisk writing, page turning action, and hot and steamy sex had all the makings of this being a stellar read, but for the fact that I was totally aggravated with our heroine and hero - especially Pepper. After all, after having this amazingly sensual connection with a he-man type gorgeous soldier, she couldn't TRUST him to tell the truth, to share her burdens that someone (an Army General) was trying to kill her? And her reasons for running away from him in the first place - didn't cut it. Granted he had his secrets too, but she was just too prickly to warm up to. I did like the action, the covert gadgets and thrill of terrorists attack. Unfortunately, even the hero turned into too much of a cave-man with the \`you belong to me - we're mated' statement! Ugh, I cringe! But sensibilities aside, when an author can arouse readers emotions with a characters' distasteful personality - then you do have to appreciate the writing talent and Ms. Dodd is certainly that, a writer with enormous talent.

I can't remember why for that one. I didn't like Hope, I think. I didn't finish this one either. I skipped around. Hoping it would get better. It didn't.

Why he loved her, I'll never know.On top of that, it's hard to believe that she ran away after her first sexual encounter. And that she's still mad at Dan Graham for some reason. In fact, she stays mad at just about everybody and everything. The romance part wasn't very believable. Nor or we told why she kept travelling under an assumed name for so many years.

But, it didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. For me, it was too far-fetched that both sets of villains got together and stormed the ranch. The whole plot is far too over-done.I guess there are 2 more books to come in this series. Brother Gabriel and baby sister Caitlin. The latter was less than a year old when the family was broken up. I am making a note to self right now to give them a pass.All in all, I think Ms. Dodd should stick to her historicals. She does so well there where not many do."},{"Title":"Almost Like Being in Love (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 2)","review":"This book went a little over the top for me. The sexual tension between Pepper and Dan went a little too far to be believable. Can she really be this tough independent woman who built her own life on her own and then melt into a puddle of complicity whenever Dan crooks his little finger? And, Dan. Supposedly sensitive, ends up throwing his he-man attitude around like piles of dung for Pepper to trip over. I don't know. The story was good. Bad guys after both of them end up working together.

It's as academic as it is entertaining, and is in English and Spanish with superb photographs. For anyone who would be a collector, this is the book, for now --- a stipulation given only because of its brevity, and until the sine quo non is published. It's important because little authentic historic talavera is on the market; and because the vast majority of what is produced in Puebla these days is a sad imitation of this artisanal tradition --- whether you buy it in Puebla or attempt to find it on the web. The reader learns the technical terms and about techniques. As the book does not relate to practical buying tips, remember that it is an exhibition book, and not intended as a collector's guide. Then, if it's a bit spare on such historical details as the difference between the Puebla and Guanajuato schools, at least it does relate to talavera's oriental origins. I give it high marks for a show book. As a longtime talavera collector, I am overjoyed with it. Go buy it at Amazon, already, because it isn't available in the stores. And nada m&aacute;s is available in English!"},{"Title":"Paul: Thessalonica and Early Christianity","review":"This book is a rich collection of a number of Karl P. Donfried's most important and most influential essays. It includes his inaugural lecture as Elizabeth A. Woodson Professor of Religion and Biblical Literature at Smith College, Northampton, Mass., where Donfried has taught since earning his Dr.theol. degree at the University of Heidelberg, where he studied with G&uuml;nther Bornkamm.This collection traces much of the shape of Donfried's scholarship over past years and brings his New Testament colleagues and other readers up to date with what he is doing now. Particularly informative is not only the landmark article, \\"Justification and Last Judgment in Paul,\\" but also another article tracing its reception both in Lutheran and other circles over twenty-five years. Those who are eager to delve into contemporary scholarship on 1 and 2 Thessalonians will be greatly informed by Donfried's highly influential article, \\"The Cults of Thessalonica and the Thessalonian Correspondence.\\" (See also Donfried and Johannes Beutler, editors, THE THESSALONIANS DEBATE [Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2000].)This book represents the best of Donfried's scholarship as an independent thinker and scholar, a distinguished Lutheran theologian, and an ecumenical leader.I am very pleased to recommend this book highly. My students are reading parts of it this semester in my class on the Pauline Epistles."},{"Title":"Paul: Thessalonica and Early Christianity","review":"Donfried presents a fascinating collection of essays, now revised and compiled in a tight sequence, dealing with questions about the first letter of Paul, 1 Thessalonians, and its followup, which might have been his second letter. I was excited as Donfried filled in the background picture of the religion and culture of Thessalonians and the Roman Empire in general, providing a well-knit backdrop from which to interpret fine details of Paul's theme of consolation to the Thessalonians, as a persecuted church. This is the best study of Thessalonians I have read in years.Information about the cult of the Emperor, which was rising at the time the Christian Good News was moving into the Roman Empire, was at its height, apparently, in Thessalonica. The term \\"lord\\" came to be applied to the Emperors as a part of the growing Emperor cult of Civil Religion. This made it hard for new believers to consistently confess Jesus Christ as the only lord, and to maintain their faith in the One Universal Invisible, but Living Creator God.Thessalonica was a city that retained certain privileges like a City-State, such as minting of its own coins. The extensive coinage of this commercial and religious centre provides insights which Donfried unravels into the nature and extent of the Cult of the Emperor. This includes insights into terms like Divine Emperor and Son of God, assigned to the Emperor and his family, apparently growing from the time of Augustus, but reaching its peak in Nero.Donfried also provides a detailed comparison of the thought of Paul in this context to the wandering Stoic preachers, the ecstatic Christian prophets, and the themes and terminology of the Essenes from the Qumran documents. He identifies certain vocabulary, and possible themes, in Paul with the Essene terminology which is not found in the Old Testament.He looks at vocabulary or phrases Paul uses in the first Thessalonian letter which he does not use in his later writings. (Donfried thinks 2 Thessalonians is not an autograph of Paul himself, but definitely written faithfully by someone within his working circle of early missionary work, perhaps Silas/Silvanus.)Donfried is competent in the Greek and Hebrew of Old Testament as well as the details of the Hebrew and Aramaic documents of Qumran. Donfried notes, as does Thiede in The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Jewish Origins of Christianity (which I also review on Amazon.com), that evidence seems to point in the direction of connections between the new sect of the Nazarenes and the Qumran teachers and document collectors.His commentary critically looks at various authors who have addressed some of these cultural and religious questions related to the Thessalonian letters, in German, as well as English. He quotes from the original, then translates where helpful. Further citing footnotes some sources in French, he expects his readers to be conversant with the biblical and contemporary languages of scholarship.Donfried provides a thoughtful and serious analysis of the doctrines of Justification and Salvation in Paul, focusing on the passages in Thessalonians, supplemented by other references to Corinthians and Romans. He emphasizes here the broader context of Paul's concept of the Word of God (initially proclaimed in the Gospel) and the prophetic words of comfort, in a \\"word of the Lord\\" to the Thessalonians through this letter in their persecution by the pagan populace.He points out that Paul's emphasis uses the term Justification where I have observed that it is popularly common today to use the term \\"saved\\" for conversion. It seems Paul uses the term \\"saved\\" only in the continuous and future tenses. Paul does not commonly use the term \\"saved\\" for the event of initial conversion, but for the concept of living and enduring in Christ, and culminating in the \\"final hope\\" in the return of Christ.This is also a basis for understanding the strong statements and warnings Paul repeatedly makes, not only in 1 Thessalonians, about the importance of personal vigilance and endurance in faith. This endurance is not based on one's good works, but on the remaining in faith, in Christ, in the hope that will be finally realized only in the apocalyptic deliverance and judgement. A future deliverance into the fullness of the Kingdom of God.I was struck by how novel this is in light of the classical analytical view of Paul's theology as a systematic scheme on the late medieval model of philosophical reflection. Donfried brings to life the apostolic prophetic sense of urgency of the preacher and pastor, Paul, in his real-world working context in the pagan Roman Empire. The author probes the depths of Paul's doctrine of election, which is rarely mentioned in comments of Thessalonians. He relates this to faith, hope, endurance and faithfulness of confession under persecution, which was the situation for the Thessalonian church.Oh, and another theme and usage Donfried reviews is the usage of the common word \\"ekklesia\\" for the assembly of Christians in Jerusalem and the similar assemblies of Christian in Achaia. He finds here another fascinating similarity with the Qumran usages. This is a worthwhile read for students of the New Testament, classical culture and religions, history or early Middle Eastern thought."},{"Title":"Paul: Thessalonica and Early Christianity","review":"This is an outstanding volume, rich in first-class scholarship and ecumenical sensitivity of the highest order. Donfried is at the cutting edge of New Testament scholarship and has a profound understanding of the impact of the Dead Sea Scrolls on early Christianity.

He glorifies the use of Jewish gangsters to beat up Nazi sympathizers in Newark during the 1930s. He also defends a wide range of government actions which denied these Nazi sympathizers their First Amendment rights.It would be one thing if the Jewish gangsters were defending the Jewish community in Newark from Nazi abuse and harassment, but the author provides no evidence of this. Rather the Jewish gangsters, who called themselves the Minutemen, went out of their way to attack Nazi meetings and beat up the participants. I guess you could call these attacks pre-emptive, but Grover fails to show that the Jewish community was in danger of immanent attack. The author seems to believe that the mere presence of Nazis in public justified the use of violence against them. As obnoxious as Nazis were and are, that is a dangerous notion.In making these thugs into heroes, Grover ignores that they were largely immunized from the consequences of their actions. Despite their flagrant use of violence, they always escaped serious punishment. Why? Because they were under the protection of a Jewish crime boss, who fixed things with the authorities. You call that heroism?Finally these same gangsters were running protection rackets, corrupting unions and breaking strikes. And you can be sure that most of the victims of their criminal behavior were Jews. They were also used to prevent a rally in support of union organizing in Newark, lead by legendary socialist leader Norman Thomas, who, of course, was an enemy of anti-Semitism.That Grover has no problem with this, as long as the Minutemen were beating up Nazis too, shows misplaced loyalties.Still, it is an interesting book and a good read."},{"Title":"Nazis in Newark","review":"This is my uncle's biography, but it is also a very important part of American History that few, if any people, are aware of.

Jesus spoke in parables; the Talmud and Hebrew scriptures demonstrate God's presence in stories; many cultures have found power in the recitation of key stories. However, some stories have been ignored and overlooked. One of the projects of the modern and postmodern world has been the recovery of voices and stories from those that were silenced and lost in the past.Mercy Amba Oduyoye, a native of Ghana and theologian of worldwide acclaim, has drawn together stories that highlight the issues of women in Africa both in cultural and religious terms. Mercy Amba Oduyoye describes herself as having come from the Akan people, who were matrilineal and had many stories of women in leadership positions, both economically and prophetically. This was different from the Yoruba and British-influenced areas of Nigeria, where women were very much subject to their husbands or other male-dominated structures. 'In Africa, the very idea of a \\"free woman\\" conjures up negative images,' Mercy Amba Oduyoye writes. 'A \\"free woman\\" spells disaster.'Oduyoye take on the challenge of presenting a liberation theology in careful terms in three overarching narrative cycles. These look at the issues of language, culture and identity respectively. She weaves into these cycles folktales, mythological stories, and more current stories to illustrate the importance of the humanity of women in these times and places. 'The stories are aimed at demonstrating that, by and large, the Akan woman is not so much an active participant in her own suppression as a passive victim of the culture whose life-giving aspects she seeks to protect.' This leads not only to an exploration of the culture and the ways in which society draws gender and identity roles into play, but also to the third cycle of stories - what should women become? What are their dreams, hopes, and true abilities?Oduyoye draws in her own experience as a woman of the culture and a woman who has had broader experiences than most of her community to tap into the resources from outside that can cause deeper reflection into her own circumstances. Life is lived in community, and there is need for justice in this role. While some argue that male and female are complementary in many respects, it is in some ways a false dichotomy. 'In practice, complementarity allows the man to choose what he wants to be and to do and then demands that the woman fill in the blanks.'Oduyoye begins and ends with stories, and lets the powerful stories fill the journey with insight."},{"Title":"Daughters of Anowa: African Women and Patriarchy","review":"I read the 2005 edition of the 1995 book. Written from a Christian perspective by an Asante (Ghana) raised author, she will not remain uncritical of the Western and African Churches. Mercy Amba Oduyoye also lived among the Yoruba of Nigeria and uses Jamaican proverbs. Anowa is a mythical woman, prophet, and priest whose life of daring, suffering, and determination is reflected in Africa. Oduyoye transforms her into Africa's ancestress.Language, culture and the vision of identity are her main chapters. Specific topics include marriage and polygyny, construct and defamations of \\"witches\\", menstruation (If you overstand German, you may also be interested inDas Schwarzmond - Tabu. Die kulturelle Bedeutung des weiblichen Zyklus.and/or the unorthodoxHeliogabalus: Or, the Crowned Anarchist[English translation]).The Western - African gender confrontation is well-analyzed. And at times funny, e.g. when the Europeans wondered at some point, why in all those years they didn't find out that women were much more important to the Akan. Well, the Akan knew that the Europeans didn't value women and only let the Akan men talk to the Europeans. Which reminds me of modern Western claims with some other cultures, in reverse.The author has as much heart as she shows well analyzing capabilities. Her spirit of mind is that of solidarity. Including with all sorts of minorities which get discriminated in similar books. Which alone, but not only, makes this book a far better recommendation than those by other authors.You may also be interested inThe Invention of Women: Making an African Sense of Western Gender Discourses,Re-Inventing Africa: Matriarchy, Religion and CultureandReturn to the African Mother Principle of Male and Female Equality."},{"Title":"Things I Want Most","review":"Forget soppy movies about parents or teachers who save some poor child from the gutter or the foster home.

Professionals please read and take note to listen to the parents. Richard Minitor, thanks for writing this informative book."},{"Title":"Things I Want Most","review":"This book is the best personal account of fostering/adopting an older child that I have ever read. It is a natural for a &quot;made for TV&quot; movie, with its dramatic story, picturesque setting, and cast of &quot;characters.&quot; I laughed, I cried, I sobbed. In Miniter and his wife, we see the mixture of naivete/ignorance, denial, and audacity that goes into the decision to bring a &quot;disturbed&quot; youngster into one's family. The book also reflects the reality that formal treatment plans are limited (and sometimes unrealistic) and that &quot;real life&quot;-- honest emotions and reactions, normal expectations, natural consequences-- can be a strong motivator in turning around dysfunctional behavior. To the reader who is NOT an experienced foster/adoptive parent, I would offer a few minor cautions: 1) Miniter makes no mention of receiving any kind of training before taking the boy into his family. If that was indeed the case, that's a major flaw in the &quot;Harbor&quot; program. Prospective foster and adoptive parents of kids in the child welfare system should receive fairly extensive training in areas such as what to expect when the children come into your home, how the system (and particular agency) works, and how to manage difficult behavior. 2) Miniter would probably be one of the first to point out that this book is not a blueprint for others but is instead ONE case study, of ONE youngster, in ONE family. The Ministers' experience notwithstanding, psychotropic medication and/or psychotherapy are important-- if not essential-- components in some youngsters' healing, and respite care and parent support groups can be lifesavers for some &quot;therapeutic&quot; parents. 3) Miniter says he ignored some of the safety precautions recommended by his agency, and suggested that (hunting) guns were readily accessible in his home. Having weapons easily available in ANY home with kids (even &quot;normal&quot; children!) is foolhardy, and most agencies REQUIRE pretty sensible safety precautions."},{"Title":"Things I Want Most","review":"This story is similar to some of those Cathy Glass writes - how a foster care system can get out of touch with reality.This is a well told story about a couple who are almost completed with the job of raising their 5 children. The wife feels a calling to become a therapeutic foster parent for a child who should never have been placed into a \\"normal\\" home. The story evolves through the patient attempts this family had with the child attempting to integrate him into their loving family, and the sacrifices it took from each family member to deal with the violent behavior of this child. I especially appreciated the fact that the author didn't \\"sugar-coat\\" the responses of the family, and how, at times, they too lost control.This book will enlighten those on behaviors of what seems to be a severe head injury that ocured at the hands of his biological mother, and how dedicated some people are to helping less fortunate children receive a loving family.

I must say, I was a bit disappointed with what I found inside.His spiritual journey flushes out many perennial phenomena of awakening which may be a bit tough to swallow for some readers, but he tells his story simply and without much fanfare. This aspect of the book I found to be truly inspirational. However, a great portion of the book is devoted to the veneration and worship of one's guru. At first, this seems to be no more than loving remembrance of his own Guru, Swami Nityananda, but after a while, one cannot help but realize that Nityananda is with us no more and that this relationship now takes the form of the reader worshiping Muktananda!I want to clarify that my concern with this book is not with the actual faith. I understand that Shaktipat (receiving spiritual energy from the guru) plays a crucial roll. I guess what I'm trying to say is that unless you are a devotee of Swami Muktananda, the constant theme of guru worship gets a bit old and rather distracting after a while. I just wanted to bring this to the attention of potential buyers.This autobiography is best understood from the inside and if you have trouble getting into the ideas of the inside, the book will tend to alienate at times. Nonetheless, it is still a great insight into the man and legend behind Swami Muktananda if you can see past these concerns of mine."},{"Title":"Play of Consciousness: A Spiritual Autobiography","review":"I think any time I read about someone else's spiritual experiences, I'm looking for some insight into my own. While his are wildly different and more vivid than mine, he offers much great guidance for those on the journey. The text is rich, and I've read it three times, getting new insights out of it every time."},{"Title":"Play of Consciousness: A Spiritual Autobiography","review":"Play of Consciousness is packed with information for the spiritual seeker! One can feel Swami Muktananda's love coming from the words he has written, a must read. I like the clarity and simplicity, this book is direct and to the point.Every word is meaningful!"},{"Title":"Play of Consciousness: A Spiritual Autobiography","review":"The product was in great shape and arrived in a timely fashion, considering that I live on Kauai -- a rock in the middle of the Pacific. Play of Consciousness has a lot of first-hand information about Kundalini and the Blue Light or Blue Pearl, and while I was house-sitting a friend's house over the summer his tattered copy of it became so valuable to me that I ordered my own. I am deeply immersed in it already. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Play of Consciousness: A Spiritual Autobiography","review":"I have always loved biographies and spiritual topics. Naturally a spiritual biography of a person of spiritual importance like Swami Muktananda is the best of both worlds for me as far as my reading inclination goes. However , having said that I must emphasize that being a seeker of Truth, association with speakers of Truths such as Swami Muktananda , whether physically or via publications is something that I always try to accomplish. I guess anyone who enjoys spiritual biographies will find reading this book enjoyable and satisfying.The authors' natural ability to articulate contemplative subjects like meditation, mantra and love are beautifully maintained in this spiritual biography."},{"Title":"Play of Consciousness: A Spiritual Autobiography","review":"This is a difficult, convoluted read... but it is more fascinating to read at this point, with Muktananda having been exposed as a false guru, to better see the development of and maintenance of the guru image, and how devotion can become a cult.The inability of SYDA members to separate themselves from the unethical processes of this cult, even after Muktananda was revealed, has its root in the teachings as presented here. You can really see the motivations and methods employed from the very beginning. Truly fascinating in that respect.A true guru will never create dependence in a student. That's the best guide to tell true from false. It is however very interesting to read this autobiography with active hindsight."},{"Title":"Play of Consciousness: A Spiritual Autobiography","review":"It is difficult to put into words what is contaned within this book, many who have read it, myself included, find it more of an experince, than just a read. A subject that can often be laborious to comprehend, Muktananda weaves into a colorful, amazing, stimulating and often unbelievably true tale. I found myself mesmerized and willing to set the book down only when I was so saturated with his energy that I would pass out. A deffinate recommend and a great gift to anyone who is on a spiritual path.."},{"Title":"Play of Consciousness: A Spiritual Autobiography","review":"This book is about the experience of meditation through yoga. I read this book when I was 13 and some of the concepts were a little advanced for me at that time. Nonetheless, this book helped me to understand some experiences I had with meditation when I was young.I was raised with Siddha Yoga. Growing up, there was no place I felt safer than I did at the Siddha Yoga Ashram. For me it has been and always will be home. My spiritual journey extends beyond the confines of Siddha Yoga, but my spiritual awareness and love for God was nurtured and developed through Baba and Gurumayi's teachings, guidance, and love. I use their teachings daily.There is concern with truth or falsity of the Guru only when the seeker is looking for someone to worship rather than for a path of growth and spiritual development. I have learned a lot from people who weren't \\"Gurus\\". The word guru means to bring from darkness \\"gu\\" into light \\"ru\\". In this sense, we are surrounded by gurus all the time. All we have to do is seek them out, and they appear.It is Baba and Gurumayi who have taught me to search for the diamonds within the coals. When I am not in the right state of mind, I remember this simple teaching, and then I am surrounded by diamonds instead of black coals.In reading this book, find the diamonds and pearls in Baba's words and take them with you. Then you will feel rich and you will not be disappointed.I would also like to add that Siddha Yoga is not for everyone. The teaching of Siddha Yoga is that \\"God dwells within you as you\\". The teaching of Siddha Yoga is NOT \\"The Guru is your God\\". I have never heard Gurumayi suggest we be dependent solely on the Guru. I have on the other hand heard Gurumayi say that the Light of God dwells within us. A teacher deserves respect - whatever, or whomever that teacher may be. Yoga will reflect your state of mind, and it is not always easy or comforting to see our own reflection. But seeing is necessary for growth. Co-dependency and obsessive behaviors may surface for some, but it is not the fault of Siddha Yoga, and should be taken up with a therapist."},{"Title":"Play of Consciousness: A Spiritual Autobiography","review":"This book is divided into two \\"sub-books\\"; 'the path of the siddhas' and the 'teachings of the siddhas'. Swami Muktananda's explanation of his meditation experiences forms the core of this book.The way he reveals his different states of meditation experiences may be different from other saints who have reached the state of samadhi or bliss but I have no doubt that his experiences are authentic and he was not hallucinating. The point is that Muktanananda has already reached the highest states of consciousness or Nirvana during his meditations.The reason why I gave this book a 4 star rating and not a 5 star rating is because Muktananda had failed to give a more detailed biography of his guru. If he had included a more comprehensive account of his guru, this book would deserve a perfect rating.I would also like to recommend the \\"Autobiography of a Yogi\\" by Paramhansa Yogananda. This saint (who is also my guruji) had also attained the state of samamdhi."},{"Title":"Play of Consciousness: A Spiritual Autobiography","review":"So many of us yearn to know God, to know the Truth, to know our own Self.

Muktananda writes from both the perspectives of having been a disciple of an enlightened Master and as a Guru who has much to teach sincere aspirants on the inner path. His words carry the conviction of actual experience; this is not a theortical treatise on the ultimate meaning of life and human potential. It is rather a testament to what happens when the power of grace and the longing of a true seeker meet.

It lead me to read &quot;The One Minute Guide to Prosperity and Enlightenment&quot; by Sri Siva, a modern day Siddha Guru who now travels around the world with a similar message for the sincere spiritual aspirant. Both authors emphasize the importance of having a Guru to safely guide the person through the process of &quot;knowing&quot; God. In the world today, there are many teachers, though few who have first-hand experience of &quot;knowing&quot; God in their lives. Both authors lead us to that &quot;knowing&quot; God state and the world around us is forever changed!"},{"Title":"Jerome Robbins: His Life, His Theater, His Dance","review":"I'm amazed at the other reviews for this book that I have read (above) and their unstinting praise for a long, incredibly boring and ultimately dissapointing slog through Mr Robbins life.Perhaps Miss Jowitt has managed to bewitch or possibly hypnotize the other readers. Personally I found this drawn out rambling book to be nothing more than a catalogue of dates, dance moves and occasional affairs.And please know that I am a huge Jerome Robbins fan and consider him to have been quite simply a genius in his field. I could seriously have done with less talk and more action.I wonder how much free access Miss Jowitt had to Robbins personal letters or what her subject's estate actually allowed her to write about. She delivers a bland, un-emotional and hand tied account of someone her readers should have found a page-turning study.How does one compose a book about the man who created at least three of the worlds most acclaimed, enduring and legendary Broadway musicals and gloss over them in a matter of pages? If you suffer the 600 pages of this book you'll discover how.Unlike Mr Robbins own work, I couldn't wait for Miss Jowitt's to end."},{"Title":"Jerome Robbins: His Life, His Theater, His Dance","review":"All in all, I'm touched by Deborah Jowitt's well meaning and comprehensive biography of Jerry Robbins. She digs under the surface of his ballet and Broadway work and finds a whole lot more than I had ever imagined. Again and again she returns to the paradox of the name, how \\"Jerry Robbins\\" was a fake, all-American and showbizzy place name for the real, suffering, inward, outcast Jerome Wilson Rabinowitz, and how Robbins could never be happy knowing this. He loathed himself from the inside out and the outside in: no wonder he treated others so terribly. Deborah Jowitt's years of research into the Robbins papers, those revealing scrapbooks and journals, have really paid off, for although I think in general Greg Lawrence's biography better in most ways, Jowitt's contains innumerable examples of revelation right from the horse's mouth, scraps of diaristic strip-tease that really pay off in almost every case. We can see how, in Gypsy, there had to be a strip-tease number in which three women explain, \\"You Gotta Have a Gimmick,\\" because Robbins realized early on that was the path to artistic greatness--not the gimmick per se, but the emotional and psychological undressing.Along the way Jowitt sketches in many portraits, some of them ravishingly done. Leonard Bernstein has never seemed so much himself before. John Kriza, the gadabout dancer from Ballet Theater days, seems as \\"Fancy Free\\" as the roles he created in Robbins' early work. Jowitt's greatest \\"creation\\" as it were is Tanaquil Le Clercq, the tragic, French-born ballerina who came down with polio while Balanchine's fourth wife. Le Clercq is the real heroine of the book: everything we think about, oh, say, Audrey Hepburn was really Tanaquil Le Clercq gone commercial: gorgeous, radiant, utterly chic, loveable, wildly talented in many different areas. I had just barely heard of her before and now I want me my Tanaquil Le Clercq! I'm going to have to go down to the Robbins Foundation and watch some primitive kinescopes of her. Jowitt actually saw her dance and has apparently never gotten over it. Her next book should be all about \\"Tanny\\"!I did think that Jowitt is a bit sklmpy in her treatment of the HUAC thing. Growing up, I got the sense that Robbins' naming names made hum utterly despised. Even I, as a child of five, knew what he had done made him scum. And yet you never get a sense of what it was like for Robbins living, if not with guilt, then with the simple fact that thousands of people abhorred him. Likewise I think Jowitt isn't exactly the right person to write about Robbins' sex life, and when AIDS enters the picture, she seems bound and determined to avoid the glum subject once and for all. Finally, her lack of editorializing is all very well, but I for one do not believe that the later, experimental work is on a par with INTERPLAY, THE GUESTS, THE CAGE, AFTERNOON OF A FAUN or THE CONCERT. Why not? We don't get an explanation. It was the sixties, pretty much, and Robbins started taking the drugs and stopped wearing suits. But there must have been more to it. WATERMILL is no picnic."},{"Title":"Jerome Robbins: His Life, His Theater, His Dance","review":"Any valid bio of Robbins would have to result in a narrative of the development of dance and musical theatre in America, since the 1940s. While Jowitt gives us the, often sad, milestones in this man's life, her major thrust throughout this long and always exciting book is on his work. She delves into virtually every creation of his, including his generally poorly received occasional forays into non-musical theatre. Detailed attention is given to both concept, creation and execution of his prolific endeavors. Her in depth analysis of each of his works, often quite technical, VIVIDLY recall many great performances of these masterpieces.While not necessarily for those with a casual interest in dance, the facts of his life, as well as the cavalcade of his shows and ballets, makes for a read that is always more than just factual. Interestingly, Jowitt seems never to editorialize on Robbins' work. But then again, why attempt to laud a universally acclaimed genius ?"},{"Title":"Jerome Robbins: His Life, His Theater, His Dance","review":"Jerome Robbins was a hard act to follow. Deborah Jowitt's Jerome Robbins: His Life, His Theater, His Dance should be placed upon every public library shelf, alphabetically, before William Shakespeare, for only he could. Robbins is to 20th Century American Modern Dance Theater what Shakespeare was to the Elizabethan Stage, an author of infinite variety, a man for all ages.Ms. Jowitt gives us a scholarly blueprint for amateur, musical theater lover, and balletomane; one that should be made available to all engaged in the academic pursuits of the Arts, Letters, and Sciences. Jerome Robbins, legendary theatrical genius, is brilliantly extolled in exacting detail and rendered with the loving care of a biographer dedicated to communicating this great artist's \\"message.\\" He was the least difficult of men. All he wanted was boundless love.Deborah Jowitt's Jerome Robbins is written in a trenchant prose style, a cross between WCBS TV celebrity correspondent Walter Cronkite's You Are There, and Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace.Her tone is one of a high-powered sports newscaster delivering to her audience a polished blow-by-blow description of celebrity \\"plays.\\" These are not professional precision ball passing reports; they are larger than life descriptive interactions of 20th Century Show Business's great personalities Robbins knew and loved.Jowitt presents us with an eyeful. It were as though she uses a high definition, technicolor, movie screen attached to a time machine to fly us, like a motion picture director's crane, throughout multiple three dimensional scenes Jerome Robbins choreographs, before our eyes. In Jerome Robbins: His Life, His Theater, His Dance, Deborah Jowitt has delivered a state-of-the art biography that goes beyond the intricate prose of great fiction.Jowitt instantaneously captures \\"the moment,\\" and translates into words that in effect rolls a continuous major motion picture before us, without skipping a beat. One can almost hear the music that Robbins brilliantly illustrates. Jowitt delineates visions of Robbins forging The Great White Way for talented choreographers to follow: Bob Fosse, Michael Bennett, Twyla Tharp.Jowitt's dance training and choreographic practice is revealed in her ability to poetically describe Robbins at work. \\"...he excelled at the artificed use of the apparently accidental. When a moment in a Robbins ballet looks contrived, it can be because one is not simply moved by it but aware of how the choreographer calculated its effect....\\"A culmination of five years of writing, and an historical perspective of thirty-five years of looking at the dance, Deborah Jowitt has emerged as America's Dean of 21st Century Dance; following in the tradition of a great poet's translation of classical ephemera, the work of Edwin Denby, a chronicler of The New York City Ballet. Her Jerome Robbins is a masterpiece. Deborah Jowitt's Jerome Robbins: His Life, His Theater, His Dance should remain on the public library shelf beside William Shakespeare's The Complete Works for all time."},{"Title":"Tomorrow and Tomorrow","review":"COULD HE HOLD THE WORLD TOGETHER?The Vikes were in the saddle riding high - peddling forbidden pleasures, substituting drugs for cocktails, following a twisted path which would permit mankind to escape reality.

I was able to find all of the things that I'd always wanted to see and a few things that I would never have found on my own. I carried it with me constantly and found myself feeling very comfortable getting around. I advise marking the pages of what you want to see before you leave and perhaps making a list.

Where the Access guide shows its genius is information about hotels, shops, and restaurants. This is a book to use to plan before going, and slip into your pocket when heading out to the London streets. The hotel descriptions are excellent (in this book I found the Fielding hotel in Covent Garden, everything the book said and a great place). This is the book to study what kind of shopping to do and where the shops are (have a teapot shaped like the Tower of London now). Found a great Turkish restaurnat near the Strand from this book. This is the book that fills in the spaces between the big attractions with the stuff that is fun. It is laid out geographically, so if you are walking from Trafalgar to the British Museum, a look at this book will give excellent, useful, short descriptions of shops and restaurants between the two, so you can take not the fastest path, but the most fun."},{"Title":"Access London 8th Edition (Access Guides)","review":"I bought Access London after reviewing a dozen or so guidebooks over a few cups of coffee at the local bookstore, and haven't looked back. I only wish that Access guides were available for all of the places that I have traveled. Hopefully one day they will be!Perhaps it was my personal outlook toward going to the city that swayed my decision; so be it. I couldn't have cared less about Buckingham Palace and the Changing of the Guard. It was the old history of London that I sought. The narrow passages, the Thames and it's memories of a 1000 yrs. of watermen plying the river, the pubs which seemed moored in a stream of time all their own. Access London provided the location to many of these windows on the past and was invaluable in making a memorable experience of both of my trips to the City.Now, it should not be misunderstood that Access London doesn't give useful and accurate information about the more popular attractions London has to offer, because it does, and then some. I found the sections pertaining to the museums of London to be especially helpful in finding the highlights among a myriad of exhibitions. The book went so far as to provide floor plans for each of the major museums as well. A last consideration in recommending Access London is the fact that it is laid out in geographic sections. This means that no matter where you find yourself in the heart of this most interesting city you are provided with a host of alternatives when it comes to your eating, drinking, sleeping, and sightseeing options.Access London is an explorers guide to a great city and gets my strongest recommendation."},{"Title":"Access London 8th Edition (Access Guides)","review":"I have used &quot;Access&quot; city guides for many years and have found them to be excellent!

Big mistake! First of all, this guide book does not have a tube map!!! Second, the maps of the different boroughs are not very good. Also, the information is all thrown together so you have restaurants and hotels amidst tourist attractions. Even thought the titles are color coded, this is not very practical, making it harder to find the information you need.I also found that this guide book did not include sufficient practical information that one might need when travelling: addresses for Internet caf&eacute;s, laundromats, information for women travelling alone, etc, which Lonely Planet guides offer extensively. Furthermore, the recommendations in this guide book, in terms of restaurants and hotels, seemed more suitable for \\"older\\" travellers and travellers with a larger budget. If you are young or if you are looking for the \\"cool\\" places to hang out, this guide will not be very helpful.One good thing about this guide book though is that it has detailed background information on the different tourist attractions one might visit.

A new ice age decends upon the planet and creates social and economical upheaval. In addition, many new species are beginning to emerge and punctuated equilibrium theory is demonstrated in the new beasts evolving to cope with the enviromental strains presented by the growing cold. Humans also undergo sudden evolutionary changes and as these strange, genetically different children are born our society seeks to contain what they see as a threat. Weber weaves sound biological theory, scientific speculation, and social and polical issues into an entertaining look at human nature at its best and at its worst. I enjoyed this very much. I a biology student and avid reader of science fiction so I hope to see more from Mr. Weber in the future. Good biological fiction is hard to come by."},{"Title":"Transfiguration (Chronicles of the Future)","review":"A very well written, fast-paced, yet easy read. Was always very interesting, had a hard time deciding where to leave off for the night.Mr. Weber combines sound (and quite convincing) biological theories with philosophical and political viewpoints. In a quickly changing world, new species suddenly begin to appear; among them, a new species of humanoid, which springs forth from their Homo sapiens parents. These creatures are unlike the others: near-hairless, thin bodied, with large heads and large eyes--seemingly unfit for the new environment.But it is soon discovered that their power lies not in their brawn, but in their brains. Their intelligence is far greater than their human counterparts, and they are very quiet and withdrawn--because of this, they are scrutinized and put into \\"special\\" schools. In these schools, the new children aren't given any learning material of any kind (which drives them crazy--they crave knowledge), and the corrupt government attempts to make them more social.There is much more! But I don't want to give it away! Read it yourself!"},{"Title":"Transfiguration (Chronicles of the Future)","review":"This book is easy to get into and it carries the reader along with it quite well, and is worth reading for entertainment value alone. Then there is the political message that accompanies the book as part of the plot itself, as this book is almost a dystopian version of the future.The only problem is with some of the evolutionary science. Rapid mutation as a result of climate variation is quite an acceptable theory, along with punctuated equilibrium, but simultaneous identical mutation and goal directed evolution are not science. Fortunately Sci-Fi requires plausability instead of strict accuracy."},{"Title":"Transfiguration (Chronicles of the Future)","review":"Interesing, well written with a good plot. It was a very fast read. My criticism is that some of the plots and &quot;facts&quot; are simplistic. For example one of the protagonists who is in charge of schooling the population argues that extreme intelligence is abnormal. Her arguement is written &quot;...Being able to play Chopin is abnormal, as is being able paint like DaVince...&quot; Now I don't know of many people who would present an arguement in such a black and white simplistic (and antagonising) way.

Great book and a must have."},{"Title":"The Oxford reformers, (Everyman's library)","review":"Frederic Seebohm's Oxford Reformers, an intellectual history of fifteenth and sixteenth century England, is primarily a collective biography. Seebohm presents the thought of John Colet, Desiderius Erasmus, and Thomas More not as an end in itself but to show the intellectual and personal relationships among them. The best parts of the book relate directly to Seebohm's purpose, his descriptions of each man's character, of how they came to know each other, and of how they supported one another in their work. For example, John Colet is the lonely reformer who with his lectures on the Pauline epistles wages a solitary battle at Oxford against Scholasticism, all the while awaiting a companion and co-laborer. Having found, he believed, that co-laborer in Erasmus, Colet is severely disappointed when Erasmus returned to the continent for further study until Erasmus later rejoined him in England. The relationship between Erasmus and More is also developed, from Erasmus's recognition of More by the brilliance of his arguments to Erasmus's frequent stays at More's home. Most importantly, More's internal conflicts about becoming a monk are presented in light of Erasmus's sufferings with monasticism. Particularly good are the descriptions of John Colet's preaching, without regard to for his own safety, against the corruption of bishops, against Henry VIII's war with France, and against corruption during Woolsey's investment as cardinal.Seebohm describes at length the major philosophical and theological themes of the Oxford Reformers by analyzing their major works. Their most prevalent theme is anti-Scholasticism, seen most clearly in Colet's creed: \\"Keep firmly to the Bible and the Apostles' Creed, and let divines, if they like, dispute about the rest.\\" Part of that anti-Scholasticism is their shared approach to the Bible. Both Erasmus and Colet regarded the Bible as inspired, but not verbally inspired. Both thought that its true meaning resides in the literal sense and could be discovered by means of grammar and history; both thought that criticism of the Bible and even the accommodation of its text were necessary. Colet and Erasmus were also unified by an anti-Augustinian theology. Both Colet and Erasmus favored the writings of Jerome, Origen, and Dionysius to the writing of Augustine, and their theologies developed accordingly. Colet, for example, believed that God's election was conditional upon the merit of the one whom God elected. All three men also united against the avarice of authority. Colet's sermons, Erasmus's Praise of Folly, More's first speech in Parliament resisting the King's appropriations, all denounced the greed of church and king. The men's shared intellectual emphases were matched by a shared personal piety, though both Erasmus and More fell far short of Colet in this respect. Colet showed his piety in sermons about the Christlikeness that the gospel requires; Erasmus in his Enchiridion, and More in his struggles about becoming a monk and in always wearing a hair shirt.On the whole, Seebohm succeeds in his task of writing a collective biography of the Oxford Reformers. He comes somewhat short, however, of writing a history of the Oxford Reformers. He does an excellent job of describing who those men were and what they thought; he does a poor job explaining their place in intellectual, religious, and English history.Seebohm begins with a failure to put Colet, Erasmus, and More in the context of those who preceded them. Without that context, the Oxford Reformers are isolated from those who influenced them and those whom they influenced. Little explanation is given about the condition of the church. Wycliffe, an earlier reformer also from Oxford, is scarcely mentioned in the book. Martin Luther and John Huss are mentioned, but only in passing. Seebohm does try to explain Colet's thought as originating in a revival of neo-Platonism in Florence by trying to connect Colet to Savonarola. But he admits that there is no evidence that Colet ever traveled through Florence or heard Savonarola. He fixes that apparent flaw by arguing that there is no evidence that he did not hear Savonarola.One cannot blame Seebohm for admiring his subjects (or at least Colet), but one could wish that he wrote about them rather than about his admiration for them. There is no spot to be found in any of them, especially not in Colet. For example, in refuting the accusation that Colet was a cruel schoolmaster, Seebohm makes a cogent argument, but the problem is that he assumes his conclusion at the beginning rather than examining the facts and then coming to a conclusion. He describes More's family life, full of problems as being a model of happiness. Seebohm is not content to describe Colet's theology; he must go out of his way to praise its superiority to the theology of those in Seebohm's time who held to a propitiatory atonement. More's Utopia is not just described; Seebohm extends More's arguments further than More himself went. At times, it seems that Seebohm has abandoned facts entirely and describes the Oxford Reformers not as they were but as he wishes they had been.Seebohm includes many primary sources. Letters in their entirety, long extracts from major works, and longer analyses of those works form the bulk of Seebohm's book. All these primary sources give direct insight into the minds of Colet, Eramus, and More, but the insight gained would be greater if the sources had been put into broader contexts. For example, Seebohm stirs great admiration for Colet's bravery in preaching a sermon that was not enjoyed by the bishops assembled to hear him. He then summarily dismisses Colet's trial for heresy in a page, leaving the reader dissatisfied, having hoped for an explanation of what people other than the Oxford Reformers were thinking in order that he could have something to set in contrast to their thought.Perhaps the greatest fault with Seebohm's book is that he almost never explains the impact these men had on the English people, on religious developments in Europe, and especially on the English reformation. Where one expects to read history, he reads panegyric. And that is the greatest dissatisfaction to the reader and the greatest slight to Colet, Erasmus, and More. If they were truly the great men that Seebohm believes them to be, then they carved their epithets into future generations. Their reputations, and Seebohm's book, would have been better served by a description of that impact on future developments.In short, Seebohm does a good job illumining the Oxford Reformers. Unfortunately his book is a spotlight shining on them and them alone, giving no illumination to their surroundings. Had he given more attention to their context, case, Seebohm would have succeeded not only in writing a collective biography but also the history of Colet, Erasmus, and More."},{"Title":"Victorian and Edwardian Fashions from \\"La Mode Illustree\\" (Dover Fashion and Costumes)","review":"I was leery of ordering this book, because most of the books that claim to illustrate both the Victorian and Edwardian eras merely skim over the Edwardian. But I was pleasantly surprised.The book covers the years 1860-1914 and gives equal (or slightly superior) coverage to the Edwardian and pre-WWI years. The illustrations are large and detailed, allowing for very good views of the trimmings of the garments, and the smaller rear views of many garments are invaluable to the recreationist. Also included are period captions describing the intended uses of the garments (tea or opera, for young girls or women &quot;of a certain age&quot;); these are both interesting and very helpful for the self-educated costumer. The selection of dresses, coiffures, hats, parasols, coats, lingerie, nightdresses, and children's clothing is well chosen and the garments are lovely.My only complaint is that a few years are either entirely skipped, or skimmed over: 1866, 1872, 1875, 1878, 1883, 1893, 1899, and 1911. However, the existing material is excellent and very useful--I wholeheartedly recommend it."},{"Title":"Victorian and Edwardian Fashions from \\"La Mode Illustree\\" (Dover Fashion and Costumes)","review":"This book is one of the most comprehensive, well-done and complete guide to both Victorian and Edwardian fashion I've ever seen.

I recommend this book as a very accurate guide to the period for researchers, costumers or fashion enthusiasts. The book, along with fantastic illustrations, includes a summary of the times and fashions and a very helpful glossary.

Joanne Olian, former curator of the costume collection at the Museum of the City of New York, has painstakingly assembled a huge collection of the finest illustrations showing beautiful ladies' fashions from 1860 to 1912, with almost every year getting at least one page (though, as another reviewer mentions, some years unfortunately aren't examined in much detail). Every illustration is full-page and accompanied by a paragraph or two of text, generally taken directly from the original description of the item in LMI.

Hence the necessity of including reprints from both in one's collection of historic-fashion reference. The great advantage of this large-sized book is that the illustrations are reproduced in such generous proportions as to make study of the details of dress mostly very easy. Of course it's too bad they're not in color, but if you keep in mind that this was the heyday of aniline dyes, many of them exotically named, you'll be able to guess at that. I found it intriguing that well into 1871, while the artists reproduced the look of the clothes with great care, they didn't seem to quite have a handle on the wearers of them: many of the faces don't exactly look like women as we see them today. Outerwear, bathing costumes (some of which resemble modern pajamas), party gowns, street clothes, travelling clothes, informal household dress, accessories, and children's clothing (of which you can find more inChildren's Fashions, 1860-1912: 1,065 Costume Designs from \\"La Mode Illustree\\") all appear here, in the classic elaborate styles of the late-Victorian era.

These detailed black-and-white engravings give an excellent overview of cutting-edge French fashion for women and children from 1860 through 1914. Since French fashion set the style for the rest of Europe and North America, it's a good sourcebook for them too.The reader has to be careful. These are fashion plates, and the models are impossibly proportioned and impossibly elegant. But the details are invaluable.Descriptions of the images are brief and perfunctory, presumably translated from the original French.This book covers a long period and rather gallops along. There are fashions for nearly every year, but no one year is gone into in a lot of detail.

Sailors endured grueling labor for low wages on long voyages, bad food in small quantities and frequent savage beatings from ships' officers. Sailors who jumped ship in California were penalized as criminals, guilty of \`\`desertion'' and imprisoned for six months at hard labor.These conditions, combined with a rapidly expanding West Coast maritime economy, gave rise to the Coast Seamen's Union, which became the Sailor's Union of the Pacific. The Coast Seamen's Union was founded on a lumber pile on the Folsom Street Wharf on March 6, 1885, by radical socialists of the San Francisco-based International Workmen's Association, modeled on Marx's wing of the First International....But as the account progressed into the 1920s, schizophrenic authorial voices alternated with metronomic regularity, in places sympathetic to proletarian radicals, at other points distancing and dismissive in the smug cliched style of mainstream American journalism.Schwartz critiqued the Bolshevik hijacking of radical tendencies in the international workers' movement, and Moscow's sabotage of revolution in Germany. Subsequently the authorial voice took on the frenzied tone of a protagonist in a story by Edgar Allan Poe. He wrote as if he'd been cheated out of a parking space. On page 86 of Chapter IV Schwartz claimed that when it came to police violence against the working class in the United States or Russia \`\`There was most assuredly a difference between the clubs of (Democratic) forces and those of the Communist (sic) police in Moscow.''From a left-libertarian critique of Bolshevik state capitalism, Schwartz swung to a right-wing demonization of Stalinism. Schwartz had crossed over to the side of the bosses, as long as they weren't the bosses of nationalized industry in Russia.In a later chapter Schwartz claimed the Russian and German revolutions and all the revolts and uprisings since 1917 had been minor footnotes to the union-controlled San Francisco General Strike of 1934. Although many of the seamen and longshoremen in this strike followed the leadership of Stalinists, Schwartz dismissed this as a generation gap between solid trade-unionists of the SUP stripe and combative young proles who didn't understand what the union movement was all about. This last point was offered without irony.Cracking up entirely under the weight of trade-union consciousness, Schwartz extolled the patriotism of the SUP and its role in the American war effort in World War II and the Korean War. The manuscript ended with brown-nosing praise of Paul Dempster, Schwartz's employer, the contemporary head of the union.I compared Schwartz's manuscript with The Sailors Union of the Pacific by Paul S. Taylor, an economics instructor at the University of California who published his history in 1923 with the cooperation of Sailors' Union leader Andrew Furuseth.According to Taylor, the SUP was a business union with a conservative strike policy. As early as 1894 the SUP went on record as being against \`\`the collective ownership of the means of production and distribution.'' During World War I sailors were one of the few categories of workers that refrained from striking throughout the war. Furuseth proclaimed in a patriotic manifesto during the war that \`\`Seamen have no choice but to obey.''...*{From \\"From Munis to Meese: Left Communism or State Department Surrealism?\\" by Kevin Keating:[...] }"},{"Title":"A Dream Play, and Four Chamber Plays (The Washington Strindberg)","review":"i did not come to this site buying the book ... i wanted the translation og the monologe of &quot;The blind man&quot; into english .... it is tough, and a short cut of a life ..."},{"Title":"Transportation Engineering: Planning and Design","review":"My book was in great condition as stated and was shipped on time.

But in fact it contains only a portion of the text. Jerome translated the Chronicle of Eusebius of Caesarea, which ran from the birth of Abraham in the 15th dynasty, down to the vicennalia of Constantine in 326AD. He added his own preface, filled in a few gaps where Eusebius had been ignorant of events in the Latin West, and also brought it up to date, adding entries of his own composition down to the death of Valens in 379AD. It is this last portion ---- from the end of the translation of Eusebius' work to the end of the chronicle ---- that is included in this work.This is a great pity. No translation of the whole Chronicle exists in English. However, the editor has done us a service by translating the last portion, and giving references for each year to the details in other ancient texts such as Eutropius and Aurelius Victor.

The Knox family settled in Indianapolis, Indiana, where Prudence grew up, married, and raised her own children. The characters in these stories are unforgettable, ranging from the mysterious Miss Abigail, who helps the Knox family escape safely from Georgia, to fiesty Mama who keeps everyone in line. We meet Mr. Quiggels, who helps Prudence and her young daughter, Phyllis (the author), cope with the racial prejudice all too common in the 1940s and 50s, as well as Peter Lorre, who tries to persuade Prudence's husband, Morgan Adair, to work for him.

Ms. Adair-Ward has done an excellent job drawing the reader into the joy and pain of her family. The story provided plenty of history about Indianapolis and the black community beginning in the early 1900's.Will and Sally Knowx owned a large farm in Homer, Georgia where there was plenty of room to roam for a family of twelve. During the early 1900's the south of full of racism and klan activity were reported widely. The Knoxes were forced to leave their home,family members and friends behind when rumors surfaced that the klan were targetting Papa. After an altercation in town Papa quietly moved his family to Indianapolis, Indiana. Little did they know that the klan were moving their headquarters to Indiana about the same time.Life for the family was different but their love sustained them.Indianapolis was an exciting place to behold with all the bright street lights and the trolley. But there was not as space as in the south. There was talk about Riverside Amusement Park and its limited access to blacks. Segregation was alive and well in this city.Papa Will was easy on the kids but Mama Sal was quite the disciplinary, despite her petite stature. She did not tolerate anyone messing with any of children. She had to pay a visit to the children's school early on to rectify a problem that had arisen with her boys.They also had plenty of mischief shared by all the children. Prudence in particular was quite headstrong.One incident in particular was when Prudence and her sister Blance had snuck off to the Douglas Theater to see an old friend perform. They had lied and said that they were going to a game at the school. Of course Mama Sal knew about the escapade.

Excellent customer service!"},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"In Weber's classic work, he connects the Protestant Reformation with the rise in modern-day capitalism - the two, according to Weber, are essentially linked together. The Reformation introduced core elements upon which capitalism is built. For example the idea that the individual has rights associated with responsibility is a fundamental element of the Reformation - no longer is the Catholic Church solely responsible for the spiritual development of an individual, he must be responsible himself...every member a minister concept. Well, that's essential for the promulgation of capitalism as well - it's not the responsibility of the state, it's the reasonability of the individual to make a profit or lose capital in the process. The individual was kept stable and protected under the thumb of the Catholic Church, according to Weber, and the Reformation has freed the individual to take risks and stake their claim in life. Weber also notes that the Catholic Church promoted religious piety, a quiet and subdued worship within the walls of the sanctuary while the Reformation released people to worship with zeal and passion in the fields and through his labors."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"When feudalism broke down in the Late Middle Ages, Weber argues, the capitalism that emerged in its place was an entirely new ethos, accompanied by a peculiar Puritan ethic that dignified the accumulation of wealth as a sign of divine favor. The \\"spirit\\" of capitalism was distinct from the impulse to acquisition, which was nothing new in the 16th century. It was the pursuit of perpetually-renewed profit, for its own sake, above and beyond the satisfaction of traditional human needs. But what was driving this pursuit of perpetual profits? The religious concept of \\"calling,\\" says Weber, the idea that worldly activity is morally good if it is what God has called us to do. This concept contrasted with earlier Christian renunciation of worldly affairs in favor of monastic contemplation of God.Just as worldly wealth was a sign of God's favor, poverty became shameful, indicating rejection of God's calling. The unequal distribution of the goods of this world was ordained by God's inscrutable Providence, said Calvinists. Therefore charity became meaningless, in sharp contrast to the teachings of St. Paul, who called it the greatest of virtues. Said John Wesley, \\"We must exhort all Christians to gain all they can, and to save all they can; that is, in effect, to grow rich.\\" Said Jesus, \\"It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.\\" Is there a disconnect between Calvinist Protestantism and the teachings of Jesus? You decide.The socio-economic preconditions for capitalism existed in other parts of the world, argues Weber; why did it arise only in the Protestant West?

Both authors do not exclude each other, but can be used to criticise one anohter."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"The story of Max Weber's life is well known. He was born to an affluent Prussian family. His father was domineering and politically active, a hard-nosed conservative by most standards. His mother, by contrast, was loving, genteel, and deeply religious. Most of Weber's relatively brief life may have been imbued with Oedipal tension produced by the struggle between these opposite poles.A brilliant student, Weber took a degree in law and wrote an habilitation on Roman agricultural practices and regulation. He rose quickly in academe, and was awarded the chair in history held by the famous Theodore Mommsen.In spite of his tremendous academic promise, some of it already realized, in his early 30's Weber suffered a nervous breakdown. He struggled with neurotic symptoms for the rest of his years, though he also managed to return to an active academic and high-level political life. His commitment to a peculiarly Prussian notion of honor was conspicuous when, WWI clearly lost, he advised the Kaiser to don the uniform of a soldier and seek death between the trenches in no-man's land.The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism was originally published as two essays in successive issues of a German academic journal. Weber, and especially the Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, were long uncritically revered in the United States. This was due to the fact that Weber found Marx's historical materialism anathema, and this was manifest in his work. Some observers, exaggerating, I think, have taken Weber's life's work to be a contentious exchange with the ghost of Marx.Marx found the development of capitalism in the demise of feudalism, the consequent freeing of prospective small-scale capitalists and workers, and the struggle between capitalist and capitalist, worker and worker, and, decisively, capital and labor. Capital's intent was to accumulate more and more, and to gain control over ever-broadening markets. In the process, they sought to use concentration and technological development to drive down labor costs, further increasing profits at the expense of labor. Social change was due largely to class conflict. Capital accumulation became an end in itself, intrinsic to the role that capitalists played. That was what capital did, and that was how individual capitalists survived!Weber saw things differently. For Weber, hard-edged Calvinism, with its merciless doctrine of pre-destination, prompted people to persuade themselves and others that they were among the elect by achieving material success on the temporal plane. Capitalism provided a means to use accumulation as a way of identifying those whom God preferred. Since accumulation of ever larger amounts of capital was an indicator that one was among the elect, asceticism to permit investment of ever greater monetary gains was a useful way of life and work. fostering the rationally calculable accummulation of still more capital. Hard work, self-abnegation, and great wealth were the hallmarks of one favored by God. As suggested by another reviewer, and consistent with Weber's understanding of routinization, such practices became institutionalized, autonomous of their provenance in Calvinism.All the while, those who had little, and presumably were not among the elect, worked hard to enhance the glory of god. But why? They were not among the elect, so why should they care if god was glorified or not? Sounds like a self-defeating scam that workers would quickly see through. This scam, moreover, would foster worldly libertines rather than hard-working worshipers of a god who had rejected them from the outset. As we can see from our own social world, however, a culturally engendered work ethic dies hard. Eventually, nevertheless, it seems likely that no set of practices can survive on incantations and habituation alone. \\"Eventually,\\" though, may be a long way off.Weber's thesis has never made much sense to me. If capital accumulation assured entry to heaven, then it would be persuasive. As it is, however, it merely hinted at that outcome. Yes, the Protestant Ethic eventually became autonomous of its provenance in Calvinism, attaining an independent cultural dynamic, but that still begs the question of the dubious efficacy of Calvinism at the outset.Weber, no doubt, was a genius who personified the Protestant Ethic in his strongly felt need to be \\"crushed under a burden of work.\\" But even hardworking geniuses are sometimes wrong, as in this case."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"Modern readers may find the dry style this book is written in a bit boring, but the subject matter makes up for it.

Specifically, the author analyzes differences between the behaviors of Protestants, Catholics, and Jews.The author points that \\"rational organization of capital\\" is a good thing and \\"politically oriented capitalism\\" is a bad thing. I agree with this comment. However, the author's belief that the former is Protestant capitalism and the latter is Jewish capitalism is something that I find objectionable since all Protestants are not the same and all Jews are not the same.The author brings up examples from both history and religious doctrine to back up his points.John Christmas, author of \\"Democracy Society\\""},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"The Dover edition of the book has been bound so tightly that it's difficult to turn the pages--and to read the words, which are nearly swallowed up by the binding.

Anything's better than trying to read this edition."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"This book is the founder of the prolific field of eocnomic sociology. It introduces the concept that culture (in the form of the protestant ethic) is better adapted to fit capitalism. Therefore, capitalist growth was found more frequently in protestant societies than in others.Since Webber, there has been much study of this topic, with some of the main names being Lawrence Harrison (focusing on the culture of underdevelopment) and Francis Fukuyama (focusing on how trusting societies benefit economically). Both and others push the frontiers initially established by Webber.Though controversial especially today in the period of political correctness, Webber presents a strong mainly anecdotal case (given the absense of many statistical tools at the time) of why protestant societies succeed in capitalism; his main argument (though there are many other important ones) is that it is socially acceptable in protestant societies to make a profit, whereas it may be considered immoral in other societies, such as catholic ones.This is a good theoretical book with a few good anecdotes. It is for someone interested in the history of sociology, especially as it pertains to economics. If you are just looking for a link between culture or religion and economics, look at Larry Harrison."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"Rather than a general theory or explanation of either economics or religion, Weber attempts to draw a specific link between what he sees as the conjunction of the work ethic of Protestant (mainly Calvinist) spiritual teachings, and the success of Western European Capitalism.Weber is an astute analyst, in many ways. He rightly notes that often the 'sine qua non' of Capitalism is thought of as \\"greed\\". Arguing against this notion, Weber points out that all societies have had greedy people within their particular economic system-greed is thus a factor irrespective of economic systems. Replacing this, Weber proposes that the \\"spirit\\" of Capitalism be thought of as a particular moral attitude towards work and idleness-an attitude that holds that constant and diligent work for its own sake is a moral imperative. In the face of what Weber calls \\"the radical elimination of magic from the world\\" this work ethic was the existential option left for people in terms of atonement and personal compensation for inadequacies. I believe that these two insights are right on target.If there is a weakness involved in his characterization of this Protestant \\"Ethic,\\" it lies in the fact that Weber attempts to draw a strict dichotomy in the origins of this ethic. He states forcefully that this ethic does not come out of any Enlightenment thought. The problem with trying to separate this ethic from the Enlightenment, is that this ethic which posits diligent work for its own sake is clearly found in the ethics of Immanuel Kant, who classified this kind of work and labor as a \\"duty\\" (ethical rule) that the self has to itself. In other words, how much of this is the legacy of the Reformation and how much of this is the legacy of the Enlightenment?The necessity for this kind of work also appears in the ethics of Hegelian philosophy. Hegel characterizes work as a means of the realization of Spirit within the human self, since the performance of duties which one would not normally choose to do can be thought of as a deliberate placing of oneself in the context of alienation. The individual then, through diligent &quot;work,&quot; attempts to convert that which is foreign (antithetical) to the self into that which is of the self. Work is thus a means of overcoming a system of deliberate self-alienation, and is vitally necessary. Kant and Hegel, clearly two giants of Enlightenment thought, both maintain that the essence of diligent work is to become, not acquire-acquisition is a by-product and consequence of work. This is very similar to Weber's characterization of this ethos.Another problem arises when we attempt to draw a strict separation between the worldly attitudes of Catholic monasticism and this \\"Protestant Ethic.\\" While it is certainly true that Catholic monasticism placed a high degree of value on contemplatio, Catholic dogma, from Augustine through Gregory the Great and onwards, held explicitly that one must always return to work in the world-contemplatio was always insufficient in itself as a mode of being. Biblically, this was often seen in light of the Hebrew story of Rachel and Leah, as well as the Greek story of Mary and Martha. The contemplative life is certainly of \\"higher\\" value in Catholic thought, yet it must be seen as returning the soul to the life of activity, lest the soul run the risk of the heresy of \\"Quietism.\\" Some forms of Catholic mysticism ran into heretical issues precisely because they held that the life of activity should be abandoned. So, while there may be a difference in degree, we should be careful not to draw a stronger split than is there. Weber writes as if only Luther or Calvin has the concept of a life's \\"calling,\\" when this was always already part of Catholicism too.This entire issue actually has its roots in Greek political philosophy, where we see a clear tension between the &quot;practical life&quot;, and the &quot;contemplative life.&quot; The issue persists into Roman life. We can even see some evidence of this type of Protestant ethos in Stoicism, which held that the active pursuit of virtue and public activity was the highest good. Contrast to Epicureanism, which held that the private, quiet study of philosophy and other pleasures, away from worldly life, was the highest good. The issue, of course, reemerges in Christian thought. But for all of its force in Protestantism, we must not take a myopic view that this was somehow unique to Protestantism in Western intellectual thought. Other factors than religion must have also played a role in the development of capitalism.The role of Judiasm is Weber's biggest problem. According to his own endnotes, Jews enjoy more economic success and motivation---so why would Protestantism give birth to Capitalism?We should nonetheless congratulate Weber for attempting to take a close look at the interactions between religious and economic thought. Like Marx, his work serves a good framework to examine the way religious thought influences and inteacts with factors like world economics."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"This book is legendary. Max Weber arguably was the first social scientists who devoted his life's work to cross-cultural studies. His pioneering study of &quot;The protestant ethic...&quot; combines a broad, almost universal, vision of human desires and ideas with painstaking details of how certain religious movements transformed the economic basis of feudal Europe, and later the United States, into an economy of competition and free enterprise. The drive in early capitalism, Weber shows, was an inherentreligious belief in money as a means of eternal salvation. Trough accumulating more wealth, capitalists were trying to prove for themselves that they were worthy of God's grace and hence were secured an afterlife in Paradise. However, spending money was not an option for these capitalists. It was considered a sin to use capital gains to satisfy carnal and worldly desires ( compare with Enron and Worldcom executives). Wealth was in many ways protected by a fear of God."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism is CLASSIC - and should be a mandatory read for every student of sociology. Unfortunately, the classic literature of sociology isn't emphasized enough in today's educational institutions. Students are entering the real world without the foundation of social prophets and coming up with their own ideas of &quot;what the world is coming to,&quot; and taking credit for ideology that has long been debated and written down by masterminds such as Weber. Pay attention! What is this book really about? This is a revolutionary work discussing critically the causes and effects of sociological chance, and how the sociology of religion has changed meaning because of the philosophy we now base our ideas on.

Despite that, the author isn't a cultural determinist because he takes care to point out that values help to shape an outcome, but don't produce it for certain.This book is quite interesting, and includes lots of interesting observations regarding Weber's main premise, despite not being overly long. For instance, the author says that due to the fact that Protestant ethic viewed hard work as a duty and looked down on excesive luxuries, Protestants were indirectly encouraged to save almost all the money they earnt, thus increasing the funds available for the capitalist process. Of course, there are many more examples that contribute to give weight to Weber's argument, but to know more you will need to read *The protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism* ...Weber analyses some data at his disposal, and that makes some chapters slightly less engaging. Notwithstanding that, this book is likely to be worth your time and your money. To start with, you will learn quite a few interesting facts you probably were unaware of before.

Weber regarded this as foolish, but too many who pick up this book for the first time read it this way. Weber's theory of the Iron Cage is important and stunnningly extended by Daniel Bell in the Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism.This book was translated 17 years before the next important work of Weber's, which caused much scholarship of him to reduce him to the content of this text. Don't fall into that trap. Weber is one of the hardest thinkers to reliably abstract in history. Most Weberians and Neo-Weberians are still radically at odds with each other over what his opus meant. Heck, Thomas Burger almost gets violent in his criticism of other Weberian interpretations.The primarary error of setting this as Weber's monolithic work is to set Weber as Marx's counterbalance. He \\"turned Marx on his head\\" mainly to Weber's contemporaries in Germany, many of whom had accepted religion as an opiate of the masses unworthy of scholarship. It is far easier to understand Weber is you compare him with Rickert. Better yet, read Weber's on work on methodology of the social sciences and his alter works that explored hte religious, political and social worlds."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"Weber's \\"Protestant Ethic\\" was originally published in 1904-1905 and later in a second, revised edition (1920). This edition is the second edition, and the translator is Talcott Parsons.In \\"The Protestant Ethic\\" Weber famously attempts to explain how the spirit of modern rational capitalism emerged; and he essentially argues that an important part in this process was played by what he termed ascetic protestantism or different types of Protestantism that were activistic and ascetic (most famously Calvinism).Ascetic Protestantism energized businessmen and workers, and valorized a new type of capitalism: rational capitalism which is much more methodical and dynamic in nature than the type of capitalism that existed in Europe in the 1500s (\\"traditional capitalism\\"). Today rational capitalism has conquered society and turned it into an iron cage (to use Parsons' famous translation of two words in German that are more accurately - and less imaginatively - translated as \\"steelhard casing\\").\\"The Protestant Ethic\\" is by far the most famous sociological study and is unsurpassed in theoretical boldness and creativity. Parsons said that he found it as exciting to read as a detective novel. Most of us have to struggle quite a bit with it - but it is definitely worth it!"},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"As part of my enquiry into the forces that the Reformation unleased, I decided to at last read this classic.Alas, it was disappointing in that Weber makes the assertion - that reformation-spawned ideologies were the foundation of the capitalist revolution - and then offers little historical explanation as proof of his thesis. Instead, what he does is to painstakingly describe the ideologies in question, to show that they are compatible conceptually with his definition of capitalism (the rise of an urban bourgeoisie that created wealth by investing in industry as a major new economic actor, eventaully leading to the eclipse of the old land-based aristocracy). As Hannah Ardnt said, so long as you are far enough from reality, you can make almost any ideas appear compatible. As such, I was unconvinced that a) the feeling of being among the elect made people work harder to prove it by material success and b) that a heightened sense of individuality that arose with separation from the papist ideologies augmented this pursuit of self-development via the massing of personal capital. While the protestant ideologies may conform vaguely to these notions, that does not in the slightest prove a direct causal connection. Indeed, one might argue that it was the repression by the Inquisition - against the bourgoise's challenge to traditional aristocrats - that may have delayed the development of capitalism in Catholic countries for a few centuries. (That capitalism did develop in many Catholic countries also undermines the book's prinicpal thesis.)This essay is interesting as a pioneering attempt at sociological determinism from a rather existentialist perspective, but reading the whole thing was a bit much for me. Weber was a great and innovative thinker, however out of date his modes of reasoning have become - they are strictly qualitative. Not recommended except asof historical interest."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"As it is one of the most important and influential masterpieces in the history of the social science, if you can understand the analytical methods used in this book, the rest is few. Since even the details are interesting, I stress the structure of this book.The first part is the proposal of the question. Found on several statistical analysis, the following problem is arisen; why merchants and manufactures were willing to be protestant, which has the much severer attitude to desires in the world than Catholic?The reason is the estimation of the job. Their preference is bound to their social situation in the Middle. This is the fundamental leading discipline of Weber.The second part is the results of such Protestantism. They willingly entered them, which obligate their work as sacred. Then, what happened as results? The main influence is brought by the predetermined dogma, which means that the fatal of people has already been determined before their birth. It makes people disinterruptedly anxious and stress, because nothing to do is useful for the salvation in this world. Its psychology became the engine for the world to be free from the magic.His existential analysis of Protestantism attracts readers even now and we applause it, but in his eyes their psychology was bound by their social situations. His analysis seems to stress the psychological change at the second stage to have believed in them, but he shows the importance of the motivation at the first stage to have entered into them.This overview may make clear the composition of his analysis. However, maybe, almost all readers will forget this framework in the face of his analysis' seriosity."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"THE PROTESTANT ETHIC AND THE SPIRIT OF CAPITALISM by Max Weber is the kind of book which I imagined was important in my youth. I find it difficult, now, but not because anything which is says is any less true than it ever was. As history goes, it is some of the most thoughtful. The problem is that we are no longer living in history. Comparing ourselves to the contents of this book confirms that society is now at the level of farce, and likely to remain so. This conclusion might not strike anyone starting the book for the first time, but it ought to grab anyone who is capable of comprehending Chapter 3, &quot;Luther's Conception of the Calling.&quot;My point of view works best if it is accepted that, as America now stands, it can only be understood as a nation of shoppers. The large and still growing amount by which imports exceeds exports requires that the entire world maintains this view for monetary stability. The political parties might pretend to be theoretically split between those who use the government as a means of shopping for people's needs and those who would enhance the ability to make big bucks, but neither party can, in actuality, represent with their whole heart those who picture government as the ultimate shopper, which ought to be able to provide people with what they would not otherwise have, whether through liberal social programs or by imposing rigid security provisions and covert activities. Thinking about how well secret military tribunals or jailing users of illegal substances actually functions, as applied to &quot;others,&quot; strike me as being an absurd application of Luther's &quot;observation that the division of labour forces every individual to work for others.&quot; Both parties, to maintain their existence in such a tipsy world, must appeal to those who would maintain &quot;the privileged position, legal or actual, of single great trading companies.&quot; Only the American ability to convince the world that everyone who takes our money for their products fully shares the ability of Americans to benefit from such great wealth can maintain such a situation as &quot;a traditionalist interpretation based on the idea of Providence. The individual should remain once and for all in the station and calling in which God had placed him, and should restrain his worldly activity within the limits imposed by his established station in life. While his economic traditionalism was originally the result of Pauline indifference, it later became that of a more and more intense belief in divine providence, which identified absolute obedience to God's will, with absolute acceptance of things as they were.&quot; The uses of two &quot;Absolute&quot;s in that sentence is what frightens me. Any sign of inability to adapt to a future which includes vast changes is a bad characteristic for a modern society, and the modern economy seems to be headed in a direction that will no longer provide great wealth to all who expect it. In such a situation, anyone might consider the words of Milton in &quot;Paradise Lost,&quot; as quoted by Max Weber, which points out that people are able:To leave this Paradise, but shall possessA Paradise within thee, happier far.The next paragraph suggests, &quot;The appeal to national character is generally a mere confession of ignorance, and in this case it is entirely untenable.&quot; The difference between what Max Weber is trying to describe and what I'm thinking is what makes this kind of book so difficult to read, and I wouldn't be surprised if you haven't read it."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"This is one of Weber's most important works.

Perhaps there is even a tonic more readily administered than recent disputations of Weber's famed religio-economic history: which has it that the cultural norms of Protestantism (denial of self-gratification in pursuit of a spiritual ideal) are responsible for the rise of the modern entrepreneural economy, perhaps all too securely. In fact, perhaps the architect of Weimar's Caesarist exceutive branch ought to be trusted with relatively little in this respect: that is to say, there should be some fact by virtue of which his work is available to us as an unstable amalgam permitting of virtuous appropriation.Might this be the new \\"availability\\" of the former standard translation by Talcott Parsons? Indeed it might: Parsons was not only the dean of American sociologists (and how), he was actually a fantastically acute observer of \\"Lakatosian\\" dynamics in the history of ideas, and the problematic character of the Weberian conceptual scheme was unlikely to have passed him by. If we compare this version to George Schwab's translation of *The Concept of Politics* by Carl Schmitt (once explicitly claimed to be the \\"legitimate heir\\" of Weber by Habermas) the relative lack of excitement is palpable, and perhaps tangible too: Parsons was actually rather fond of \\"cages of rationality\\", and in all seriousness there may be no very good reason to consider \\"cylindricized\\" elements of meaning employed in goal-directed behavior all that ironclad.

Geography and later geology gave England industrial and economical sucess.With the 30 years War, Germany was splited in about 300 feufdoms.The England's decadency also came from no theological problemas, but geological, political and tecnological problems.With the reunification of Germany, an industrial enemy was created in continental Europe.With the invention of airplane, England could be attacked by an enemy with no navy.With the coming of oil's age, England (North Sea oil's reserves not found before the 1960's) had to import100% of his fuel.With both World wars, England's empire was sentenced to death.Protestantism in fact, like today, was ever divided in thounsands of cults, since his beginnings.If fact all kinds of protestantisms are image and similarity of his human creator, culture and society.Luther made a anti-semithic protestantism suc as himself.Calvin made a bank's friend protestantism, as himself was.And the England's king Henry VIII made an english protestantism.All reformator made a Jesus equal to himself.This fact is true until today.Protestantism don't make a society and culture.In fact a society and a culture makes a protestantism.The brazilian and latin american reality shows that protestantism itself don't make economical sucess.Here in Brazil, 80% of people who go to a church, go to a protestant (pentecostal) church.Do we have economical sucess with all this protestantism?NO!!!!This same fact happened in many parts of latin America.Bad economic results followed protestantism growing.El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua all are as protestants(pentecostals) as Brazil.All with bad economical results.About 35% of brazilian population are protestants, against about 80% of brazilian maids are protestants.In fact the brazilian protestants are, poorer than the general brazilian population.Also brazilian states with more protestants have bigger crime rates.In fact, more protestants, more crimes in Brazil.The poorest of all religious groups in Brazil are, the protestants(pentecostal).Only protestantism as a medicine for economical, political and cultural troubles is a quackery.Not a single african or latin american country had good economical results after protestantism's growing.At the same time, Spain with less than 1% of his population protestant, is an economical sucess.Italy and Portugal with only about 2% of protestants are also developed countries.This book is a source with some good things to read.As I wrote up, Max Weber was an honest scholar, not a mad or a bigot.After all, Max Weber was looking to show us the reality, but he only wrote us rooted, in his own times, believes and realities.Every man is a prisioner of his times, friends and realities.And Max Weber wasn't an exception."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"I meant Heinrich Rickert, not Richter.

It has its faults, but in refuting the idea of Marx's stages of development and merging the notions of religion, it demonstrates how capitalism builds on the ideologies of ordinary individuals. This is a must-read for all social scientists."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"The main thesis of Max Weber's book is the definite link between the Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism: \`through which fruits can the Reformed see without doubt that he has the right faith: when his Christian life increases God's glory. Only a chosen one has really the Fidex efficax; only he is capable of being reborn and from this sanctification can he during his whole life increase God's glory with good works. So, good works are in no way means of obtaining salvation, but only a sign that one has been elected.' (Adaptation of the German text. LR)The relationship between \`God's glory' and \`good works', is expressed by a rationalization of man's economic life (work).This thesis is, in fact, a response to Marx's theory, which states that ideas, beliefs, ideologies are part only of the superstructure. The real foundations are the property and production relations between the classes, with on the one hand, the owners of the means of production (the capitalists) and on the other hand, the owners of the labor force, which they are forced to sell to the capitalists (the proletarians).By demonstrating that religious 'ideas' also influence the socio-economic behavior of man, Max Weber wanted to prove that the base structure also includes ideas.Money in circulation and capitalismBut there is a whole other aspect of the influence Protestantism, a very palpable one and not in the minds of people.For a long period of time, 75% of all the money in circulation in Europe was in the hands of the Catholic Church (W. Manchester). What did the Church with this money? She built many Versailles (churches); in other words a sort of Western potlatch.The radical change came, on the continent, with Protestantism and in England, with Henry VIII (G. M. Trevelyan). From then on, entrepreneurs and merchants could keep a big part of their money, which before had been confiscated by the Church. They invested it in new profitable businesses.A simple example as illustration: when in the 16th century, Antwerp was besieged by the Catholic Spanish King, Philip II, all \`Protestant' entrepreneurs and merchants fled the city and settled in Amsterdam. They created there a golden age (the beginning of pure capitalism for I. Wallerstein).Max Weber's book is a must read for all those interested in Western history."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"My spin is that Weber's work is helpful in that so many writers reference him that you need to know what he said in order to comprehend the point they're making. Having said that, I think Weber has some validity, but his sociological explanation of how socieites fuction is lacking.He does not equate capitalism with greed. He explicitly states that and goes on to define a capitalistic economic action as &quot;one which rests on the expectation of profit by the utilization of opportunities for exchange, that is on (formally) peaceful chances of profit.&quot;Weber contends that &quot;business leaders and owners of capital, as well as the higher grades of skilled labor, and even more the higher technically and commercially trained personnel of modern enterprises are overwhemingly Protestant.&quot; He goes on to discuss how the teachings of Calvinism bring this about. He talks about stewards on earth having heaven as an ultimate goal. This is a classic, thought provoking book."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"Here is an argument which merits a particular accolade: it is one of the few modern academic theories whose acceptance has withstood the test of time. Max Weber's claim, that the Protestant ethic provided the psychological/sociological framework for the emergence of Capitalism in the formative 16th and 17th centuries has surprisingly outlived, in its original whole, such momentous theses as Einsteinian relativity, to the extent that it remains so far unscathed by the inevitable skeptical critique, in tact in its primary tenets.I would go further by asserting that Calvin's progenitive endorsement of usury (in the original sense of lending of capital at interest) during his rule in Geneva (which yet remains the hub of international banking) marked not only the pivotal moment in the birth of modern capitalism and thus, the emergence of the modern problematic, but also, the signal phase in the 180 degree ideological turn from Christ's message in its initial, divine articulation. You who seek to know what usurps the possibility of peace on earth and good will to everyone, look no further than to a teaching which judges those of whom it knows nothing, as a prerequisite for social interaction, which divides the trusting and gentle at birth, as mere children, into saved and damned, superior and inferior, have and have not, success and failure, accepted and rejected, and which at last presumes as justification for all these brutal and criminal acts, putative understanding of the intricate and supernatural wisdom of a comprehensive and universal plan, and has the temerity to assign to every being in nature a place in this plan and, by extension, a place in the business plan of every multi-national corporation, who, through the blindness engendered by its aegis, sees its leadership as crucial to that strangely ever belated issue of the bringing of \\"God's glory to earth\\", we know not when or how. In short, look no further than the \`Institutes' and institutions of Calvin, and how they open the way to twisting and perverting, and condemning of the sovereign gift of Christ (altruistic love), by less devout though no less benighted souls, to the narrowest and most selfish ends.Of course, a scholar of such magnitude as Weber hardly goes this far in impugning what appears to a cranky crackpot like myself as the root cause of much of the trouble in our world: the justification for ungoverned capitalist exploitation by the few \`elect'. But, ostensively, at least, his close analyses of the relevant texts tell. I begin at the end, with the justly noted conclusion of his of his argument:\\"The Puritan wanted to work in a calling; we are forced to do so. For when asceticism was carried out of the monastic cells into everyday life, and began to dominate worldly morality, it did its part in building the tremendous cosmos of the modern economic order. This order is now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production which to-day determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisition, with irresistible force. Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt. In Baxter's view the care for external goods should only lie on the shoulders of the \`saint like a light cloak which can be thrown aside at any moment'. But fate decreed that the cloak should become an iron cage.\\" (123)Weber carefully traces the transition from the contemplative detachment of Medieval Christian monasticism and mysticism, which at least preserved space for a vision of the Edenic enchantment of the world (although he's not real clear on how this concept meshed with the austerity of Christ's radical moral demands - for more see the brilliant work of his associate, Ernst Troeltsch), to the \`iron cage' of the lockstep, treadmill, Sodomic devaluation of the world in the early modern European mind.In what is for me one of the most revealing passages of the work, Weber lays bare the predicament with which the first Calvinists, such as those, who, having escaped the iniquitous Egypt of the Old World, and survived, most often racked with disease, starvation, and desperation, the uncertain crossing of the Red Sea, by shear force of will and faith in the beneficence of the Almighty, trod precipitously those fateful steps down the plank, their Bibles clutched at their breasts, to touch terra firma in a New and Promised Land, to stand at the edge of Eden, a pristine, magnificent wilderness, which, the handiwork of aeons, in a mere few centuries would be crushed, pulverized, and buried under billions of tonnage of concrete and garbage, patch-marked with every conceivable form of human filth and corruption by the inexorable weight of commitment to this false ideal of an undoubtedly true but unknown God, in utter, bewildering, undeniable terror.\\"In its extreme inhumanity this doctrine must above all have had one consequence for the life of a generation which surrendered to its magnificent consistency. That was a feeling of unprecedented inner loneliness of the single individual. In what was for the man of the age of the Reformation the most important thing in life, his eternal salvation, he was forced to follow his path alone to meet a destiny which had been decreed for him from eternity. No one could help him. No priest, for the chosen one can understand the word of God only in his own heart. No sacraments, for though the sacraments had been ordained by God for the increase of His glory, and must hence be scrupulously observed, they are not a means to the attainment of grace, but only the subjective externa subsidia of faith. No Church, for though it was held that externa ecclesiam nulla salus in the sense that whosoever kept away from the true Church could never belong to God's chosen band, nevertheless membership of the external Church included the doomed. They should belong to it and be subjected to its discipline, not in order thus to attain salvation, that is impossible, but because, for the glory of God, they too must be forced to obey His commandments. Finally, even no God. For even Christ had died only for the elect, for whose benefit God had decreed His martyrdom from eternity. (Calvin openly stated this assertion in a sermon given at Broek in 1609 and centrally implies it throughout his teaching) Thus, the complete elimination of salvation through the Church and the sacraments (which was in Lutheranism by no means developed to its final conclusions), was what formed the absolutely decisive difference from Catholicism.That great historic process in the development of religions, the elimination of magic from the world which had begun with the old Hebrew prophets and, in conjunction with Hellenistic scientific thought, had repudiated all magical means to salvation as superstition and sin, came here to its logical conclusion.\\" (60-61)To prove salvation, by earthly success, became the impetus for the disciplines which propelled the emergent capitalism to the dominant social form of Western civilization. All of our social forms must have an ethical basis and justification - to live rationally is to adhere to a moral code. This code Calvinism provided, eschewing the impulse to the universal love we find espoused in the later chapters of John, where the New Law, the New Dispensation is an unequivocal and unprecedented call to altruism, in favor of redeeming, once again, the strategy of \`divide and conquer' mightily prized by Caesar and the legions who would follow him.Again, Weber:\\"But in the course of its development Calvinism added something positive to this, the idea of the necessity of proving one's faith in worldly activity. Therein it gave the broader groups of religiously inclined people a positive incentive to asceticism. By founding its ethic on the doctrine of predestination, it substituted for the spiritual aristocracy of monks outside of and above the world the spiritual aristocracy of the predestined saints of God within the world. It was an aristocracy which, with its character indelebilis, was divided from the eternally damned remainder of humanity by a more impassable and in its invisibility more terrifying gulf, than separated the monk of the Middle Ages from the rest of the world about him, a gulf which penetrated all social relations with its sharp brutality. This consciousness of divine grace of the elect and holy was accompanied by an attitude toward the sin of one's neighbor, not of sympathetic understanding based on consciousness of one's own weakness, but of hatred and contempt for him as an enemy of God bearing the signs of eternal damnation.\\" (74-75)For those of you who read the reviews for help with term papers and such, I have given you what I esteem to be the essential passages - but, this book is one which categorically must be read, regardless of the work required - for your health, your understanding of the world today, your orientation, your survival.

He further discovered that in his country (Germany), Protestants tend to be wealthier and better educated than the Catholics because Protestants showed a special tendency to develop \\"economic rationalism\\"; that is, a particular approach to creating wealth that was less focused on the gain of comfort than on the pursuit of profit itself. The general outlook on life and work that the early protestants sects drew from their belief made them singularly well adapted to modern capitalism. They brought to it: (1). A desire for progress; (2). A love of hard work for its own sake; (3). Orderliness, punctuality and honesty; (4). Belief in a calling on proving one's faith in worldly activity; etc. In sum, Weber showed how character traits, strongly shaped by religion, could play a massive role in the creation of wealth."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"The Renaissance Classics version is absolutely ridden with typos and other formatting errors.

Overall, it was an excellent buying experience."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"While I was at a Big Ten university in the 90s I was taught that Weber was spot on. That was in my economics class (one of my minors). My history classes (one of majors) told me otherwise, and I found them to be more persuasive. Sociologists love Weber for his explanatory power, although most only assume Weber to be correct, being neither trained historians nor actually interested in Weber's theory beyond its popularity or (en vogue anti-Catholicism). After reading back on some of this I decided to write a quick review that outlines Weber's thesis along with some considerations about its validity.To summarize, (and correct me if I am wrong here), Weber asserts that only Christianity, and only the Protestant variety, provided the framework within which capitalism could flourish. Why? Because Protestant leaders, unlike Catholicism's ascetically inclined theologians, actually encouraged the accumulation of wealth. On the other hand, Protestant leaders also encourage a modest lifestyle, unlike the squanderous upper crust Catholics who had the wealth and spent it on lavish indulgence, thus failing to reinvest. So the saving and reinvesting of wealth, and the desire for more and more, were at the heart of the specifically Protestant, Northern European capitalist acceleration. There it is in a nutshell.The only problem with this thesis is, as I learned, that it isn't supported by the actual facts gained by actual research (which, if you know about Weber's strong anti-Catholicism, was very biased). The capitalist revolution preceded the Reformation by at least two hundred years in the city-republics of Italy and was spreading. Italy, you may recall, is the heart of the Roman Catholic stronghold; not many Protestants running about. Moreover, the whole notion of the reinvestment of capital was widespread in the monastic centers, albeit not always for personal gain (although more so than generally assumed).Something else that I find worth noting when reviewing Weber is the role of wealth within parts of Protestantism, and here he could also have done more with the research. Although not widely commented upon, a major motivation underlying much of the desire to accumulate wealth within Protestant circles stemmed from a desire to demonstrate to your neighbors that you were part of the elect. The doctrine of election is not unique to Protestantism, but one formulation of it is worth considering here. Believing God had predestined some to damnation and some to salvation before the creation of the world (Classical Calvinism), many asked, \\"How do I know I am part of the elect and therefore saved?\\" The answer would be developed in multiple ways, but one was, \\"God will bless you with material wealth.\\" So folks worked hard to show everyone else and themselves that they were part of the elect. Roman Catholicism does not have anything like this teaching. This is, incidentally, the root of the pernicious \`name it and claim it' school of televangelism where it seems that God wants everyone to pray the \`prayer of Jabez' or, more commonly, to send in $50.00 of good faith seed money to the guy in the gold-studded suit with a heavily made up wife at his side so that God will in turn cause your own wealth to multiply to the point of a cup running over. It's wired, but popular, and is one tangent of Weber's thesis that has borne itself out.For more, seeCRISIS OF THE 17TH CENTURY, THE,Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century, Vol. I: The Structure of Everyday Life (Civilization & Capitalism, 15th-18th Century)Medieval Economic Thought (Cambridge Medieval Textbooks),The Italian City Republics (4th Edition)and \\"The Beloved Myth: Protestantism and the Rise of Industrial Capitalism in Ninteenth-Century Europe\\" from 2001, Social Forces."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"It is a very poor edition, very hard to read. Mistakes of every kind in the print (for example, at the very first page Max Weber's name is not in capitals). Notes bigger than the text. There isn't the name of the publishing house and no translator. It might have been translated on google. This edition is definitely not worth the money."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"Max Weber's thesis that the Protestant work-ethic helped give rise to the spirit of modern capitalism is well known, but how true is it? Weber goes into an impressive review of historical details on how Luther's concept of the calling became the Calvinist concept of labor to glorify God, and finally the Puritan concept that is applied to business as well as anything else. In short, the Protestant hard-work ethic, intended to be a sign of election and to glorify god, inadvertently (at least in part) gave birth to the spirit of capitalism, of sustained, planned, methodical profit-making. Though capitalism is no longer dependent upon religion for maintaining its ethos (we are all caught in the rat race), it is fascinating how Weber makes a compelling case that a once anti-materialist Protestant Christianity came to affirm the capitalist spirit by way of a hard-working ethic. Many of Weber's themes are persuasive, if also controversial. Weber has by no means isolated the final or full cause of the take-off of capitalism in modern times, but he has made a good case for one contributing factor. Would that his style of writing had been a bit more direct - Weber's insights are at least worth careful reading."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"This is a very concise and succinct exploration of the role of four major branches of religious thought to come out of the Reformation: Lutheranism, Methodism, Anabaptist and Calvinism. His exploration of ascetism within these specific religious philosophies and their impact on capitalism is as insightful as I have ever read. Having personal and extensive experience amongst some of the reminant religious communities still functioning in North America, I must say his objectivity in a such a subjective subject makes for a lucid and enlightening read. If you do not have some background in Reformation and northern European history of this time, you may miss much of what he's trying to convey. He demonstrates that he is a true scholiast of this subject. Have your dictionary handy!!!"},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"A decisive intellectual victory over the numbing utilitarianism of the day -- as important now as it was a hundred years ago. In his masterpiece, Max Weber traces the development of the worldly Protestant ascetic spirit from its predecessor (medieval otherworldly asceticism) to its modern religious peak (Puritan social ethics) and beyond, to the current utilitarian economic thought (with no religious elements whatsoever).Weber also reveals the development of the spirit of capitalism as a tautologous paradigm of thought that has a long time ago abandoned its original religious motives, leaving behind only a system -- a ghost of a ghost -- that everyone must reproduce in order to survive. This is the \\"iron cage of [capitalistic] modernity\\" which we inhabit, and as Weber says, it will not be gone before \\"the last load of coal has been burned\\"... A chilling remark in retrospect, as we have now found out that the ever-growing global economy -- a growth for the sake of growth in both communist countries (especially China) and Western democracies -- is cooking up the Globe.I suggest you waste your money on this."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"In my youth I used to believe that Max Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism was the very last word in understanding, sociologically, the driving force behind capitalism in its prime. His premise, at least his expressed narrowly- defined one, that out of the mishmash of feudalism a \`new' man and a \`new' woman were being created who could subordinate their temporal desires enough to begin the tedious process of primitive capitalist accumulation that got the whole mode started, hit home hard to my young mind. Of course, that was not my conscious take on it at the time, although parts of it certainly were. What interested me the most wa that Weber was using some examples that were close to home, the Massachusetts Bay Colony experiment, and, being from Boston and steeped in Purtian history, that is why I was glad to get a copy of the work.Strangely, in recently re-reading the work I found that I was drawn by those same examples. Additionally, I was drawn by the huge set of footnotes at the end that I did not remember going through in my youth but offer some very interesting insights into how Weber put his argument together and the sources that he had available at the time and that he used. The re-reading poses this question, though. How does the work itself hold up?Of course today my class struggle perspective derived from a Marxist world view notes that Weber is clearly a political opponent. Not so much for his argument, which actually has a certain merit, but for his tenacious desire to use a quasi-Marxism materialist approach to sociology without drawing those requisite class struggle conclusions. I might add that the class struggle was fully raging in Germany at the time of the publication of this work as the Social Democratic Party was becoming the voice of the German working class. Weber, thus, really needed to keep his blinders on. Moreover, as a work of scholarship, which I will grant it certainly is, it is an early effort in the very long struggle to divorce sociological observations from any practical use. A militant today in order to benefit from reading this work has to do the equivalent of suspending disbelieve in the plot of a novel to realize that it is important to know what made capitalism tick in the old days and why we have to move on. Here, nevertheless is my very condensed take on the work today.In some place in 16th and 17th century Europe, the scope of Weber's study, individuals and small communities were breaking from the established churches, Roman Catholic and mainstream Protestant and creating, in some cases 'hit or miss', a culture that we today describe as secular but in the nature of those times had a religious connotation. That breakout, not without opposition and oppression by the constituted authorities, formed the nucleus of an ethic that made accumulation of wealth through hard work and thrift the norm-in short that private accumulation mentioned above. This, dear reader, was a historically progressive series of actions. In the year 2007 those traits have long since failed to be progressive. What is necessary, as Marx, Lenin, Trotsky and even someone like Che Guevara recognized is in the interest of social solidarity we need to create \`the new socialist man and woman' out of the muck and mire of capitalism. Hell, we need our own version of the Protestant ethic-and if current worldwide economic conditions are any judge- we need it pronto. Read this one at your leisure."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"Max Weber's seminal articles on the spirit (if not the origin) of capitalism, first issued in 1904 and 1905 and then jointly published around 1920, have stirred as much debate as any other sociological texts save Marx. Indeed, this is a work weighted with rep, not all of it deserved. In and of itself, \\"Protestant Ethic\\" perhaps does not date undamaged, but it does retain considerable power, conceptually and theoretically if not statistically. Of greatest concern to many readers today, particularly students caught in the web of a professor assigning the text, is the ability of the steward of a given edition to craft a package that can be readily assimilated.I give you: Talcott Parsons. Not only is Mr. Parsons a gifted translator (for this is a work which has frequently lost much in translation), he also has the presence of mind to give over the introduction to an equally gifted Weberian scholar. Mr. Anthony Giddens beautifully sets the table for the main course, the taste of which is much more pleasant (and identifiable) in the light of his prefacing. Now, scholars may wage wars over whether he sets the table correctly, but that's a debate for another forum. For our purposes here, this is as well-translated and accessible a package of this work as you're going to find. I certainly grasped it, well and enjoyably. And if I can, lord knows anyone can!"},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"While I cannot claim to be able to read this classic work in the original German, I share many of the other reviewers' frustrations with regard to Talcott Parson's English translation of it. First is all the passages from other authors which are left in the original French, Latin etc. and which the average anglophone reader today will be hard-pressed to decipher. Second is the shortage of explanatory notes pertaining to the various minutiae upon which Weber dwells. Contemporary readers can't be expected to know anything about Pietism, for example, so a few footnotes would have been helpful. Finally, there's the dated quality of Parsons' language which seems more redolent of the 19th century than the mid-20th. Every time he uses the word \\"to-day\\" complete with its archaic hyphen, it's hard not to be reminded of how musty this translation is and how the far the \\"to-day\\" he's writing about is removed from the \\"today\\" we live in.For all the above reasons I would be reluctant to assign this book to an undergraduate class. Surely there's someone out there willing to take a shot at a new, fresher rendering of this book for the 21st century and fix some of the shortcomings of this rather flawed translation."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"this book was somewhat difficult to get through because of the footnotes (i have trouble with footnotes), once you get that point though, it's a fantastic book. it discusses why the capitalist system we have now, and the morality we have now is the way it is. we have all heard of the protestant ethic yes? it is that you must work hard, without pleasuring yourself too much, for the sake of pleasing god. working as hard as you can allows a person to 'most effectively' utilize the gifts god has given them, but they cannot take pleasure in the fruits if this because too much pleasure would result in the breaking of some sin, greed or sloth or what have you, pretty much all of them can be connected i'm sure. but if you can't have fun with what you're working so hard to create, why work so hard? because you are pleasing god, setting yourself up for the next life if you will. well this is wonderful for a historical reference, but we're very much secularized in society today so why does any of this matter? well, weber contends that a man named calvin (yes calvinism) took the protestant ethic and tied it to capitalism. calvin took the protestant ethic, which was good because it got things done with little complaint from the workers, and connected it to the economic system by turning god into money. we can imagine the problems with this, if nothing else, there would be trouble behind the fact that what motivated people before was spiritual, and now we expect the same results because of different motivations. that's like using a car to float down a river instead of a boat. ya cars go forward wonderfully, on the medium they were designed for.so now we all ascetically put ourselves into our work towards the end of making more money. i'm not a history buff so i don't know if this is true or was just used as an example of how religion effected capitalism, but i don't really care as i can see the connections between the protesant ethic and our capitalist morality.weber calls where we are now the iron cage, kind of pessimistic, but he believes that now we're here, we're stuck here. we can't get out of the mental state we are in now, which i don't necessarily agree with, but can see how someone could. if you leave the economic system today, chances are you'll end up on the street. i think this is my favourite quote, it's right at the end of the book and sums up the final point quite well.\\"No one knows who will live in this cage in the future, or whether at the end of this tremendous development entirely new prophets will arise, or there will be a great rebirth of old ideas and ideals, or, if neither, mechanized petrification, embellished with a sort of convulsive self- importance. For the last stage of this cultural development, it might well be truly said: 'Specialists without spirit, sensualists without heart; this nullity imagines that it has attained a level of civilization never achieved before' \\"an eye opener to say the least, but a really good read."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"This book turns Marx on his head in that Marx regarded religion an ideology reflecting classes, Weber seems to be showing that capitalism itself was produced not by economic forces but by the influences of religious ideas. The drive of puritans to work out anxiety over their salvation or damnation, which was left in doubt by the theological doctrine of predestination. The predestined beliefs of the Protestants encouraged capitalism. Weber uses this to describe why capitalism emerged in the western world. Students of the conflict tradition should not miss this work."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"Weber's work is, among other things, a great example of what happens when research goes bad. His work is most significant to academia because it shows what can happen when a researcher mistakenly assumes a causal relationship between two variables that are simply coincidentally related. Religion and capitalism is an excellent example and a call to vigilance for all researchers. It is particularly pertinent to this study where it might be easy to conclude too hastily about relationships between a respondent's religious, ethnic backgrounds, political affiliation or knowledge and the respondent's opinions.It is now obvious the world that there is no link between Protestant religion and successful capitalism. Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia and other nations that do not have Protestant Christianity as the primary religion in the country have become economically powerful. Nonetheless Weber's classic must be read, both as an example of a great mind and to show how even a great scholar can be lead astray. It is a reminder to all people to think critically at all times. For what seems obviously correct at the time, might very well be proved to be absolutely invalid."},{"Title":"Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism","review":"I NEVER EVEN RECEIVED THE BOOK!!

As a political scientist, I cherish Weber solely for his definition of the state as having a &quot;monopoly of legitimate coercion&quot;. Having brilliant insights like this on a regular basis, however, apparently drove Weber further and further from sanity over the course of his life. The tragedy for Weber . . . well, he had many of them. He spent most of his life in the rubber room, and he didn't have a particularly happy marriage, based on the biography written by his wife Marianne. These Germans are not party animals, you know. They need to go to Club Med in the winter. These are the first examples of seasonal-affective disease; before they had those lamps. Don't laugh! I have one! I can't make it through the day without my lamp. If Weber were Marx, which he wasn't, although he really dug nudism. He liked all these young people doing it, including D.H.

The bond we develop with pets is as wonderful and rewarding as it is fascinating and practical.Some animals have an amazing capacity for loving us. Anyone who has ever loved a pet knows the very special magic they give us. Pets have become a basic part of our social evolution. Our natural role as steward is part of our basic human need to love and be loved. People who do not have companion animals have no idea what they are missing!Many people are lonely and need to have pets to take the place of family located far away. The bonding is essential medicine for the owner. When a pet dies, it is normal for us to grieve and suffer a unique sense of bereavement. After the initial stages of mourning, we realize that the deeply personal spiritual aspects of the bond remain unbroken. Many of us feel compelled to find a replacement, as we need to go on loving others.Sometimes it makes good sense to get another pet before the older one dies. If the older animal accepts the presence of a younger interloper, things settle down and harmony can exist. There will be another cat to love and care for, and help to buffer some of the sorrow. I tried this, as Star is thirteen plus years now (I've had her since she was born), but she absolutely refused to be in the same room with the little boy kitten.The loss of a pet is a terrible experience but it feels worse when the cat just disappears. Comet, Star's father, did just that. The grieving stages feel unending, and Dr. Sife recommends \\"conscious repression of the feelings and bad memories\\" as to \\"reconcile a problem, it seems to be the only release from endless anguish.\\" Not knowing what happened means you can find no closure. Animals know when something is going to happen from the tension the owner has. I had to let the little one go, not just because Star would not accept him, but he needed the freedom to roam, as all tomcats do, and our small apartment was just not big enough for both to be a bother to each other. After only a month, there was a bond built up between us, but for the sake of sanity he had to go. I spent days of walking around the area trying to find him, but now I think perhaps he will be our 'ghost' kitty forevermore.This book is full of pictures of monuments and unique gravestone for loved pets. Ligeia was poisoned when she was seven years old, half Star's age, and it was as if a child had died. Tosca, my medicine cat, lived to a ripe old age of 19 years, but I had no way to go see her anymore and she just flat gave up as her arthritis got the best of her.

It let you know that innumerable other humans share similar feelings of grief and/or guilt at the loss of their pets, even though our society still mainly frowns on overt or prolonged displays of sorrow over the loss of anybody but another human being. The book was good about going through the Kubler-Ross stages of grief and applying them to pet loss situations. However, our situation involved huge guilt feelings, which this book didn't devote as much time too as might have helped us more - that's where our pet bereavement counseling sessions came in - yes, counselors are out there and trained for just these kinds of situations.

He thoroughly explains the stages of grief that we go through, and helps us understand why we feel as we do going through them. It is easier to process our grief when we understand that we are normal in every strange feeling that comes over us, and that those feelings are temporary, and that we are not alone in our terrible pain. The human/animal bond is unique, as is the bereavement. This book also illustrates how deep a love can be between a human and a beloved animal companion, and because of the pure relationship that is shared every day, the loss can be much more painful than losing a human loved one.

He was the 2nd pet I had to send to Rainbow Bridge, the first being in 2007. But we had been through a lot together. So much of what Sife said rang true and to my very core. For the first time since George crossed the Bridge, I have felt a sense of resolution and peace. And yes, I KNOW I will see all my sweet fur kids again!"},{"Title":"The Loss of a Pet","review":"I received my copy yesterday and immediately sat down and read the whole book. It's been a month since I lost my companion of 14 years. I fortunately hit the resolution stage 2 days ago as Dr. Sife refers to it, and it feels peaceful against the context of the extreme suffering that I was experiencing. As he says, if you are buying this book then you are undoubtedly suffering horribly. I would recommend this book, and I would recommend that if you haven't reached the resolution stage and are still in deep suffering, that you read the book over and over, again and again until you finally reach the peace of mind of knowing that it is ok to let go of the suffering and the hurt and the rage and the sense of loss and emptiness. That it is ok to let go of the pain and tell your best friend how special they were to you, but that it's time for you to leave this suffering state and go on by yourself but forever carrying their loving memories in your heart. I'm not saying the book itself will get you there, but it will at least allow you to perhaps think for just a minute that there will be a day when you aren't going to be suffering. It will help you validate your feelings of just how hard the death has been on you and that you aren't losing your mind. It will still be a lonely journey to get through."},{"Title":"The Loss of a Pet","review":"WHEN I LOST MY BELOVED COMPANION DOG RECENTLY I WENT TO GRIEF COUNSELING, HEALERS, READ EVERY WEBSITE AND JUST FELT NO ONE UNDERSTOOD, AND THAT NO ONE COULD FEEL THE WAY I DO IN THE EXTREMITY OF GRIEF.

SO OVER ALL THE BOOKS I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU GET THIS ONE.ONE POINT I LOVED IS THE GREATER YOUR LOVE THE GREATER YOUR GRIEF~ that says it all for me."},{"Title":"The Loss of a Pet","review":"Having recently lost my Doberman of 12 years, I went looking for a good book that would help me cope and understand the grief I was experiencing. My search ended here.Wallace Sife's book, \\"The Loss Of A Pet\\" covers all the areas a person will go through when grieving for a pet. The grieving process consists of many levels including shock and disbelief, anger, denial, guilt, depression and finally resolution. The author guides you through each one of these and explains each one to help the individual realize this is a normal thing for humans to experience.A couple of other areas of interest would be on euthanasia. When is the right time and what to look for?? Basically the quality of life. No loving pet owner would want to see their beloved animal suffer needlessly. It's a big step but a very humane thing to do. There also is a chapter on how to explain the death of a pet to children of varies ages.The last few chapters offer some options concerning the final arrangements and supportive counseling. Deciding what to do with the remains is up to the individual---to bury or to have cremated. It is whatever is comfortable for each and every one of us. Most of us will need some kind of support either from family,friends or maybe a grief counseler. There is nothing to be ashamed of when it comes to your feelings. You have just lost a family member. It takes time for the sting to ease.Wallace Sife also has an excellent website--[...].org for more information and support. They have an online chat for pet loss that I found very helpful. You are in the company of fellow pet lovers who know how you feel and are there to help. This may be a easier option when dealing with grief than talking to someone face to face. Not everyone you encounter will understand or want to. So seek help among some new online friends. Also consider writing a journal to express your feelings to your pet. Very good therapy.One final note. I have lost family members over the years and had to deal with grief before. This was the first time I have felt this strongly about a pet who I loved and adored. In return, I received the same from my dog. I wasn't sure if the same techniques I used before would help me this time, so I bought the book. Most areas are the same but on a differnt kind of level. A human-animal level. This book will open those doors that you need to open to find peace within yourself and to carry the love you once had for your pet forward for years to come."},{"Title":"The Loss of a Pet","review":"I would highly recommend this book. One of my friends gave it to me when one of my dogs passed. I found it very helpful. I purchased this book to help one of my friend's through the grieving process after losing her beloved pooch."},{"Title":"The Loss of a Pet","review":"Dr. Sife, is a wonderful man full of compassion. love and knowledge and heartfelt feelings for the Loss of a Pet. To read his book, is to know his heart and soul for he, has experienced the same in that we all bond and unify with our animals. God Bless you Dr. Sife!"},{"Title":"The Loss of a Pet","review":"I highly recommend this book for anyone grieving the death of a beloved pet. Dr. Sife gives very helpful information about the grieving process, and most important, reassurance that the pain one feels is very real, and not to be dismissed by anyone. Very well-written, insightful, with numerous photos. I would have been lost without this book."},{"Title":"The Loss of a Pet","review":"I have read many, many books on pet bereavement and loss and I have to say that I'm a little disappointed with Mr. Sife's book. It reads like a monotonous textbook and lacks feeling. I've read other pet bereavement books where warmth and understanding are felt, right from page one, but this book is not like that. There are other pet bereavement books out there that are much more helpful."},{"Title":"The Loss of a Pet","review":"Dr. Sife has found the courage in his work, to allow us to boldly go through all of the emotions of grief - as is usually applied to the loss of a human - in the loss of a beloved animal friend. Our relationships with animals are often so intense that, if we are honest with ourselves, we find that they are often the beings we trust unconditionally with our secrets and our souls. This book gives the reader permission to grieve, a guided path down the road through the grief process, and skills to lead them to the healing process. He does not take these losses lightly - but rather helps the survivor understand their powerful grief. Through this work I have come to understand that the loss of a pet is significant, and can be life altering. I thank Dr. Sife for helping me to find the space and the human contact (counselors and support groups are listed in the book) through which I came to understand that this loss is not to be taken lightly. Buy this book for yourself, or for a friend who has had a loss of this kind. You may never know how much that friend may need it because pet bereavement is not something everyone allows themselves to show. You may be helping a soul to heal."},{"Title":"The Loss of a Pet","review":"After reading several pet loss books, this was the first that really helped me understand the absolute devastation I was experiencing over loss of my beloved companions."},{"Title":"The Loss of a Pet","review":"No one should experience the loss of a pet without this book to guide and comfort them throughout the grieving process. Dr Sife speaks to the mourning pet lover with a gentle, conversational tone that reads easily and does much to heal the soul.I was disconsolate after the loss of my Great Dane and this book helped me understand what I was feeling and why. If you love someone who has lost a pet, get them this book. I am donating several copies to my vets office in the name of my dog."},{"Title":"The Loss of a Pet","review":"I agree the book contains some useful information. But the author clumsily and repetitively makes the point that 'normal' pet grief should last just a few weeks, for people with other issues the loss of a pet may be \\"the straw that broke the camel's back\\", and for lonely people dependent on their pets, the loss can be a \\"disaster\\". He repeatedly advises that these people seek other counseling. That pet loss counseling won't help them.I can't imagine there exists a single adult human in the world without baggage, regrets, unresolved grief of some kind. Of course a new loss brings up past matters. Of course grief can be a complex affair. And of course there are vast numbers of lonely people in the world. The author seems to have a fantasy of being able to treat perfectly healthy humans through a few weeks of grief.If you are in the vulnerable state of grief, you deserve to be treated more gently and thoughtfully. And if you do need extra counseling to cope with any the past issues a new loss brings up, you deserve to be positively encouraged to do so, not told that you are an impending disaster when you are so fragile.The suggestions at the end contain some useful coping strategies, but they include the consideration of a job change or move. This is inexplicable."},{"Title":"The Loss of a Pet","review":"After the death of our beloved dog-child Ruffy, this was the only book on pet grief I could find at my bookstore. My heart was, and still is,bleeding and I took it home and devoured it in a matter of days. It is written more to those who counsel the grieving in my opinion and did not minister to my pain. It is too technical and black and white. I felt it left out heartfelt emotion and soul. I am still searching for a book to touch my heart."},{"Title":"The Loss of a Pet","review":"I have to admit that this is one of the better books out there on pet loss however it is very clinical. When you're in a bunch of pain that clinical tone is a bit too impersonal and doesn't convey a whole lot of empathy. In fact the book contains several examples of case studies of pet owners who were too attached to their pets and needed counseling. The part that was the most helpful to me was the suggestions on what to do to feel better, there's a list offered towards the end of the book. One suggestion was writing down remote memories that seem to surge in the days immediately after the death of your pet. The chapter on feeling angry was a good kick in the pants. It's a good book but it has more of a tough love approach. I didn't feel a whole lot of comfort reading it but it did have some solid suggestions that helped. It's kind of practical. It is very informational talks about a lot of issues and practical stuff like pet cemetaries, counseling, etc. Author does have a few soap boxes."},{"Title":"The Loss of a Pet","review":"There are many books on what I term \\"grief relief\\", which take the reader through the many stages or phases of grief. I have never reviewed any that were not good, but Wallace's book is a very good book that I can recommend. Having talked with Wallace on several occasions years ago on his philosophy of healing, I can attest to the fact that he cares about people and that his work reflects that. You have only to read the reviews of those who needed his help to see they received it. This book is a good source of help."},{"Title":"The Loss of a Pet","review":"An excellent book for those who have lost a beloved animal companion and are trying to deal with their grief. Dr. Sife offers insight and understanding of the profound grief experienced by the pet owner. Just knowing one is not alone in their feelings is a tremendous help. An excellent, unique book."},{"Title":"The Loss of a Pet","review":"This book was THE seminal text on Pet Loss and Bereavement. Dr. Wallace Sife wrote this book out of empathy for people who suffered at the loss of their pets, after he lost his beloved dog, Edelmeister, and could not find any comfort himself. For those who find this text \\"cold\\", you should go to his Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement site and read his many articles. He is a hugely warm and generous person, and he is an academic. This book was well received only because it SOUNDED legitimate and had the ring of a professional text. At the time that he wrote this book, there was nothing out there that he could find. He was smart to take an academic look at the subject, as this topic was roundly dismissed by people as silly. \\"Just get another dog\\" or \\"It's only a cat\\" were what you heard when you showed grief. Especially in the context of the times, it was the perfect approach. Because of Wally Sife, there is a plethora of books on the subject in stores. Because of him, there are books for those who want a more emotional approach and books for those who want an academic approach. Because of Wally Sife, you don't get laughed at for loving animals enough to really suffer when they die."},{"Title":"The Loss of a Pet","review":"I am a professional in the Mental Health field and found Dr. Sife's book to be an invaluable resource both for personal recovery and professional training.

I love the author's writing style and the gentle but to-the-point information he shares with his readers. You can tell that he knows how this kind of grief feels and the impact it has on a life. One part of my grief that I never expected to have was guilt. I was so relieved to find an entire chapter dedicated to this subject and it helped me enormously. I have recommended this book to friends and they too, have had the same positive reaction to it's content. I didn't realize that this kind of grief would affect so many parts of my life.

Thank you Dr. Sife for your wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Loss of a Pet","review":"From Publisher's Weekly: If you snicker at the notion of a book devoted to pet bereavement, consider that that very lack of sympathy may have brought the book into being. Sife, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based psychotherapist and the founder of the Association for Pet Bereavement, addresses the pet owner whose grief at a pet's death is largely misunderstood or even ridiculed by friends, associates and society in general. Although his topic easily lends itself to touchy-feely disquisitions, Sife is to be commended for offering information that is not only compassionate but concise, wide-ranging and, above all, practical. For example, he defines stages of grieving, interpolating case studies to demonstrate those instances where expressions of mourning mask deeper problems. He composes dignified rejoinders to those who launch a \`\`perceived assault'' on the reader's grief; explains why the rupture of a human-animal bond can be so devastating; offers specific techniques for dealing with anger; explores the special needs of children whose pets die; presents various factors involved in considering euthanasia, including such particulars as whether or not it is beneficial to remain with the pet until its final breath; and polls leaders of various religions. A superb contribution to a growing field. (May)"},{"Title":"The Loss of a Pet","review":"Three weeks ago, we lost our 8-year old Boxer, Taylor, to Lymphosarcoma. We took her to the very best Oncologists(several of them), spent thousands of dollars in trying to keep her with us for as long as possible, but in the end we knew it was time for us to let go.Not having children, the pain of losing such a loving animal was beyond my expectation of grief. When I researched the list of books on pet loss, I was looking for facts on how to deal with this agony and pain. Dr. Sife's introduction and chapters on this subject matter was a validation that what me and my husband were feeling and going through were normal.Dr. Sife's case histories throughout the book were very helpful in applying what other people have experienced and what we were going through.For anyone who has recently lost a pet and is looking for some insight on the feelings they are experiencing, I highly recommend this book. He is very factual. If you are looking for a spiritual or religious aspect, this is not the book.

I just lost my beloved pit bull mix to osteosarcoma and after reading in this book for the third time the implication that people who get too emotionally attached to their pets are somehow less than mentally healthy, it was just too much to take. I happen to love my pets. More than a lot of humans I know. Pets don't judge, they are always there for you and never let you down. So I'm crazy because of this? Or less than what the author deems 'normal'?? That's a ridiculous assumption.

Not only did it give me a practical understanding of what I was going through, but more importantly, I got to stop crying for a few hours while I read it.Call it \\"tough love\\" if you want.

The first two editions kept winning awards and rave reviews, but Dr. Sife has pulled a rabbit out of a hat with this revised and expanded Third Edition. As a result it is by far, the best-selling book on the subject. Dr. Sife has been acclaimed as the leading authority in this field, and was the founder/president of The Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement: www.aplb.org. This Third Edition is completely revised, and also contains 56 additional pages of wisdom and practical advice, based on his experience with over 18,000 bereaving pet owners, since he founded the APLB. It is all in this book! But some readers may feel let down when he informs them that prolonged grief is almost always a side-effect of other personal repressed problems, triggered by the death of a beloved pet. He wisely points out that in such cases the bereaver should also be working with a professional therapist, to address these problems. This wonderful book is analytical, but not \\"clinical\\" as some have claimed. And it is written with a wisdom and compassion that is truly a gift to the open-minded reader.Perhaps Sife's philosophy can be summed up by his statement. \\"Life is a wonderful transition we can barely understand. Yet there is a lesson here that our beloved deceased companion animals can help us learn - in salute to their memory. A joyful celebration of that life is our best memorial and tribute. We are not victims, but celebrants. And by achieving this we now honor them, and enrich ourselves, as well.\\""},{"Title":"The Loss of a Pet","review":"I was extremely disappointed in the treatment of pet loss bereavement in this book. Among other things, the author suggests that there is a specified &quot;appropriate&quot; mouring period after the loss of a pet. He seems incredibly judgmental of anyone who isn't &quot;over it&quot; in 3 weeks' time. This is a major turn-off.In addition, I found the book full of insincere platitudes. The author's biases are more than apparent, yet he does not own them as personal opinion or perspective; he presents everything he writes as &quot;truth.&quot; Personally, I am leary of authors who do this. In spite of that, I read the whole book, and was disappointed at my own misjudgment, at having wasted me time."},{"Title":"Sex, Food, and God: Breaking Free from Temptations, Compulsions, and Addictions","review":"Dr. Eckman does a wonderful job of uncovering what is happening under the surface when it comes to all types of addiction.

A high-profile job - along with a fabulous new promotion - gorgeous clothes, parties filled to the brim with celebrities...face it, she's on a permanent winning streak. Then there's Jake. Jake is a handsome guy, making ends meet as a janitor, as he tries to boost his career as a music mogul. The problem? The band that he's managing is bound to break-up - unless he helps them launch themselves into the industry. But no matter how hard Jake tries to better himself, nothing ever seems to pan out. But that all changes when Jake crashes Ashley's celebrity bash, and the two of them share an electrically-charged, passionate kiss. One that leads Ashley to believe that she's just hit luck in love. But then the stranger - Jake - disappears, and suddenly Ashley's heel breaks, her skirt rips, and she's carted off to jail. Whereas Jake's bad luck has suddenly changed to good. Now, Ashley must find the mysterious, handsome stranger, and exchange one last kiss with him, in an attempt to win back her luck, even if it means leaving behind a potential boyfriend.I have a tendency to purchase movie novelizations of films that I want to see, in an attempt to \\"find out\\" what they're all about, before the film hits the big screen. With JUST MY LUCK - adapted by Laurie Calkhoven - I have struck gold, for the premise is adorable, and the plot is fast-paced and cute. Ashley is a fantastic character, who thinks that luck will follow her wherever she goes, no matter what; while Jake is the adorable Prince-in-training, looking to accumulate any luck he can get - no matter how little. These two characters play off of each other extremely well, and give the reader a view of two personalities - grateful and ungrateful. A fun, quick read, that you'll be lucky to get your hands on.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"The Midlife Miracle Diet: When Your Diet Doesn't Work Anymore","review":"The Midlife Miracle Diet is according to the author a method where you can take back control of your eating habits, lose weight and become healthier.The diet has 4 basic steps. First you achieve BASIC BALANCE by cutting back your carbohydrate intake. Next you go to CARB CAREFUL where you further cut back on carbs. You also add SUPPLEMENTS that will help you balance your blood sugar and you add EXERCISE.There are many good ideas throughout the book. Adele tells you never to get hungry so your blood sugar will stay on keel. She recommends hard chews (like an apple) and soft chews (like tangerines) to satisfy your hunger needs. Adele includes food choices to select from that will help you stay in control.Unlike other low carbohydrate diets where you suddenly go from eating what is normal for you to eating low carbs, in this diet, according to Adele, the transition is gradual. The first step Basic Balance removes many carbs but in a gentle way. The next step Carb Careful removes more when you are ready. Personally, I did not see a large difference in the two steps. For example in Carb Careful she suggests removing cereal and grains from your breakfast meal, but then includes bread in the menu plan.Menu plans are included for both Carb Careful and Basic Balance.These may get you in balance and in control of your food but they are pretty stringent. In one example, a client of hers, eats a handful of string beans with other veggies several times a day and portions of protein, with a tiny amount of grain and fat included. The menu plans to me were pretty joyless. There was no mention of wine or chocolate, fat free cheeses were used, etc. Can you eat this way for life?One of the reasons that low carbohydrate dieting can be so successful is that the fats in the diet are so satisfying. They add a richness that helps make up for the lack of carbohydrates we are used to. Adele does not mention fat much in her book. A menu might have a tad of olive oil or a bit of cheese but not much more. I feel many folks will not be satisfied eating both low carbohydrate and low fat. And recent studies have shown that good fats are good for you to eat. So she could have included more of these in the sample plans and at the very least more information on how to treat fat in your diet.Another area Adele discusses in depth is supplementation. She makes suggestions for different nutrients and explains what they can do to help you. She also sells these nutrients at her website and to her credit does not push her own products at all.Exercise is also covered. She discusses how it can really help your insulin. One suggestion she gives as an exercise choice is TY BO. It made me wonder how quickly the book was put together as the correct spelling is TAE BO. With the lack of information on fats and the obvious spelling error, I wondered if perhaps the book was put out fast.I think alot of Adele Puhn's warmth and regard for her clients comes through in the book. But I think with the stringent eating plan and lack of thorough information on how to treat fats in the diet many people will be disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"The Midlife Miracle Diet: When Your Diet Doesn't Work Anymore","review":"Adele's book has been so helpful. Following her plan, it has been easy to reduce the amount of carbs in my diet. And I don't even miss them, which is a miracle. With some planning ahead, I always have the right snacks to keep me on track. I feel satisfied and do not miss eating what is not good for me. I do not feel deprived.It has made such a difference in the way I feel. I am so much more energetic -- which helps me exercise more. My cholestrol and blood pressure are going down. I sleep better and no longer have headaches. After many years of yo-yo dieting, I feel I have found the program that works for me.Thanks, Adele."},{"Title":"The Midlife Miracle Diet: When Your Diet Doesn't Work Anymore","review":"Adele Puhn goes directly to the heart of the matter. How could so many intelligent, well-read people, people who care about their health, care about their looks, keep getting fatter and fatter?Blaming this syndrome, often the precursor to Type 2 diabetes, on a metabolic mix-up, Puhn lists foods, supplements, eating plans, all of which are low carb and the combination of which make you feel, at least in my case, like your &quot;old self&quot; again.Very few people who don't have the problem themselves understand, as does Puhn, how awful you can feel when the metabolism is out of whack. Constant hunger and weakness, headaches, cravings--all signs of systemic imbalance--can lead to destructive overeating and weight gain. One feels in the throes of something uncontrollable.I've only been on the plan a few weeks and am feeling in control and fit. I've tried other plans that hint at what Puhn spells out directly and am ever grateful to her for her thorough directives. The supplements she advises really help.An avid golfer, I'm not running out of steam by the eleventh hole and am as careful about my snacks as if my life depended on it.And I bet it really does!"},{"Title":"The Midlife Miracle Diet: When Your Diet Doesn't Work Anymore","review":"An informative, well organized, and clearly written book. I found her suggestions, menu plans, and nutritious recipes all user-friendly. She understands the challenges of mid-life and respects our busy life style. Ms. Puhn has obviously done her homework. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to feel better, have more energy and focus, and regain some control of your weight!"},{"Title":"The Midlife Miracle Diet: When Your Diet Doesn't Work Anymore","review":"This book helped me understand what I had been doing wrong all along when it came to dieting. Adele Puhn teaches you how to balance food intake and exercises to achieve your ultimate goal of losing weight.What's great about her advice is that she doesn't make you quit those carbs cold turkey. You learn to do it gradually where eventually you get to a stage where you don't miss them as much as you thought you would.Thanks to this book I have lost 20 lbs. and have learned how to keep them off. I enjoyed reading it and have recommended it to many of my friends with similar struggles of the bulge."},{"Title":"The Midlife Miracle Diet: When Your Diet Doesn't Work Anymore","review":"This book was a wake up call for me. I first found it at the local library. I enjoyed it so much I bought it to be able read it over and over and remember that it is my choice to live healthy."},{"Title":"The Midlife Miracle Diet: When Your Diet Doesn't Work Anymore","review":"I found this book to be both useful and inspiring. I recommend it for anyone who has ever had food cravings. Adele Puhn talks to you like a good friend who knows about the food traps that make you feel bad physically and mentally, and leave you with unwanted weight. She privides practical information that is organized in a way that is easy to use.She conveys a depth of knowledge and spirited enthusiasm which make her suggestions compelling to read and easy to follow."},{"Title":"The Midlife Miracle Diet: When Your Diet Doesn't Work Anymore","review":"It is very informative and I am just getting used to the plan. Expect to do better on it once I don't have to keep checking the book."},{"Title":"The Midlife Miracle Diet: When Your Diet Doesn't Work Anymore","review":"I love this diet! I couldn't lose weight on my regular diet anymore, so I tried this one and it's working great! I love Adele Puhn's enthusiasm and professionalism."},{"Title":"The Midlife Miracle Diet: When Your Diet Doesn't Work Anymore","review":"It is incredible how this low glicemic diet can do instantly in my body and my mind, I don't feel tired, and my sugar and carb cravings are almost gone since the very first day. Finally I know that I am going to loose weight."},{"Title":"The Midlife Miracle Diet: When Your Diet Doesn't Work Anymore","review":"This is a commonsense book that does make sense. It's a quick read, too."},{"Title":"The Midlife Miracle Diet: When Your Diet Doesn't Work Anymore","review":"I received the Midlife Miracle Diet, very quickly after ordering it...(Just haven't had the chance to finish reading it yet).I purchased Adele Puhn's 5 Day Miracle Diet, in 1995 and Loved it...So I am hoping to get the same results with this book. :O)\\"I'm giving it a two star\\" at this time, (to be able to submit my review) as I have not completed the book."},{"Title":"The Midlife Miracle Diet: When Your Diet Doesn't Work Anymore","review":"What a joy it was reading this infomative bit of eatable literature. The way to balance eating habits makes perfect sense. A great look see!!"},{"Title":"The Poetics of Manhood: Contest and Identity in a Cretan Mountain Village","review":"Ever since I became interested in Greece I have been reading books that I would not otherwise have bothered with and some of them have widened my horizons and deepened my understanding (of things in general) to an extent I would not have expected. This book by Herzfeld is one such work. Its rather peculiar title contains a number of words whose meaning has to be worked out early on. Poetics has nothing to do with poetry. It refers to the way people work out value and meaning in their everyday lives. Contest, etymologically, has a connection to male reproductive organs and therefore to the ways males relate to each other, which is usually by fighting -- at least in traditional or primitive societies. Yeah, heroism, bravery, cunning, violence, ruthlessness and all those qualities held in such high esteem by the writer of the Homeric poems.The name Glendi (the village in Crete where the author carried out the field work on which the book is based) is a fictional invention of the author himself but the rest is real-life data and careful scientific analysis.Most of the data is concerned with animal thievery and the rhetoric that accompanies it after the fact. The rhetoric shows how the Glendiot men structure meaning. Meaning is the way people constellate mental images relative to each other in the collective consciousness, and value is the relative measure of psychic energy it takes to keep an image constellated. A poetics shows how people map their values onto their everyday activities. In the present case this involves the activities, verbal and non-verbal, one carries out in the process of identifying himself as a man. (I hope I am not over-simplifying.)This is not any easy book by any means. The reader has to do a little work. But the rewards are enormous. A first-rate study."},{"Title":"How to Deal With Parents Who Are Angry, Troubled, Afraid, or Just Plain Crazy","review":"This book contains so many helpful ideas that it ought to be required reading in teacher education courses. One of the biggest problems new teachers have is learning how to deal with parents of all stripes. New teachers ought to have a book like this at home or at school for ready reference.In my own courses for teachers, I cover information that McEwan describes so effectively in her book. She's been there, done that, and new teachers can benefit from her experiences. It is well written, practical, and to the point with many wonderful examples. A worthwhile investment by any account."},{"Title":"How to Deal With Parents Who Are Angry, Troubled, Afraid, or Just Plain Crazy","review":"This book is fantastic! It breaks the issues down as to why parents are angry, troubled, afraid or just plain crazy, what staff does to cause it, and solutions for each. I would highly recommend this book to all school staff that work with parents on a regular basis!"},{"Title":"How to Deal With Parents Who Are Angry, Troubled, Afraid, or Just Plain Crazy","review":"I enjoyed the book thoroughly. The author has a great sense of humor, which makes the book an easy read. I liked how the author pointed out the frustrations parents have with schools and teachers, as well as pointed out the different types of parents teachers and principals have to communicate with. There are tips on how to deal with angry, troubled, afraid, or just plain crazy parents, as well as tips on how to make your school more open to parents. Communication is the key in this book, and the more communication parents have about what is going on, on campus, the better the culture at the school will be. I also liked the back of the book that has a section for staff development. I think the reason many teachers avoid talking to parents is because they don't always know the right way to approach parents. The reason I could not give the book a perfect \\"5\\" is because I would of preferred a chapter specifically on examples of the \\"situations\\" and the different things that could be said in these situations. Listing the ways to handle a parent is great, but I also need several examples to help me practice."},{"Title":"How to Deal With Parents Who Are Angry, Troubled, Afraid, or Just Plain Crazy","review":"I was required to read and review a book during a summer class I took for my Education degree. I choose this one because the title looked interesting, to my pleasure the whole book was also interesting. The author has a great sense of humor, I guess you have to when you've worked in education any length of time. She uses that humor to address many of the day-to-day situations teachers and administrative staff must deal with. Having worked in Early Childhood Education for a number of years, I found myself wishing I had read the book sooner. To my amusement/horror I discovered I too had been one of the \\"crazy parents\\" once, when calling my daughters school, and the principal had implemented one of the very strategies in the book on ME! Needless to say, it worked and I calmed down. I recently bought the Kindle version so I could easily reference it as needed, now that I am in the classroom as a teacher."},{"Title":"How to Deal With Parents Who Are Angry, Troubled, Afraid, or Just Plain Crazy","review":"I think that this book is a good read for anyone who has intentions of going into School Administration. It is important because it gives good examples of how to deal with parents who make lives difficult."},{"Title":"How to Deal With Parents Who Are Angry, Troubled, Afraid, or Just Plain Crazy","review":"This book is fantastic! She deals with many problems which face teacher relationships with parents. I highly recommend it to all teachers, especially new teachers!"},{"Title":"How to Deal With Parents Who Are Angry, Troubled, Afraid, or Just Plain Crazy","review":"The book haas some great advice and insight as do other books I have read on the subject. When I received the book I was a bit shocked as the price tag being $61.95 and the book itself is abut 7 inches in length and five inches wide with 169 pages total. I read this book during my lunch. While the author included some nice tools to measure your school's climate oroverall health, I felt the book was seriously over priced. I can't get past the dollars I paid for this book. I would loan it out but not recommend anyone purchasing the books for such a price."},{"Title":"How to Deal With Parents Who Are Angry, Troubled, Afraid, or Just Plain Crazy","review":"I find the term \\"helicopter parent\\" insulting. As a doctor, and the father of a son with dyslexia and LD, I am sure that I have been called a \\"helicopter parent\\" in teachers' lounges and administration offices, but for all the teachers out there, try to imagine what YOU would do if your child was falling more and more behind and the school seemed unable or unwilling to address their needs.What would you do if your child had dyslexia, couldn't spell, and then was told the solution was to make him or her \\"spelling exempt\\" rather than place your child in an Orton-Gillingham based instructional curriculum that would help them. What would you do if you were told year after year \\"oh, just give it time, they will grow out of it.\\"If this happened to you, YOU would become the \\"helicopter parent\\" or the \\"crazy parent\\" which just means that you were a fierce advocate for your child and wouldn't take no for an answer. If I wrote a book about \\"helicopter patients\\" I ought to be drummed out of the medical profession.Oh, and by the way, in my school district in Sackets Harbor, NY, they spend $14,217 per pupil and 45% of 8th graders FAIL to show basic proficiency on the NY State ELA exams. If more parents knew that, there would be \\"helicopter parents\\" landing on our superintendents front yard.David Smith, MDSackets Harbor, NYFounder, READ (Reading Experts and Advocates for Dyslexia)Member, United New Yorkers for Choice in Education\\"A Union of Parents\\""},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"What makes Wanda Sykes so incredibly funny is that she is so incredibly smart! She is a terrific blend of \\"street\\" savvy and insightful, sophisticated intellectual. She really knows what's going on in so many arenas. She defies stereotypes, and clearly comfortable in her skin. She takes on sexual topics without being disgustingly filthy like many other black commediennes. She's politically savvy, and hopefully gets people to think critically about some of the foolishness they are being fed by leaders and the media. And I can't understnad why Bill Maher hasn't had her on his show!"},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"There were laughs in the book. Overall I was disappointed that so much of it was recycled from her stand up shows. If she is going to expect people to lay down money for a book, the least she could do is come up with some new material. As it is, the book is barely 200 pages and a good number of them are blank except for a section number. Her rants on politics were not funny."},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"I really love Wanda. I'm sure what I'm about to write won't differ too much from other reviews, because unfortunately what I'm about to say and what others have said is the truth. She isn't as funny on paper as she is on stage or tv. I love her points of view on all subject matter in the book - dating, football etc, and I can just imagine hearing her say all this 'in person', so for me, that's what's funny about the book. I give it only four stars instead of five because it needs to be an audio cassette version to make it go from funny to totally hillarious."},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"I have to disagree with those who say that the book isn't funny because you have to HEAR Wanda to appreciate it. If you HAVE heard her, that's all you need to appreciate this book. I HEARD her while I was reading it! I've gotten some strange looks while laughing out loud as I read. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who \\"knows\\" Wanda. I cannot imagine what a reviewer who is offended would expect! It's pure Wanda---Yeah, I Said It---and she did!"},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"Many people have said that this book has great material but it lacks Wanda Sykes hilarous voice. I disagree. This book, to me, proves that it's not just how she says her jokes that make them funny. There are times of this book that you wont believe what your reading, such as the part where she says that she doesnt care if you actually read the book because she already has your money. My biggest complaint is that when I was reading some parts of this book, I realized that I had already heard the same exact jokes somewhere else: the Toung Untied DVD. Thats the only reason I gave this book 4 stars and not 5. If you havent seen the DVD, it's very funny material. If you have, you should still read this because [I think] it's not all used material."},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"Wanda rocks so why wouldn't her book be the best. Get it and you will not be dissapointed. Get one for grandma too! She will jump out of her stockings!!"},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"While I agree with the majority of the viewpoints in Ms. Sykes book, it gets tiresome. About halfway through the book, the soapbox format gets old. It takes little talent to write in such a perscribed format."},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"I like Wanda Sykes, but this book just isn't that good. If you expect to sit and laugh the whole time you are reading it, it's not going to happen. I do not regret that I read it, just slightly disappointed. Better just borrow it from someone or get at the library, it is not worth the money. A part of the book is garbage, neither it's funny nor smart."},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"Folks, just because Richard Pryor and Lenny Bruce could skillfully mix the profane and the profound with their comedy doesn't mean everybody can do it. This is an example of a weak attempt to mix the two. I would agree with another reviewer that one reason this book falls flat is because you have to hear Wanda's high-pitched whine for her comedy to work as opposed to seeing it in print. In cold print, this just comes off as a bunch of mean-spirited, unfunny, profane rants akin to what you could hear from a barroom or barbershop (or in this case, beauty parlor) loudmouth on paper. the literary equivalent ot \\"Soul Plane.\\" Don't bother."},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"I found this book on an airplane and could not put it down. Everyone around me was wondering what was making me laugh so hard! I had tears streaming down my face and my sides ached from laughter. I couldn't wait to pass it along to all my friends. They had the same reaction. We became fans of WANDA! Shortly after we went to see her stand-up routine, but it wasn't half as funny as this book. I keep it on hand when I need a good laugh."},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"This is a good book and it is just plan fun to read. I saw Wanda Sykes for the first time on Comedy Central and after that couldn't wait to read her book. And I am glad I did. This is a great book, worth the cover price."},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"Wanda Sykes is crazy. I so enjoyed this book. Near the end I realized she had a commentary on Prince, too. Needless to say I was laughing my butt off at work while on break at her antics. This is a good read and will keep a smile on your face. Great holiday gift idea."},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"Wanda is the #1 in female stand up. Her voice is one of a kindand her comedy is always hilarious. In this book something is missing. It falls a little short on content. Some of the book is material I have heard in her stand-up. It is not as good on paper.Her inflection is missed.Its a quick read with her brutally honestpolitical views. It would be better if the title was Hear me talk. Even Bush supporters would find her opinions funny and havesome truth to them.She was a big fan of Clinton which I find refreshing because he has not been given enough good credit in my opinion."},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"Wanda Sykes is a very funny comedian...when one is watching her stand up. However, that doesn't mean that she is funny in print. This is the problem with most of comedy books , after a while it gets tiresome ,boring and you're looking forward to see the end of it. In the case of YEAH , I SAID IT ; gets so boring after a few pages into the book .The book is a lot of what she is done in her stand ups, little stories about politics, celebrities and everyday stuff. A lot of cursing and gross commentaries.Like i said one thing is hearing about it and another thing it's reading about it.I don't know what i was expecting ,but this was a drag !!!"},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"This book is amazing. If you love watching Wanda on stage you'll love this book. The books not really about anything specific, she just talks about whatever comes to her mind. But beware, the book is not for kid (obviously of you know Wanda, you know that). But overall, it was pretty good..."},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"I've seen every one of Wanda Sykes' standup shows that I could, so a lot of this I could recognize as word for word from different routines she's done. I still loved it, though, and some of it was new to me. Well worth it. And I meant to give it 4 stars, but this page won't let me change it!"},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"Some of the best of Wanda's favorite and most irreverent tropes, but it must be said that they don't \\"sound\\" as biting and as trenchant as they do in person or as on TV. Nevertheless, she is the Richard Pryor heir apparent, and is not just smooth, but cool and oh so smart.Five stars"},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"First, let me say that I love Wanda Sykes. She's a hoot, but parts of her book just didn't come out the way I think she intended it. I can laugh at tasteless jokes and dialogue, which explains why I could sit through movies such as the American Pie trilogy to Wedding Crashers with my father. However, I couldn't seem to find the humor in some of her monalogue on whites vs. blacks and the strange rant on gastric bypass. Overall, I would recommend this to someone who wants a quick read and needs a few laughs. Wanda doesn't disappoint, but remember the title when you come across some of those sections that seem outright offensive."},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"I think the book does cover some of her stand up stuff, but she addresses a lot of points with some interesting points of view on some political issues.If you're easily offended by some raunchy obscene humor -- this book is not for you.If you have watched Wanda over the years and have gotten to know her style and her comedic sense of humor then you will enjoy this book... I surely didnt mind rereading some of her good stuff -- recalling it made me giggle.I enjoyed this book for the most part."},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"I love Wanda Sykes, but unfortunately her humor doesn't translate very well in print. What makes Wanda Sykes really shine is her delivery, and without her body language, whiny voice, semi-ghetto/Ebonics talk and impeccable timing, the jokes just don't have the same effects.This is still worth a read (especially since it's such a quick/easy read), I think I'd rather re-rent her hilarious DVD, \\"Tongue Untied\\" again."},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"I purchased this book the day after I watched Wanda Sykes' appearance on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. She delivered several comments from her book. Her delivery was flawless and she was hilarious.Reading the book is much different. The material is very funny but it's difficult to read it without experiencing the timing and emotion of Ms. Sykes' delivery.If she or her publishers ever read these comments I would strongly suggest that she RECORD THIS BOOK ON TAPE. I logged on tonight to see if the book was available on tape and am disappointed that it isn't.Five stars for material but a deduction of two for format."},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"I thought Wanda's book was funny. Since I'm already familiar with Wanda's brand of humor that helped because as I was reading I couldn't help but to hear her delivery. I think anybody can enjoy this book. Wanda touches on everything from politics to strip clubs with her no-time-for-nonsense humor. I hope the book does better than some of her tv shows have because she is talented. Go on, help Wanda out, buy this book!!"},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"I caught this book at the library, and I had to read it.Some points that she brought up (politics, marriage, celebrities, and kids were my fave topics) were so hilarious, it seemed like she was talking to me. I couldn't put the book down. It's funny how she even did the word count. I have to admit, the cussing was a little much, but like every comedian, it's their trademark, as well as the way they talk. She isn't afraid to type out anything!This is a good book, especially if you want to see how a lot of women think--or I should say in this case, Wanda."},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"Wanda Sykes has been billed as a outstanding stand up comic and here enters the world of comedy publishing with Yeah, I Said It, a set of her pointed, witty commentary on sex, politics and modern culture.

However, her sharp wit proves it works as well in print as on stage, making Yeah, I Said It a winner."},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"I haven't laughed so much since I listened to my Moms Madbly tapes. Wanda is funnier than Moms. Well, that's really not fair. Moms is no longer with us, but if she were, I know that Moms would love Wanda. More than once I almost fell out of my chair laughing. Another time I could not stop laughing and had to call 911. The section on Martha Stewart made me fall off the toilet seat. There should be a warning on this book: Danger: This book can kill you with laugher or cause serious injury of unexpected falls. A gem. Get it today!"},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"This was truely outragously FUNNY!! Im not kidding. My son took my husband and I to see Wanda live, and we absolutely laughed our guts out.

I won't part with this ever cause I know if I find myself down, all I have to do is pick it back up and laugh all over again. She is unbelivably straight foreword and hilarious."},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"I've always enjoyed the comedy of Wanda Sykes and am particularly glad she is a favorite recurring guest on perhaps my favorite TV show, CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM . . . so whenI saw she had written her first book, YEAH, I SAID IT, I got hold of it and managed to devour it in one sitting.It was that good!Sykes has much to say about women, politics, football, dating, Martha Stewart, and a whole lot more . . . yet it's her take on gay marriage that got me to truly appreciate how insightful she also is . . . she notes:I don't think marriage needs to be protected from the same-sex couples. The biggest threat to marriage is divorce. Divorce is kicking marriage's ass. Divorced is what ruined my marriage, notStacy and Anna getting hitched. Most marriages end in divorce. If Bush and the Christian conservatives really want to protect marriage they should propose a constitutional amendment toban divorce. Divorce is in direct opposition to their Christian beliefs more so than gay marriage. . . . Marriage should be like the Mafia--once you're in, you're in.Many other parts of YEAH, I SAID IT got me thinking . . . yet others got me laughing out loud . . . among them:When we'd go on vacation, he'd want to ride jet skis; I'd want to get a nap by the pool. I guess when you reach a certain age you don't even entertain the idea of doing something that if it goes wrong it could be life threatening. You figure if you've made it this far, you gotta save what life you got left.Here's a tip for you guys. When a woman asks you to do something and prefaces it with \\"when you get a chance,\\" or \\"when you get around to it,\\" just stop what you're doing and do the sh*t right then and there. When we ask, we really don't mean when you get a chance, when you feel like it,or when you get around to it. No, we mean right now. If you do it, you'll save yourself a lot of time and grief and a lot of arguments.When you call me, do me a favor. Leave me messages saying why you called. Do not leave a message telling me to call you, because I won't. \\"Hey, Wanda, it's Dino. Call me.\\" Why? I sense no urgency in your message. At least mention jail, or bail, or drinks or something. Don't be all vague or you will not hear from me. I figure if you're just calling to talk, you'll call back."},{"Title":"Yeah, I said it.","review":"FABULOUS humor from one of my new heroes, now that she SLAYED at that Washington reporter's dinner.And here's a post-script from the TV entertainment magazine Extra, explaining how she was asked to keep her routine clean ...\\"They told me not so say the F word or the N word...

To a large extent, the book tries to speak about general principles of design. As opposed to tying the knowledge to a given fab process or a current linewidth.The emphasis is on CMOS design. Which is fair, since this is the most common digital technology in use. Though earlier pMOS and nMOS efforts also get a mention, along with BiCMOS, where the latter is perhaps most useful in high speed applications.At the systems level, you get a good discussion of such items as using a clock to synchronise actions across a chip. Alternate circuit ideas are also covered. Though space constraints mean that the book can't really go into these in the detail that they warrant."},{"Title":"G.I. Joe Vs. The Transformers Volume 1 (v. 1)","review":"For the record, this is not the first time that Hasbro's two juggernaut action-figure franchises have collided: apart from a few references peppered into the final season of the old Transformers cartoon - including a supporting villainous role in one episode by none other than Cobra Commander himself - Marvel Comics, which then held the comic book license for the two franchises, brought them together for what I'm sure was supposed to be an epic crossover. Jeez, was it wretched. The quality of the art fluctuated terribly, characters were misnamed, continuities were mangled and basically the whole thing sucked even for Transfans.Flash forward to 2003. Both 'G.I. JOE' and 'Transformers' are enjoying renewed comic-book success...but through different publishers, Devil's Due owning the Joe license and Dreamwave holding the TFs. When the time came that the idea of another Joe/TF crossover was brought up, the two companies hit upon a novel solution to the dilemma of a licensing conflict: each published their own separate Joe/TF crossover. Dreamwave's is far grittier - even set during World War II, to further distance it from the existing Joe and TF continuities - but Devil's Due's story, while still out-of-continuity, hearkens back to the glory days of the 1980s for both sagas. And whether you're an ardent fan of either saga and you either loved or hated it, in the end 'G.I. JOE vs. The Transformers' is a radical upgrade from its Marvel predecessor.The story is as thus: instead of Mount St. Hilary erupting, thus awakening the Teletran-1 computer which controlled the Autobots' hijacked starship four million years ago, the Ark is instead uncovered by Cobra agents who decide to haul off as many of the dormant robots as they can, reprogram them to serve Cobra's will and retrofit them as Cobra vehicles, and then use them in a full terrorist assault against the civilian populace. Right from the start, there are problems for our villains - two in particular: 1) Decepticon leader Megatron can't be reprogrammed, so Cobra Commander has Megatron paralyzed and stuck in gun form, whereupon he taunts Cobra Commander vowing to crush him like the bug he is; 2) Fortunately for the free world, Autobot leader Optimus Prime, while encoded with Cobra's programming, refuses to carry out any of his destructive orders.Since in this story G.I. JOE does not as yet exist, it's up an assembly of familiar faces in uniform - later codenamed as Flagg, Flint, Lady Jaye, Scarlett, Mainframe and, of course, our man Snake-Eyes - to get it all together and, as the newly-organized anti-terrorist force known as G.I. JOE, take down Cobra and their new toys. They get at least some help: namely, a self-serving ex-Cobra agent named Mercer, and two Autobots left behind by Cobra and awakened when Cobra demolitionists sealed up the mountain - Wheeljack and Bumblebee! Before it's all over, the Transformers break free of their programming and what starts as a mission to capture Cobra's higher-ups turns into a free-for-all which involves the Joes disobeying direct orders to prevent a nuclear attack, a defense satellite that goes haywire and begins blasting up Cobra's island headquarters with everybody on it, some heroes meeting their deaths (a la 'Transformers: The Movie'); and, of course, the brawl for it all - Optimus Prime vs. Megatron!The story's pacing is pretty frenetic, which again improves greatly on the original crossover; the dialogue is snappier, particularly within the chemistry that develops between the Joes and their two new 'friends', despite (or due to) a few misunderstandings here and there; and while there are few chances to really get into it given the demands of the story, everyone is perfectly in character in this one - Destro and the Baroness get flirtatious, Wheeljack's the logical one, and Starscream is egotistical as ever. Clearly, Josh Blaylock is comfortable with his game writing for the Joes, and at least here he isn't required to remain too serious - half his cast are giant robots.Mike Miller's art is a perfect complement to that effect, too, capturing every character to a tee - even the refit Transformers who, despite their new vehicle modes, still recapture the essence of their true-blue G1 counterparts.In closing, 'G.I. JOE vs. The Transformers' may not be a comic-book classic, but it does its source material justice far more effectively than some of the attempts made before it. And if you're not into the grim-and-grit approach of Dreamwave's book - or if you just want to have a fun read - then pick this one up...and roll out!"},{"Title":"G.I. Joe Vs. The Transformers Volume 1 (v. 1)","review":"If you grew up in the '80's (and by that I mean young enough to play with action figures watch Saturday morning cartoons) then you probaly already bought this book and have read it a dozen times. But, for you younger guys, I suggest you get this book to see what was hot back in the day. The sheer testosterone fury of GI Joe combined with the awesome Manga style robot madness that was Transformers combine to make the slickest, most action packed comic book I've read in a long time. If you read comics to enjoy explosions, super-tanks, and giant robots then you have found your Holy Grail. Enjoy youngsters, this is what your daddy loved before he found girls."},{"Title":"G.I. Joe Vs. The Transformers Volume 1 (v. 1)","review":"Back in the 1980's Marvel comics had the license to produce comic books based on the two hottest selling toy lines: G.I. Joe and the Transformers. So it seemed like a natural that the two toy juggernauts should eventually meet and thus in 1987 Marvel gave the world the four issue mini series G.I. Joe & The Transformers. Reflecting the times and the fact that it was aimed at the kids who played with the toys, the story and art were very simplistic. Now, seventeen years later Devil's Due has the license for the G.I. comics while Dreamwave (now out of business) was doing Transformers. The companies combined for two different series between the two toy lines each collecting them into trade paperbacks.The Devil's Due book, \\"G.I. Joe Vs. The Transformers,\\" takes a unique approach as they re-imagine the history and backgrounds of the two groups and intertwine their origins. In this new continuity, Cobra who is still unknown to the world, finds the Ark, the spacecraft that brought the Transformers to Earth millions of years ago. They first think the Transformers are mere robots but soon discover they are sentient. They remove several of the robots and Dr. Mindbender figures out a way to control the Transformers so Cobra can force them to do their bidding. Megatron is essentially imprisoned in his gun form and worn by the Cobra Commander. Cobra uses the Transformers to attack a summit meeting that is being guarded by the U.S. Army who is no match for the Giant Robots including Starscream. But several of the Transformers seem to be malfunctioning including Optimus Prime, the Autobot leader. Megatron informs the Commander that he's not malfunctioning, but resisting. We actually see Snake-eyes as a soldier and it is in this attack that his face is disfigured and he soon dons the familiar ninja attire. As Cobra announces its presence to the world, the U.S. military creates the G.I. Joe force to counter the threat including Scarlett, Mainframe, Flagg, Snake-eyes, and others.When the Joe Force is attacked again by Cobra, help comes in the form of two Autobots who were left behind by Cobra: Bumblebee and Wheeljack. They reveal that the Cobra attacks are meant to obtain the materials to make Energon, the Transformers power source. Furthermore Optimus Prime has managed to get a message out to the Autobots revealing the secret Cobra base and now the G.I. Joe Team and the Autobots prepare themselves for all out war versus Cobra and the Decepticons!Transformer and G.I. Joe purists may have a problem with the changing of long-established continuity but if they do I chalk it up to stodginess. First, I don't think it's meant to be viewed as a change in continuity but rather as an alternate view in order to effect the teaming of these two forces in a logical manner that fit well with the plot as opposed to the hack job that Marvel did nearly 20 years ago. The bottom line is that this is just an exciting and fun story. The idea of Cobra locating the crashed Ark and controlling the Transformers (at least for a little while) is positively brilliant. I also like the way Josh Blaylock and Dan Jolley have given us a story that is edgier and fits well with what Dreamwave had been doing with the Transformers as opposed to the \\"G\\" rated stories of Marvel Comics. The art of Mike Miller is excellent, particularly his rendering of the various Transformers, especially Soundwave who's never looked better or more menacing. Kudos to the colorists as well; I remember the days when Soundwave would often look purple instead of blue! Joe fans will be please to see many of their favorites like Destro, Zartan, Firefly, and The Baroness.Complaints? Not many. It might have been nice to see some of the other famous Transformers like Shockwave or the Dinobots but you understand there has to be a cutoff point somewhere. All in all this was a great book and I highly recommend it for both G.I. Joe and Transformer fans."},{"Title":"G.I. Joe Vs. The Transformers Volume 1 (v. 1)","review":"Good characterizations of all the people and 'bots we knew and loved from their cartoon shows so long ago mark this volume. The artwork is crisp, although the Transformers are all altered from their familiar forms - only their heads are the same. Great work on Megatron, Cobra Commander, Scarlett, Snake Eyes, Optimus, Bumblebee, and many others. I've read that volume two is better than volumes one or three, but it's hard to get your hands on. This is a good start, though, bringing these groups together in a believable and enjoyable way."},{"Title":"G.I. Joe Vs. The Transformers Volume 1 (v. 1)","review":"This is absolutely one of the masterpieces of my collection. The mix of GI Joe and Transformers improves both. The Transformers feel larger and more epic than they ever had before, and the Joe's seem more fearless when battling for freedom among the giant transformers.As a Transformers fan, I really appreciate the depth and accuracy given to each of the (relatively few) Transformers who star in this story. As a new GI Joe fan, it was a great introduction to some intersting characters.This book is action packed, but remains fresh clever. The art does well to convey the story and is still engaging during the third re-read. The tone of this book is positive, extolling the virtues of bravery, cooperation, and heroism.It's only fair to warn the buyer that this praise is equally true of the next two volumes as well. Book I is a good mix of attention on on the Joe's and the Transformers. Book II gives most of the attention to the Joe's, and book III leans more toward the Transformers. All three serve up good action, sparse but enjoyable dialog and clever plot shifts. If you're only going to buy one, buy this one to start, then buy the other two anyway.

Not so with this book!Although the authors are British, and there is a bit of bias towards names used in the U.K. it is well researched. They could have double-checked US sources a little more when commenting on its use as a US name. Yet, this only means that they wrote what they knew to be true rather than making wild uninformed guesses. For instance, they suspect that &quot;Oprah&quot; was a form of Orpah but without being completely sure they only list it as a supposition and attribute it's existance in the US to Oprah Winfrey. Their linguistically inspired guess was correct! Oprah has mentioned in an interview that her name was a typo of Orpah.

DeVitto combines his extensive knowledge of historical periods of severe speculation, in particular the 1920s in America and the 1980s in Japan,with almost 20 years of working &quot;on the front lines&quot; with individual investors, to draw a very insightful, yet sobering picture.DeVitto writes: &quot;Investors are now looking back at the reality of the last decade rather than forward to the risks that lie ahead.&quot; He argues quite convincingly that &quot;the deflationary risks in today's global economy are more pronounced than at any time since the 1930's.&quot;DeVitto reveals that our passion for stocks, combined with an ever-increasing debt burden at both the individual and corporate level, have left our nation with little wiggle room should we experience a recession of any lasting duration. He argues that as the &quot;wealth effect&quot; begins to evaporate,the confidence or psychology of most investors will erode,and, as consumers, will quickly discover that both their capacity and desire to buy goods and services have diminished markedly.Given that consumers represent 2/3 of the economy, it doesn't take a nuclear scientist to figure out what can happen to corporate earnings, which, ultimately, are a stock's only lifeboat.DeVitto writes in plain english and incorprates his graphs in a very user-friendly way, making the book accessible to all readers. Irrational Markets is a very smooth read, and at under 200 pages can be incorporated into even the busiest of schedules.Despite the fact the NASDAQ is currently 50% off its highs reached in March of 2000, this book is no less timely. In fact, should some of the concerns raised by DeVitto become a reality, most Americans will be elated to return to their February 2001 account values.DeVitto's book is A MUST READ for any equity investor, especially bullish investors like myself who have embraced technology stocks with the same passion a 16 year-old boy embraces his prom date. I'm confident readers will find this book well worth their time and the investment (the price of the book and a bottle of TUMS)as it will serve as a much needed yield sign through the frenetic intersection of Equity Street and Net Worth Avenue, Pamplona, USA."},{"Title":"Quilt Inspirations from Africa : A Caravan of Ideas, Patterns, Motifs, and Techniques","review":"This is a great looking book.

In many cases, it also suggests several asana that may assist in those medical issues. The goal is to show people how yoga can impact the overall health, rather than just being a tool for flexibility.I found this approach useful given a reasonable background in yoga, but do not recommend it for a beginner. For someone with background in the Asana, it can help to provide a broader view of the potential benefits of each asana. I have found this useful for adjusting my home practice, particularly to make adjustments around current flucations in my health (for example, if my asthma is flaring up). While you may get some of this information in a group class, my experience is that it tends to come in a haphazard manner (e.g. \\"your ashtma is bad today? Well, the forward bends should help.\\"). This book allows me to build a more comprehensive and systematic understanding. Also, it frequently states that its arguements are from medical studies, which makes me feel a little better than when the comment is based on something my teacher heard from another guy who once had a similar problem sort of approach. It would have been nice to have references to the studies, but at least I feel like there is some basis here.As far as not recommending the book for beginners - I don't think the description of the asana are complete enough to really help get you there with the form. Also, there is generally only one picture of each asana, so you are limited to seeing it fully applied and from only one angle. This is helpful if you have already learned it from another source (for example, some of the names where different but once I saw the picture I was on board).

There is barely any text in this book, other than titles of his work and short intros to chapters, the images speak for themselves."},{"Title":"Jack Vettriano","review":"You may well have seen Vettriano's \\"The Singing Butler,\\" or other of his elegant paintings - but that doesn't mean you've heard of him. This book takes care of that. It covers eighteen years of his career, 1987 to 2004. It shows what you missed, and probably a few images you saw but never connected to the others.Vettriano's images go beyond Hopper's. They have much of the same graphic quality but, where Hopper so often addressed solitude or loneliness, Vettriano frequently depicts depicts desperation under a cracking veneer of elegance. Many of these paintings capture some moment in a story of intimacy for sale, or of intimacy between the wrong people - the moment that culminates the story so far, and that sets the direction of the story to come. In those pictures, the underlying cheapness of motiviation contrasts sharply with the graciously dressed (or graciously undressed) actors moving their roles forward. The anachronism of ballroom grace and mid-twentieth-century fashion gives the modern viewer enough distance to see the glossy finish as well as tawdry underside. Without asking forgiveness, Vettriano explains how beauty and a moment of passion can lead people down paths that they'll later regret.Not all of the imagery carries that dark edge, though. Vettriano does equally well with sunny couples in happy, if adult kinds of love. In many cases, only the painting's title tells the viewer whether or not to approve - and somehow, that makes disapproval that much harder. Vettriano's work has been called \\"populist\\" and \\"undemanding.\\" So be it. Holding wide appeal isn't such a bad thing, and neither is work that easily yields its meaning.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"Jack Vettriano","review":"What a very good book, it doesn't show every painting in the different series but you get to see most of them.

Vettriano's work gives you a picture that tells YOU it's story, it's subtleties lie in your imagination, and when you describe the picture to someone you can't help but become the Storyteller. His use of light, shade and shadow may draw you into a corner of a Pub or Cafe, or onto a sun filled Beach where in either place you may find sadness or joy. Women are frequently the Conquerors and Men their willing subjects. And sometimes they are just mutual partners in enjoying themselves. You can feel their ebb and flow like the tides of the Ocean.

It is essentially the bare bones description of the movements of this destroyer escort during WWII in the Pacific. A typical example: \\"April 7 - 10 we escorted three APAs to Saipan where we went ashore for the first time.\\" This is followed by exactly one sentence that provides an insight - or color - to either the convoy or the ship's arrival in Saipan, concludinbg with \\"April 12 - 15 we returned independently to Eniwetok.\\" Unfortunately most of the book is like this. There is next to nothing about life on a DE, the ship's crew or officers, incidents or actions, and, saddest of all, virtually nothing about the author's own experiences. This book badly needed editorial help. It's also set in sans serif type (a book-publishing no no) but the chapters are short,(the book is 92 pgs.) the font fairly large, so the type is reasonably readable.

The descriptions and excellent pictures make it easy to visualize the work and the author frequently gives you good alternatives to buying expensive, very specialized tools.

Wayne tries to generalize a how-to article enough to cover 18 years and 5 different engines. It can be annoying, although a few of the projects are car- or engine-specific. Most such projects are specific to the e36 cars, rather than e30s. For non-specific projects, e36 photos are generally used. If you have an e36, the photos alone are worth the price of the book. They are much better than the Bentley. Even if you own an e30, the photos are still very helpful.The great thing is it has a more narrative form than the Bentley, and explains a little more of the why and how, rather than just step-by-step instuctions. Wayne also spends a little more time talking about logistics. For example, the Bentley hardly even mentions the horrible top-bolts holding the transmission to the engine, but this book spends a couple paragraphs going over techniques and possible combination of tools to remove them.Also, the word \\"performance\\" in the title is a little misleading. Most of the projects are general maintenance items.Bottoms line -- it's a nice book to have around for any 3-series DIYer, and arguable a must-have for a e36 owner."},{"Title":"101 Performance Projects for Your BMW 3 Series 1982-2000 (Motorbooks Workshop)","review":"This is a great book for Bmw owners who enjoy doing repairs and modifications yourself.Though this is mainly a mechanics related book,it offers info and tips on bodymods,wheels and exterior.The book is easy to read and is backed up by some great pictures showing each step of the prosess.The colourpictures are great for showing what the parts and problem area looks like.In all the projects featured in this book,the author also gives hints on brandnames and price.

It's mostly mechanical stuff that needs replacing, so I thought this book would be a good companion. It's unfortunately not and I am retuning mine. This book is almost exclusively written for E36 projects. There si really only one project I can remember specifically written for the E30 ... timing belt repalcement. Control arm repair instructions initially look like they are for both models, but then again the E30 control arm mounting points are much more difficult to reach (passenger side) than those on the E36, so no help here either. If you know the 3-series, you know that the E30 and E36 are VERY different. The articles often indicate \\"For all years\\", but that is a long stretch in my view. Most projects and the tips and tricks mentioned are not applicable to the E30. All engine project pictures are for the E36 M50 VANOS engine and not for the E30 M20 six (except the tming belt project pictures). Interior shots and drive train photos are also all from the E36 ... no E30 help here either. I just did my brakes all around and there are significant differences.I find this book not at all helpful for my E30. So be aware and informed about what you are buying. I personally think the title is very misleading. Don't get me wrong it is a great book ... but really only for the E36 owner. On top there is the very good \\"Bentley\\" repair manual specific to the E30 (available for other BMW models too!). No reason to get this book if you already have the Bentley. Or get the Bentley and you have a manual specific to the E30 and much more helpful. The author should call it what it is ... an E36 projects book."},{"Title":"101 Performance Projects for Your BMW 3 Series 1982-2000 (Motorbooks Workshop)","review":"It's always helpful to get a 2nd opinion. Which is why having this book is so helpful. So the Bentley manual is THE BIBLE for E30 BMWs, but 101 Projects is good in its own right and also worth having to cross-reference against.

It's informative, as several of the tips and photos help fill in the gaps from other tech sources. But it also suffers from a damaging flaw: it tries to include too many projects for too many cars, and as a result, the information tends to be generalized and vague. There is a big difference between a BMW E30 and a BMW E36, yet this book tries to explain something like a brake job for both models in the span of two pages.

Nevertheless, &quot;Art of Islam&quot; is possibly the finest book ever written on Islamic Art, not because it says all there is to be said on this vast and fascinating subject but because it says the right things in the right connections. In fact, I've never been able to understand why this and Burckhardt's &quot;Fez, City of Islam&quot; and &quot;Moorish Culture in Spain&quot; are missing from literature lists in many works on Islamic ornaments, architecture and town planning. Titus Burckhardt was a spiritual giant (if the expression be allowed) whose love for the sacred art and craft he wrote so much about was like a flame burning in perfect stillness. &quot;Art of Islam&quot; is a blissful and edifying experience even for readers with plenty of foreknowledge on the subject. Below is a list with some of the topics (not an index) as I found them along the reading of the book:Genesis and history of Islamic art; Nature of sacred art; Sacraments/Liturgy/Sacred art; The propagation of Islam; Christianism versus Islam; Sufism; Ritual orientation; Structure of Christian basilicas; Mosques in general and in particular; Supersaturation and crystalization in art; Buddhist art; Migration of Asian art; Byzantine art; Idols and icons; Iconoclasm versus Aniconism; Arabesques and interlacements; Sacred numbers 5, 6, 8 and 40, the Ka'ba, Dome of the Rock, Arches, Muqarnas, Mihrabs, Minbars, Portals, Persian versus Gothic vaults; Polarity in languages; Arabic, Chinese and other languages; Book art; Arabic calligraphy; Persian miniatures; Literary style of Quran; Prayer; Pre-Islamic Arabs; Reality and painting; Functionalism; Beauty and Reality; Desintegration of Western art; Expressions of Oneness; Ternary in geometry; Qualitative form versus limiting form; Light and shadow; Magic power versus spiritual elegance; Psychological &quot;law of imitation&quot; among conquered peoples; Government and people; Aristocracy; Public estate; Town planning; Commercial structures; Regulation of daily life; Family life; Social classes; Knighthood and art; Quranic schools; Priesthood and Clergy; Canonization in the Islamic world; Jurisprudence; Veils, Turbants, Gold, Silk and Art of garments; Carpets; Mughal art; Nomads; Umayyads, Sassanids, Seljuks, Safavids, Timurids and Copts; Virgin Mary; Abraham; Symbolism of the loom and of the sword; Necropolises; Pilgrimage to the tombs of saints; and much, much more.As it says on one of Amazon.com's bookmarks: &quot;The test of literature is, I suppose, whether we ourselves live more intensely for the reading of it&quot; [E.

It covers the topics and most of the time it is easy to understand. If you have never done trig, I don't know if you would understand it. The problem is with the accuracy in the math questions. The book is full of questions to help you, gradually they become more complex. However, I find myself correcting the book as I go. I would say about 10%-15% of the answers are wrong. Sometimes they get the answer correct in the explanation, but where they state the answer it is wrong. This is an editing mistake that would have been easily fixed by a few TAs. They could have edited the book in a few hours and made it a lot easier for those of us trying to relearn the subject. Nothing like knowing you did it right, but the book has a completely different answer.

Possessed of the vitality and gusto of a Philibert Commerson, and the determination and singlemindedness of a David Douglas, Michael Kudish, had providence placed him squarely in the Age of Reason, would surely have rivaled the great plant hunters of the age. Alas, Dr. Kudish was born into a modern, tamer era, but his contribution to the science of botany, if not heroic, is nonetheless estimable, as his Adirondack Upland Flora adduces.Three attributes of Kudish's work stand out as testaments of an eminently successful flora. The first, perhaps most important, is its accessibility to the layperson. It is written with concision and clarity, with a de-emphasis on jargon. Maps and tables aplenty, and a sprinkling of full-page color photos serve to break up the densely informative text. Years of lecturing to fidgety and blurry-eyed college freshmen has enabled Dr. Kudish to convert the most arcane subject matterinto the simplest terms to even the most recalcitrant of students.His frowzy attire and dotty manner seem to elicit a strange fascination from students, as it might when one observes an organ grinder and monkey that suddenly appeared on one's street corner. I always wondered if it was by chance, or by calculation, that the narrow end of Professor Kudish's necktie invariably hung lower that the wide end.The second attribute, appealing especially to students of natural history and ecology, is Kudish's in-depth discussion of the the determinants of the plant composition of the Adirondack flora: soils and climate. Rarely does the consulter of a flora get such enlightening background information as Adirondack Upland Flora provides, as most floras focus singularly on describing plants in a particular region, without providing much context of the plant's surroundings. Kudish's &quot;ecological perspective&quot; is truly an ecological perspective, not a political diatribe on how &quot;humankind is destroying the planet.&quot;Adirondack Upland Flora's third attribute is, forsooth, its usefulness to the botanist. Chapter five, the meat of the Flora,is a compendium of what must have been thousands of pages of meticulous field notes the indefatigable Kudish has compiled over his years of ambling the Adirondacks. Anyone with at least a modicum of interest in botany will marvel at the depth with which he documents the distribution of a particular plant. Along with detailed data on site, elevation, frequency, and often phenology, the reader is additionally treated with oddment and miscellaneous information:&quot;Dead branches bright orange; the only other woody plants with orange dead branches are big tooth aspen and white ash. Moist blackened leaves emit butyric acid upon decay . . . permeating portions of the Adirondacks with its putrid stench.&quot;These are the sort of miscellaneous comments that makes this flora a delight. Kudish's Adirondack Flora is a treat to both the botanist and casual naturalist alike. Well worth the price, even if bought new.&quot;The discoveries never end.&quot;-Kudish"},{"Title":"Desenmascarada (Unveiled: Tamar. One of five unlikely women who changed eternity) (Spanish Edition)","review":"This story about Tamar brought the Biblical character alive for me. I had known the basic story. She married an evil man, was given to another evil man, and finally had a child by deceiving her father-in-law.What I hadn't realized that women's main role back then was to have children. If you couldn't have children you were basically a failure. This story also really brought out the justness of God. God has several atributes but it was awesome to see how when things looked so unfair for Tamar, God blessed her. I read this book in one day because it was so gripping that I could almost feel the injustness that Tamar felt.I HIGHLY recommend you buy this book, however it can be somewhat graphic so I wouldn't recommend it to younger readers. One of the best books I have ever read. Rivers does it again."},{"Title":"IPv6 Clearly Explained","review":"The book is ok to get some basics about IPV6 and a lot about IPV6 history.

IPv6 is a streamlined version of the current IP version, IPv4 and among the topics this book covers is these various differences.The book starts off in the first few chapters with a &quot;history&quot; of IPv4 and the reasons why it needs to be updated, along with a brief &quot;intro&quot; to it. One thing I hadn't known about previously was the &quot;Internet model&quot; of internetworking, which as four levels instead of the standard seven with the OSI model. Also covered are reasons why IPv4 no longer &quot;works&quot; and then the origins of IPv6.One thing too about Ipv6 that because it is a streamlined version of IPv4, that items like headers and such are streamlined as well, some items necessary in IPv4 are not needed with IPv6. Other issues covered? Addressing, Routing, Security, related protocols, and transition strategies.IPv6 is already being implemented around the world and this book, albeit a bit dated at this point offers an excellent description of the &quot;next generation&quot; version of IP."},{"Title":"IPv6 Clearly Explained","review":"Pete Loshin, the author, excels at making advanced networking concepts clear and easy-to-understand for the IT or networking generalist. This should be the first book on IPv6 you read, and, unless you are an IPv6 development engineer, it may well be the only book on IPv6 you need to read.Unlike technical books that bury the reader in details from the outset, this book provides context first, starting with a brief overview of IPv6 and how it improves on IPv4 - the current widely-deployed global network protocol. This holistic approach to explaining IPv6 provides much more than reference material or detailed configuration-level information (although that level of detailed information is in the book too).Pete's latest book will help you really *understand* IPv6, from \\"what triggered the development of the new protocol\\", to \\"IPv6 basics\\", to \\"how to configure IPv6 network devices and host computers\\". Each major topic is covered - addressing, security, multicasting, QoS, neighbor discovery, autoconfiguration, mobility, transition, services, deployment planning, and futures (full disclosure: I contributed to this book).Considering the enormous success of the Internet and the pervasive native of IP-networking, and considering that IPv6 will be here soon and likely be *the* network protocol for the next 20 years, every IT professional should know something about it. This book is the way to get that knowledge."},{"Title":"IPv6 Clearly Explained","review":"This book provides a good review of TCP/IP as well as a comprehensive overview of IPv6.

From simple transpositions of figures (swapping the &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;complex&quot; network examples about 8 pages apart) to downright inaccurate figures (text talks about networks A, B, C and D; figure shows networks X, Y and Z) the illustrations are by far the most confusing part of the text. There are however a number of textual errors as well many of them subtle problems in technical content, my favorite example being an IPv6 address displayed with *two* double colons in it, and no, that wasn't in the example of invalid addresses.The redeeming feature is actually the non-technical content, such as the introductory materials that explain why IPv6 is where it still is today, and how it can move forward, or the project/migration management aspects of network administration that non-seasoned network hands will find accessible and useful.Bottom line: those vaguely familiar with IPv6 already will notice a number of mistakes, but then they really don't need this book. Those not familiar with IP networking are bound to be confused, especially if they're trying to experiment along the way. Hopefully a second printing, after a thorough technical editorial review, will enable this book to be more than it is today."},{"Title":"IPv6 Clearly Explained","review":"it helped me complete my CCNP and prepare for CCIE it is full if good information to help you pass"},{"Title":"Come and See: The Gospel of John (Come and See: Catholic Bible Study)","review":"This study guide has been a true blessing for the Catholic bible study that my wife and I coordinate.

With a young adult Bible Study, it was great that even if you didn't do the \\"homework\\" and just showed up, you learned amazing things from the discussion as well. Of course we learned the most and had the most spiritual growth when doing all the questions and the studies, but whatever we put into it, God rewarded tenfold.The set up of the study time was especially helpful, given the fact that the leader wanted to learn from the Bible, and not learn how to run things. It gave great suggestions for social gatherings that really fostered our friendships, and helped us get to know each other.The references from the CCC were helpful to clarify technical questions, and to give articulate reasons to a particular teaching. We loved how it referred us back to the OT in order to see how Christ fulfilled so many teachings of the prophets.

It's easy to see why; books that challenge an established religion such as the Mormon Church the way This Is The Place does have traditionally not been welcome. Utahians are missing out, because Carolyn Howard-Johnson's lyrical book is a tough-love letter to Utah, and more importantly, a lesson in tolerance. The generations of one large family are bonded by both kinship and conflict. The heroine, half-Mormon, half-Episcopalian Skylar Harriet Eccles, faces the heartbreaking choices of young women in the '50s, conforming to the expectations of family and society or finding her own way. She is ostracized by not being Mormon, and ostracized for being Mormon.I know this author, and her conviction and conscience shine through. Read this book and rediscover Utah...rediscover tolerance."},{"Title":"This Is the Place","review":"Family. The word evokes different meanings for different people. In This is the Place by Carolyn Howard-Johnson, Sky Eccles regards her family with bittersweet emotion. After all, she has grown up in a close, but religiously divided, family. Ms. Howard-Johnson portrays well a girl who struggles to maintain her own identity amid those who came before her in 1950's Utah.This is the Place is a timeless tale, rich with history and colorful characters. It is a story to treasure, and a reminder to treasure our own family stories."},{"Title":"This Is the Place","review":"Carolyn Howard-Johnson writes with about the many faces of prejudice, offering her reader a glimpse of Utah and the Mormom community from the inside, and doing it all with a gentle touch.Listed as a finalist in the prestigious Masters' Literary Awards, she is an author to look out for in the future"},{"Title":"This Is the Place","review":"One Amazon reviewer says, &quot;Another great American novel,GONE WITH THE WIND, depicted the people and times...Carolyn Howard-Johnson's great American novel, THIS IS THE PLACE depicts the people and the times....&quot;The only thing similar between GONE WITH THE WIND and THIS IS THE PLACE is that they were first novels. That's where any comparison should end.The jacket for the book says: &quot;A fond and bitter story, THIS IS THE PLACE is set firmly in the midst of the Mormon culture of the 1950's. It is about how intolerance affects souls and society, about subtle prejudice as well a blatant bigotry....It is about how prejudice can be disguised with love, family, and religion and how it can turn on those who use it.&quot;Maybe you need to be from Utah or be 1/2 Mormon and 1/2 Protestant, as the book's heroine Skylar Eccles is. Maybe you need to have grown up not knowing about racial prejudice in the south or ethnic prejudice in the northeast.To me, the story never shows the reader any real bigotry, nor were there any real consequences for those who weren't Mormon. Other than not having her grandparents at her wedding (they couldn't come because it wasn't in one of their wards), Sky doesn't seem to suffer much from being a half-breed. She goes through normal teen-age crises, but nothing like being denied access to an all-white bathroom, drinking fountain, or restaurant.Another reviewer says: &quot;The written word has never before congealed into such a beautiful tale....&quot; I believe readers of Virginia Woolf or Issak Dinesen or William Faulkner or Ernest Hemingway would disagree.What the book seems to be, rather than such a grand epic, is a possible fictionalization of the author's own therapeutic journals. Her stories are singularly personal and really don't reach across the page with any interest for her readers. The author had issues with her Mormonism, to be sure, but to make them into a self-published book seems to be a bit of a stretch.If you grew up in Utah and you have issues with the Mormon's dominance of all aspects of your life, maybe this book is for you. However, readers from the other 49 states probably won't find enough substance to hold their interest."},{"Title":"This Is the Place","review":"Carolyn Howard-Johnson presents a warm, very human story of an intensely likeable young girl growing up in a Utah community.

The main character, Skylark, chafes under this unyielding bigotry as she pursues her journalism career, providing powerful fodder for the book's conflict. Howard-Johnson's lyrical prose graces every page.&quot;"},{"Title":"This Is the Place","review":"Believe it or not, it was the title that drew me to This Is The Place. From a savvy marketer like author Carolyn Howard-Johnson, I would have expected a title with a real splashy hook. From someone as enthusiastic as she, I would have expected a title with some oomph! This title seemed so ... so ... so out of character.But that's because I knew nothing of Mormon history. Now I do. And so does anyone else who reads This Is The Place - a tale tossing on the stormy seas of a society divided by religion. \\"This is the Place\\" is what Brigham Young had said when he first led his Mormon flock into the Salt Lake Valley, where they would be free from the persecution they felt in the East. Howard-Johnson writes: \\"They were bringing with them a determination that would be tapped to deal with the harshness of this land that both defied life and nourished it with spiritual intensity. He had said, 'This is the place.' And it was.\\"Howard-Johnson warned me that her novel is \\"literary\\" and might not appeal to men. If literary means there is a lot of angst and torment and gnashing of teeth, or at least a valley full of soul-searching, then it is literary indeed. Howard-Johnson crafts very realistic characters struggling with prejudices, family pressure and their own internal contradictions.Set in 1959, This Is The Place is built of one intriguing layer upon the next. Each generation of the Eccles family replays the same challenges, the same choices and the same griefs of the previous one. Early in the book, I lost track of how many generations carry the same burdens. Half the fun is in trying to keep track of who is who.Howard-Johnson calls her novel \\"historical fiction\\", but when I asked her, she said it is also \\"a cross between memoir and novel.\\" Much about Skylar Eccles, the heroine of the story, is autobiographical. Like her Mormon father and \\"gentile\\" mother. Like being the youngest reporter ever hired by the Salt Lake Tribune at that time. Like the piano dragged across the plains.So Howard-Johnson writes about Skylar Eccles, who writes about various family members who tell her about her ancestors. Trying to follow the layers in This Is The Place is a bit like trying to keep track of the men playing female characters disguised as men playing roles as women in Shakespeare's As You Like It.To say that This Is The Place is controversial is an understatement. Howard-Johnson paints a vivid portrait of a society torn by prejudice, not on the surface, but in undercurrents just below - the secret everybody shares.About her book signings, she says, \\"Unfortunately, I can't determine how to keep away the religious right who want to convert me away from Mormonism, which is kind of hard to do because I'm not one!\\" In hindsight, Howard-Johnson seems to have written such protests right into her novel: \\"Sky had the anonymity of a Mormon name bestowed upon her by her father. Sky had the coloring carried through the same seminal link. She was rarely asked if she was Mormon; people just assumed.\\"Maybe the protesters should read the book and find out about Howard-Johnson ... er ... I mean Skylar, for themselves. And maybe you should read This Is The Place, too. I thoroughly enjoyed it...."},{"Title":"This Is the Place","review":"This is the Place is a magnificent book and Carolyn Howard-Johnson is a magnificent writer. Her book is a joy to read. It is a work of literary art. It has something to say. It is an important book. It is a book that touches the heart, mind and soul.This is the Place is about 19-year-old Skylar Harriet Eccles - Sky -trying to figure out who she is, what she wants to be, and where she belongs. It is about marriage and domesticity, Mormon-style, and about young Arthur Benson, who loves Sky and wants to marry her. It is about Utah, 1959, and the Salt Lake Valley, where Brigham Young declared, \\"This is the place,\\" and settled his persecuted flock some hundred years earlier. It is about three living generations of Sky's family, whose men are Mormons, with one a direct descendant of The Church's founding prophet, Joseph Smith. It is about Sky's Protestant mother, who would not convert, and Sky's grandmother and great grandmother, who did.Sky puts it all in a nutshell when she asks, at one point, \\"So why...can't I just do what I want? Do I have to be so adaptable because every woman in my entire life is? Is that what's required?\\"Seeking to calm her down, her aunt Neesha, who is only a few years older, suggests, \\"If the great mystery of life is who we are, you and I are not going to find it today.\\"\\"Probably not,\\" Sky agrees, but wonders \\"what we would do with ourselves if we actually found out.\\"The book opens with a story about a piano, which belongs to Sky's grandmother, Harriet Skylar Eccles, \\"Gram Harry.\\" The instrument symbolizes the promising musical career, and independence, she abandoned when she chose to marry and become a Mormon.Gram Harry tries to keep Sky in line when she sees her granddaughter going to work for the liberal Salt Lake City Tribune.\\"You have musical talent,\\" the grandmother tells Sky. \\"Music runs in your veins.\\"Resisting the pull of the lifestyle her grandmother had chosen, asserting herself, Sky replies: \\"Try to understand. Words are my music. You love the notes, I love the lyrics.\\"Howard-Johnson's words, indeed, are her music. She writes with journalistic clarity and poetic beauty and power. Her writing is especially rich in delightful, enlightening similes, which appear unexpectedly, like refreshing, hidden springs.Consider these:\\"Material verve followed her like the aura of expensive perfume.\\" (p. 33)\\"The night was heavy and the moon was gray, washed with clouds like mottled oatmeal.\\" (p. 162)\\"Sky didn't tell her (Stella) that (her eyes) were melancholy pools, like twin mountain lakes at dusk.\\" (p. 95)\`There was no difficulty for him in choosing her, dainty as a blossom of bleeding heart, skin as soft as butterfly wings.\\" (p. 133)\\"Big raindrops started to clap, like scattered applause, across the driveway and sidewalk.\\" (p. 170)Howard-Johnson knows the people and places intimately and captures the inner and outer worlds with subtle, startling and telling detail.The author has found a deceptively simple, intriguing way of telling her multi-generational story. Each chapter is devoted to one or two individuals, allowing the reader to get to know them and their relationship to Sky, moving the plot along in the process.We read about Sky Eccles, Harriet Skylar Eccles, Sky and Archer, Harriet and Brock, Sky and Stella, among others.We also read about places - Sky's Place, Harriet's Place, and The Place - The Salt Lake Valley and Salt Lake City.The chapter subheadings suggest the point and plot direction: The Search, Soul Music, Identity, Intolerance, Discovery, Proposal, Love Story, Finding Yourself, Inclusion, Exclusion, Rejection, Healing, Self-Denial, Consolation, Destination, Sacrifice, Premonition, Perspective, Loss and The Lesson.The author cares about each of her characters and makes us care.What makes this book important is that it is not just about particular individuals, and a particular place and time, but that it is about timeless and universal types and issues.Sky observes the many forms of prejudice and cruelty. After one family gathering, she confides in her aunt: \\"You know it isn't just our family, Neesha. One side is as bad as the other. Neither side ever gets it. People who have suffered persecution can turn it on others with a terrible benevolence. It becomes a cycle that builds in intensity. It never wears itself out.\\"The book is about how the persecuted become the persecutors; how those who have suffered from bigotry and prejudice become bigoted and prejudiced. It is about \\"us\\" and \\"them,\\" about inclusion and exclusion, about the comforts and benefits of belonging - and the price of belonging. It is about the family or the group imposing its will on the individual. It is about the individual vs. the group, and the liberation, survival and freedom of each.If these themes resonate with you, any time, any place, then this is the time, the place and the book - for you."},{"Title":"This Is the Place","review":"This is a very well-written novel with fantastic and believable characters.

However, in the hands of a dancer it pivots and twirls, opening gradually or with a flick of a wrist to reveal itself as a work of art, a kaleidoscope of color and movement. As the dance develops the fan becomes more than an object in the hands of an artist. It is a gateway into a world both frightening in its strangeness and comforting in its familiarity.This Is The Place, Carolyn Howard-Johnson's excellent first novel, unfurls as the fan does developing from a simple coming of age story, filled with the music of everyday life, into a powerful novel about the search for individuality and the struggle against prejudice.Skylar Eccles is the hero. The daughter of a Mormon father and a Protestant mother, she must struggle against the demands and prejudices of both sides of her family that mandate that she conforms to their religious views. She must also struggle against the constrains placed on members of her sex in 1950's Utha, that sent the message that \\"only in marriage would a woman be a complete entity.\\" Even the love of a good man and the love of her family threatened to destroy her selfhood through the obstacles placed in her path in their attempts to mold and shape her into good wife, obedient daughter, and a child of the faith. \\"...Sky looked at her own life and saw the awful power of love hovering ready to shape-maybe destroy -her own reality.\\"The pain of intolerance and the fight against bigotry is reflected in the lives of Skylar's great-grandmother Crystal and grandmother Harriet, who both gave up their more comfortable religions to embrace the harsher rules of Mormonism, in order to be with the men they loved. It is also mirrored in the life of Skylar's mother Stella, who refuses to relinquish her own faith.Beneath all this emerges another story. It is the story of Utah, the fifth woman in this tale. Utah is the mother, loving, comforting, and judgmental. Enfolding these women in her arms, she shapes and forms them in her own image, strong and glorious in her harsh, uncompromising beauty that demands respect and honor from her sons and daughters. Howard -Johnson speaks in reverence of the land whether it's the family's private house and land imprinted in Sky's soul \\"both sweet and scary like a sugar apple with a dark spot in its core\\" or Utah itself, who \\"chained her with its beauty and with the calls of her ancestors because her feet were grounded in its clay.\\"Howard-Johnson's language is vivid and vibrant, pulsating with the music and beauty of the land she describes, burnt sienna, pumpkin and amber. Her words, like the music that pours from grandma Harriet's piano, ties our souls to \\"the rhythm of life in Utah's Mormon community.\\" But, it is Howard-Johnson's power as a story teller that holds the readers enthralled bringing to life characters that spoke directly to us of their hopes and joys. She not only held my interest until the end, but she made me fall in love with Utah a land whose harsh and vivid beauty effects the lives not only of the people who live there but also impacts those who merely visit it at one moment in time in the pages of a book.

Temple entitled them to wear under their clothes, whether work clothes or best, in summer and winter, awake or asleep. Garments were one piece with both sleeves and legs that insisted on a modest cut of outer clothing to cover them. They had little embroidered openings to mark the navel and nipples and were sometimes edged with a tiny faux crochet trim. They would be a symbolic and perpetual reminder that binds two together and those two to their spiritual heritage. He was the figurative God of the household who would some day hold that place in the highest degree of heaven. She was the strength of the family to be by his side in this life and the next.'The clay that brought their union together and made it right for them was passion so their garments were sometimes folded and arranged in a soft, white pile while they stroked each other into ecstasy. This was difficult for them for they felt it was a violation of their commitment to each other and to their vows, the times they chose to let their garments stay on. Their desire was too intense to take the time to remove the unwieldy underwear worn next to the skin like long johns so they worked around the constriction of a full body suit as best they could.\\"Carolyn Howard-Johnson has written that great American novel that she always dreamed of writing.

It is also about how families, no matter what their religion, have disagreements but still have love for one another."},{"Title":"This Is the Place","review":"THIS IS THE PLACE By Carolyn Howard-Johnson A review by Kim JacobsenThis is a beautifully painted portrait of words depicting life in 1950&#65533;s Utah and the bigotry that existed for non Mormons. A bigotry that still exists today.For those of us who don&#65533;t often use words such as bigotry, we must first realize that &#65533;it&#65533; comes in many sizes, shapes and colors. THIS IS THE PLACE portrays the story of a young, non Mormon woman growing up in an age and place that was strict with its standards and beliefs.Author, Carolyn Howard-Johnson, weaves a story about one family and the generational battles with one particular type of bigotry - religious bigotry. The barrier created by believers and non believers is so huge that it changes the course of life for members of this family. Happiness becomes aloneness. Love becomes intolerance. People tied together by the bonds of family and blood dissipate into a changing history.Life is difficult for these hard working people and the bias that clings to the non Mormons is another burden for them to carry. Their guilt and independent beliefs wage a tug-o-war within their own hearts. Even within the family unit there is always an underlying need to convert the non believers.The characters within the pages of this story are instantly lovable and unbelievably real. So much so that the reader can&#65533;t help but feel compassion and sorrow for their predicament. As the reader, we long to find a way to reach out and help them through the trying times, but Ms. Howard-Johnson keeps us moving ever forward through this glorious walk back in a time not familiar to many, not remembered by most.Utah is an entire state that stands with strong beliefs and dogged determination to convert all that are not Mormon. The importance of this determination cannot be swayed by love, marriage, blood or independence.Carolyn Howard-Johnson&#65533;s words sing like Grandma Harriet&#65533;s piano keys. The written word has never before congealed into such a beautiful tale...."},{"Title":"This Is the Place","review":"Carolyn Howard-Johnson, This Is the Place (America House, 2001)....The comparison on the back jacket between This Is the Place and Gone with the Wind is ludicrous. Mitchell's first (and blessedly only) novel was an overblown, unreadable piece of melodrama that should better have been published, in the words of Melville, to the flames. Howard-Johnson's first novel is exactly the opposite; it's a spare novel, rarely a word out of place and with very little filler, without long diversions that have little to do with the central characters. No, Gone with the Wind this isn't, and I, for one, couldn't be happier.Set in 1959, This Is the Place gives us Skylar Eccles, between high school and college, working for the local paper, and a non-Mormon living in the state of Utah. She's dating a mormon seriously, and it looks as if she's treading the same route as most of her ancestors that we get to know in this novel: she's going to marry a Mormon. But how that affects her, how her wordless battle against pre-ERA workplaces, and the various other strings of plot here are of secondary importance. This Is the Place is a novel about the Eccles family and Sky's attempt to put the recent family history into words. It is a love affair with genealogy, and that is what makes this novel shine. More than once while reading this, I found myself making comparisons to Lee Smith's brilliant novel Oral History; I get the feeling that the audiences for the two books would cross over perfectly.Since I felt compelled to mention the prejudice angle previously, I might as well attempt to justify it. Sure, there's prejudice to be found here. Anyone who grew up with Tom Fitzgerald's wondrous Great Brain books has a basic understanding of the ins and outs of Utah society. Not much changed between T. D. and his family at the turn of the century and Sky in 1959. Much is made of the oppression of the Mormons by American society; much is made of the oppression the Mormons foist on others, as well, both the non-Mormons living in Utah and those places to whom the mormons send missionaries. There's also a rather biting passage about the non-Mormon minority's feelings towards the Mormons that had me wanting to stand up and cheer for our heroine. Yes, prejudice is pervasive in this novel, but it's not thrown in our faces with the tacit understanding that we should Do Something About It. It's presented in a more Nietzschian fashion-- what doesn't kill us,etc. Does that make this a bad book, or a \\"sell-out\\" as far as prejudice goes? Far from it-- would that more American literature treated prejudice in such a pragmatic fashion.My main problem with the book has nothing at all to do with Carolyn Howard-Johnson and the tales she spins within its pages, but with the publishers. The editor fell asleep at the wheel more times than I can count, and every spelling and grammatical mistake jars, especially when there are ten or twenty per page (this is commonplace in the large italicized blocks towards the end where Sky actually starts writing down all this family history). If you're a nitpicker, beware-- there are large blocks of this novel where you'll be slowed down by a shoddy editing department. I thought the book was well worth reading despite that, but your mileage may vary. *** 1/2"},{"Title":"This Is the Place","review":"In &quot;This is the Place,&quot; Carolyn Howard-Johnson sheds light on the mysterious world of Mormonism. Growing up Methodist in a Mormon-populated town, I had never understood the beliefs of the Mormons until I read this book. Despite the push-pull that forces Sky Eccles to reconsider her place in Utah -- and, subsequently, in her family -- the author's tone is compassionate for all her characters, both Mormon and not. Particularly satisfying is the twist ending, a delightful surprise that left this reader happy for the journey. In an age that doesn't quite appreciate literary authors, Ms. Howard-Johnson has created a work of depth and ambition that doesn't speak down to its readers but rather allows them to become a part of the tale. Well-done!"},{"Title":"This Is the Place","review":"Carolyn Howard Johnson takes the reader back in time to an era of polygomy and prejudice in Utah. She shows us that our rightous prejudice is exclusive and hurtful. Living as a minority in any community requires courage. Sky is an example of one womans courage to row against the tide and be true to herself. The message that prejudice can be cloaked by love, family, and church is skillfully presented whitout defaming the founding principles of the LDS Church. As an active, open minded LDS member, I can appreciate her message and take it to heart and still say: The church is perfect, the people aren't! The book sends a message that we still have a long way to go in fully appreciating diversity."},{"Title":"This Is the Place","review":"\\"This is the Place,\\" by Carolyn Howard-Johnson offers the reader insight into Utah, a state she obviously loves, and the dissension that religious intolerance and bigotry can create within families, communities, states, countries and worlds. This timely and powerful tale evolves through the experiences and vision of Sky Eccles. Readers will feel both her joy and her pain as she offers us glimpses into Mormon life from outside its security net. Howard-Johnson's lyrical style captures and holds your attention from beginning to conclusion. The author's emotional ties, her sense of loyalty to her native state of Utah parallel my feelings about my beloved Iowa. I enjoyed reading \\"This is the Place\\" and recommend it to all avid readers. Howard-Johnson's writing is skillful and often downright poetic. Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge"},{"Title":"This Is the Place","review":"There are certain issues involving our cultural that you cannot question as an author without getting all kinds of hits--both positive and negative and none of them have anything what-so-ever to do with the literary merits of the story. One of those is to question or comment on some particular religious organization, even if indirectly. It takes literary courage and becomes a fine line between the art, prose and the balance of truth.However, the truth is determined by our own personal insights as to what is correct. It almost always reflects the life long training and the belief system of your family, community and those who educated you. Very few ever really explore religions outside their own youthful indoctrinations into whatever cultural and religious heritage we were born into. So, when author Carolyn Howard-Johnson writes a book based on her alienation from the surrounding culture of Mormonism in Utah she is bound to open herself up as a target.Carolyn's book title is taken from a quote of the LSD leader Brigham Young when he looked out over Salt Lake City and proclaimed \\"This is the Place\\". Contrary to some reviews I had read about her book, I found that there was no attempt to attack any organization. She deals with people in her book and it is the actions and views of her characters that become the focus of the issues in her story. However, the culture she writes about is a collective thought and action process of a group. She writes about her lead character having to deal with life as a non-Mormon in a state where this is the primary social driving force. The premise seems to be that no matter what you do or achieve as a non-member of this cultural you will always remain feeling like you are on the outside or at least separated in some social way.Carolyn uses her lead character to bring out the past as she explores her family genealogy. We discover how a group of early founders escaped from the bigotry and persecutions of other places. They came to Utah to build a place where they would not endure such things again. In her book, it seems that the former persecuted become intolerant of outsiders over time. Maybe not in brutal ways like blacks had in the south but at least socially there was a division between the non-believers and those of the LDS church.When reading her book one gets the feeling that her story seems almost personal and autobiographical. It feels like we are following along in a memoir of someone exploring their family and themselves looking for their roots and meaning. It is well written and the prose is top notch stuff. It flows with energy as it almost dances through the pages. Her characters are all alive and have depth and animation. This was her first novel but it feels like classic piece of literature like many other great first novels of our time.This book will continue to be controversial but hopefully in a healing way. I get the feeling that the author is trying to throw a mirror out there for people to look into for discovering there own roots. I think the author obviously has great writing skills and talents. I hope people read this story with both an open mind and heart so that they can fully enjoy the actual story she has created."},{"Title":"This Is the Place","review":"This story of a young woman's heart as it blooms in matters of life and love takes on special meaning as she struggles in the midst of discrimination during an era when not only Mormonism, but the judgemental attitudes of the 50s, trapped women inside tight little boxes. An unexpected twist at the end."},{"Title":"This Is the Place","review":"Who doesn't love the thrill of discovery...the tingle one gets from uncovering a hidden treasure? Author Carolyn Howard-Johnson is an undiscovered jewel of a writer, a true artistic force waiting to be revealed, and enjoyed. In the author's first novel &quot;This is the Place,&quot; Howard-Johnson turns her pen to the challenges of love, prejudice, the journey towards self-awareness, and the power of individuality--and in the process, has created a story which is both timeless and timely. Set in 1950's Utah, young Sky Eccles fights to find her place and her peace in her family and in the Morman culture despite her &quot;half-breed&quot; status. Howard-Johnson takes the reader along Sky's journey of growth, weaving a tale which is dense with detail, yet lyrical and easy to read. Readers will leave &quot;This is the Place&quot; enlighted, moved, educated, and delighted with the author's gentle yet profound skill with words, and eye for the little things that weave into life's tapestry.

The stories told are alive with history, movement, curiosity.It is 1959, & Skylar Eccles has become a journalist for a Salt Lake City newspaper, where she takes on the project of discovering her family's genealogyA quite well written novel with some lyrical patchworked stories about one woman's life & her history within a closed society, her memories of how she tries to toe the party line, & her eventual break for freedom. Did it gladden my heart? No, the often abrasive tone about the oppression of a host of written & unwritten rules, was withering. As too the Big Brotherism of that culture.At the end there is a Reading Group Guide in which are listed questions for serious discussion, which transforms this novel into a textbook about closed societies & their impact."},{"Title":"This Is the Place","review":"I love family stories, and this book is like a quilt stitched together by the ties that bind the Eccles women to each other. Author Carolyn Howard-Johnson pieces together their stories like patchwork squares handed down from generation to generation, until the reader truly feels enveloped in this family's rich heritage. Her writing brings the characters and the setting to life as vividly as an Oscar-winning documentary, and her lyrical style paints them in colors and details to rival an exquisite picture postcard from her beloved Utah.Having lived all my life in Alabama, I thought I knew all there was to know about discrimination. What an eye-opener this book is about religious intolerance--a subject that becomes more and more relevant in today's world of terrorist threats and suspicion. Would that we all could see the issues from both sides as does this book's heroine, Sky Eccles. Empathy is a hard thing to learn, but this book goes a long way in teaching it."},{"Title":"This Is the Place","review":"This is a book that is both entertaining to read but it also has the subtle ability to change perceptions I think about a loaded subject. I was aware of recent explorings of the family systems in the often mysterious land of Mormonism. The writer has managed to bring a personal experience into the characters of her story and the complexity of being in and/or from a Mormon community in a modern times.I think it is true that it is impossible to write anything without it being somewhat autobiographical but this author has managed to remove herself enough to let this be a story that is entertaining to read and enlightening. It can't get any better than that for a writer or a reader. Being a writer myself makes me doubly critical and I give this 5 stars. This book was thoughtfully written and well researched.June of the Corn Huskers Ball"},{"Title":"Blessings & Curses","review":"Once again John Visser reveals an insight into the biblical reality of blessings and curses in our lives. This book, with it's depth of wisdom and real life stories, invites us to discover the keys to lasting change from the sin, pain and shame of living in a fallen world. My husband and I are working in the trenches with marriages in crisis and this book has been extremely helpful in opening our eyes to a deeper understandingof human nature, and God's desire for wholeness in the relationships of His people. Visser's explanation of coping mechanisms, generational curses, and how we kill the pain in our lives has equipped us with knowledge to help those who are struggling. His explanation of God's promise of restoration and how becoming a safe community can help lead people to mental, physical, emtional and spiritual wholeness is emphasized with powerful true-life examples. Visser's \\"Olive Shoots Around Your Table\\" is a must read for understanding family dysfunctions and God's original plan for relational wholeness. Blessings and Curses leads us to discover how Jesus and the power of the Holy Spirit frees us from the chains of a curse and allows God's blessings to flow into our lives. Whether you just want to gain a greater understanding of how blessings and curses are at work in your life, or whether you are in ministry of any form , this book is an essential tool. This book has been excellent for us -we highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Blessings & Curses","review":"\\"Blessings & Curses\\" is a strong entry into the field of self-understanding and whole-person healing books. Combining solid psychological research, a host of supportive and helpful case-studies, and meaningful biblical theology, this book provides a hopeful description of true human health and a realistic approach to assessing and moving through dysfunctional identities and behaviors to fulfilled living. It is not mushy or trite, but neither is it academic and austere. Here is a book for those who are tired of simplistic pop-psychology, and who want to find a way to bring together Christian faith and personal or family system health. It is especially beneficial for those who have gone through abuse of various kinds from older family members. There are enough notes of encouragement and helpful insights to keep any parent or self-aware person pursuing each page for nudges toward personal growth and insights for giving such blessing to others."},{"Title":"Please Mr. Einstein","review":"This is a very entertaining book with a very unique approach to discussing Einstein's work.

After some cursory discussion about relativity and some lame examples, there is a long angst about Germans, Jews and the wars, very old news, replayed ad nauseum.The girl who is supposed to be the other main character has no personality, a total nonentity, finds out zero she couldn't have found out at the local library or Google, has no epiphany, has nothing insightful to add. In sum, it's trite, bordering on silly, a waste of money, and despite it being relative, a waste of time; don't even read it at the speed of light.

Everything, and I mean everything about this cover screams dreck. To begin with, there's the title, which seems just a step above completely juvenile. Then there's the cover art. Rowena is a fairly decent artist, but she will do quick work for cash, and this cover, featuring a stereotypical 80s Valley Girl on a skateboard with a horrible little runt dragon in front of pastel palm trees, fuses the horrible with the massively incorrect. (No Valley Girls, palm trees, or skateboards included. The dragon, as described, is much prettier and larger to boot.) And the blurb on the back uses every single Southern California hook possible... but the book has only a general connection to California at all, which merely is a setting (and it takes place in the mountains anyway!)What are we left with? Why, a personal recommendation, which is how I came across this. It's good standard fantasy, with a few horrible puns thrown in (all told by the participants, though, not part of the scenery as in Xanth.) It's a book about friendship, and about chasing dreams, and about fighting huge horribly ugly evil dragons with the help of the small pretty ones...Agewise, one could easily hand this to a twelve-year-old and have complete comprehension. There might be some topics that are age-inappropriate, however, so screen it before handing it to your kid. I also think this will appeal more to girls than to guys at that age; there's not nearly enough action for someone fond of video games."},{"Title":"Make Way For Dragons!","review":"I read this book many years ago and it brought me fully into the world of fantasy.

(1997-2000) The last two years of this service was spent as the senior member of the vestry, known in the Episcopal Church as Senior Warden. The Senior Warden's responsibility is to lead the twelve person vestry as well as work closely with the clergy on all church matters , both secular and spiritual.For the past decade, our church has witnessed phenominal growth, due primarily to the increased spiritual vitality of the church and strong leadership of our senior pastor,Ron McCrary. In the past few years, we have prayed about and researched ways to serve our growing church community. We had become basically a program based church. Although small groups were a part of our church family, programs, which catered to the masses and which the staff implemented were thought to be the foundation for meeting the congregation's needs. I believed strong progams was the answer to meeting the spiritual needs of a growing church. I had my doubts about the effectiveness of small groups and was not a proponent of cell based ministry.Several months ago, Ron McCrary gave me a copy of the Cell Based Church and asked me to read it and tell him what I thought. Reluctantly I began the book, not initially expecting anything that would change my mind about cell ministry.After the first chapter, I discovered that I was underlining, highlighting and making notes in the margins. The reason was that so much of what I was reading seemed to have relevance to our church and had specific relevance to many of the people that I knew personally in our parish.By the time I finished the book, I had become a cell based ministry convert. Not only did many of Billy Hornsby's ideas seem to have great potential and benefit for our church, the &quot;proof of the pudding&quot; evidence, from other churches doing cell base ministry, convinced me that we had to change our church's ministerial philosophy from program based to cell based.Our clergy and vestry agreed recently to convert our ministry philosophy and stategy to a cell based approach. We are now in the embryonic stages of that conversion.We have known for some time that God is truly blessing our church. We also know that He has now sent us Billy Hornsby with his exciting ideas and proven stategies in order that we may really take our responsibility in doing God's work to the next level.The Cell Driven Church is a &quot;Must Read&quot; for any church leader.Roy Jackson"},{"Title":"The Cell-Driven Church: Bringing in the Harvest","review":"The &quot;Cell-Driven Church&quot; is full of practical insights into the &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; of the cell model.

Giussani's goal makes clear that it is possible to have a concrete, historical relationship with Christ--not as a figure of our imagination or a product of wishful thinking (we know that would be as flawed as we ourselves are) but as God who is present and still acts through the Holy Spirit's use of men and women who are both saints and sinners. Giussani clarifies how it is that our individual temperaments and personalities can remain vehicles for the divine in time and space, and how throughout the history of revelation, those chosen to carry out God's plan in history, beginning with Abraham, Moses, David, were not perfect, but rather, were human beings as prone to weakness as we ourselves are. Nevertheless, this is only a part of the book's thesis. The entire work itself is a fitting and complete elucidation of Giussani's thought, beginning with &quot;The Religious Sense&quot; and continuing with &quot;At the Origin of the Christian Claim.&quot; This is an author who brings the newness of his personal charism to truths that are eternal, and the mix of these two aspects of his work are both thrilling and life-giving."},{"Title":"Why the Church?","review":"This book explains that the Church is a life - not a place where people follow a bunch of old rules. Giussani brilliantly explains what constitutes this church, what its mission is, what it claims to be, and what it is not. A great book to enter into an understanding of what the Catholic Church really is, from someone on the inside of this life. If you are not a believer I would venture to say it would make you curious about this phenomenon that was started 2000 years ago by a carpenter's son from Nazareth. If already a believer, I think that it will educate you to a deeper understanding of what it is and expel some notions about it that are false. An indispensable book for any Catholic or any person who really wants to know what the church claims to be in history."},{"Title":"Why the Church?","review":"First of all, read this book in the School of Community of Communion and Liberation if you can find one. Much of the stuff is too dense to unpack on your own. Second, I never read the first two books of the trilogy and that might have been the reason I missed out on a lot of things. But this book isn't for someone who just wants to start learning about the Catholic Church. You'll need some easier books under your belt first. Third, the translation sucks. If you can read Italian, Spanish, or French, I'd recommend you picking up one of those. Hopefully a new translation will come out. Also there are a couple typos and some paragraphs missing. So I would have given Don Giussani's work 4 or 5 stars, but the edition itself isn't the best."},{"Title":"America's Founding Fathers: Who Are They? Thumbnail Sketches of 164 Patriots","review":"If you're a history nut like myself, you might enjoy this one. It's pretty small in comparison to other such books, but it's packed with information about (as the subtitle says) 164 players in early American history. The intro includes four tables, the first listing the the signers of the Declaration of Independence, the second listing the signers of the Articles of Confederation, the third listing the Constitutional Convention delegates, and the fourth offers a cross-reference of the participants and the documents they signed. Chapter 1 offers a brief (13 pages) but very informative outline of early American history. Chapters 2 through 14 list the patriots by state (or &quot;colony&quot;), and the sketches are alphabetically arranged. The headings include the date of birth, date of death, who they married, their education, occupations, and accomplishments. Highly recommended, but warning...this is a very condensed book...there are no pictures!"},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"First a little background information about the main players in this tale of cocaine, murder, egos, and Showbiz &quot;wannabes&quot; and &quot;ustawuzes.&quot;For starters there was Roy Radin, a modern day, but old fashioned, vaudeville entrepeneur. Radin got very rich producing vaudeville type productions that traveled a circuit of medium sized midwestern cities and towns as fund raisers for such organizations as police benevolent societies. The sponsoring societies did make money, but Radin usually made more. His shows and audiences were the sort that usually gave more applause and greater laughter to the trained dog act than to well-known entertainer, Joey Bishop.Oh, yes, Radin was also a binge eater and user of cocaine. These little habits often consumed a big part of his income.The second major player in this drama was Karen &quot;Laney&quot; Jacobs, later Laney Greenberger. It is a matter of public record, from her later pre-trial hearings, that Laney was a major cocaine distributor who did business with some very vicious people, and who ended up on trial herself for a very vicious murder.A third player, key to our story, was Robert Evans, a Hollywood movie producer who had produced some very successful movies but who, during the period covered by this book, was somewhat down on his luck.Additional players were various drug traffickers, dealers, gangsters, and hit men, as well as Laney's last husband, Larry Greenberger, who either was a retired businessman or a major player in the drug trade, depending on whose testimony one chooses to believe.It would seem that both Radin and Laney (then Greenberger) wanted to get into the legitimate movie producing business. To facilitate this desire, Laney introduced Radin to Robert Evans who had the rights to produce the movie &quot;Cotton Club,&quot; but who was unable, at that time, to get financing through normal channels. Radin, through use of his own money, and money from other sources, could provide this much needed financial backing.Laney's idea, when she made the introduction, was to form a production company consisting of Evans, Radin, and herself. This is the point where Radin made his very serious error in judgment. He decided to cut Laney out of the deal and to only pay her a $50,000 finder's fee. Laney didn't take kindly to this snub. Being a principal in the procuction company that made this film would have made her &quot;someone&quot; in Hollywood, and potentially could have been very profitable to the tune of millions.She didn't take this sort of thing lightly. One evening, she set up a dinner meeting with Radin to &quot;discuss&quot; their differences. He was last seen alive getting into her limousine. A month later his badly decomposed body was discovered, It had multiple bullet holes in the head.Her last husband was also guilty of using poor judgment, which evidently caused Laney to become angry with him. One day, with Laney upstairs in their large estate home in Florida, He managed to commit suicide in a most unusual manner. With a large caliber gun in his right hand, he somehow shot himself in the left temple with powder marks that indicated that, in addition to this unusual way of shooting himself on the wrong side of the head, he had managed to do it from six to eight feet away. Very long arms? He also managed to hold onto the gun, with his finger still on the trigger, even though the recoil should have caused him to drop it. A most amazing form of suicide.Since Laney was charged with Radin's murder and expedited to California, the investigation of this most unusual suicide was never completed.This all goes to show that, when dealing with a no-nonsense, tough as nails, female drug dealer, one really should try to use some degree of discretion."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"\\"Bad Company\\" is a good example of a book that ties the creative with the factual. Steve Wick did a wonderful job in developing the story without making it too heavy for the gray cells. He was able to successfully give insights into the lives of both the living and the dead giving ample space for both the protagonist (Roy Radin) and the antagonist (Laney Jacobs) as well as the people around them.After reading the book, I see Laney Jacobs/Laney Greenberger as a woman who used an aura air sophistication and good taste to mask her ruthlessness. She was a woman who wouldn't let anything or anybody stand in the way of achieving her goals and dreams. Laney Jacobs/Laney Greenberger was a person who only thought of herself.The only problem that I had with the book is that the last 2 chapters gave me an impression that the last parts were hastily done. I believe Steve Wick could have given the said sections \\"more meat\\" instead of making it look like a summary of whatever happened after Laney Jacob's/Laney Greenberger's arrest."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"This other book goes into this crime further and the association with the Manson Family.

It's truly amazing that he could have actually been the person that I read about and I was, well, shocked to say the least. I thought he made all of his money being a body guard for the rich and famous and had no idea that the trips he took me on were his alibi's...scary stuff when I look back. I also learned from the book that he was cheating on me with Lannie what's her name. Well, at least it had a good ending and he ended up in prison where he 'ought to be after he got his 7 minutes of fame featured on &quot;America's Most Wanted.

Wood's book does a terrific job of bringing meaning to chaos, describing the science behind the spectacular features everyone has seen, and pointing out the subtle but interesting features a casual observer is likely to miss.Instead of being a simple encyclopedia of visual features, the book is organized such that &quot;stories&quot; about the moon's geology emerge. It isn't fully comprehensive, and so would be complemented well by a detailed atlas/encyclopedia, but as a guide for the interested amateur astronomer, it can't be beat."},{"Title":"The Modern Moon: A Personal View","review":"The title of this book suggests that the reader will be regaled by the author with possibly some off-beat notions and theories, quite the opposite is true. This reference contains an accurate review of lunar geography from a historical perspective, giving a fair airing to the lunar volcanism theories that existed up until quite recently and then launches into a very descriptive examination of the lunar surface. The book is divided into sections which relate to the lunar geography and take the reader be they casual or serious through the features and structures of our nearest neighbor. If you read Charles Wood in Sky & Telescope you will know of his feelings towards NASA and some of the recent decisions that NASA have taken do not fit with Mr. Woods outlook, however he does not allow these views to over color this otherwise excellent reference.

Montgomery Darby doesn't have to look hard, for he falls for the first girl he lays eyes on: Adele Landis, diamond of the first water.But wooing Adele won't be easy, for she already has a horde of suitors. To assure that he comes out on top, Monty enlists the help of Clarissa Starnes, Adele's cousin. Clarissa thinks she's falling in love with Mr. Montgomery Darby--but she still wants to help him. Her terribly bratty cousin would be able to save Monty's father from debtor's prison.The book was light, witty, fun and enjoyable. However, I think the secondary characters were the stars of the book. The other Darby brothers &amp; Adele were just as well-developed as the hero and heroine. Adele was deliciously awful. And Tristram was the brother I fell in love with. At the beginning, I thought Tristram was bizarre and immature. However, he proved himself to be the most sensitive, most caring brother--and he was the only one with a lick of sense. I would have enjoyed the novel a great deal more if it was a little less predictable. I would have liked to think, &quot;Hmm... I wonder which brother she'll end up with.&quot;At any rate, I hope Tristram gets his own novel.To Marry an Heiress is a fun, thoroughly enjoyable book. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"To Marry An Heiress (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"\\"To Marry an Heiress\\" is the first in a trilogy of books (I'm guessing) featuring the Darby brothers and their quest to find rich wives. And while \\"To Marry an Heiress\\" proved to be a rather readable and enjoyable, it did suffer from one defect -- the 'too-much-happens-in-one-book' flaw -- so that character development, the gradual and smooth unfolding of the novel and the progress of the 'real' romance sometimes suffered.When the Viscount Tavistoke looses more money than he can afford at the gambling table, he comes up with the notion of getting his sons to marry heiresses as a way to alleviate all their cash flow problems. To that end he's decided that all his sons -- Montgomery (the heir), Max (Montgomery's twin) and Tristram -- should go to London for the Season. The viscount has even managed to persuade an old gambling friend, the Marquess of Cravenwell, to fund their stay and to help them navigate London's treacherous social waters. All that's needed now is for the Darby boys to agree to go to London and to snare three rich and amiable wives. And after an initial show of anger and hesitation, the brothers agree to go along with their father's latest scheme.And almost as soon as the brothers arrive in London, Montgomery falls for the Season's reigning beauty, the rich Miss Adele Landis. But how to get close enough to her and to engage her interest? And that's where Adele's sensible cousin Clarissa Starnes steps in. Clarissa herself has fallen in love (at first sight) with Montgomery, and she finds herself volunteering to help bring Montgomery to Adele's notice. Operating partly on the desire to help the gentleman she's so smitten with achieve what he wants, Clarissa is also secretly hoping that if Montgomery is exposed to Adele's selfish and spoilt ways, he may turn away from Adele and perhaps notice her. Will Clarissa's hopes come to pass? What then of Montgomery's goal to marry an amiable heiress? For while beautiful and spoilt Adele is very rich, sensible and likable Clarissa is definitely a poor relation...I liked \\"To Marry an Heiress\\" because the characters were all very engaging and likable. The trouble was that Julia Parks had so much material to cover -- like setting up the premise and setting up things for the next two books in the series; making the romance that unfolded between Montgomery and Clarissa seem probable and romantic and yet keeping in mind the fact that Montgomery was not only courting Adele but that he had actually fallen for her in the beginning; and then there was the mysterious Marquess of Cravenwell (also known in Society as the 'Dirty Marquess' -- what was his game and why had he really agreed to sponsor the brothers to a London Season?) -- that sometimes things got rushed along so that she could tie things up nicely enough for the happily-ever-after ending. And while Julia Parks does a rather good job of juggling all these subplots but I couldn't help feeling that by including so much material this novel suffered from not having enough depth -- for example, I felt that the story of how the romance develops and grows between Clarissa and Montgomery suffers because too much time was spent on other characters (like Max and Tristram who will have their own stories anyway).On the whole though, in spite of these few nitpickings on my part, I did think that \\"To Marry an Heiress\\" was a nice enough read, well worth the time spent reading it, and that based on how much I enjoyed this installment, I would definitely be reading the other two installments in the Darby Brothers series."},{"Title":"Bound to Love: A Collection of Romantic BDSM Erotic Stories","review":"If you are the kind of reader that looks for BDSM books where a young girl invariably gets trussed, clamped and then has the living daylights beat out of her. this is NOT the book for you... but .... if you enjoy contemporary erotica of amuch gentler tome where the bondage is in many cases more 'perceived' or mental, then this IS the book for you.Edited by Maria Isabel Pita, one of my favorite erotica authors this book contains nine short stories, eight of which are by new authors whose writings certainly stand well above the crowd.In 'Summerhouse' by author Johnathan Marchant, one of my two favorite stories, our heroine, a young, agressive, take no prisoners, city lawyer is called back to her summer house in the woods to check for storm damages to her roof. Being too busy for any kind of real social life she explores her deepest hidden erotic fantasies as she prepares to meet the builder whom she hasn't seen for over a year. It's in these fabulously erotic dreams and hidden desires that the author shows us that the bondage doesn't necessary have to be ONLY physical but that we are all one way or another trussed by our erotic secrets.The other story, 'Necessary To Her Good' by author Marilyn Jay Lewis, after a furtive three page start that I found strange, the author hits her stride when Elisa recounts her story of total submission to her deepest darkest dreams at the hands and .. well you know what I mean .. of Armand.

They have a contract which is renewable every six months in which she's agreed to allow him to punish her as he sees fit whenever she's disobedient or anger gets the better of her. Brent's forceful yet loving dominance helps soothe her enough to calm down and allows her to focus on the present.WHAT IT MEANS by Brooke SternDavid and Ansel are a relatively new couple about to embark on their first foray into discipline. Spanking, to be specific. Both admit to an interest in it, but they worry about what it means. Are they perverted for desiring the extra stimulation?NECESSARY TO HER GOOD by Marilyn Jaye LewisA young woman recounts her journey through life craving punishment. She learned as a child that spankings spark a state of arousal and lust. Over time punishment has become a necessity. Can love go hand in hand with the sort of humiliation which she needs?COMFY by William GaiusTim's search for a place close to campus leads him to Rose Ann's door where he agrees to rent a basement apartment. The rent's steep and it's far from comfy but getting to know Rose and pleasing her soon becomes a focal point in Tim's life.

When she was living in the city sex was a driving force in her life. Living in the \\"middle-of-nowhere\\" she has a sense of peace with her needs and desires.BOUND TO LOVE covers many aspects of the lifestyle commonly known as BDSM. Maria Isabel Pita has gathered vastly different stories with varying degrees of bondage and discipline which sometimes teeter on the edge of perverse. In every case there is a semblance of love and devotion between the couples involved and all scenes are consensual.

It is not a historical novel in the usual sense, but a deeply contemporary reconstruction of the past by a writer who was in love with the city in which he spent his life and knew everything there was to know about it. Framed as a series of sequences that accumulate in emotional power and grip the reader ever more tightly, it is compulsively readable and deeply moving.Although it is set in Stockholm and details Swedish life with loving care, the author's vision is so universal that the reader ultimately forgets its foreigness. The translation is sensitive to the music of the original and creates a strong English equivalent that makes it seem it was written in English to begin with--you forget you are reading a translation. You forget, in fact, that you are reading, and get lost in the story."},{"Title":"City of My Dreams (Stockholm Series, Vol. 1)","review":"City of My Dreams, the first book in Per Anders Folgelstr&ouml;m's five-volume Stockholm Series, broke the Swedish record for best sellers. A compelling storyteller known for his narrative sweep, his acute characterization and the poetic qualities of his prose, Fogelstr&ouml;m was highly acclaimed even before he wrote the series. Ingmar Bergman made one of his earlier novels, Summer with Monika, into a film that is now a classic.After reading his series in Swedish, Jennifer Brown B&auml;verstam, an accomplished translator of Swedish and French, married to a Swede, she vowed to make these books available in English. The skill of both author and translator brings into English this superb telling of the tale of Henning Nilsson and his family, a family whose origins and growth in the underclass of nineteenth century Stockholm mirrors the growth of Stockholm itself into a modern European metropolis. Beginning with the arrival in the city of fifteen-year-old Henning, barefoot and penniless, on the eve of the industrial revolution, it continues with the story of an impassioned struggle for a fully human life. Powerfully written, City of My Dreams sweeps the reader along in a historic saga of fortune, love, and acceptance of the existing order of things in a society experiencing great social and political upheaval. Clearly a masterpiece of historical realism, this novel transports the reader into the inexorable drama of another person's life. A favorite among Swedish readers of all ages, this translation is a welcome gift to English readers."},{"Title":"City of My Dreams (Stockholm Series, Vol. 1)","review":"First of all, realize that the translator is crucial - and she does a stellar job. Having read various resources as \\"color\\" for genealogy, I was deeply moved by Fogelstr&ouml;m's characters, his depth of understanding of human nature, and the natural way in which he presents events that are almost beyond our understanding in the 21st century. His protagonist is a good man, yet one that many can empathize with; this is true of many characters, giving us a multi-faceted portrait of ourselves given the same conditions. Moving to the city, finding work, living one among 6 in a room, sleeping on the floor, the simple joys of a picnic by the river - the reader will find himself immersed in the life of the time to the extent that you can actually picture it.

We greatly enjoyed the perspective of these stories because the hunters are not obsessed with \\"record book bucks\\" as are many writers of today.

No, in this case, this book is truly what it says it is: James Bishop Peabody edits a collection of original source material, puts it all in chronological order according to the events it is discussing, rather than the order in which it was written, and provides connecting and explaining paragraphs of his own. What we are left with is truly a biography rather than an autobiography; Peabody really should get the credit as author, rather than editor. Still, probably 2/3 to 3/4 of the book is actually written &quot;in his own words&quot;: excerpts from his incomplete autobiography, his correspondence, and his diary entries detailing his life in very thorough and exhaustive detail.The book is a bit dry, and because it is in Adams' own words, its style is somewhat archaic, so it may not be for the general reader.

She has gleaned the essence from each of them to present a meaningful and rewarding reading experience,as the subtitle promises, to: \\"Nourish Your Mind To Feed Your Soul.\\"In Chapter Four under a subtitle \\"In The Game\\" she discusses living vicariously and how important it is for our growth to experience life from writing our own resume to riding a train. Then she paints this picture: \\"If you wanted to learn about trains....by reading a stack of books...you could learn a great deal....But unless you traveled by train, you couldn't learn a number of things: the smell inside the train car; the feel of the upholstery; the gentle rocking as the train speeds along; the sound of the whistle as the train moves through a crossing;the sight of people at a small town station waiting either to board or to greet disembarking friends or family;....\\"And the last page of chapter six where she compares information and knowledge with an antipasto: \\"Information is like individual small bowls, each filled with olives, peppers, provolone cheese, salami or olive oil dressing. In contrast, knowledge is like those same ingredients all placed into one large bowl, tossed gently, and allowed to marinate until the flavors are married and a complete antipasto salad is ready to be enjoyed.\\"By absorbing the wisdom from this book, and turning it over to God for His direction,I allow myself to be guided to accomplishments of expectations I have allowed to lie dormant much too long.Nancy Nordenson has written a book to read and study; and a bibliography to savor much like that antipasto salad of knowledge."},{"Title":"Just Think: Nourish Your Mind to Feed Your Soul","review":"I couldn't put Just Think down once started.This book is a fresh,inviting &amp; healthy journey to explore the depths of human knowledge. Nordenson assists the reader in learning to examine this knowledge by light of day and light divine. She also extends grace to those who have fallen into dull routines and self-limitations. The reader will be alternately delighted by quotations from a vast array of writers, both classic and contemporary, and pushed deep into reflection by the challenges found in these beautifully crafted pages."},{"Title":"Just Think: Nourish Your Mind to Feed Your Soul","review":"In &quot;Just Think -- Nourish Your Mind To Feed Your Soul&quot;, I appreciate getting permission from the author to think, dream, investigate, imagine, and ponder. Daily life may dictate an obligation to be relentlessly busy, but Ms Nordenson catches my attention and I can stop for a minute to think. She lets me breathe. She kindly hands me free admission into the life of the mind, encourages me to explore, and gives me some directional pointers along the way. Since this is a book that I can pick up for short sections and easily-scanned quotes, I feel invited to come back whenever I want. Highly readable and personally encouraging!"},{"Title":"Just Think: Nourish Your Mind to Feed Your Soul","review":"\\"Find a way to be a link in the chain, to make what you've learned available to someone else. What can you pass on?\\" ~Nancy J. NordensonNancy J. Nordenson draws on her own inner wisdom to solve issues in her own life. She also loves to read, as is evidenced by the many books she mentions. She quotes Jane Austen, Viginia Woolf, Gustave Flaubert, Dodie Smith and many others. She also includes passages from the Psalms.\\"Giving written form to thoughts is a concrete way of paying attention to them. It is also a way to untangle and expand them. Sometimes anchoring and examining thoughts through writing is the only way we can discover what we really do think and feel about a subject.\\" ~Nancy J. NordensonI enjoyed Nancy's insightful approach and her wisdom is encouraging. If you feel trapped in everyday responsibilities, this book will give you many ideas for escaping the chaos and for finding a peaceful retreat. Here are the main topics:A Mind for Life - God, Integrity, Abundance, Powerful Thoughts.The Needed Balance of Faith and Reason/Heart and MindForward Movement - What's Next?Breadth of Life, Fullness of Thought - The well-stocked mind, books by your bedAccommodations for Thought - Solitude, A Season for EverythingMental Readiness - Captured on Paper, Preference for KnowledgeBefogged - Clarity, Melancholy, BoredomSelf-Knowledge - A Student of your own lifeTruth - A Sometimes SkepticQuestions and Answers - Unexpected DiscoveryStretch and Strain - Simple/ComplexLifelong Learning - The Round Table of CounselRhythm: Work and RestAction - Choose the WayThe Pursuit of WisdomI liked her ideas about distraction being the enemy of sustained productive work. She notes: \\"physical separation from distraction is the first line of defense...\\" That would work if my new kitten would decide if she wants to be inside the house or outside on the deck, for I do believe I can hear her meowing for both while I'm trying to write. She reminds me of my own nature, sometimes I want to be reading and doing everything else at the same time.This entire book basically is encouraging women to become more fully active in their intellectual lives and not to ignore their need to be entranced by a delicious book. She also focuses on a woman's spiritual development and draws much of her inspiration from books she has read, her own wisdom and biblical stories and principles.Just Think is amusingly enough a book that makes you think about what you want to think about in the near future. You might end up with a list of books to read after seeing all the quotes!~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Just Think: Nourish Your Mind to Feed Your Soul","review":"I love this book. I have read it twice. Once every 5 years or so. It helps remind a person to take the time to nourish your brain with more than a constant running feed of &#34;to do&#34; tasks and items. People are so much happier when they have their mind engaged beyond their everyday routine, but it is so easy to fall into the trap of becoming solely preoccupied with practical things. Even if you cannot change your daily routine, this book provides insight to just change HOW you engage with your day mentally and intellectually. What a huge difference it makes! This book is one big sigh of relief. I suggest it to anyone."},{"Title":"Golden Prophecies","review":"If you like prophecies, telempathy, and something a bit different than the average romance novel then this is for you. With believable characters you can relate to and a well thought out plot, you will be glad you found this book.I never thought I would be one to enjoy futuristic romance, but this book has opened that door for me, and I shall never look back. Thank you Pam, for writing a novel I became engrosed in from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Golden Prophecies","review":"In order to prevent an interstellar war earthling Lancer is sent to investigate a newly discovered planet whose women, called Pythias, can predict the future. Word has it that they've predicted the war and are the only ones who may be able to avert it. Lancer's job is to prove the Pythias' powers are a reality and convince the planet to join the United Planets Republic before their powers fall into the wrong hands.Thena is planet Delphi's Golden Pythia. She is the most important oracle on the planet because of her outstanding accuracy rating. Unlike other Pythias Thena remembers her prophecies and fears succumbing to madness like her mother before her. When Lancer shows up on her planet and talks about mind doctors called psychiatrists she sees a possible cure for her problems and intends to go to earth. Only her father, ignorant to her fears of insanity, refuses to let her go.Both Thena and Lancer have reasons for keeping their agendas to themselves. Thena hasn't shared the fact that she remembers her prophecies with anyone including her own Father. Lancer goes to the planet on the pretense of making a film about the Pythias. He doesn't state his real intentions for fear the Delphians will accuse him of using them.Nevan is the irritant in their budding relationship. He's Thena's observer who is supposed to accurately write down her prophesies. Whenever they get close Nevan gets between them. When they discover he is lying and attempting to destroy her status as Golden Pythia for his own selfish motives a distraught Thena runs off to Earth with Lancer to quickly find a cure and save both her mom, herself and her reputation.A lack of communication and their secret agendas continually come between them, along with a series of outside events that cause them both angst and pain. Both are good people with their hearts in the right place but their different worlds divide them. Both characters must realize what is most important to them before they can find true happiness.GOLDEN PROPHECIES is an action packed read where the adventure sometimes outweighs the romance. A little more time exploring the feelings of the hero and heroine as they dealt with each new adversity would've made the characters come truly alive for this reader.This fantasy romance fan found the prophecy sessions quite fascinating and delighted in reading about a simpler world filled with magic rather than technological gadgets. The addition of the Pythia sidekick, the Moncat, makes for a cute addition to the story. Mirroring the heroine's emotions the Moncat adds a sweet touch of humor to this fast paced tale of other worldly love."},{"Title":"The applications of elliptic functions","review":"If you are a physics or engineering student looking to sharpen your sword with elliptic functions, look no further. This is your book.Rather than approaching elliptic functions via the historical path of Legendre's elliptic integrals, then defining Jacobi's elliptic functions in terms of their inverse, and then finally showing that these latter entities can be applied to actual physical problems such as the circular pendulum, this book introduces Jacobi's elliptic functions directly as the solutions to the equations of motion of the circular pendulum.This is great for students of physics and engineering as they can immediately apply their physical intuition to these functions. It is decidedly less good for students of mathematics.Also in the first chapter we get a detailed treatment of the cycloidal pendulum with a demonstration of its isochrony. We also get some series expansions and tables for computation, and even the solution of the free rigid body problem as well as a surprising amount of other material.Again, that's all in chapter one.Chapter two takes up the topic of elliptic integrals of the first kind. It treats them quite exhaustively. Weristrass' approach is also introduced in this chapter along with some of Klein's work. There are pages and pages of formulas here.Chapter three turns back to applications. The examples provided are many and varied. Some are quite exotic. Others are more mundane.At the end of this chapter you will be less than 120 pages into this book, but if you even make it this far, you will have done well. However, this book is still just getting warmed up.Chapter four covers addition theorems. Many of them. Then it applies them to the \\"Poristic Polygons of Poncelet\\" with respect to two circles. Poncelet's poristic polygons are the subject of a deep and highly inobvious result in the plane geometry of conic sections. They were widely known and studied in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. But now projective geometry has fallen on hard times, and very few people have even heard of them. Nonetheless, elliptic functions are used in the context of the good old circular pendulum together with the addition theorems to make the existence of these polygons for two circles quite clear. In doing so we are given an excellent account of Jacobi's construction. This important construction, easily understood in terms of the motion of the circular pendulum, comes up over and over again in books on elliptic functions. This chapter also provides some applications of elliptic functions to spherical trigonometry.Chapter five is a deeper, rather abstract look at addition formulas, and even goes so far as to cover Abel's Theorem.Chapter six brings us relatively back to earth in its coverage of elliptic integrals of the second and third kind. The third kind is particularly challenging. Some of the figures in this chapter are almost laughably busy.Chapter seven provides even more material on elliptic integrals as well as some fairly exotic applications.Chapter eight covers the double periodicity of elliptic functions in considerable depth, but I found it surprising to encounter this quite basic aspect of these functions so late in this book.Chapter nine is dedicated to various series and product expansions of elliptic functions, while chapter 10 finishes up the book with transformation theory. Basically, this is just finding formulas analogous to double and half angle formulas from trig and then generalizing them. In this connection, this chapter also provides quite good introductory coverage of modular functions.This is followed by an appendix that provides a few more examples and some final problems.And that, finally, is the end.Like I said, if you are really looking for expertise with elliptic functions - both Jacobian and Weirstrassian, you have come to the right place. This book is extremely detailed but makes good use of the student's presumed physical background in its explanations and examples. It also demonstrates some high levels of mathematical technique, and is laden with examples, figures, and exercises. It is probably worth pointing out though that it provides absolutely no material on theta functions.This is an excellent book even now, though many of the applications are unsurprisingly dated. However, I definitely would not recommend this book as your first read on the topic. Make sure you have at leastThe elementary properties of the elliptic functions, with examplesandElliptic Integrals...under your belt before you tackle this work or you are almost certain to be overwhelmed.Good luck with it."},{"Title":"Effective legal negotiation and settlement (ALI-ABA professional skills course materials)","review":"Charles B. Craver is the Freda H. Alverson Professor of Law at the George Washington University Law School and a frequent contributor to The Negotiator Magazine. Professor Craver has taught courses in Legal Negotiating at several Law Schools over many years. Additionally, lawyers will know him for his continuing legal education courses on the negotiation process and alternative dispute resolution and well as for his many books and articles on labor relations, alternative dispute resolution and negotiation. He is, therefore, a true expert in negotiation.Effective Legal Negotiation and Settlement was first published in 1986 and with revised editions every four years or so it has been tested in over sixty law schools and by thousands of lawyers as a negotiation resource. In that time, it has been polished and updated repeatedly and this latest edition is no exception. It is as close to a \\"must\\" for every negotiator's reference shelf as you will find.Craver has an easy to read style, bereft of mysterious Latin terminology and legal mumbo-jumbo. It is a practitioner's book exploring the phases of the negotiation process and providing the \\"nuts and bolts\\" for moving successfully through any negotiation. It is also a comprehensive guide to the special areas of the field and focuses on them and integrates them into the negotiation spectrum. You will find clear and valuable discussions of negotiating with government agencies, international negotiations, assisted negotiation through mediation as well sections on ethics and a variety of negotiation issues.The book is truly a compendium of information, advice and carefully crafted illustrations. You will find the entire family of who, what, when, how, where and why always brilliantly represented no matter what the topic. Easy access to the material is through a carefully constructed index as well as through the table of contents.Want to know more about: how to ask questions, reading the meaning of non-verbal signals, opening a negotiation, or crafting and carrying-out a concession strategy in various stages? It is all here and I do mean all. Facial signals? Twenty-nine are described. Negotiating techniques? Twenty-nine separate techniques are described, their risks illuminated and defenses appropriate to each tactic are suggested. Negotiating via e-mail, telephone, letters? Advantages, disadvantages and risks of each method are clearly spelled-out.All that suggested, let me focus briefly on a single area in Professor Craver's work by way of illustration of what you will find in this book. Every negotiator and every sales manager, corporate executive, government or non-profit leader, every union leader needs to know: how to conduct a meaningful and instructive post-negotiation assessment. There is no single area of more importance to managing one's organization than improving its negotiation performance.Professor Craver is correct when he writes that \\"win or lose ... it is only through objective post-mortems focusing on every negotiating stage that individuals can continuously enhance their negotiating capabilities\\" (p. 308). Now, here is the real stuff of improving the results of your organization. You must know, whether or not you got the agreement, if you did the best possible in the negotiations. In these times of fractional point margins, you have to know the answer to that question about this deal and from it learn how to better prepare and conduct the next deal.Craver tells you how to conduct that essential review, the questions to ask, the areas to focus on. The rest of the book is, of course, the prescription, but first you have to have an accurate diagnosis.The author guides the reader quickly through the essential aspects of a professional evaluation process. First, we explore the stages of the process and then we move into specific topics of importance in evaluating the performance. He suggests that focus should be placed on some specific elements. For examples, Craver directs the evaluator to a review of the concessions; an assessment of the impact of time pressures; a look at the techniques used, including deceitful ones; an assessment of which party got the most beneficial results; and of course, and study of the mistakes made and new tactics employed. Readers will find a valuable three page checklist for post negotiation reviews at the end of the section.Readers should recognize that although this book was primarily crafted as a law school text and is dauntingly lengthy, it is a rich trove for all negotiators. They may also be surprised that according to research cited by the author, most attorneys settle over 90% of their cases through negotiation and yet have no formal training in negotiation. Additionally, we learn that successful litigators may have no more of negotiation skills than any other effective negotiator.This is, therefore, a book for every negotiator, enriched by the author's experience as a negotiator and a teacher, requiring no legal training for its precepts. It is based on the best of psychological and social science research and, of course, seasoned by legal reason.There is an Appendix with several negotiation training exercises that readers may find most interesting and consider employing for training purposes. Additionally, there is an extensive and carefully updated Bibliography.Best book in the field of negotiation.John Baker, Ph.D.EditorThe Negotiator Magazinewww.negotiatormagazine.com"},{"Title":"Effective legal negotiation and settlement (ALI-ABA professional skills course materials)","review":"There are a lot of books which deals with the the subject of legal negotiation. Since I am currently writing the first book on this subject to be published in Norway, I have read basically all of the books available. Some books are not so good, some books are quite good. Professor Craver's &quot;Effective Legal Negotiation and Settlement&quot; (Fourth Edition) is simply excellent! In my view, both as a Supreme Court Attorney and partner in one of Norway's biggest law firms and as a scholar/author, this is by far the best book on the market. Why? I have three main reasons: 1) Contrary to many other books it does not loose itself in the world of academics or theories. This book is written for lawyers and others who are negotiating in the real world. As a former lawyer, professor Craver has been there himself. He knows what the lawyer is facing and how the lawyer should negotiate both to obtain the maximum result for the client and to be a value creator. 2) The book is backed by references to studies and examples which show that what the author is saying is correct and backed by real life studies. 3) The book is very well-written. It is clear, it is concise and it is easy to follow what the author means, why he means it and where he is going.I could not have competed with professor Craver's book even if my book had been written in English. I have read his book many times, and I will read it again. This is an outstanding book and superb reading. In my view no other book even comes close!!"},{"Title":"Effective legal negotiation and settlement (ALI-ABA professional skills course materials)","review":"Lots of the material in this book is obvious to anyone over the age of 10. I had to use it in a course on negotiation but got very little from the book. Don't know anything about other books in the field but this is full of cliches. An example:'If negotiators can induce their opponents to make the initial offers, they can bracket their objectives by adjusting their own opening offers to place their goals near the midpoint between their respective opening positions. For example, if plaintiff attorneys hope to get $300,000, they can begion with a demand in the $500,000 range to keep their $300,000 target in the middle.'One would hope that anyone who has gotten as far as law school would not need to be told such obvious things."},{"Title":"Stone age on the Columbia River","review":"I found this book to be very informative on Native American collections along the Columbia River. It tells the method used to make the items in the book and describes what they were used for. Because of this book I visited the Sacajawea Museum in Pasco, Washington where at one time was a great Native American camp, and I also visited Fort Walla Walla, which was very interesting. There are many quotes from Lewis and Clark's journal of their passing through this area which are fascinating.

Masterfully written, the author weaves a spellbinding tapestry of events that chronicles the life of Mary Stuart, the Queen of Scots, while in captivity.The book details her stay at the castle on the island of Lochleven in Scotland, while at the mercy of her illegitimate half brother and self-proclaimed Regent, the Earl of Moray. It recounts her daring escape from her Scottish captors, as well as her woefully misguided decision to flee to Enland, rather than to France or Spain.Instead of the succor that the beautiful, charming, and very Catholic Mary, an anointed Queen, expected to receive from her cousin, the wily and Protestant Elizabeth I of England, Mary found, instead, an uneasy captivity. From the moment of her entry to England, she was in effect a prisoner, commuted from castle to castle with a never ending succession of jailers whose task was to ensure that she did not escape. It was a captivitry that was to span nineteen years.Filled with the political intrigues and conspiracies that abounded in sixteenth century England and Scotland, the book paints a sympathetic portrait of Mary, a queen that ruled with her heart, rather than with her head. She was a woman who was at a disadvantage in negotiating with her cousin, as Elizabeth, unlike Mary, ruled with her head and not with her heart. Elizabeth was very much aware of the political realities of the time and sensitive to Mary's own claim by blood to the English throne, making Mary someone to be kept in check, rather than helped.Based upon actual historical figures and events, the author creates three dimensional characters and infuses them with all the pomp and pageantry of the time.

She expected to be treated like a queen by her cousin, Elizabeth I, and was, instead, treated like an incompetent invader in need of watching.The book is chaptered by castles. While one might think this would be very boring it is not. Every move, and thus chapter, contains something new in Mary's life. Yes, her life was dull after a while, her health and beauty suffering from the damp and cold, but there is no end to then intrigue that happens while Mary is in England. From plots to marry her off to different men, to those wanting her on the throne of England, and those concerning just getting her back to Scotland. You find out the fate of her son, James, and her third husband the Earl of Bothwell(who she married at the end of the first novel.)Again Plaidy keeps you on the edge of your seat from the beginning to end. I couldn't stop reading this. I hated to go to bed, work, or clean because it would mean that I had to put the book down. I believe I finished it in about three days(because I had to do those mandatory tasks.) I loved how even though I knew what was going to happen I still cried at the end. You know the ending, but Plaidy makes you lament this even if you didn't always like her, and I'll admit at times she was stubborn and foolish. Very worth while bit of your time."},{"Title":"The Captive (Large Print)","review":"If you enjoy historical novels, then you should check out this author. I've read her novels for many years."},{"Title":"The Captive (Large Print)","review":"This is the continuing story of Mary, Queen of Scots, after her disastrous marriage to Bothwell. The novel opens with Mary the captive of her half-brother, Jamie. She finds that there are still subjects who want to follow her, and they help her escape to England. When she arrives, she finds herself the captive of Elizabeth I, and spends the next 20 years in captivity.This is an intriguing story about Mary. Although the book drags in many parts, it is still interesting to find out what happened to Mary following her loss of the throne. She continues to fascinate as the counterpoint to the magnificent Elizabeth."},{"Title":"The Captive (Large Print)","review":"This is historical fiction at its finest. Masterfully written, the author weaves a spellbinding tapestry of events that chronicles the life of Mary Stuart, the Queen of Scots, while in captivity. The book details her stay at the castle on the island of Lochleven in Scotland, while at the mercy of her illegitimate half brother and self-proclaimed Regent, the Earl of Moray. It recounts her daring escape from her Scottish captors, as well as her woefully misguided decision to flee to Enland, rather than to France or Spain.Instead of the succor that the beautiful, charming, and very Catholic Mary, an anointed Queen, expected to receive from her cousin, the wily and Protestant Elizabeth I of England, Mary found, instead, an uneasy captivity. From the moment of her entry to England, she was in effect a prisoner, commuted from castle to castle with a never ending succession of jailers whose task was to ensure that she did not escape. It was a captivitry that was to span nineteen years.Filled with the political intrigues and conspiracies that abounded in sixteenth century England and Scotland, the book paints a sympathetic portrait of Mary, a queen that ruled with her heart, rather than with her head. She was a woman who was at a disadvantage in negotiating with her cousin, as Elizabeth, unlike Mary, ruled with her head and not with her heart. Elizabeth was very much aware of the political realities of the time and sensitive to Mary's own claim by blood to the English throne, making Mary someone to be kept in check, rather than helped.Based upon actual historical figures and events, the author creates three dimensional characters and infuses them with all the pomp and pageantry of the time. It is a stirringly written narrative that fully engages the reader. Those who love historical fiction, as well as those who have an interest in the life of Mary Stuart, the beleaguered Queen of Scots, will most certainly enjoy this book, as will anyone who simply loves a well written and compelling story."},{"Title":"The Captive (Large Print)","review":"This is historical fiction at its finest.

This book gave me pretty much everything I wanted to know and then some. I found it to be easy to read and engaging. It was just a great, eye-opening book. It's totally up to date even though some research findings are a bit dated because things don't really change that much in the IPO world.The book is international in scope, and should satisfy those interested in US-only, international-only, or a combination IPOs.You will learn some things that you probably didn't even now existed. Did you know banks allocate part of their fees to stabilazation, which means they will buy shares when the market opens in case there is a downward pressure on the stock. They are allowed to stabilize the price for 30 days.Also, did you know that the difference between IPO price and the opening price is risk premium? I always thought that IPOs rise so much on the first day BECAUSE they are so great. In fact, the reason for the rise is the opposite: it's because the company is considered risky by IPO investors and they will only pay enough for it to allow for a nice upside to compensate for their risk. That partially explained the huge run-ups in the first day of trading during the bubble. It's hard to admit that I had all this wrong.You will learn everything about the process from company valuation, to roadshow and marketing, to the way syndicates work and the associated politics, to the fee allocation among various managers and underwriters. You will also learn about ADRs and the way international companies chose listing on various international (US-including) stock exchanges.Overall, just a superb book for somebody who wants to completely understand the process of equity offerings. The author uses sufficient examples, but I feel that for those wanting even more detail, the author could have included more war stories and easily increased the size of the book by 50-100%. I am not sure whether that would have made it a better book, though. Right now, it's short and sweet. Easily 4.5 stars."},{"Title":"Passion And Scandal (Bachelor Arms) (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"Hotshot P.I.

Carter's &quot;bugs&quot; are imaginative and fanciful. If you are looking for a book to teach your child about different types of bugs, this is not it. The bugs in this book are not &quot;real&quot; bugs, they are cartoon caricatures of bugs (sometimes barely recognizable as &quot;bugs&quot;) showing a number of different feelings and states (happy, sad, hungry, busy, crazy, cold, etc). With that in mind, I highly recommend this book. My 14 month old daughter loves the bright colorful pictures, and the big eyes on all the bugs capture her attention. This is a favorite in our house, and it's fun for Mom and Dad to read to her because it's humorous (check out why one of the bugs is not hungry). The words are minimal but rhythmic and work well for those who have kids who want to turn the pages themselves, because there's not a big storyline to miss if they turn several pages at once - each page stands alone.Overall a fun, colorful, attractive book."},{"Title":"Busy Bugs Lazy Bugs (Busy Bugs Board Books)","review":"This book taught our daughter what happy, sad, sillyetc. means!

Shaykh Kabbani's guidebook is a great help for doing daily devotions and learning the Sufi way."},{"Title":"The Naqshbandi Sufi Tradition Guidebook of Daily Practices and Devotions","review":"One of the distinguished schools of Islamic spiritual discipline, the Naqshbandi Sufi Order has a long and illustrious history from the first days of Islam. Led by the shaykhs of the Golden Chain-inheritors of spiritual knowledge from Prophet Muhammad (s)-the Naqshbandi Order has always played a central, pivotal role in the life of people in the Muslim world and survived the turmoil and tribulations of the past century to remain one of the few authentic mystical traditions maintaining a living link with its ancient past.The extraordinary vision of the Naqshbandi Saints was manifest in their establishment of fixed devotions and daily practices firmly rooted in the Qur'an and Sunnah of the Prophet (s). These practices have enabled devout seekers to awaken certainty of belief and to attain stations of nearness to the Divine Presence. The renewed prominence of this order at the turn of the 21st century, due to the indefatigable striving of Mawlana Shaykh Muhammad Nazim al-Haqqani, signals an impending change to our society in which aspirants to Divine Service will be granted to transcend the bounds of the physical senses in order to fulfill the unexplored potential in each human heart.The Naqshbandi Devotions are a source of light and energy, an oasis in a worldly desert. Through the manifestations of Divine Blessings bestowed on the practitioners of these magnificent rites, they will be granted the power of magnanimous healing, by which they seek to cure the hearts of mankind darkened by the gloom of spiritual poverty and materialism.We pray that each person who picks up this book of devotions with sincere intention to observe any of its efficacious practices will receive a portion of the blessings and manifestations bestowed on the greatest saints of earlier times.This book presents the doctrinal underpinnings of the Sufi Tradition according to the sourcetexts of Islam, the Quran and Sunnah as well as evidences for the practices on which Sufi spiritual disciplines are based. The book then presents in detail, in both English, Arabic and transliteration, the daily, weekly and date-specific devotional rites of Naqshbandi practitioners."},{"Title":"The Naqshbandi Sufi Tradition Guidebook of Daily Practices and Devotions","review":"If one is serious about pursuing the Naqshbandi Sufi Tradition/Tariqa, then one cannot be without this most august work.

It just creeped me out. The book was good but every time I thought I had placed the above factors out of my mind the author brought them back up. The story was interesting to see how they made it through the time apart and stayed connected."},{"Title":"The Edge of Heaven","review":"I really liked the first book, Twelve Days, but I hate where this series is going... Teresa Hill definitely has talent when it comes to dark and painful romances. But this one was just a fail. I had a few problems with the novel I couldn't get over. Beware, there are some spoilers ahead.1) The age difference between the two main characters. Emma is 18 and a virgin; Rye is 33, an ex-convict, and Sam's long lost brother! Forget that Rye has a history of violence and Emma was once the victim of an abusive father, the 15 year age difference seemed really unhealthy. My parents have a 15 year age difference but met when my mother was 30... Emma definitely took an infatuation with an older man too far. He gave her absolutely no encouragement after he found out how old she was, but this didn't stop her from spending years miserably waiting for him to change his mind.2) The novel takes up only 70% of the book. The remaining 30% are a few long excerpts from novels Hill has published. And it's truly sad because the end of \\"Edge of Heaven\\" was rushed and anti-climatic. Hill's novels could definitely benefit from some epilogues (romance fans love epilogues!)3) In the beginning, the villain of the novel was Emma's crazy ex-boyfriend but for the majority it was Sam. Sam was painted as unreasonable for trying to separate his adoptive, college-aged daughter from his younger brother (who is only 5-6 years younger than him). I was totally shocked that Emma's mother, Rachel, seemed to handle it so well. That seems very unrealistic to me.Ultimately, I liked less of the plot than I enjoyed. I'm giving the novel 3 stars instead of 2 because hopefully, I can re-read this novel in 2 or 3 years (when I graduate college) and not be turned off by it."},{"Title":"The Edge of Heaven","review":"I know, I know , the h was a big watering pot, damn if she didn't cry on almost every page. But I don't care because I loved her. Emma is a child of domestic abuse, she and her siblings were rescued by a couple with big hearts and the capacity to love unconditionally. She is forced to leave college after an incident that has history repeating itself. Unfortunately for her or maybe not, on the same day her love ones are called away on a family emergency leaving Emma home alone a stranger appears at her door looking for answers to his past that only her adoptive father can provide. While they await the return of her family Emma will be stalked and Rye will come to her rescue jeopardizing his freedom to help a damsel in distress. To me Rye is the star of this book, his birth parents was taken from him at an early age and he was separated from his brother and lied to about his origins, which lead to a downward spiral in his life. Somewhere amongst his rediscovery of his brother he falls in love with Emma. But nothing about their romance is easy, there is a 15yr age difference to deal with, and will his past prevent him from finally receiving the love he deserves.Rye is the type of guy you would want in your life in spite of his past. He's protective, a great listener, honorable and sexy. While Emma was freak'n out he was the calm in the midst of her storm. She could not help falling in love with him, there sexual attraction was a slow burn that gain momentum at a believable pace. I didn't know how the author was going to pull off a romantic relationship between a 18yr old and a 33yr old, all I can say is it worked and kept me eagerly turning the pages til the end only to find out this is the 2nd book in a series. My only negative is the relationship between Rye and his brother Sam, it should have been developed more. I just felt they had so much more to say to each other about their past. The Edge Of Heaven was a great family drama, I normally don't like May/December romances but the depth of emotions and longing between the H/h made this story a recommended read."},{"Title":"The Edge of Heaven","review":"I bought this book because I loved the first one and wanted to continue to read about the children. I didn't want to read about their emerging sex lives! It's just weird when you feel like you get to know a character as a child, and then have graphic details about their sex life. It's like knowing the details of your own child's sex life- yuk! The writing and the story line were good, albeit frustrating and it seeming like the author was just trying her hand at romance writing- very amateurish. Perhaps that added to my embarrassment while reading it. I read the whole thing, bought the next in the series and hoped for different with the 3rd book."},{"Title":"The Edge of Heaven","review":"When a sexy, protective stranger shows up on her doorstep, Emma McRae doesn't give a thought to falling in love with him.

He didn't come to the pretty town of Baxter, Ohio, looking for a woman. But there she was; pretty and sweet, and the kind of woman he'd always wanted, but never dreamed he could have. Emma's innocent vulnerability tugs at Rye's weary heart, and the sizzling sexual pull between them can't be ignored.Her &#34;baggage&#34; in the form of an ex- and her background, lead the reader who knows....to feel for her.Definitely will read all of the McRae Series."},{"Title":"The Edge of Heaven","review":"After reading book one I was happy to read this story about Emma as she got older.

It was that good. I got the first book for free, liked it enough to be interested in reading Em's story and promptly bought this. So glad I did! I loved how the author wrote both Em and Rye's characters and found myself really rooting for them. I loved that they both were given time to grow and cheered immensely when he finally chased after & got to claim her. And the words he used to convince Sam...I felt a pinch somewhere in the vicinity of my heart when I read them."},{"Title":"The Edge of Heaven","review":"I really liked this book, I liked the first book in this series and was excited to find the second book of the series.

As I said in an earlier review, I kept reading because I'd bought the series and hoped the author would get back to the kind of writing she did in book 1. As it turned out, book 4 did turn a corner; overall, to me it seemed like a rewriting of book 1 with characters who grew up and changed situations but not patterns."},{"Title":"The Edge of Heaven","review":"I love the McRae series.

A little predictable but it is a nice break from negative drama. Get comfortable and enjoy the afternoon."},{"Title":"The Edge of Heaven","review":"This book is what I look for in an older man/younger woman romance, but it has so much more than only that theme or that taboo. It is just a wonderfully written and touching romance, in every way. I just now finished it, crying a little and really feeling as if I've been put through every emotion, from sadness to joy, from frustration to hope.I devoured this book, every beautiful, poignant moment in it. You already know the blurb and, from another review, who Rye will turn out to be. This is where the taboo aspect and the conflict of the story come in: Rye is Sam's long-lost brother, and Sam is Emma's adoptive father. On top of that, Rye is 33 years old and Emma 18 when they first meet.Now for some people, the age of the heroine may be a deal breaker, but don't let that put you off. It is so not seedy or dirty or wrong. It's really quite touching the love she feels for this older man. Given her past, Emma is an old soul, and on so many levels, she sees and understands all the deep, lonely, and sad places in Rye. For Rye, who has a shameful and painful past, Emma is everything good and innocent and right in the world. He desperately wants her but feels so unworthy of her.If ever a man was in need of redemptive love, Rye is that man. I loved him. He is that hero you fall in love with. You can totally see how Emma would lose her heart to him. He is the protector, he is that lost, injured soul, and he is that hero who is strong but needy and vulnerable. If you want a hero who risks his own future for the safety of the heroine; if you want a hero who waits for the heroine, a hero who wants only her and no one else; if you want a hero who believes he's not good enough even to touch the heroine, you will love Rye.After waiting over two years for Emma, Rye is ready to have his deepest desire and greatest longing. He's tired of wanting and loving her from afar. He knows he doesn't deserve her, but once Emma tells him her heart is his and always has been, he can't deny himself any longer. Rye tells Sam, \\"There may be a better man than I am out there somewhere for her. But there's no one who's ever going to love her as much as I do... She's it for me. The only woman I will ever love.\\"I love when a hero longs for love, desperately wanting it with everything in him. And when he gets it, he cherishes it and will never let it go. What a damn fine hero; Rye's it for me. And what a romance, a true romance. It is touching, sexy, and deep in story and character. It's bittersweet, full of longing and emotion, and just plain romantic."},{"Title":"The Edge of Heaven","review":"Does age really matter? Maybe if there is a 15 year age gap? How about if the heroine, Emma, is 18 and the hero, Rhy is 33? This was a sweet romance with a bit of the hard hitting issues like domestic abuse, this case boyfriend abuse, thrown in for some drama. I liked that the two characters had chemistry and the fact that they didn't consumate the relationship until she had some time to grow up. Didn't seem like such a large gap in their ages then. Funny though because it was still a 15 year gap but perhaps people feel when you are a bit older you know more about what you are doing and have experienced life a bit more."},{"Title":"The Edge of Heaven","review":"He waited for this moment for most of his life, but now that he apparently found his older brother Sam in Baxter, Ohio, Rye McRae hesitates, not sure of the reception he will receive. As he watches the house with a hope of finding family love inside, Emma McRae returns home from college. Her boyfriend Mark abused her so Emma fled to the sanctuary of her adopted parents' home. However, Sam and Rachel leave town to help a pregnant relative before Emma can explain her plight.Rye finally finds the courage to knock, but an answering Emma thinks he is seeking a job with Sam. He fails to tell her his identity claiming only to be a friend of her adopted father. As Mark begins to stalk Emma, Rye intercedes to keep her safe and that leads to Rye getting into trouble with the law. Still Rye will risk jail to keep Emma safe, not just because she is family, but because he loves her with all his heart.Known for her engaging novels that hook the reader from start to finish (see UNBREAK MY HEART), Teresa Hill provides another strong tale that sub-genre fans will complete in one sitting. The story line is loaded with action and the characters are fully developed though the audience needs to accept Emma, recovering from an abusive relationship, taking a stranger into her home. Still, Ms. Hill provides her fans with a strong romantic suspense that takes the reader to THE EDGE OF HEAVEN.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Edge of Heaven","review":"This was my first T Hill book and I wasn't sure what to expect.

Younger women do fall for older men and it does work out! I liked the fact that the couple do not have a relationship immediately (spoiler, I guess!).

Real Experiences. Real Advice. (Cliffs Notes)","review":"I purchased this book a couple of days ago and I've been reading it every chance I get. I finished it today and I have to say it is one of the best books of its type. All the bases of college life are covered and there are many quotes from students dispersed throughout the book. I especially found the sections on Money and Relationships informative. The financial srategies made sense and the relationship advice was definately sound.For example: the author warns students about the risks of credit cards and backs this up with figures showing how much debt you would accure at diffferent spending levels. In another section the author talks about whether or not to move in with a boyfriend or girlfriend. He backs up his advice with experiences from students.The book really doesn't get preachy with the exception of the Other Drugs chapter, where it tells students to simply avoid them. This makes sense because of all the problems drugs can cause and the harsh consequences that can come from possesion.The information in the book is geared towards freshman for the most part, but some of the information such as how to choose a major is helpful for upperclassmen.I am going to recommend this to my freshman friends and anyone else who is going to be going to college."},{"Title":"A History of London","review":"This book is not only written in an easy and laid-back fashion, but it is laid out in a way that is easy to navagate. It is broken down in to main secions of history (e.g. Mideval London) then further broken down into sections by topic (e.g. Society and Cutlure). This book covers every aspect of the city, from government to economics to housing to transportation. Sure I found some of the sections boring but I was able to skip over those sections of text without losing other valuable information about the city and its history.This was a very comprehensive book that I read with ease in less than a month. Don't expect grandiose details on any particular monarch, policy or era, for this is just an overview, and an overview of London at that. This is a great way to understand how the little Roman settlement of Lundun morphed into the vast metropolis we know today. A great beginning for further study on this topic. Highly recommended for armchair historians."},{"Title":"A History of London","review":"This books large size is simply due to its large subject. The City of London is a wonderful place that I have been fortunate to visit over a dozen times and plan to visit many more times.In the states we measure the history of buildings and cities in decades and MAYBE a century or two. In London they measure in centuries and maybe a millennium or two (or three).Mr. Inwood takes us through that history with lively prose and keeping the focus on the interesting and the informative without weighing us down with the kind of detail academics seem to love to inflict on themselves. No, this book reads like a book half its size because of the fun we have touring the development of the place and the inhabitants who have taken and left its glorious stage through the centuries.If you know London you will love this book and if you don't know London you will learn to love it through reading this book."},{"Title":"A History of London","review":"Stephen Inwood has put together perhaps the most complete single-volume history of London to date. While many historians focus on a particular London (and yes, there are many Londons -- literary London, political London, et al.), and Inwood is no exception in taking particular focus at different times, this book touches on all the facets, by concentrating largely on London's inhabitants, and, as they belong to different Londons, exploring their native Londons and the interactions between the differing Londons.Inwood from his childhood looked upon London as a 'remote and fascinating place'. His father as a London cab driver (as one finds, when living in or visiting London, often those who know the city best). Inwood infuses his memory of this fascination on every page of this 1100 page text, eliminating the remoteness by description and analysis that is excellent. As Inwood says, 'You can still walk the streets that Boswell and Dickens walked, and even, if you look carefully, see some of the buildings they saw.'Inwood, realising that many histories begin with the 'easy bits', tackled the problem of writing history from the beginning, with Londinium, and even before. 'The first known inhabitants of the Greater London aea were the late Ice Age (8000 BC) hunters whose flint tools and reindeer bones were found in Uxbridge in the 1980s. From there he traces the founding of Londinium through Boudicca's revolt to Flavian Londinium to its virtual abandonment. London again had a revival during Anglo-Saxon times, being rebuilt by Alfred the Great or his son, Edward the Elder.Edward the Confessor and his briefly tenured successor, Harold, helped intensify the significance of London by building, consecrating and then turning Westminster Abbey into a fundamental symbol of royal power -- the coronation at Westminster Abbey has remained a strong tradition for 900 years. London the city, however, had a love-hate relationship with royalty, and to this day the Lord Mayor has a ceremonial power to refuse the monarch entrance to the city, much in the way the door to the House of Commons is slammed in the face of Black Rod, the House of Lords representative sent to summon the Members to attend the proceedings in the house of peers.Inwood's sensitivity to issues grand and small is in evidence throughout, by attending to sweeping urban planning issues to taking up a discussion of the role of Gentlemen's Clubs, 'Those who could not gain access to the best dining rooms could enjoy many of the pleasures of London society (the exclusively masculine pleasures, at any event) by becoming a member of one of the West End clubs...'Inwood makes the observation that 'in the 1990s they could find England's most extreme social and economic contrasts within 5 miles of Parliament Square', and this is true on the whole, for the wealthy and the destitute both tend to flock to the urban scene. London has suffered by not having a central government, the only major city without such government, not that the GLC was effective, but that something needs to be done -- and perhaps the new mayoral initiative will bring some hope. London's 1993 GDP was about 110 billion GBP (180 billion USdollars), bigger than the GDP of Russia - 'a city with the capacity to generate wealth on such a scale does not need to endure overfilled railway carriages, understocked classrooms, decaying social services, underfunded libraries, neglected housing estates or families living in fire-trap bed-and-breakfast accommodation.'Inwood concludes with an early comment on London: 'The city is delightful indeed, when it has a good governor,' penned by William Fitzstephen in 1173. Of course, today's problems are not unique even to London, as this history demonstrates admirably.This is a history that is well worth the investment of the time it takes to read."},{"Title":"A History of London","review":"At 937 pages of text this is an encyclopaedic account. Inwood covers everything from Roman times to the first publication of the book in 1998: the history of London's buildings and ever-changing appearance, architecture, economics, sociology, demography, sanitation, transport, entertainment, administration, politics - all in a clear and sober style."},{"Title":"A History of London","review":"Couldn't put this book down.

This \\"memoir\\" is grassland exploration and ecology literature search at its best: Price cites over 65 authors in his bibliography.Price traveled to South Dakota, Kansas and Iowa to discover what remained of the prairie, and in the process interviewed four writers whose books had spoken to him of the region. These writers - their varied views, stories and struggles - are the subjects of the four main chapters of the book: \\"Reaching Yarak: The Peregrinations of Dan O'Brien,\\" \\"Not Just Any Land: Linda Hasselstrom at Home,\\" \\"Native Dreams: William Least-Heat Moon and Chase County, Kansas,\\" and \\"A Healing Home: Mary Swander's Recovery Among the Iowa Amish.\\" Price's insightful questions and sense of humor make the book's subject highly accessible and memorable.Great Plains enthusiasts, as well as those wanting to understand this often-overlooked region (\\"...where surprises can live and grow\\"), will delight in his extensive use of quotations from well-known writers such as Wendell Berry, Gretel Ehrlich, Wes Jackson, William Kittredge, Wallace Stegner and Terry Tempest Williams, to name just a few. Woven through the narrative in often lyrical passages is Price's own exploration of place, community, family history and an understanding of \\"...what it is that the land demands of us in our daily lives: the nature of responsibility.\\"Price, who grew up in north central Iowa, has written an important book about region that will be studied, discussed and enjoyed for years to come. He is an Associate Professor of English at the University of Nebraska-Omaha."},{"Title":"Not Just Any Land: A Personal and Literary Journey into the American Grasslands","review":"This is an excellent regional history - social, biological and natural history - of the American plains.John Price's voice is expansive and insightful, including his family connections to various spots in the middle plains states. It also is a look at just what it will take to ground him, via nature, in life. And, as a relatively recent husband, it is also a reflection on where that grounding will take place, and the give-and-take that will be involved with his wife.As to the specifics of life on the plains, while finding much to celebrate once stereotypes are penetrated, stereotypes still have a fair degree of truth, as do cold, hard facts.Racism and sexism can still be found in the Midwest, for example. They may be fading away, but they haven't disappeared.Unfortunately, what has disappeared is untainted land. Take these eye-opening stats from Price's home state of Iowa, for example.Just one-half of 1 percent of the land is in a pre-European natural state, the worst of any of the 50 states. Even worse, it is so farm-and-ranch chemical laden that only 20 percent of it can EVER be restored to that pre-contact state, it is estimated, citing Richard Manning's \\"Grassland.\\"Can we change to something more sustainable? That question, too, gets pondered in this book, and from different angles.===Two caveats on matters historical and botanical.First, the Quapaw and Caddo lived in the southern plains, not the northern ones; second, the prairie did not extend from Appalachia all the way to the Rockies -- Illinois was the one cis-Mississippian state with significant prairie."},{"Title":"Not Just Any Land: A Personal and Literary Journey into the American Grasslands","review":"As I look forward to again attending The Prairie Festival at The Land again this year, I relished reading this book. It was fascinating reading the four authors' discussions of their work and their lives as they intersect their published writing.This book also spoke to my interest in the Operation Migration project which is leading the way for the whooping cranes to again be wild and part of the land. John Price ponders and dissects the importance of place and the meaning of home and how we can follow Wendell Berry in really knowing about the place where we live.\\"Though Heat-Moon's final quest for memory is a times awkward and self-conscious, it is for him essential. If America, if the human species, is to survive, then it must work actively to rejuvenate and reconstruct geographically specific, ancestral paradigms-deep maps-that move it toward a grand harmony of people and places.\\"Anyone who has seen the movie \\"Into the Wild\\" will resonate with Price's description of the effects of William Trogdon's decision to write \\"Prairy Erth\\" under the name William Least Heat-Moon.\\"This rejuvenation begins with the individual journey, with the singular act of self-creation represented, perhaps, by William Trogdon's decision to rejuvenate the William Least Heat-Moon name. Whatever the consequences for the larger world, it was clear to me that the \\"Heat-Moon self\\" had led Trogdon to write one of the most important books on the prairie in American literature, a book that had had a profound impact on my own commitment to place. That fact alone suggested that what Heat-Moon had written about names was true, that they have he power to shape who we become in relation to the land around us. He writes:'Many tribal Americans believe that a person turns into his name, partakes of its nature in such a way that it is a mold the possessor comes to fill. When names lose their first meaning, as they have to most Americans of European descent, that mold becomes only a handle for others to move us around with.'\\""},{"Title":"Gangbusters: How a Street Tough, Elite Homicide Unit Took Down New York's Most Dangerous Gang","review":"I thought this book was a &quot;good read&quot; but not a &quot;great read.&quot; What keeps me from giving the five star endorsement are a number of factors:1. no pictures -- I didn't want to see any gory crime scene photographs, just pictures of the good and bad guys. Seeing faces tends to bring things to life.2. confusing -- There are hundreds of crimes and characters in the narrative. As a result, it got very confusing at times. I think the author should have thrown in some of the diagrams of the gangs and how they interacted with each other (like the way the prosecution explained things to the jury at the trial).3. a bit wordy -- I think the author could have trimmed twenty pages from his narrative by weeding out overly long biographical sketches of peripheral players and by eliminating the office politics story.4. dubious triumph -- I guess the elimination of the Wild Cowboys (aka &quot;Red Top&quot;) is a definite triumph. A bunch of killers were locked up. Crime in the area they operated in has gone down. But I feel a little queasy over the fact that two of the gang's leaders were allowed to plead out to non-life sentences for orchestrating crimes and street terrorism that merit, in my view, the death penalty."},{"Title":"Gangbusters: How a Street Tough, Elite Homicide Unit Took Down New York's Most Dangerous Gang","review":"If you live in suburbia and want to get a good picture of life in the inner city this is the book to read.

What would have made it better is if we had a more round about picture on the victims, and the perps.

He writes with energy and enthusiasm about the individuals involved in this unit, the bureaucratic struggles, the courts and jails, and you are left with a vivid sense of the work and difficulties faced by these investigators, prosecutors, and judges.He also has an excellent lead-in chapter about New York's economic decline and the changes of the 1960s and 1970s that coincided with the infestation of drugs; and the various political forces that impinged on the police force, including the anti-corruption efforts of reformers.This was a great read on a weekend day.

Unfortunately for readers, Stone completely squanders this golden opportunity. Dispite its interesting subject, this book is so poorly written, and ultimately so small-minded and tedious, it is virtually unreadable. By narrating the Manhattan DA's destruction of New York's infamous Wild Cowboys gang, Stone might well have presented an engaging and perhaps even important story. Instead, Stone self-indulgently chromicals the petty and irrelevant, as if proof of his own inside access is what matters to readers. Throughout the book, with no more than tabloid-level attention to the actual story, Stone delves into trivia of no significance or impact, leaving readers to wonder &quot;So what?&quot; Worse, the author strains to concoct unfalttering personal portraits of major players, while heaping praise upon marginal characters and functionaries. Stone serves up mere character assassination for District Attorney Robert Morgenthau and lead prosecutor Dan Rather Jr., while inexplicably gushing over others irrelevant to the success of the case. Stone wastes page after page in an unpersuasive attempt to make a hero of an administrator named Walter Arsenault who, as it turns out, himself neither investigated nor took the Wild Cowboys gang to trial. All this makes for unrewarding reading, and suggests that Gangbusters is the work of a hack writer bent on rewarding the vanity of his sources rather than the honest effort of a real journalist. Ultimately, even with full access to the elite of the Manhattan DA's office, Michael Stone either just didn't get the story, or couldn't deliver it to the reader. He would have served the story and readers far better by committing his attention to the real bad guys and the true heroes, such as the undercover cops who infiltrated the gang, the witnesses who took the stand, and the winning combination of lawyers and investigators who actually put the case together and made it stick."},{"Title":"Gangbusters: How a Street Tough, Elite Homicide Unit Took Down New York's Most Dangerous Gang","review":"This book caught my eye because I remember when the Wild Cowboys weren't in books but instead running the streets of Washington Heights and they were known as the Lenny Boys. Being a native New Yorker from Washington Heights, i only saw the good side of the Lenny boys lifestyle...the money, cars, weed, and women. Oh yes, they were making money illegally but from seeing these guys in the streets no one would ever imagine that they were responsible for so many murders in NYC.The book did a decent job in informing the reader of the investigation which lead to the downfall these drug-slingin' bandits but left out much of what was needed to understand Lenny and his compadres day to day lifestyles.I wish there were pictures in the book to bring to life these people who did things which are hard to believe actually happened, even for someone like me who was born and raised in the same streets these guys come from.This is a true story, without a doubt, but i feel maybe some parts were omitted and or exagerated to make the book much more dramatic. Also, the writer could have left out more of the political game that is played down in the DA's office and elaborated more on the events that earned the Lenny boys the title, Wild Cowboys.I would suggest this book to anyone who wants to get a taste of what it is like living in a neighborhood where crack dealers are as visible as the police themselves and wield just as much firepower as they do. But remember, it's only a taste!!!"},{"Title":"Gangbusters: How a Street Tough, Elite Homicide Unit Took Down New York's Most Dangerous Gang","review":"A wonderfully told story about crime and the crimefighters in NYC. Stone's book provides an insightful and often frightening look at gangs. The members and their actions are so vividly described one feels as if they are right there on the streets with the brave investigators. This is a chilling, moving, heroic story that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Not to be missed!!"},{"Title":"Gangbusters: How a Street Tough, Elite Homicide Unit Took Down New York's Most Dangerous Gang","review":"When we read about drugs, gangs and violence we wonder why the police aren't doing anything. Why are they allowing people, often innocent victims, to be gunned down in the streets. Further we wonder why the courts aren't doing more to put these malevolent violators of decency away. Gangbusters answers many of the questions citing politics and bureauracy as reasons why the police can't get the job done as well as they'd like to. Gangbusters takes the reader through a difficult attempt to rid a section of New York of a drug gang called the Cowboys who terrorized their portion of the city for years, often enlisting the paid help of children of tender years who would do anything for $30. A sepcial unit of prosecutors along with selected detectives dedicated years to bringing the Cowboys down and the good news is that they did, but it is how and what it took that comprises the story. Their frustration becomes the reader's frustration as time after time politics intrudes itself into a worthy effort that should have been helped along at every turn. An interesting slice of the tale is the involvement of newsman Dan Rather's son, Daniel Rather, a prosecutor, who for whatever reasons, causes problems with an already overburdened unit. This book is for everyone who wants to know more about how the greater world operates and the tragedies that lie outside our comfortable lives. Further, it is an eloquent statement about how the system fails to reward those who truly make a difference."},{"Title":"Gangbusters: How a Street Tough, Elite Homicide Unit Took Down New York's Most Dangerous Gang","review":"&quot;Gangbusters&quot; is an okay, but not a great book about criminals. You want a killer read about crime? Try &quot;Black Mass: The Irish Mob, The FBI and A Devil's Deal&quot; by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill. Now that's a wild book. And all true too."},{"Title":"Mad Power","review":"If you are a big fan of MAD's movie and television parodies then you want to know before you start flipping through the pages of \\"MAD Power\\" that you are not going to find any of the classics. Instead there are a couple of rather different types of parodies. \\"Song of Mighty Joe Kong,\\" drawn by Mort Drucker and written by Dick De Bartolo, combines \\"King Kong,\\" \\"Son of Kong\\" and \\"Mighty Joe Young\\" into a new film starring James Garner, Doris Day, and Dick Van Dyke (with Richard Burton as the title character). Unfortunately, I think you have to be raised on Doris Day films to really enjoy the merger of the giant ape film with her particular brand of movie comedy. Then Drucker teams up with Larry Siegel for \\"MAD Looks at a Typical Kiddie TV Show,\\" starring Uncle Nutsy. Again, it is the genre under comic assault more than a specific target.\\"MAD Power\\" was originally published in 1964, which means you have to remember that this was before the Beatles showed up on \\"The Ed Sullivan Show\\" and changed American pop culture, forcing the Usual Gang of Idiots at the magazine to retool. But if you are looking for what was funny during the Kennedy Administration, editor Albert B. Feldstein has provided a nice survey. The best indication of this is the \\"Famous People's Home-Study Courses\\" put together by artist Bob Clarke and writer Al Jaffee, which includes one from ten famous space travelers featuring not only Shepard and Glenn, but Laika the dog, Jose Jimenez, and Alfred E. Neuman. Frank Jacobs and all of the MAD artists put together a series of \\"MAD's Valentines to American Industry\\" and Dave Berg provides his \\"Lighter Side\\" looks at both Adult and Kids Parties.The other choice parts in this one are \\"I Got All the Finks I Need,\\" Bob Clarke and Larry Siegel's rejoinder to Charles Schulz's Peanuts book \\"I Need All the Friends I Can Get,\\" and the semi-complete issue of \\"Phony Magazine.\\" This parody of a specialty magazine (remember, this was before computers allowed such things to be targeted to any and all groups) includes ads for phony labels and phony accent lessons, a look at the \\"Phony of the Month,\\" and a test to find out how phony you are. You will also find several bits from Dave Martin, Spy vs. Spy, and Sergio Argonnes.The other thing to pay attention to here is the concerted efforts to warp the minds of America's children. Realizing that children's safety songs are usually based on old-fashioned subjects, such as playing with matches (e.g., \\"Bad, Bad, Matches\\" sung to the tune of \\"Frere Jacques\\"), Joe Orlando and Larry Siegel come up with some \\"Up-to-Date Safety Songs for Children\\" (e.g., \\"It's A Grand Old Bag\\" sung to the tune of \\"You're A Grand Old Flag\\"). Then there is Al Jaffee's \\"A Child's View of Newspaper Headlines\\" on things like \\"School Tax to Be Higher\\" and \\"South Vietnam Army Heads Removed.\\" This reprint collection is a nostalgic look at comedy from simpler times from warped minds, which is a pretty good combination to have when you go back that far."},{"Title":"Authentic Beauty: The Shaping of a Set-Apart Young Woman","review":"Fabulous book--even recommended to others!!!

As I sat down to read the updated and expanded edition, I didn't think that it could get any better--and was I wrong!Filled with insights and encouragements, this book challenges you to look beyond yourself toward a Savior that is offering that which we, as humans, often find the hardest things to do: forgiveness, love, and hope. Accompanied by writings from her husband, Eric Ludy, we glean insights on our earthly relationships with men as Ludy invites readers on a journey towards rediscovering the true meaning of femininity and falling in love with your Prince--Jesus Christ.Throughout this wonderfully written and laid back book, you feel as though you are chatting one on one with the author about your heart's deepest hurts and desires.

If I were a young girl reading this book I would not have a good image of men and sex after. In my opinion she lacked wisdom on her impressions toward young women,concerning men. I do not agree with her healing methods. Thinking on the pain of every brake up then releasing it to God. Why relive every pain? God does not require that of us. Repentance yes, but not the way she says. Putting God first is a great message, that is why I give this one star. I do believe she has good intentions but does come across a bit legalistic. This book is repetitive, and boring with some unessesary detail of sexual sins, and lofty expectations.This was a dissapointment after reading \\"God's gift to Women \\",of which I completely enjoyed."},{"Title":"Authentic Beauty: The Shaping of a Set-Apart Young Woman","review":"This book opened my eyes to truths about relationships that I had not seen before. I have read many books about relationships but this one stood apart in that it encouraged me to make my relationship with God central and to allow God to bring the guy into the picture for me and to build that relationship on the one I have already established with God. This book is very practical and challenging and a great read for any young woman who wants to find her confidence and security in her relationship with Christ rather than in a guy."},{"Title":"Authentic Beauty: The Shaping of a Set-Apart Young Woman","review":"Part One of Authentic Beauty is titled \\"The First Step - Understanding the Crisis Facing Modern Day Femininity.\\" Mrs. Ludy begins her book with heart-breaking stories of how her fairytale dreams of being a princess, finding a prince, and living happily ever after were trampled as a result of interaction with lusting, bullying young men and girls who sold themselves short in their pursuit of love and romantic attention. Leslie explains the threat to our hearts that is found in settling for the cheap substitutes for intimacy and true love that the world offers. In a beautiful description of how she first found her Prince, she awakens us to the fact that Jesus is the Prince we are all looking for. The inner yearning we all experience, whether we admit it or not, can be satisfied only in Jesus. Part Two: Lily Among Thorns - The Essence of a Set-Apart Young Woman pulls no punches. Mrs. Ludy issues a passionate call to lily-whiteness. She declares that total abandonment and set-apartness to Christ is crucial to experiencing intimacy with Him and knowing His true love to the fullest. She gives practical advice for \\"taking out the trash\\" and \\"kicking out other lovers\\" from our hearts and lives. Mrs. Ludy slashes through the world's erroneous assumptions that we require friends, success and romance in order to be happy and encourages us to trust Him to fulfill our every want and need. Part Three: Romantic Mystique-The Mystery of a Set-Apart Young Woman is a rousing call to protect the sacred sanctuary of our hearts. Part Four: Tender Reverence -The Passion of a Set-Apart Young Woman is full to the brim of practical guidance and steps we can take to cultivate daily intimacy with our Prince and delight in Him with every breath. This section also includes the foundation of a love story built upon Christ. The Studying Manhood inserts written by Eric Ludy are encouragement for the envisioning of warrior poets and offers tips for inspiring the young men in your life to aspire to such a standard.Authentic Beauty puts into plain language my longings and lifts my eyes continually to Jesus, the only One who can fulfill them. It is a declaration of the kind of disciples we should be as young women following Jesus Christ and a guidebook for how to just that."},{"Title":"Authentic Beauty: The Shaping of a Set-Apart Young Woman","review":"This book has the mark of a best-seller: a meaningful, life-changing message delivered in fun and entertaining writing style.

As someone who is dating right now, this book has brought encouragement and advice. I would highly recommend every Christian woman to read this. It will speak to your heart."},{"Title":"Authentic Beauty: The Shaping of a Set-Apart Young Woman","review":"This book is full of authentic, beautiful truths, and so much to take in that it's almost overwhelming! One of my dear blogging friends, Amanda, put it so well when she said that the author and her husband leave the reader \\"blessedly convicted\\" through their writing. So true! I certainly felt convicted seeing how short I fall of truly living every moment fully for the Lord. How often I allow myself to get distracted, even while knowing how important it is to passionately guard my time with the Lord--praying, reading the Bible, and worshiping Him. But I also felt blessed to be reminded of the preciousness of the relationship I have with God.There is so much to glean from these pages! Leslie Ludy does a wonderful job of pointing readers to God and reminding them of their need to focus always on Him. It is so easy to get sidetracked in this world, and so hard not to dwell on earthly romances (or the lack thereof). But God is so good, and there's absolutely nothing that can compare with spending time with Him and knowing Him!One of the few things that perhaps frustrated me a little about the book was the repetition. Certainly, there is nothing wrong with repeating important points so that the reader is sure to understand the main message. However, I think the repetitiveness of specific words and phrases was a bit overdone, although this is just one reader's opinion!Overall, though, I have been inspired by the Ludys' example. The inclusion of Eric Ludy's articles was helpful in gaining a good perspective of masculinity and how that affects femininity. And now that I've finished the book, I know I have so much I need to think about and actually apply to my life! If a book challenges you to draw closer to God and encourages you to put Him first and seek His will, then it's a book worth reading--and this book was both very challenging and wonderfully encouraging!"},{"Title":"Authentic Beauty: The Shaping of a Set-Apart Young Woman","review":"This book is very inspiring for young women.

I found myself constantly trying to be perfect because I didn't want to disappoint God, I didn't want to disappoint my future husband and I surely didn't want either of them to find me impure in any capacity.For someone who was raised in legalism, this book will only make it worse and push girls to believe that they are nothing if they have done anything \\"wrong\\" according to this text. My aim for perfection and purity put me so far over the edge that by the end of my freshman year of college I'd developed an eating disorder because I took Ludy's words SO personally. Certainly reading this isn't the only reason for that development but I will always, always believe that it is the legalism and inability to see someone past their mistakes that sent me into the darkest place I've ever been.When and if I have children, they will not know books like Ludy's exist. It disgusts me the fundamentalism texts like this perpetuate and the damage it does to those who have never been taught how to love someone in spite of their mistakes."},{"Title":"Authentic Beauty: The Shaping of a Set-Apart Young Woman","review":"This book is more for younger girls who are in middle school or high school, especially girls who find it difficult and confusing to avoid listening to the world's perspective of their beauty, their relationship with God and their interactions with guys. Or it would be a very helpful book to read in a discipleship or mentorship with such a young woman (or a group of them).Though the prose is often flowery and verbose (pleasant to some and not others), Leslie gracefully and powerfully presents the importance of knowing God before you're ready to think about dating. She often uses her own experiences too much and too repeatedly instead of cutting to the chase, but they are usually helpful. It's nice to have a young, real author who's gone through the struggles herself, rather than an old, angelic writer harping on the younger generation.All in all, this is an extremely helpful book to start up discussion and provide ideas for building one's intimicy with Christ above all and through all."},{"Title":"Authentic Beauty: The Shaping of a Set-Apart Young Woman","review":"In \\"Authentic Beauty,\\" Leslie Ludy does a magnificent job at convincing young women that they are beautiful just the way God made them. She stresses the importance of falling in love with our \\"true Prince\\" (Jesus) before being able to fall in love with another man. Ludy assumes a very approachable style as she writes, and even tells her readers that she wants to speak to them as though they are best friends talking in a coffee shop. Ludy uses allusion, anecdotes, and listing to make her purpose of teaching women to love themselves clear and appealing to the reader. The basis of the book is a woman's relationship with God and how that affects her life; therefore, allusions to the Bible and Christ are sprinkled generously throughout the book. Every one of the 4 parts of the book begins with a Scripture quote such as: \\"My beloved is mine and I am his; he delights in the lilies(111).\\" These quotes help to tie the theme of the book together: to be lily white (pure for God). Ludy also tells many stories from her personal life such as when she was in elementary school and boys would tease her and her friends because they hadn't \\"developed\\" yet. These brief anecdotes help the reader to relate to the author and believe that the author is someone the reader can trust for advice, like a friend. Finally, Ludy uses lists to make it easier for the reader to look at and understand the information being presented. She lists questions young women should ask themselves about how they relate to the opposite sex in order to see if the young women themselves are \\"set apart\\" for their future husbands. She also lists the assumptions girls live under such as \\"[t]o have a successful future, a young woman must carefully follow society's pattern for success,\\" and why they are examples of unhealthy thinking(85). These lists help young women to evaluate what is truly important in life and apply those concepts in real life situations. I greatly enjoyed this book and believe it is absolutely not a one-time kind of read. This book helped me to realize my own self-worth and that the \\"perfect guy\\" will come around when God, he, and I are ready."},{"Title":"Authentic Beauty: The Shaping of a Set-Apart Young Woman","review":"This book is a must-read for any christian young woman. Leslie Ludy shines above most christian authors for young women as she shares her own story and how she has grown in her personal relationship with Jesus. I love this book more than any other &quot;chritian living&quot; book because you don't feel like you're being preached to, but instead that you're sitting down and having a heart to heart with a best friend. But be prepared to really study this book if you purchase it! There is a wealth of knowledge to be gained, it has been a totally awesome inspiration in my life.Also, if you purchase this book, buy a spiral or make a place in your journal for notes and things....you will have the urge to write about what you've learned!"},{"Title":"Authentic Beauty: The Shaping of a Set-Apart Young Woman","review":"Authentic Beauty was a disappointing read for me. I thought Leslie Ludy had some wonderful things to say and it is clear that she loves the Lord. However, the book was extremely repetative. I kept expecting her to dive into some really intense issues, but in the end it was all very surface. I'm a college student and i lead a small group of college girls. I got this book thinking it would really challenge us. However, it didn't. This book would best serve younger girls, probably middle school age, who are still learning what it means to follow Christ."},{"Title":"Authentic Beauty: The Shaping of a Set-Apart Young Woman","review":"As a fan of the Ludy's, I was really interested to read \\"Authentic Beauty\\". I had really mixed feelings about it though.I liked the concept of the book: pursuing a more intimate relationship with Jesus Christ and discovering the beauty of being a woman. However, I felt like half the book was a reiteration of her and her husband's book, \\"When Dreams Come True\\". This seemed to be a \\"filler\\" because the rest of book is so REPETITIVE.Every other word in the book is \\"Prince\\", \\"Beautiful Prince\\", \\"Your Prince, Jesus Christ\\", etc. The whole book reads like this, literally. I was actually sick of it by chapter 3, but finished the book to see if it would get better and if she used a thesaurus. It does not and it's clear that she didn't.Her message is very genuine, but the repetitiveness totally overshadows it. This would be a good book for a pre-teen who has not read yet delved into the religious self-help genre, but college-age women and older might be turned off by Mrs. Ludy's unfortunate childishness.Unfortunately this book is bubble-gum-pop-princess to the Nth degree. Could have been better. Highly recommend \\"When God Writes Your Love Story\\" over this one."},{"Title":"Authentic Beauty: The Shaping of a Set-Apart Young Woman","review":"I loved this book. This book challenged me to not live like everyone else, but to live a life set apart for my Prince, Jesus. Leslie is candid about what she's been through and how she got through it. She also gives you great teaching on how to live the set apart life. This book changed me. How? By helping me grow closer to my Prince, Jesus and fall in love with him all over again."},{"Title":"Authentic Beauty: The Shaping of a Set-Apart Young Woman","review":"I would like to get my one complaint about this book out of the way, and that complain is Leslie Ludy's overuse of the phrase \\"Lily-white\\"; Other than that there is nothing wrong with this book. In fact I would say that as usual the Ludy wrote a timely and much needed portrait of what Godly purity is. Non-Christian women see no need for purity, and even Christian women begin to shake their heads after a while because no one ever explained why God requires us to be pure.As I said before Ludy does use the phrase \\"Lily-white\\" a lot, and probably could've been a little more creative in that respect, and felt that in trying to reitterate her point she was making me feel like a third-grader. At the same time, because many women(especially young women) are not accustom to what purity means, she uses that phrase to make her point of what purity means.Ludy uses a lot of personal testimonies about how she lived a not so pure life growing up. She explains that even though she grew up in the church, she was just always taught not to \\"go all the way\\". Now, I know that growing up I was told the same thing by my parents, and they never told me what true puroty was. Leslie uses her personal experience and other woman's experiences to explain what true purity is. It is purity in your mind and heart, it is about being wholly blameless before the Lord. She explains that it is not something we can achieve on our own, and involves a lot of one on one time with Jesus Christ who purifies us as we draw closer to him.I felt the most important message in this book for Christian women to get is that we will never be fulfilled by a man. It is only we we come to our savior just as we are and seek fulfillment in him, then we will feel whole and satisfied. A husband is nice, but the only thing a husband is for, is to help draw us into the presence of the Lord, not to fulfill and meet all of our needs (although they can meet many of them).Marriage will not solve all your problems, in fact it will create many new ones that you never knew existed. This is why Paul states that it is \\"better\\" to be singlke than married; although that as he said, is his opinion, and not necassarily God's view. It is up to God whether or not you get married, but if you are married or unmarried no matter your age, this is a great book to read to discover the true meaning of purity. :DGod Bless ~Amy"},{"Title":"Authentic Beauty: The Shaping of a Set-Apart Young Woman","review":"To any woman out there who longs to be a beautiful, white, princess and is longing for your Knight in Shining Amour...this book is for you.

I have often spent many nights staying awake reading their books over and over. Authentic beauty was no different. This book is a must read for ever girl, young and old. It shows God's heart for a women. Every girl longs to hear that they are someone's beloved and every girl wants to feel beautiful. In our generation we often turn to mankind to me that need, but that is only a need that God can feel. Mankind's version of beauty can fade, but God is unconditional. His love for us never wavers. I had the amazing opportunity to meet with Leslie a few years back when I was a senior in High School at Summit ministries in Colorado, and I was able to here her and Eric speak on Courtship and dating and lets just say that after reading their books you will never look at Love the same. It makes me want to hold out and be patient for God to bring the one person he created for me to be with. Our world is so fixed on instant gratification, but true love is worth waiting for, it is worth fighting for!"},{"Title":"Authentic Beauty: The Shaping of a Set-Apart Young Woman","review":"I read this book when it first came out and I was completely blown away by the message!

It shows how true beauty dosn't come from the outside, but what is in your heart, a heart dedicated 100% to God and his will for your life! It might be hard to accept some of the issues she address, but in the end it is a beautiful way of life that makes complete sense!

I found this book to be a great resource and passed the Psychology CLEP with an \\"A\\". It only has two practice tests but they are fairly detailed. The information in the text is a little light and sometimes confusing. I had to look at a few other sources to figure out what this book left out, specifically on the structure of the brain and brain stem.

I read this book, took the practice exams and then looked at the practice exam in the official book from the college board and realized that a lot of it wasn't covered here.

The stories are great and talks about places in the USA. I highly recommend this book to all children. It seems that the old folk tales are being lost and it's great to find stories that keep them alive."},{"Title":"Paul Bunyan Swings His Axe","review":"PAUL BUNYAN SWINGS HIS AXE by Dell McCormick is a 111 page hardcover book. The cover is noted for its sturdiness. The pages are made of thick paper, almost like thin cardboard. Inside the front cover is a 2-page spread, in green ink, showing a map of the United States. The map shows little images from various Paul Bunyan stories, e.g., an upside down mountain, Babe the blue ox, the giant pancake griddle, Paul Bunyan dragging his axe thereby creating the Grand Canyon, etc. The book contains 22 black and white ink drawings. The drawings are all in a simple style, to some extent resembling the no-nonsense pen & ink drawings that were once used in newspaper advertisements for supermarket produce.There are 17 stories in this book, and 21 stories in another book by the same author, called, TALL TIMBER TALES MORE PAUL BUNYAN STORIES. At any rate, of the 17 stories, the second tells about Paul's discovery and rescue of Babe. The third discloses Paul's invention of the double bladed axe. The next story tells about a ten acre griddle pan, where cookhouse boys skated with bacon strapped on their feet in order to grease the pan. Another story tells how Johnny Inkslinger invented an eraser that only erased mistakes, and left accurate numbers intact. Further on into the book, we find a story disclosing how the fog in North Dakota was so thick that it confused the fish, and the fish swam out of the streams and through the fog, and that the fog was so thick that lumberjacks had to chop a tunnel through it. The 12th story tells how the heat in Arizona was so intense that the sacks of corn carried by Paul Bunyan's lumberjacks started to pop, and how everybody (except Paul) thought that the popcorn was snow, and that they all put on heavy coats to keep warm.The book presents the Paul Bunyan legend in a straightforward and dignified manner. In contrast, a number of more recently published Paul Bunyan stories contain colored pictures in a comic book style similar to that in the Curious George books. I prefer a more dignified drawing style for Paul Bunyan stories. Rockwell Kent, who illustrated an edition of Melville's MOBY DICK, is the type of illustrator that I believe to be best for Paul Bunyan stories.I also recommend a fine recording, available on compact disc and cassette tape, of PAUL BUNYAN, read by famed actor and comedian Jonathan Winters. The reading is accompanied by the guitar of famed folk-musician Duck Baker. Jonathan Winters' recording can be found on the RABBIT EARS label.

When they are barely off the boat, the ganster has his wife murdered, and now the young man is left framed for the murder in a country where he has no friends and doesn't speak the language. This story is his struggle to clear himself while staying out of the hands of the authorities, find the real killer(s), and exact revenge.While it starts out as a very promising noir thriller, Woolrich's pulp magazine writing roots show through, and the action turns into a &quot;fast-action whiz-bang&quot;, with the story-line moving at breakneck speed through opium dens, Cuba, and the United States. Fortunately, Woolrich was very good at writing whiz-bangs, and much noir remains in the story. It is a shame, though, that the story has an almost schizophrenic nature.It's an enjoyable stor! ! y, but not one of Woolrich's best. By all means read it, but try to find some of his better &quot;black&quot; novels, such as &quot;Rendezvous in Black&quot;, or his William Irish novels, such as &quot;Phantom Lady&quot;, too."},{"Title":"The Black Path of Fear","review":"The Black Path of Fear is formulaic (read: okay, but not a classic) Woolrich crime novel. As usual we have a lead character under duress, with Woolrich turning up the heat. Predictable? Yes, generally. However Woolrich treats us with a rather surprising ending.The story is simple. A down-and-out guy gets a job as a gardener for a rich Miami gangster (timeframe: circa 1940). He gets into a brief relationship with the gangster's wife, and both escape to Havana. Naturally things go badly, and our leading man finds himself running through the seedy parts of Havana to escape capture from the police. His saviour is a most unusual Cuban woman (a compassionate criminal with extreme hatred of the police). Along the way we are treated with encounters by masochistic thugs, drug smugglers and opium addicts.Bottom line: an enjoyable, escapist read. Worth a look."},{"Title":"The Hidden Encyclical of Pius XI","review":"This is an interesting tale of an encyclical that never saw the light of day, especially because it was an encyclical against racism clearly aimed at Hitler. But the authors misintepret the document's import.They act as if this draft encyclical would have been the first time the Church denounced the Third Reich's anti-Semitism. In fact, Pius XI had solemnly condemned it in the encyclical Mit Brennender Sorge (1937), written in German and read from the pulpit of every German church. He also denounced it in several addresses to the College of Cardinals.They also miss the fact that Pius XII incorporated large chunks of this encyclical into the first encyclical he published after being elected pope in 1939. As Pierre Blet shows in his fine work on the Vatican archives, Pius XII continued to hammer home the Church's opposition to anti-Semitism in many cables to papal ambassadors, authorizing them to save Jewish lives through Vatican passports, false baptismal certificates, and the granting of sanctuary in church buidlings.The &quot;hidden encyclical&quot; only confirms the public words and actions of Popes Pius XI and XII against racism, especially in its Nazi guise. Oddly, however, the authors twist this evidence into something suggesting just the opposite."},{"Title":"The Hidden Encyclical of Pius XI","review":"The concept of this book was admirable and the text of the encyclical is intriguing but a lot of the narrative is dull and repetitive.

It was too academic in my mind and less papal. But back to the detective work - ultimately I found the book to be overly ambitious (the subject doesn't warrent it) and somewhat arrogant as if the encyclical itself is above the Church and must be taken to be heavenly.

It does not contain any Modernist error such as that Adam and Eve were not real people, but rather a fable.The Bible History also helped me understand the Bible closer than before.

For years, women have been expected to be silent on this journey, this momentous passage from youth and fertility to another place, where mind and body change, expand, contract in so many surprising ways. How welcome it is to have Yitta Halberstam break this silence. How wonderful to listen to eloquent women discussing vital transformations, which, like so many other human experiences from childhood to old age, we (both men and women) are encouraged not to talk about. Momentous passages, like the first day of school, traveling alone to an unknown place, starting a new job, are usually greeted with: \\"that's part of life;\\" don't make a big deal about it;\\" \\"everyone gets through it, you will too.\\" Ms. Halberstam has created a room where women can share their experiences from youth through middle-age; where they can describe how they are re-learning and re-conceiving bodies and minds they have inhabited for forty and fifty years. The essays in \\"Changing Course\\" (including some beautiful ones written by Ms. Halberstam herself) have been edited with discretion and insight. A few of the essays might, possibly, ring truer if they left off that final sentence declaring, in summation, that the experience of aging is valuable, instructional, uplifting.

All revolutionary Marxists, following Marx's lead, have studied the lessons of the Commune from various angles and have essentially drawn the same lessons as he did. Therefore the essential points are covered by Trotsky. Additionally, here you get the Marx's masterful contemporary analysis of the events and his adamant defense of the Communards before the international working class. I might add one note which Lenin and others incorporated into their strategies. One of the few, if only substantial revisions that Marx made in his seminal document the Communist Manifesto was to revamp his understanding of the state after the takeover by the working class. In 1848 he assumed that the working class would take over the capitalist state as is. Reflecting on the Paris Commune experience he dramatically changed that factor and held that the working class would have to smash the old state machinery and develop its own institutions. This is in line with previous revolutionary history, especially the experience of the French Revolution. Frederich Engels' introduction, later the subject of some controversy in the international social democracy is an added highlight.All militants pay homage to the memory of the Commune. For a historical narrative of the events surrounding the rise and fall of the Commune look elsewhere. However, if you want to draw the lessons of the Commune this book offers a superior strategic study. Not surprisingly Trotsky, the organizer of the Russian October Revolution in 1917 and creator of the Red Army, uses the strength and weaknesses of the Commune against the experiences of the October Revolution to educate the militants of his day. Today some of those lessons are still valid for the international labor movement in the seemingly one-sided class struggle being waged against it.When one studies the history of the Paris Commune of 1871 one learns something new even though from the perspective of revolutionary strategy the Communards made virtually every mistake in the book. Nevertheless, one can still learn lessons and measure them against the experience acquired by later revolutionary struggles and above all by later revolutions, not only the successful Russian Revolution of October 1917 but the failed German, Hungarian, Bulgarian, Chinese and Spanish revolutions in the immediate aftermath of World War I. More contemporaneously we also have the experiences of the partial victories of the later Chinese, Cuban and Vietnamese revolutions. Trotsky's analysis follows this path.Notwithstanding the contradictory nature of later experiences cited above, and as if to show that history is not always totally a history of horrors against the fate of the masses, Trotsky honored the Paris Commune as a beacon of the coming world socialist revolution. It is just for that reason that Karl Marx fought tooth and nail in the First International to defend it against the rage of capitalist Europe and the faint-hearted elements in the European labor movement. It is truly one of the revolutionary peaks.The Commune nevertheless also presented in embryo the first post-1848 Revolution instance of what was to be later characterized by Lenin at the beginning of World War I as the crisis of revolutionary leadership of the international labor movement. Moreover, after Lenin's death this question preoccupied Trotsky for much of the later part of his life. Trotsky's placing the problems facing the Commune in this context made me realize that this crisis really has a much longer lineage that I had previously recognized. Unfortunately, that question is still to be resolved.Many working class tendencies, Anarchist, Anarcho-Syndicalist, Left Social Democratic and Communist justifiably pay homage to the defenders of the Paris Commune and claim its traditions. Why does an organization of short duration and subject to savage reprisals still command our attention? The Commune shows us the heroism of the working masses, their capacity to unite for action, their capacity to sacrifice themselves in the name of a future, more just, organization of society. Every working class tendency can honor those qualities, particularly when far removed from any active need to do more than pay homage to the memory of the fallen Communards.Nevertheless, as Trotsky notes, to truly honor the Communards it is necessary to understand that at the same time the Commune shows us the many times frustrating incapacity of the masses to act in their objective interests, their indecision in the leadership of the movement, their almost always fatal desire to halt after the first successes. Obviously, only a revolutionary party can provide that kind of leadership in order fight against these negative traits. At that stage in the development of the European working class where political class consciousness was limited to the vanguard, capitalism was still capable of progressive expansion and other urban classes were at least verbally espousing socialist solutions it is improbable that such an organization could have been formed. Nevertheless such an organization was objectively necessary.It is a truism in politics, including revolutionary politics, that timing is important and many times decisive. As Trotsky noted seizure of power by the Commune came too late. It had all the possibilities of taking the power on September 4, 1870 rather than March 18, 1871 and that would have permitted the proletariat of Paris to place itself at the head of the workers of the whole country in their struggle. At the very least, it would have allowed time for the workers of other cities and the peasantry in the smaller towns and villages to galvanize their forces for action in defense of Paris and to create their own communes. Unfortunately the Parisian proletariat had neither a party, nor leaders forged by previous struggles that could or would reach out to the rest of France.Moreover, a revolutionary workers' party, while entirely capable of using parliamentary methods is not, and should not, be a machine for parliamentary wrangling. In a revolution such activity at times amounts to parliamentary cretinism. The Central Committee of the National Guard, the embodiment of organizational power, had more than its share of such wrangling and confusionist politics. In contrast, a revolutionary party is the accumulated and organized experience of the proletariat. It is only with the aid of the party, which rests upon the whole history of its past, which foresees theoretically the road forward, all its stages, and knows how to act in the situation, that the proletariat avoids making the same historical mistakes, overcomes its hesitations, and acts decisively to seize power. Needless to say those same qualities are necessary to retain power against the inevitable counter-revolutionary onslaught. The proletariat of Paris did not have such a party. The result was that the revolution broke out in their very midst, too late, and Paris was encircled. Like other revolutionary opportunities six months delay proved fatal. Capitalism cruelly exacted its revenge. That is a great lesson of the Commune, for others read this book."},{"Title":"The civil war in France","review":"This has been a tremendously influential collection of analyses, essential for undetstanding revolutions in Russia, Asia, Africa and Latin America. But this edition is so flawed by typos, repeated misspellings (Theirs for [Adolphe]Thiers, for example) and other errors as to be nearly unradable. Also, it lacks the helpful notes common to other editions. A much better edition is available free on Scribd."},{"Title":"COLD COMPANY","review":"I liked this book. The Alaska setting and the protagonist Jessie Arnold being a dog sled racer gave the story an unusual side. The characters were good. The story line was interesting. The ending was surprising. I'd recommend it to those who like mysteries set in the outdoors, like Nevada Barr's series about Anna Pidgeon."},{"Title":"Mandarin Chinese dictionary: Chinese-English","review":"This is a review of the Mandarin Chinese-English Dictionary: Chinese-English by Fred Fangyu Wang. (There is also an English-Chinese volume of this dictionary, which I have not looked at yet.)This is actually a very good dictionary, but only for a very narrow group of readers. If you are learning Chinese, and do not have any other dictionary, this is NOT the one you should start out with. However, if you already have a good basic Chinese-English dictionary, and you are still not satisfied with your fluency in modern Chinese, this will be a worthwhile addition to your collection.This dictionary is organized phonetically according to Pinyin romanization (with tone marks), with a radical index in the back. (If you do not know what I'm talking about, then this dictionary is not for you, and you do not need to read on.) Perhaps its greatest weakness is that it is far from comprehensive. Really, no dictionary is, not even the Hanyu Da Cidian. But there are plenty of fairly common compound expressions that you will not find here. A further quirk is that the entries are arranged alphabetically by WORDS, rather than by SYLLABLES. For example, in a standard dictionary, JIUJING (\\"grain alcohol\\") would be right before JIULIANG (\\"ability to hold one's liquor\\"), because both begin with the syllable JIU (\\"alcohol\\"). But in this dictionary JIUJING and JIULIANG are separated by JIUJINSHAN (\\"San Francisco\\") and JIUJIU (\\"maternal uncle\\") and JIU/alcohol occurs two pages earlier, because the organization is strictly alphabetical by complete words.However, there is one strength that makes this dictionary quite useful in its own way. Professor Wang provided sample sentences for most of the words (multiple sentences in some cases). And the sample sentences are written in both characters AND pinyin romanization with tones! So this dictionary is really a treasure-trove of sample sentences by a native speaker, arranged in dictionary format. There are other dictionaries that do this, but this is the most comprehensive set of sample sentences I have seen in a dictionary. (If you know of a better dictionary for this purpose, PLEASE let me know.)On a personal note, I'm just kind of fond of this book. Like so many books that have been reprinted by Dover, this book is charmingly quirky, but we would have suffered a loss if it stayed out of print. The original work was published in 1967. It was obviously produced using an ordinary typewriter with the characters written in by hand (!). Don't worry: the calligraphy is painfully precise and clear. If you didn't know better, you might mistake it for a font. I'm old enough to remember when one couldn't do characters with a computer, so I appreciate how much work went into this volume. Finally, I feel an affectionate debt to people like Professor Wang, who taught the Chinese language back when only a handful of missionaries, linguists and government employees learned it. (Wang wrote a dictionary for the U.S. \\"War Department\\" in 1945 [p. v].)So if you are a student of modern Chinese who is already equipped with one or more standard dictionaries, I recommend this book as an addition to your library."},{"Title":"Mandarin Chinese dictionary: Chinese-English","review":"A Chinese dictionary is no different than any other bilingual dictionary.The words that seems to be out of order for an english speaker were ub actual phonetic, spelling order for the Chinese who might be searching for his multiple \\"syllable word\\" because he or she wanted an English translation.The rooman alphabet is actually used correctly:Jiu (= alcohol)Jiu-jing (= grain alcohol},jiu-jin-shan (= San Francisco),jiu-jiu (= Maternal uncle),jiu-liang (= ability to hold one's liquor).The so-called syllables are actually individual words, each done with one character. These are spelled out in romanized text to make it clear to a new student that it is in alphabetical order even in Chinese. Each group of syllables create an ideogram, or better thought of as a \\"phrase,\\" A Chinese person would recognize his or her phrase since the phrase indicates the idea presented. i.e. San Francisco is built on a Shan (mountain-side). The Jiu-Jin part is probably a long lost concept years ago after the first Chinese landed in San Francisco.When the radicals are indexed, they are usually done in the number of strokes (or lines) it takes to create the character. It is not difficult to find the character desired by counting the strokes since most of them within the original \\"radical\\" are also created and noted as such, with the number of lines needed to make the character in the \\"radical\\" list.Don't know the characters for the numbers, count the number of lines in the characters below the \\"number\\" and one learns quickly those basic numbers. It is a very helpful exercise in learning your way around the Chinese characters.The four tones are easy to understand also. - / V and \\\\, to further simplify the tones, they are numbered in roman numbes as: 1, 2 , 3, 4.This numbers are usually written next to the romanized \\"characters\\".If you are interested enough to learn Chinese any Chinese-English orC-Spanish or C-German dictionary is an excellent place to start learning to recognize the components of each character.Mandarin Chinese Dictionary: Chinese-English"},{"Title":"Mandarin Chinese dictionary: Chinese-English","review":"Had I been aware that there was no pronunciation guide for the entries in the dictionary, I wouldn't have wasted the money. I bought it for Chinese in-laws who are over for a visit so that they could learn to speak some English phrases. It was totally useless for this purpose."},{"Title":"Labyrinth: A Maze of Metaphysical Mysteries","review":"All I have to say is &quot;WOW&quot; I am completely enchanted by this writer's book and ideas. These short stories are so suspenseful and addicting, I want to read and read, keep turning the page after page and the next thing you know, you've read more than half the night away and you have to get up bright and early to tend to the kids. LOL Really, this is one talented writer and this is one great book and it has something in it for everybody. I don't want to give anything about it away but it is one of my new favorites, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Labyrinth: A Maze of Metaphysical Mysteries","review":"I absolutely love ALL of Ray Fraser's books and can honestly say I have never had a disappointing read. This also holds true for Labryinth: A Maze of Metaphysical Mysteries. The stories contained within will leave you wanting more! Ray Fraser has done it again!"},{"Title":"Labyrinth: A Maze of Metaphysical Mysteries","review":"It was worth the wait. I had heard for some time that Ray was going to release his collections of short stories. It was worth the wait. These stories would make a great television series. Each story made me want to read the next. Labyrinth was a great read. Very professionally and suspensefully done."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Noncommutative Differential Geometry and its Physical Applications (London Mathematical Society Lecture Note Series)","review":"This book is (partially) the answer to my prays: an introductory book on noncommutative geometry, something I've been waiting since I discovered the topic in Connes' seminal text, which I've also reviewed here. Instead of exposing the historical origins, then firing a goddamn chaingun of advanced topics (something quite fascinating, because of the potential of the theory, but not pedagogical), Madore uses a more friendly way of exposing things, by mantaining a compromise between the most natural motivations to the techniques of the subject and the places where the background needed is not so overwhelming. He do teach much of the background (in the sense that you don't need to master functional analysis, operator algebras and advanced differential geometry), but he goes quite fast on it, requiring a rather mature mathematical mind. As noncommutative geometry is not for the faint of the heart, I guess he's not asking too much after all.The pedagogy of the book is also benefitted from the post-&quot;Connes' book&quot; evolution of noncommutative geometry, because in 1999 the theory and its (real and potential) applications were a great deal more mature and solid than in 1994. Being this theory a work in progress, the better the math knowledge the reader has, the more he or she will learn from Madore's book, which stands maybe as the only pedagogical exposition of noncommutative geometry (now I'm waiting for the huge book from Garcia-Bondia and his colaborators, to be published by Birkhauser in 2001, hope that it contains more background; it would be very useful for those interested in beginning research on the area)."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Noncommutative Differential Geometry and its Physical Applications (London Mathematical Society Lecture Note Series)","review":"FOR PHYSICIST, I strongly reccomend this book! There are so many physical examples in this book. Always we physicists hate mathamatical proofs like a torture. But this book concentrates applications to physics. If you want to study Noncommutative Geometry as a physicist, this book should be chosen as the first introduction!"},{"Title":"A Matter of Life Or Death: the Incredible Story of Krebiozen","review":"Bailey painstakingly digs out the truth underlying the controversial drug, Krebiozen, and how the AMA sought to destroy the reputation and career of a great scientist, Dr. Andrew Ivy, who, after examining all the subjective and objective evidence based on hundreds of studies, concluded that Krebiozen had great promise and should be considered an often effective alternative in the treatment of cancer, especially when encountered in its late stages, when the patient was at death's door and had no other options. The AMA and ACS (American Cancer Society's) denunciation of a drug they considered useless in the treatment of cancer, however, was so effective that gullible doctors, reporters and the public largely believed them, being unable to accept that these \\"fine, upstanding institutions\\" could lie, even though the records maintained by the Krebiozen Research Foundation clearly showed that was exactly what they were doing: maliciously falsifying reports and claiming that testing at this and that hospital left no doubt that the drug was worthless, even when the records indicated that the hospitals in question had not tested the drug at all, or else did so in a very slipshod manner. Such has been the influence of these nefariously criminal institutes that you will still find any number of reports on the web testifying to the drug's utter lack of value. The evidence, however, is, according to Bailey, visible and clear: Krebiozen showed remarkable effectiveness in a good number of cases and virtually brought back several terminal only-days-to-live patients from the grave--and without any major side effects as well. A great read, fine drama, and a real tragedy!When you compare this story, however, with that of other cancer alternatives with great potential, however, such as laetrile and the Hoxsey herbs along with many others, the pattern is clear: they must be destroyed or relegated to experimental status so that the often lethal standard-of-care therapies (chemo, surgery, radiation) will have to be tried first. Then, when the patient has been poisoned, cut and burned almost to death and more of the same will do no good, they will allow the alternatives to have a go--at a time when they're sure to be least effective because of the victim's nearly destroyed immune system. This is not civilized but barbaric, bankrupt medicine at its most deadly! Patients are being left to die in agony when this and other alteratives can often, at the least, offer them a pain-free death and, at the most, a full recovery."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],x={key:0},H={key:1};function P(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",M,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",H,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",x,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const O=u(B,[["render",P],["__scopeId","data-v-20c4957a"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/48.md","filePath":"guide/48.md"}'),W={name:"guide/48.md"},R=Object.assign(W,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(O)]))}});export{j as __pageData,R as default};
