Witty, irreverant and down-to-earth. Having just gotten through the first year as a new mother, and finding that raising a baby \\"ain't all that\\" at times, this book was the perfect remedy. It's great reassurance that yes, you are normal if you don't always enjoying every aspect of raising your child and no, it doesn't mean you don't love your kid or are a bad mom. I highly recommend this book, especially for moms with kids around a year, as they will inevitably relate to what the author is going through. Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"gave as a gift and got rave reviews, even being passed on to other new moms-to-be"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I've read this book 3 times now and laughed just as much the third time as I did the first. This book is SO refreshing and Stefanie says things that we all are thinking but just won't say. I'm a Mom and wasn't offended by ANYTHING in this book. For those 1 or 2 of you giving this book a bad review, lighten up and quit taking you and your life so seriously! Life is too short!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"My son is 2 months old, and without having any major live-threatening problems, I feel like my husband and I have had every problem in \\"the book\\". Since we're the first in our group of friends to have kids, we felt very isolated going through this. Then I found this book at the bookstore, and decided to take a look, thinking it would probably be very stupid and hopefully at least mildly entertaining.When I FINALLY had a chance to read some, I laughed so hard I reread the first three chapters to my husband when he got home. The chapter on the trials of breastfeeding was, for us, so on point, and it felt so good to be able to laugh about the experience--something we hadn't been able to do before.I find Ms. Wilder-Taylor's writing a little crass and many of her references to pop culture go over my head (though I get her drift), but even so, she is a fantastic writer and I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"My wife is six months pregnant so she's been poring through all the New Mommy books -- and she read me so many quotes from \\"Sippy Cups\\" that I had to read it myself. Stefanie Wilder writes with pure, unadulterated honesty which as soon-to-be-parents we really appreciate. And it's really really funny. So funny that I've been quoting it at work - and guys at the office are now buying it for their wives and friends. I highly recommend it and will be the first in line to read whatever Stefanie Wilder writes next."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Based on the input of the recipient, it was read in one sitting and laughter ensued. It looked like fun to me as I glanced through it...a fun gift -- just the title alone for the wine Aficionado..."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I'm so glad that Stephanie wrote this book...it's the best laugh I've had in the five months since my baby was born. I was rolling around on the floor--well, practically--my husband was so happy to see me laugh again that ppl would have thought he was high (kidding, he wasn't). Though I didn't care for all the language and humor, I still fully recommend this book because it's so hilarious and REAL. When was the last time a book was written about motherhood that was REAL?? Huh??? One that admits that breastfeeding doesn't work for everyone and that the parenting philosophy books are NUTS? I loved this book!! Go buy it!!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"As a new mother, this book disturbed me. The \\"author\\" writes about her own experiences as if they are facts that ALL mothers are HONESTLY experiencing (and if they don't admit it then they are just lying and she doesn't trust them). I have no problem with people writing about their personal experiences and I certainly don't have to agree with their views; in fact, whether I agree with Wilder-Taylor is irrelevant. The problem I have is that she writes as if she is the authority over issues that she has only experienced first-hand. She uses a lot of, \\"you will feel...\\" \\"This will happen to you...\\" It's ironic because she writes at length about how she hates it when people tell her what to do or how to feel and yet that's what she does to her readers.She also over-simplifies just about everything she writes about and doesn't give factual information. For example, in her breastfeeding section she gives only 2 extreme scenarios: If you choose to breastfeed and are eventually successful at it then you are a breastfeeding nazi or you're a sane person who realizes formula is best (mothers I know don't fall into either extreme camp). Again - it's fine to share one's personal experience, but she attempts to give factual information and even brings in her own expert to back herself up. For example, she says that her pediatrician has not seen any differences between breastfed babies and formula fed babies in his practice. Ok, either she's lying or he lied to her. All one has to do is read statements based on years of research from the World Health Organization or the American Academy of Pediatrics to see that this is simply not statistically sound (you don't need a college degree or even a high school diploma to understand this).I know how excruciatingly painful and difficult breastfeeding is for many women (including myself). I know mothers, for a variety of reasons, who exclusively breastfeed, exclusively use formula, and breastfeed and supplement with formula. I do not judge women for their decisions as she clearly does which again is ironic as she's doing the same thing to her readers as she feels the lactation consultants, doula, La Leche League volunteers and complete strangers have done to her.In her chapter on \\"little braniacs\\" she writes, \\"if you're dying for your child to speak Chinese, why not adopt a Chinese kid? The upside is in a few years they can do your taxes. On the other hand, they'll cost you a bundle in car insurance.\\" Not only is this not funny, but it's extremely ignorant. She says a lot of things like this in her book which readers might interpret as \\"real\\" and \\"so hilarious\\" but why does one have to say, quite frankly \\"mean\\" things at the expense of others and others' choices? This has nothing to do with being \\"PC\\" at all, by the way. I simply think it's unfortunate when people need to make fun of other people to make themselves feel better.I believe that new mothers need to support one another (as she also says she believes, strangely enough). I also like it when new mothers are willing to admit that they are not perfect and it's refreshing when we can laugh at ourselves. Though Wilder-Taylor claims to do all of this, she actually just judges other new mothers and their decisions as well as puts them into 1 extreme camp or another in virtually every page. I felt like I was in high school again reading a book written from one of the \\"mean\\", not-so-bright girls, but I'll stop here. I don't want to stoop down to Wilder-Taylor's level."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Any \\"New Mom\\" book that is written with humor and honesty is OK is my book! Ms Wilder's book is refreshing, honest, and funny on many topics \\"new mom\\" related. She discusses many issues a \\"new mom\\" will encounter. She starts with the issue of \\"instant bonding\\" - what a relief to know that I was not only one to take a few weeks to fall in love. From there she discusses other biggie \\"new mom\\" topics - the realities of breastfeeding, bottle feeding, baby-blues, feeding solid foods, babysitters, venturing out with your newborn, other new mothers, handling friends without children, sex after baby, A-type mommies, and different parenting styles, and much more. This is a book you can read at one sitting or one topic at a time. The author's honest, witty style is engaging and entertaining, and I suspect will give many \\"New Moms\\" a peaceful night's sleep.It Gets Easier!: And Other Lies We Tell New Mothers"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This book is laugh out loud funny because it's so true! The chapter about the author's first Mommy & Me encounter is priceless. No book has better expressed the mixture of joy, dread, happiness and horror felt by new parents. It's like Kubler-Ross for the Kebbler Elves set. I raise my sippy cup to Ms. Wilder-Taylor."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I happen to catch Stefanie on television this week and first off fell in love with the title. Being a new mom I often feel that sippy cups should be for chardonnay. It can be a difficult time and I sometimes feel like I'm the only one who is going through it. But after flying through the book it was funny, made so much sense to me and really made me realize that everyone goes through the same stuff after giving birth. The book was filled with a lot of common sense, and really made me laugh which is always welcomed during this time. I've recommended this book to all my friends who are pregnant or have babies at home."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"AFter having 2 children and questioning myself constantly, this book made me feel that it was OK to have had the feelings I had. This is a REAL look at motherhood, as honest as it gets. There are no pretensions here, and every mother will relate to this book in some way. This is a MUST HAVE for new moms. Because Mommyhood is HARD and it's great to hear someone validate the frustrations that go along with the amazing journey of parenthood."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Can we all just agree that mothers in general are way too serious about child-rearing? What a breath of fresh air it is to read a book about parenting that is not only filled with valuable advice, but is also laugh-out-loud funny!Each chapter hilariously chronicles the emotional roller coaster of parenting from the inception of your nugget, to nipple sharing, and all the way through to color coded meals. A great read for someone who has a child or for anyone who has ever known a child. Or anyone who has been pregnant at one time or another."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This is perhaps the strangest \\"what to expect\\" book ever written. A funny and irreverent look at new parenthood, combined with some practical advice. Along the way she skews &uuml;bermoms, parenting fads, crazed \\"lactivists\\" (the kind of folks who think kids should be breast fed until college) and her own attempts at parenthood. If you are expecting, have kids, vaguely remember having children at some point, or just thinking about it, this is a book for you.And do not be put off by the title; fathers will enjoy the book too.Be warned, however, that it is a bit on the raunchy side, so if you are squeamish about those things, find another book."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"As the new parent of a now-8-month old, I don't have a ton of time to read. So when I sat down with a few spare minutes to read this one, maybe I set my expectations too high. I was hoping this book would be like talking to a funny, wise older friend or sister with children. Hearing both the ridiculous, comical anecdotes (which I know must be out there, since parenthood so far has been quite a crazy trip!) along side some valuable, serious advice. This book provided neither. The anecdotes were quick and gave a few chuckles, but lacked warmth and sincerity. I never got to know the author, her family or her new baby. She was just rattling off cliches and one-liners about the price of strollers or the prescription anti-depresseant drugs most new moms will want and then moving on to the next chapter. I chucked the book in the recycling bin tonight and am looking for a new one about motherhood that will teach me something and make me laugh. I know there must be some better ones out there!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"the funnies and hard core honest...before this one i thought Jenny McCarthy's \\"Baby Laughs\\" was the best to describe graphically and brutally honesty about new mommyhood experiences, but this one bit Jenny's...with no cover ups and political correctness...as is and as result a refreshing breath of fresh air for new moms...love it."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I bought this book for several of my friends who are new moms and/or pregnant and they all love it.

It tells the truth and the truth is always funny!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"If you're desperate to maintain some sense of normalcy in your new life as a parent then this is most definitely the book for you. New mom Stefanie Wilder-Taylor's hysterically brutal honesty will have you laughing out loud more times than you can count. And in between the laughter, you're breathing a huge sigh of relief that you're not alone - there are others out there just like you who are completely overwhelmed on this amazing journey! \\"Sippy Cups...\\" is truly a GOD-SEND for those of us who want to (try to!) successfully navigate through this magical, life-altering world of parenthood."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I picked this up after reading It Sucked and Then I Cried because I'm a new mom and I've been enjoying the \\"Mommy Books.\\" This book wasn't really worth it for more than $5 though. It's basically a collection of short essays almost all of which I feel was the author complaining about being a Mom and it was a very choppy read. There were some parts that were mildly funny but for the most part, you could hear this stuff if you just went out with a fellow Mommy girlfriend and had a glass of wine (or whine). I also felt that some of her text was polarizing. Moms come in many forms and while one Mom might not do something that another Mom would, I don't really care for any Mom passing judgment on another or making jokes at their expense. This author talked about being a Mom like being back in high school and the way she wrote the book was exactly like that: childish."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Yes, Ms. Wilder-Taylor does point out the more amusing aspects of pregnancy and motherhood, however her approach is not impressive. She needs to take her vulgar language and drinking habits back to the trailer park and leave the writing to someone with a lot more tact."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I was very excited to read this book after reading the great reviews. However, I couldn't even finish the second chapter about how there is no such thing as love at first sight, even with your baby. I absolutely fell in love at first sight with my baby, and I didn't care to read on as she claims that moms who say they fall in love at first sight are either high or lying to themselves. I'm not saying there is a problem if you don't fall in love at first sight, but she's pretty adamant that it's impossible. She's too opinionated for me. I returned it before I even finished the 2nd chapter."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Being a first-time mom I had so much reading this book. She gets right to the point with topics and she is \\"right on\\" with her assessments. A must read for all parents, especially those who take it too seriously."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I bought this sassy little book as a gift for 2 of my friends who are new moms. Before I wrapped them, I decided to page through the book while I was on the toilet. I was so entertained by the writing and personality that came through the short stories, i actually ended up on the john for 2.5 hours reading the book cover to cover. It was great, I mean fantastic, I ended up giving one of the books to my mom (instead of said new mom friend) as i know how much she loves funny books. I highly recommend \\"Sippy Cups\\" as a must-have books for new moms, potential moms, never-to-be moms and really ANYONE who enjoys genuine laughter."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I didn't make it far into this book before deciding it wasn't worth the frustration of reading further. The author writes as though she truly believes that every mother either does or should feel and act as she does. She seems to take constant apologetic shots at mothers that don't parent exactly as she does. The commentary borders being snide, yet begs acceptance and forgiveness by those whom are offended. I felt this from every nearly every chapter I read. Like false confidence.In my own parenting I did feel an instant bond with my newborn, breastfed for two years, shared a bed with my son until he decided to move to his own bed, cloth diapered, and made my own babyfood. My issue with this book wasn't that the author chose to handle motherhood differently, but that it was constantly insinuated that those who choose the attachment parenting route are doing so for moot reasons. The author obviously feels as though it is unacceptable for others to force their values on her, and her child. I think it's safe to say that most, if not all, mothers feel this way. But, is the act of chiding \\"lactivists\\" any more mature or full of respect? Suddenly, women that realize that in FACT breastmilk IS superior to formula are supposed lunatics in need of some lightening-up.I couldn't relate to this book at all, and grew very tired of the poorly masked defensiveness and the use of the word \\"bizzotch.\\" Yet I see where it would be enjoyable for people who actually agree, and parent within this author's own style. All in all, I perceived what I read as a constant pat on the back, both to the writer, and her pals."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I'm not, and honestly, this is one of the funniest books I've read in I don't know how long. I saw the author on the Today show, and I have a couple of friends who are expecting, so I decided to get a couple copies for them. Well, I flipped open the book to check it out and seriously couldn't put it down. I'm talking laugh out loud funny. I hope she continues to write books that pertain to parenting as her child grows--I know when I have kids it would be much appreciated! Oh, and my two friends who are expecting both thanked me profusely for getting it for them as well."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I bought this book for a friend who just had a baby, intended just to glance at it myself, but ended up reading it cover to cover -- and laughing all the way through it! This book is so funny and SO TRUE! A MUST-READ for all new moms -- and a hilarious one for \\"old\\" moms too."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This book is so refreshingly true and SO funny. It's bad enough being a first time Mom-to-be but the Mom squads with all their different \\"techniques and methods\\" are frankly quite scarey. Stephanie Wilder-Taylor lets you know that common sense should prevail and listening to your gut will yield the right answer more often than listening to the \\"experts\\". I laughed out loud at her rendition of her first Mommy and Me experience and stories of unwanted advice. I have already sent this book to my niece in England. Can't wait for the sequal."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This book is great! I was starting to go just a little bit insane taking care of my newborn and this book pulled me back from the edge. It got me laughing again (which was something that my husband hadn't been able to do in weeks) and really made me take a step back and find the humor in the stuff that I was going through. It was actually almost too funny, I'd bust out laughing while rocking the baby (reading with one hand whild holding the baby with the other is a wonderful skill to develope) and wake her up again!Hilarious and sneakily insightful, this book is worth it's weight in gold. It was instrumental in getting me through those awful Baby Blues.I will definitely buy copies for any of my friends and family who become parents."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book, but after reading a few pages of gratuitous cursing, I closed the book. I admit that Wilder-Taylor is funny, but I personally got distracted by the foul language."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Seriously so funny and real - read it after my third baby and almost peed myself but also wish I had read it before my twins were born, its the kinda stuff about motherhood no one really tells you. Instead of giving gobs of unwanted advice, im totally going to recommended (or most likely give this book) to all my mew mommy friends. Also, I totally want to be this girls friend."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I really wish I would've read this book before I had my baby. There are so many things to feel insecure about when you're a first time Mother and Stefanie Wilder-Taylor helps you put them in perspective with her comedy. At times I laughed with her, others at her, and even at myself at times. Had more than one snort laugh while reading this book. Caution, she can be a little crude sometimes, but I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I have never written a review for a product, but this book helped me through tough times! I loved it! It is not for the super mom types, but perfect office you find yourself struggling with new mommy hood. I felt as if she was reading my mind and writing my journal. It was nice to laugh about the changes in my life that had me stressed and most importantly it was nice to hear someone else understood!!! This book really brightened my day each time I picked it up and it turned my days around on many occasions. I would highly recommend."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I so want to hang out on a play date with this author. She so gets what it takes to be a good mother and how to realistically deal with issues while enjoying the short time that one has with their children. Thanks for the laughs! This mother of twins desparately needed this book for therapeutic relief."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This was a wonderful book to read if you are a first time mother, and if you have alot of worries about the baby, it is really funny and set my mind at ease!!!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Hilarious! A tell-all book for real moms. If you are a mother, plan to be a mother, know a mother, or just need a good laugh, read it! With perfectly written, short chapters, its the type of book you can throw in your bag for a spur of the moment read. If you are the type of mother who wears T-shirt's that say \\"Taylor's mom\\" and drive a mini van with those family stick-figure stickers on the back..you may want to skip it...on the other hand...I take that back...you should read it! Do us all a favor!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This book is for the mom-to-be. It's similar to \\"Belly Laughs\\" by JenniMcCarthy. The book is great, very funny, and is a must-read for any new mom-to-be.

Also very funny."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I don't even have a baby.

Definitely a must read."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Stefanie Wilder-Taylor is a great new voice in parenting that is honest, funny, & refreshing.

We should all hope this is just the first of many books by Wilder-Taylor."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I absolutely LOVE this read. As a first time mom, a single mom, and a mom that can't believe she's a mom, this book is a life saver!Seriously, I'm that mom that couldn't believe I was really going to have a baby, so I read every pregnancy/parenting book out there. I was checking my babies development in the womb daily! I was trying to eat perfectly, exercise daily. I wrote the perfect birth plan, read to my baby in utero and sang the ABC's constantly from the moment I knew her ears had formed, lol! I was trying to be super mom.Then I crashed and asked myself, \\"Where the heck are the REAL parenting books?\\"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay was just what I needed. I stood in the store and laughed as I flipped through the pages. I closed the book when I read about mom's needing other mom friends because only they can answer questions like, \\"How the f*** does this Diaper Genie work?\\" I hadn't made myself get other mom friends yet, and that statement made me tear up while laughing.Any book that can make you laugh and cry at the same time because it is so real, is definitely worth the purchase.Buy this book for yourself if you are a mom, mom-to-be, or ever think there is a possibility you may want a baby. Buy it for your friends and your sisters! This book is a joy!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I read this when I was pregnant.

I thought it was just so, so. The humor was sort of forced Saturday Night Live painful sketch style. The concept is good - lighten up about this babyhood business - but there are so many judgmental moments, it feels a lot like those other \\"how to be the right mother\\" books. What if us mommies really did lighten up and just accepted the idea that everyone does the best they can. At least we're better than gerbils!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Stefanie Wilder-Taylor is an absolute riot! The women who haven given this book bad reviews are just some of the ubermoms the author warns about. LAY OFF YOU \\"LACTIVISTS--breast is best but not every woman can do it!\\" There is so much pressure out there to be a good mom--finally a book is written to help you just relax and be yourself. It makes you realize that as long as your kid has a roof over his head, clothes on his back and food in his belly--you are a good mom. The author is so dead on with her descriptions of the roughness of sleep deprivation and many worried calls to the pediatrician. I am going to buy this book for every baby shower I ever attend. It's just that good! Buy it for a good laugh--you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I just have to say, I barely review anything but had to comment on this book..that's how strongly I felt about it.First of all, this is better than 'Dirty Little Secrets,' which was something more suitable for a website than a book! Second, this author just loves to complain about baby products that didn't work for her (as if they would never work for anyone else) and only wants to promote her way. I might have found her funny if she was a bit humble about her opinions. Her husband must be a publisher because she doesn't even write well!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I joked to friends in the first year of being a mom that I would be writing my own \\"tell all\\" about all the crazy stuff that you feel and think about...I'm glad Stefanie Wilder-Taylor did it because I never would have gotten the time plus she cut right to the bone with many laughs about how it really is for us newbies. I've bought copies for family members and referred this title all over the place to all new moms. A fast read too, which we know is very important to those of used to reading a sentence at a time. :) If you get a chance to have someone watch the kids while you sneak an hour to have a glass of wine and read this, then you'll really have a good time!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I received this book when I was 5 months pregnant, and I loved it then, but now that my daughter is 6 months old, it takes on a whole new meaning. The author is one of the few brave enough to write about the good bad and the ugly of being a new mom. Some of her expierences are a lot worse than mine, but that just makes me laugh (and feel really lucky). I've given this book to 3 of my \\"new mommy\\" friends. They all love it. ALSO, my husband, who is a physician, read parts of the book, too (the parts I just had to share with him) and he loved it, too. THIS BOOK IS A GREAT GIFT FOR NEW MOMMY'S, OLD MOMMY'S, NEW DADDY'S, OLD DADDY'S, AND EVEN GRANDPARENTS WHO NEVER HAD BOOKS LIKE THIS WHEN THEY WERE NEW PARENTS!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"The book world is so full of authors and doctors telling new moms what to expect. After being given a few of these types of books, I was thrilled to receive this book from a friend. It is hilarious and refreshing. I don't think that she \\"makes fun\\" of post-partum depression or any other subject, as another reviewer wrote. I felt that she made light of certain subjects in a way that is a total breath of fresh air to those of us who are just tired. of. being. told. what. to. expect. I don't feel it was disrespectful; the book is written in a comical tone, so I took her jabs as funny and comical instead of mean or hurtful. I've heard so much advice and so many stupid pregnancy myths that I could just rip my hair out. When I feel I'm at wit's end, I pull out this book to have a laugh.It did bother me that other reviewers have said that the author makes light of post-partum depression, which she most certainly does not. I'm not sure if maybe they just assumed that, since it is a \\"funny\\" book and the subject of PPD is addressed, she must have been disrespectful. To the contrary, in the small portion in which she mentions beyond-baby-blues, she says that if you have these feelings RUN, don't walk, to your doctor and get help. There is no joke about harming yourself or your baby, as there shouldn't be.I take this book with me when I hit the salon for a pedicure and I swear I've been asked ten times what I'm reading that makes me laugh so hard. Warning: There IS cursing, which I find well-placed and funny, but others may find offensive. She also DOES make light of certain subjects, which some people obviously find offensive or hurtful. I thought it was hilarious and a light, easy read for us new moms who would like to read about babies or pregnancy but are tired of hearing the same things from well-meaning strangers. Five stars."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I received this book as a gift and didn't get to it until my youngest was 2 and my eldest 5...mistake. The most important part of this book (and unfortunately what her detractors apparently miss as a result of her barbed sarcasm and humor) is that she does not advocate a way to parent. She quickly debunks the notion that we should all be stoic and pretend becoming a parent is second-nature and easy, so as not to fail in the eyes of others in a world that is incredibly judgmental. How refreshing! She thinks, and I agree, that most parenting experiences you'll run across are too extreme and that there is simply no \\"only way\\"...to wean, potty train, sleep train, feed, etc. Without naming and shaming, we are all familiar with the books/experts (and also our friends and family!) who claim there is only one valid experience on their prized topic. Simply put, those ideas are great...but they are ideas and ideals, and they won't necessarily work for you, your baby, family or situation. I applaud her for writing a book that tells you that you shouldn't feel guilty or less of a parent because you use disposable diapers, don't make homemade organic baby food, or decided to ferberize your baby-but if you do, great. Her lack of breastfeeding in no way made me (as a breastfeeding advocate who chose/was able to do so for 33 months combined) feel like my choice was less valid. Instead, I applaud her for her honesty that breastfeeding can be very painful, that she was resentful of her husband for his perceived uselessness, and her reluctance to become an asexual, shapeless mess who only ever talked about her baby and who simply couldn't relate to her single friends anymore. In my mind the only people who this book isn't right for are the people who advocate the \\"only way\\" system. Ironically it is these people who perhaps need to read it the most. Definitely worth a read, before the baby or after..."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"As a new mother, it was nice to laugh about it!

This book is great!!!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This book made me laugh out loud.

This is one of them. Stefanie Wilder-Taylor's tale of new motherhood is quite possibly the best book I've read this year. Not only is it screamingly funny, but it is useful, helpful and penned with a caustic wit that draws the reader in and keeps them until the last page is turned. It's a fast, fun read that is very easy to relate to. I wish there were more books out there like this, but I'm thankful that I found this one."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"My brother purchased this book for me for mother's day. I own my own company, and my career has always been my main focus. I was derailed by motherhood at 40 years old. Trying to balance the baby, my business, employees, the home and the husband has been quite the challenge! This book was enlightening to realize other people have the same issues--I've already purchased more copies and forwarded them to ..\\"The mom's that want to have it all...and still be cool!\\"."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This book made me remember that its ok to laugh at the way I used to think about things before I became a mommy. The things we obsess about are insane and unrealistic at best. Motherhood is not easy and any fun we can find even if it is laughing at ourselves is good."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Simply put, this book is just hilarious!!

She says everything that mothers around the world have all thought at some point."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This book is not for those who have issues with profanity or who are looking for a medical reference guide. It is a hysterical collection of essays on parenting and all the ridiculous experiences you encounter once you have a baby. Please do not listen to reviews that tag this book as 'dangerous'. It is not meant to be a substitute for your pediatrician's nurse line or for 'What to Expect: The first year'. Hopefully most people who see the lipstick stained sippy cup and the title on the cover aren't dumb enough mistake it for something its not. This book is incredibly entertaining and will lend justice to those who feel persecuted for formula feeding their babies or for using bumper pads in the crib."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This book is wonderful for making you laugh about the hardest parts of being a new mom. I fought hard to continue breastfeeding and I'm so happy I still am, but I felt the lactation consultants were too militant and the guilt I felt about even considering giving formala (I never did or have) was overwhelming and frankly painful. This books makes you laugh...plain and simple. It is not an advice book. Readers are mature enough to tell the difference."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I read this book while I was pregnant. It was a good read during the last few weeks of almost unbearable pregnancy. While I was pregnant I felt that I would be ready to go back to work after six weeks and that bottle feeding is the way to go. Then after my son was born I felt that breastfeeding was the best thing to give him and there is no way I'm leaving my baby at a day care for 10 hours a day. So, this book was great for entertainment purposes and keeps you grounded, but don't use it as a resource for child rearing."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I didn't read this book, you know, because I'm one of them manly men types.

It's also reassuring for those of us who feel like less-than-perfect mothers. Some people might be a bit offended; you must like sarcastic humor to enjoy this book. I recommend it most for new moms whose babies are less than a year old. My baby is 14 months old, and I'll be reading Naptime Is the New Happy Hour next!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Stefanie and I are the same age, had our first child at the same time, and went through a lot of the same issues - especially with breast feeding.

It's a book that made me laugh from start to finish. I'm sure you could see why but I especially loved the chapter on treating your nanny well. Every family should read this before hiring someone to help them. As an experienced mother myself, I related to so much of this book even though things were a little different when I was raising my girls, the feelings of mothers remain the same. This book is one I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I needed this book!!!

Stefanie Wilder-Taylor helps us to find the humor and warmth in the difficulties of motherhood, and no doubt speaks for everyone who never had the guts to stand up to the know-it-all pseudo child rearing \\"experts\\" who don't know when to mind their own business.

No one's trying to be June Cleaver, but this author is just so awful. Her writing is so bland and stupid - same safe \\"funny\\" motherhood jokes that we hear from the likes of Ben Mulroney and Billy Bush, where it's just so ubiquitous, you feel like she's just a writer on Access Hollywood or something.I'm not going to be tagging it as \\"humor\\" because you know ... it isn't funny."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Stefanie Wilder-Taylor is a breath of fresh air with her brutal honesty of what new Mom's face.

I always have been, and I blame my mother. That is the total sum of my experience with motherhood. This book vaulted off the table into my arms one day, and I've now read it three times. Who'd have thought I was not alone in these thoughts? Some people get knocked up and magically morph into a MommyMonster who can't possibly hire a sitter or remember the allure of Jack Daniels, but this hilarious book reminds us that Moms are still women who were at least naughty once or they never would have ended up with child. A great laugh, even after multiple readings."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"My wife read this book and as she read, couldn't stop raving about it. I figured, how good could it be? So I started flipping through it, and I was surprised at how funny it was. Not only that, it was very down to earth. This is definitely the book to help any couple through the highs and lows of pregnancy and babydom. Fantastic, funny, fast read."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Having just been through the ups and downs of having my first baby, all I can say is, why didn't this book come out sooner!? I could really have used it to calm my first-time-mom jitters and to help me take things a bit less seriously. This is the kind of book I immediately had to tell my friends about because I couldn't wait for them to read it. It's easy to get caught up in all that competitive mommying going on out there -picking the perfect doctor, preschool, etc. Not only is this book laugh-out-loud funny, it helps you realize there are no set rules or absoultes. Stefanie Wilder-Taylor has written a priceless book about being a new mom. She gets it! I HIGHLY recommend it!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This is just one in a long line of \\"yeah I have a baby but that's not going to affect my life one bit\\" books. As others have mentioned, her breastfeeding section is just sad. If the author wants to use formula, that's fine. No reason to bash moms who nurse.Can't recommend this book at all."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I bought this book today and am half way through it (it's a very short book...) and I'm so annoyed with it already. I've never heard someone complain so much about being a mom or have such cynical views on motherhood in general! I'm pretty light hearted when it comes to parenting and can certainly find the comedic side of this experience (Jenny McCarthy's parenting books had me laughing tears) and find some of the \\"overachievers\\" to be annoying, but this author goes above and beyond in her ranting. Does she find any part of the parenting journey to be sentimental or enjoyable? Also, it seems as if she bashes any mother who tries hard to do what they believe is best for their baby. If you breastfeed, have a video monitor, or (god forbid!) make your own baby food, watch out, she hates you (probably, I'm guessing, because she couldn't do a lot of that stuff herself). So anyways, if you're looking for something funny and realistic, go somewhere else. If you're a cynical person who enjoys the views of other cynics and can't often find the joy in things, then this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I purchased this book based on the reviews.

I'm so happy he did, the book is truly funny and so true.I would say a must have for all women. Its nicely written, smart, awseome sense of humor once you start reading you just cannot stop. One of the best books I've read in a long time!. All the reviews here were right on the money."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This book was not funny at all. I consider myself an open person. If a mother wants to breastfeed, then she should breastfeed. If she prefers formula, then use formula. There can even be a happy medium (I used both). This book made breastfeeding mothers sound like selfish, nosey, busybodies who have nothing better to do than dish out unwanted advice. It implied that mothers who chose to use formula were victims. I found the material and language to be offensive and insulting."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"I saw the author on the Today show and had to order the book. Even though my kids are 10 & 13 I totally enjoyed this book. I laughed so hard that I am sure people were wondering what I was reading.

You wind up thinking that you are the only person who has ever had such trouble with a baby. But Stefanie puts it all into perspective: you don't have to stop being a person because you have become a parent, and there is no RIGHT way to do things, just a way that works for you. Plus, she has a hilarious pop-culture joke in every other sentence. Count 'em."},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"Being a new mom, I seriously recommend this book to anyone who is feeling overwhelmed.

And she does.A MUST READ for all moms!"},{"Title":"Sippy Cups Are Not for Chardonnay: And Other Things I Had to Learn as a New Mom","review":"This should replace all other new-mom manuals.

Hopefully Stefanie will continue to write and include installations about toddler-mommyhood, kindergarden-mommyhood, and so on.Send this book to every new mother you know."},{"Title":"My Golden Spoon: Memoirs of a Capital Lady","review":"Who would think a book of long-ago political figures could be so interesting. Chocked full of behind-the-scenes, in-depth portrayals of past presidents, ambassadors, foreign dignitaries, family and friends. Gives an excellent window on the political scene and how with &quot;one hand washing the other&quot;, the work of government is accomplished. Well Done!"},{"Title":"My Golden Spoon: Memoirs of a Capital Lady","review":"Yes, the portrayals of political figures are interesting, albeit a little one-sided. Most of the dirt that is pulled up is on Republicans. The author admits to a friendship with Dwight Eisenhower. She and her second husband try to get him to run for President. But when he does so but opts for the \\"wrong\\" party, they can no longer support him. Eleanor even bargains with her third husband to become a Democrat if she becomes a Presbyterian.I read the book because the author's third husband, Lowell Russell Ditzen, was a first cousin of my grandfather, so my first cousin twice removed. I had hoped to learn more about this relative that I had never met. Rev. Ditzen doesn't get mentioned until the very last chapter, which was a disappointment. Yet she did have some interesting things to say about him and managed to give me a couple of details for the family tree that I did not have.A major theme of the biography seemed to me to be that Eleanor was a privileged lady who enjoyed having beautiful and handsome people in her life. A couple of times she did mention someone who was not attractive but these types were not given a big part in her story. It seemed that beauty was a prerequisite for Eleanor to enjoy their friendship. Beautiful people were mentioned far more often than her \\"golden spoon\\".Except for a lack of editing for punctuation and grammar, the book is fairly well written. It is written as a novel and one wonders if the author's memory or diary was as tuned to details as it would appear. It is done chronologically with no deviations for reflecting, scarcely any flashbacks.It does no doubt give an accurate portrait of life in Washington in the time from FDR to Kennedy. As the book was finished when the author was past 90, it indicates that it was written by one who had kept her mental faculties sharp."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"This is a scholarly work on the life of Robert Kennedy. Schlesinger knew him personally and was able to offer many enlightening insights on the man's character.Robert Kennedy was a man whose core appeared to be diligence. An intelligent, intense and often serious man, he often appeared to be driven. His driving intensity was readily apparent in all aspects of his life. He appeared to take recreational activities seriously, e.g. football which he played with great zeal. He takes that same zeal and applies it to his interrogating and pursuing Teamsters and Mafiosi; he is equally zealous and driven during his tenure as Attorney General (1960-1964) and later as a Senator.Schlesinger chronicles the man's life from the beginning; he describes Robert Kennedy's academic career, which, too was marked by laborious effort. Letters from and to him from various family members are included; these missives do point up to a strongly developed person.In many ways Robert Kennedy was a self taught man. The boy who really had to apply himself as a student became well versed in classic literature by adulthood. Robert Kennedy could quote long passages from authors such as Aeschylus, Camus and Sophocles by heart; he was able to draw from a myriad of esoteric sources. The man who admitted that for most of his life he &quot;did not lie awake nights concerned about the plight of minorities,&quot; would later become a strong advocate for the disenfranchised. He educated himself in civil rights related issues and served as the voice of many.His death leaves a painful void in history. Schlesinger appears to stop short and gives a very minimal account of the Senator's death. In reading this particular work, one cannot help but feel that Schlesinger just could not bring himself to recount the Senator's death in 1968.Indeed, the death of Robert Kennedy has left many gaping questions unanswered. This, as with any work on his life makes one wonder what might have been had he lived to win the 1968 Presidential Election. Schlesinger plainly admired the late Senator and treats him almost deferentially in this work. It is a work well worth reading. It is thoroughly researched and gives"},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"If you're at all interested in Robert Kennedy, this is the biography for you. Stunningly well written, and a joy to read. By far the best biography I've read. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"After reading many RFK books over the course of a History Degree I can say that this book is well done in its examinations but is flawed. First and foremost Mr. Schlesinger was a Kennedy insider to both JFK and RFK and his prose reads more like a reccolection then an actual history. While I do respect his works, I do not belive the author to have written a complete work. I believe that his inside knowledge, while insightful, has skewed his slant on his subject. My only other problem with this work is that as an isider Mr. Schlesinger has chosen to gloss over the assassination itself. Considering that was one of the biggest parts of Kennedy's history it would reson that it would beget more mention. All in all I found the book well written taking into consideration the above mentioned faults. Two works that I would reccomend over this one are James Hilty's ROBERT KENNEDY: BROTHER PROTECTOR and Jules Whitcovers' 85 DAYS: THE LAST CAMPAIGN OF ROBERT KENNEDY."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"Arthur Schlesinger's mammoth biography is a critically important look into one of our countries most engaging political figures. This book, while written by a Kennedy insider, is one of the most well researched documentaries I have ever come across. In today's political arena, so much of what we read or hear about is blatantly biased or otherwise opinionated, it is refreshing to a book that has so many sources attributed to it. It was interesting to read about Bobby's difficulties in academics, his faith, and his need to please his father. I would really recommend this book to any person who has a thirst for a moving story or is interested in politics. While I -- and most of us -- know how the story ends, there is this intense curiosity I encountered as the book moved along, that maybe the outcome on June 5, 1968 would change.A highly recommended read."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"Mr. Schlesinger is famous for his ties to the Kennedys and it's obvious he admires his subject, but this is still a pretty balanced account of an interesting life. You see the turbulent world of the 60's from a very present force of the times. I read this first in college and was very moved and inspired by it at that time. It's a big book, but worth the time."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"Arthur Schlesinger gives a truly informed look at the developmental years of Bobby Kennedy through the final days of his life. Schlesinger's position in the Kennedy administration gives him a special insight into the relations between RFK and the JFK cabinet as well as the powerful, long standing beaurocrats of the day. One is left with an incredible sense of loss upon completion of this book as RFK's life was so busy and so incomplete when he was killed. Sources are well documented and Schlesinger takes great care to avoid opinion and speculation."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"This affectionately written biography of Bobby Kennedy is both pleasurable and painful to read. The man's transformation from his early years as a rackets investigator and attorney general who probably deserved the description of \\"ruthless,\\" to his years following the assassination of his brother when he became a champion of the disenfranchised and an outspoken critic of U.S involvement in Vietnam, is nothing short of remarkable. One cannot help but imagine how our history might have been changed had he not been killed just after winning the California Democratic Presidential Primary in June, 1968. Could Kennedy have gone on to win the nomination? It seems likely. One thing to keep in mind when playing \\"What if?\\": The eventual Democratic nominee, Hubert Humphrey, a man with virtually no charisma at all, nearly beat Richard Nixon for President."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"One of the best books about RFK! At the end of the book you can't help wondering what the world would have been if RFK and JFK had lived! I really recommend this book to all RFK fans! A thousand thanks to Schlessinger for having written this book."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"This book will be inspiring to everyone who reads it. What a contrast with todays politicians! Read it!"},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"Since John F. Kennedy's election as President in 1960, the Kennedy family has become America's version of our &quot;royal family&quot;. To date more books have been written about the Kennedys than all of our other great political families (the Roosevelts, Adamses, etc.) combined. Basically, books written about the Kennedys fall into one of 3 groups: The early, so-called &quot;court&quot; histories, which were written mostly by aides and supporters of the Kennedys and which are highly, and in some cases almost embarrassingly, favorable. Then comes the &quot;revisionist&quot; histories, which look at the family from a very critical point of view. And, finally and most recently, have come the more balanced and objective histories, such as Richard Reeve's &quot;President Kennedy: Profile of Power&quot;, released in 1993. This biography, published in 1978, was written by Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., a noted liberal historian and political activist. In the 1950's Schlesinger worked as a speechwriter for Adlai Stevenson, the two-time Democratic presidential candidate who was beloved by Northern liberals like Schlesinger but, ironically, was held in contempt by both Kennedy brothers as a wimp and &quot;egghead&quot; idealist. In 1960 Schlesinger transferred his allegiance to the Kennedys, and he has spent the rest of his career as the family's main supporter and defender in print. This has often led to considerable criticism from other historians, and Schlesinger's first major Kennedy book, &quot;A Thousand Days&quot;, his history/memoir of John F. Kennedy's Presidency, was widely regarded as so favorable in its' view of JFK that its' credibility has been the frequent target of attack. However, in &quot;Robert Kennedy and His Times&quot;, Schlesinger - while admiring the Kennedys as always - is somewhat more objective and impartial in his treatment of his subject, and as a result this remains the best single biography of Robert Kennedy. Schlesinger is an excellent writer, and the book is engrossing reading from beginning to end, despite its' considerable length. Schlesinger openly states that he didn't especially admire or even like Robert Kennedy when he first met him in the 1950's, but through close contact he eventually warmed to him and they were close friends by the time Kennedy was assassinated in June 1968. Even Schlesinger notes that RFK did have a &quot;dark side&quot; - he could be rude and domineering with other people, he often took chances that bordered on being reckless, and he had far more enemies than his older brother did. Although Schlesinger (as expected) stoutly defends RFK from many of the criticisms that have been levelled at him - his coverups of his brother's womanizing, the rumored relationship with Marilyn Monroe, the wiretapping of Martin Luther King (according to Schlesinger, it was all FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's fault, even though he admits that RFK approved the wiretaps) - he still offers a sweeping and persuasive view of the early sixties and how RFK tried to deal with such diverse crises as the Cuban Missile Crisis and the civil rights movement in the South. His least-persuasive argument comes at the end of the book, when he claims that Robert Kennedy would almost certainly have won the 1968 Democratic presidential nomination and the presidential election (over Republican Richard Nixon) if he had lived. Many other historians strongly disagree, and there is considerable proof that even if Kennedy had lived he would have lost the Democratic nomination to Hubert Humphrey, just as Eugene McCarthy did. In the end, however, this is an eloquent and moving tribute to a man that Schlesinger clearly admired and wanted to be President - and, despite its' pro-Kennedy bias, it remains the best book written about the Kennedy family by one of their strongest admirers."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"It'll be hard to add anything to what 32 previous reviewers have written, but I did want to add my thoughts because I have always admired Robert Kennedy. He was a man who could have lived the good life with his family wealth, but instead chose to serve humanity as best he could. The poverty of Harlem and the Bedford-Stuyvesant slums of New York City and others around the country shocked him. To think such poverty was taking place in this country was simply appalling when others had so much. However, these individuals had no one to speak for them.Robert Kennedy had strong opinions regarding the problems the country was facing, and this inevitably led to conflict which will cause some to love you and others to hate you passionately. John Edgar Hoover of the F.B.I. along with President Lyndon Johnson were to who felt the wrath of Robert Kennedy and Kennedy, in turn, felt theirs as well.The text in this book is slightly over 900 pages and certain parts are going to be of more interest to the general reader than others. Every facet of Robert Kennedy's career is covered in this book by noted author Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. who has meticulous research. I only found one typographical error (page 707 the word \\"basic\\" is inadvertently spelled \\"dasic\\".)The author doesn't dwell on the murders of either President John Kennedy or Senator Robert Kennedy. Each is covered very sparingly. We are left to wonder how the history of the United States would have been different had Robert Kennedy been elected President. This book is a long haul. As I said it contains 900 pages of text, but if you are an admirer of Robert Kennedy you won't find a more comprehensive biography that this one by respected author Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. It is truly well worth your time."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"As a Kennedy insider still suffering the terrible shock of RFK's untimely death, Schlesinger wrote an anthem instead of a history. One wonders whether Schlesinger would have written a different book had he waited 25 years. The RFK presented here is a budding idealist who overcame a bit of youthful exuberance. However, more dispassionate historians have shown us an RFK that preferred action over thought, political expedience over ideals. For example, in &quot;Robert Kennedy: His Life,&quot; Evan Thomas provides a much more balanced, albeit critical, look at RFK's public record and political motives. For that matter, the references to RFK in David Halberstam's &quot;The Best and the Brightest&quot; depict a much darker RFK. He may well have changed later in life. However, given his past, how can we ever be sure that his populist rhetoric in 1968 was grounded in new-found ideals as opposed to political zeitgeist? Alas, Schlesinger is a close friend, and he never asks such questions in his book."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"One of the best books about RFK! At the end of the book you can't help wondering what the world would have been if RFK and JFK had lived! I really recommend this book to all RFK fans! A thousand thanks to Schlessinger for having written this book."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"I had read this book many years ago and loved it. I couldn't find a hard cover copy of it to buy, it was written 40 years ago. I ordered the Kindle version of it and was appalled at the typos, spelling errors and general mess of the text of the book. It is beneath Amazon's usual quality and should be pulled from their inventory. Frankly, I am going to request a refund. If you can find a hardcover copy of this book, read it. It's a study in what was and what could have been."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"This book is very, very good. This has become the official book of RFK and is a great introduction to his life. This book is filled with information about RFK and his family. My only problem with the book is that sometimes it dragged, especially when discussing Castro, and I would have liked to have seen more information about the death of RFK. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the 60's, the Kennedy's or just general American history."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"Robert Kennedy was my very first hero. When I was three years old, my mother took me into the election booth to vote for him when he was running for Senate. &quot;Push the button that says 'Robert Kennedy'and then pull the lever,&quot; she instructed me. I did and she told me that I had just voted. Whenever we saw him on the evening news, she would say proudly, &quot;And YOU voted for him.&quot; It was one of the proudest moments of my life. As a very young child, I remember my mother telling me that &quot;Senator [Robert] Kennedy is a man who cares about people,&quot; and would then relate his work with minorities, the poor and with children in particular. I loved Robert Kennedy! I thought he was sincere, brave (he dared to care about others) and the account of his climbing Mt. Kennedy in March of 1965 remains a favorite story to this day. Robert Kennedy was a man who was described as &quot;acrophobic,&quot; but he tabled his terror and climbed that mountain out of love for his brother. (I think it should be called &quot;Bobby's Mountain&quot; as he was the man who claimed it). Upon reaching the top of the mountain, Robert Kennedy gave credit where it was due by making the Sign of the Cross. That is one of the most inspirational stories I have ever come across and I have actually used that story (&quot;I call it 'Bobby's Mountain'&quot;) when I've had to give certain types of talks before the Toastmasters. I was a history major and my senior project was on Robert Kennedy. He was truly a man of integrity, personal strength and character. He is an excellent example of how persistence pays and is a very prominent figure in history. I have the deepest respect for this man."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"This book is very insightful and very well documented. You can tell the author is very pro-Kennedy, but it is still interesting to hear the story from someone on their side. Very easy to read also."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"this book is the best biography of RFK, I advise evrybody to buy it.Arthur Schlessinger tells us how was RFK and the other Kennedys.So buy and read this bookthere is no photo"},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"Superb biography. Simply the best work on the life of RFK."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"Based on what we now know about RFK, this book comes across as a total whitewash and canonization of him. The alleged extra-marital affairs are blown off or unmentioned. RFK came across as the closest thing to a living saint as one could find. Like most RFK bios, the assassination and the events following are not even touched upon. It seems as if the man left the ballroom at the Ambassador Hotel and was then taken to his funeral. In all, I would recommend this book for anyone wishing to read about RFK, but it's a little hard to read, knowing what we know now about him."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"This is my absolute favorite book in the world, and it is about my personal hero, so perhaps I am a bit biased. Yet this book spoke to me as few have. Robert Kennedy was among the most complex figures to appear on the American scene, and this is a balanced (though admittedly favorable) treatment of his fascinating life. Eminently readable, sometimes even beautifully written, Schlesinger's book seems to flesh Kennedy into a real person right before our eyes. What makes RFK such a hero to me is his humanity. He was not always perfect, not always easy, not always right. But he tried so hard, and worked so tirelessly, that even one who does not admire his social beliefs must respect his efforts. Though many mistrust him because of his late conversion to liberal politics, it is precisely this which makes him so salient a figure to me. As Schlesinger so effectively shows, Kennedy had an amazing ability to grow and change. He was ever in flux, constantly learning. This is why he would have made a great president, and this is why this book is still of so much import to the contemporary reader. As we look askance at a political community which does not seem to offer us sincerity, the picture of a fumbling, hard as nails, emotionally aroused, practical leader with a dedication to principle as well as an excellent political mind is refreshing. I recommend this book to everyone who still cares about the less fortunate in our society."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"Schlesinger, a Kennedy insider, takes advantage of that and of his skill as a historian to present a wonderful study of Bobby Kennedy during his life on the national scene, especially as Attorney General and after.His few years after JFK's assassination -- 1963-68 -- were years of profound changes in Bobby. Previously characterized as ruthless and opportunist, he seemed after his brother's death to also become a more compassionate and tender public figure. Though many bitterly criticized his entry into the presidential race in 1968 -- after Eugene McCarthy's single-issue anti-war challenge had forced LBJ's withdrawal -- Bobby won back most of liberal America in a few short months of campaigning, and was on his way to win the Democratic nomination when assassinated -- the night of his victory the California primary. Schlesinger was up close during this time, and sheds light on this extraordinary transformation with rationality, perspective and great care. Beyond being Bobby's friend, Schlesinger is at the same time truly a scholar. His scholarship allows his book to systematically present an extraordinary number of quotations by the major players in Kennedy's life in those years. It is thoroughly referenced, with good notes. Beyond that, the quotations add great dimension to the portrait of a great man moving through private and public transformation."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"All I can say is that I am truly sorry I missed the man and the time period. I borrowed the book from a friend wanting to learn more about my father's hero. I couldn't stop reading about the amazingly complex, sometimes flawed, man and his times. Now I find myself constantly wondering what it would have been like to live through the amazing highs and tremendous lows that RFK had to endure. I now quote him in school papers and refer to his philosophy in different social settings. Read this book and learn about the president that almost was. Read about the man that did so much for our country and could have done so much more. It hurts me to think of what could have been if only he would have been allowed to live and fight. Schlesinger lays down the foundation of RFK's beliefs and strategies in an easy to read way. Needless to say, he is no longer only my father's hero, he's mine too."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"Although long (approximately 950 pages), the book is by far an exceptional look at the life of RFK. You realize what a truly and personal man that he was; and how he would have made a difference had he been elected President (speculation, of course). Nevertheless, we read what a caring and compassionate man that we was - a great supporter of the poor, the needy, the Blacks, civil rights - we could definitely use more people like him today who truly believe in these causes.The book deals with his fights in the McCarthy era; his fights with Hoffa and other organized crime figures; the Cuban crises, and so on. The book seems compartmentalized, in this respect, and may have read better if it had been written in a chronological type order. Nevertheless, the book is exceptional. I think Arthur Schlesinger writes objectively and I disagree that the book is written in a worship style. For my purposes, once the book gets to the part where RFK joins his brother in the administration, the book really takes off.After reading this book, you realize what a loss the world is without a human like RFK."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"Arthur Schlesinger writes competently enough on RFK's religious and political beliefs and evolution as a public figure. There is roughly 400 pages on his time as Attorney General and 300 on his time as U.S. Senator and presidential candidate. What is lacking is a feeling of really knowing the man personally that I usually get after reading a good biography (e.g. Truman, Years of Lyndon Johnson). Though Schlesinger's is among the longest RFK biographies, almost nothing is mentioned about his marriage, relationship with children and family or anything else aside from his public life and persona. The most interesting aspect of RFK is his willingness to get dirty; visiting rat-infested slums in Bedford, NY and listening to people. No U.S. Senator does that anymore. He truly cared about poverty and suffering and based his presidential campaign around it. He was an excellent public servant and; had he lived a few years longer, would have made a great president. Considering this is the highest-regarded of RFK biography, I was sorely disappointed. Schlesinger as historian manages only dry prose which cannot capture the style or mood of the nation at the end of Kennedy's life."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. Schlesinger has given us a true portrait of Robert Kennedy, including wonderful insights into his childhood and early adult life by publishing excerpts from family letters.He goes into great depth to show the work that RFK did as his brother's Attorney General (sometimes a little too much depth) but it gives you an appreciation for RFK's great administrative skills. After seeing how RFK worked as head of the Justice Department, surrounding himself with the \`best and the brightest' I believe that he could have a made a great president.What is amazing from this book is the transformation of RFK following his brother's assassination. He became a champion of the poor, of blacks and an outspoken opponent of the Vietnam war. RFK is shown to be a man of great conviction, courage and compassion. Schlesinger also portrays a man of introspection, humor and family values.It was a great tragedy that he was himself killed in 1968. Unfortunately the book ends rather abruptly upon RFK's death, while I thought a chapter summing up his life and legacy was needed.That said, this is still the best book available on the life of Robert Kennedy. I recommend this book to everyone who wants to know more about the complex historical figure of RFK.Whether you agreed with all his politics or not, you come away from this book inspired by Kennedy's example and by his quest to \\"tame the savagenesss of man and to make gentle the life of this world.\\""},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"This book is fascinating, not only because of its priciple subject, but because Schlesinger brings to life the personalities and events surrounding RFK's life. J. Edgar Hoover, Joe Macarthy, Martin Luther King, and the kings of organized crime all play prominantly, and the reader learns as much about the zeigeist of Kennedy's time as RFK himself.This is one the best biographies and history books that I have read. It is also long and detailed, and written from an intimate and personal perspective. Schlesinger was a family friend of the Kennedy's and many of his observations about their family life are recorded.This book is still considered the definative biography on Kennedy's life, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"Schlesinger outdoes himself in the most thorough and fair biography of Robert Kennedy in print. As a Kennedy advisor for many hears, Schlesinger paints with deep and compelling account the words and actions, public and private, of RFK's short life. From his ambitous youth to his rise to national leadership in the mid 60s, Kennedy is shown to be deeply compassionate, capable, and immensely popular. Speaking to a crowd in a black ghetto the day of Martin Luther King's assination, Kennedy asked us all to dedicate ourselves &quot;to tame the savageness of man and to make gentle the life of this world.&quot; It is clear that Kennedy dedicated his life to this. We are left to wonder how different our nation would be had he not been murdered during his presidential bid in 1968. Without sensationalizing any aspect of his or his brother's life, Schlesinger's biography is a detailed, fair, and very moving account of one of the most inspiring leaders of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"I highly recommend this book to those who enjoy reading political biographies and especially those who are interested in the 1960's and in learning about RFK. I decided to read this book after first reading An Unfinished Life: John F Kennedy 1917-1963.Before reading this book, I knew very little about RFK. It is a long book, with some parts a little slow going. Beginning with the chapter \\"The Brothers: II\\", examining the JFK-RFK relationship during the Kennedy administration, I found the book to be totally engrossing. I concur with another reviewer who remarked the book is compartmentalized, and might have read better if told in chronological order. Yet the author's approach may be the most intelligible way to present such detailed examinations of political and social issues of the time.In conclusion, I found this to be a superb biography, thoroughly researched, well written. Truly an inspirational story of a man of integrity and great compassion."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr hit a gold mine with Robert Kennedy and His Times, not only is it well written and well reaserched, it is highly informative for the novice RFK historian, or anyone for that matter. This book is perhaps Schlesinger's best work yet and it should have won the Pullitzer Prize; I, personally, found it better than his rendition of John Kennedy, A Thousand Days. I would advise anyone who wants to learn about this great man, and President who should have been, to purchase this book, but read it slowly because it is full of detail."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"I have not read this book yet, but it arrived quickly and in good shape."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"Is this book impossibly biased? You bet your New England Clam Chowdah. Is it as bad as some of the other books Artie has written to perpetuate the Camelot myth? Amazingly, no. Perhaps it is because Artie doesn't have the same sort of man-crush on RFK as he does on JFK, I do not know. In any case, the treacly sentiment that has pervaded much of Schlesinger's work on the Kennedys is a bit more subdued in this work.That having been said, this can be considered a work of only marginal usefulness for students of the period. I suspect that we still need a few more years' distance from the events in question before a truly definitive RFK biography can be written. Definitely Schlesinger, well into his dotage, has nothing more of use to say on the subject."},{"Title":"Robert Kennedy and His Times","review":"This is a interesting book I picked out 'cuz it tells all the details behind the life and times, ups and downs, and legacies of the legendary honorable man of our generation, Senator Robert F.

I just seen the movie \\"Robert Kennedy and His Times\\" w/ the late Brad Davis (R.I.P.) and such a great movie and most definitely I would like to have into my collection.

(I would have said \\"buff,\\" but like that sage, George Costanza, I'm not sure what a buff is.) So having said this, I love this book. Leech is a wonderful writer and this Pulitzer Prize winner is a discovered gem. (Original copyright 1941)You're hooked from the start -\\"That winter, the old General [Winfield Scott] moved from the rooms he had rented from the free mulatto, Wormley, in I Street to Cruchet's at Sixth and D Streets. His new quarters, situated on the ground floor - a spacious bed-room, with a private dining-room adjoining - were convenient for a man who walked slowly and with pain; and Cruchet, a French caterer, was one of the best cooks in Washington.\\"The \\"star\\" of the book is, indeed, the city of Washington, D.C. Many players walk across the D.C. stage and Leech's research paints vivid portraits not seen before about the Lincolns, Walt Whitman, Andrew Carnegie, Winfield Scott, John Wilkes Booth, and many, many others. It's a D.C. you have never really seen or heard that much about. It's a scrappy, dusty/muddy, unfinished city, begging for respect. A city that found itself a lynchpin between Union soldiers heading to battle and the many battlefields of Virginia. We see the soldiers come, go and return. Some are dead, many are wounded. But the focus is always on the District of Columbia.Past and present D.C. residents will get a kick out of reading things like \\"Tennallytown\\" for today's Tenleytown; the importance then of today's Bladensburg; the importance then of what today are mere Metro stops - e.g., Fort Totten, the Navy Yard and Silver Spring. Even Rockville, Maryland, puts in a guest appearance.Leech covers the key years - 1860 to 1865 - with painstaking research. Just take a glance at the Appendix. \\"Bills for President Lincoln's Funeral,\\" \\"Other Incidental Bills\\" -- to include Mrs. Lincoln's funeral outfit. Look at the chronology of main events from Fort Sumter's surrender (April 13, 1861), to the Grand Review of the Union armies (May 23 & 24, 1865). You'll find biographical notes on major players from Henry Adams to John Ellis Wool. (I hadn't heard of him either until this great book.)Leech's bibliography covers hundreds of general reference works, D.C and New York newspapers and manuscripts. It's a breathtaking list and helped assure me that I could draw a good deal of confidence in the events as reported by Ms. Leech. No wonder this book won a Pulitzer!Listen to D.C., 1864 -\\"The capital, in 1864, was too sophisticated for panic. No city ever heard the noise of cannon in its suburbs with a greater appearance of sang-froid. People were eager to learn the facts. They bought and devoured every newspaper extra.\\"This touching scene from 1865 -\\"Gray uniforms, rather than blue, now predominated in the capital. There were increasing numbers of Confederate deserters. Twilight was settling over Richmond. Lee's losses of starving and disheartened men could be counted by brigades.\\"Ms. Leech would be surprised to learn that Ford's Theater did, indeed, reopen. (\\"Never again would the orchestra play, or the footlights flare as the curtain rose.\\") She also does something unique. While she sets the stage for Lincoln's assassination and death, she spends more time and detail with the attempted assassination of William Seward. It is a vivid account.Remember, a 1941 copyright, and read this genteel description of Walt Whitman -\\"Even in the heterogeneous company of the capital, Walt Whitman had no counterpart. His scarlet face, bushy beard and wide-brimmed sombrero gave him a delusively robust and rural aspect which caused one politician to tell him he looked like an old Southern planter . . . In his youth, Walt had been a dandy. His rough garments were carefully selected. He never wore a tie; but his spotless shirt, with its open collar was Byronic rather than proletarian. There was a queer daintiness about this big, bluff man . . . His flesh was soft and rosy, like a woman's.\\"What a brilliant description of what, in 1941, must have been handled with kid gloves.This book delivers on all fronts. It is spellbinding history with up-close touches that dazzle you. You read of a Washington full of serenading, balls, levees, secessionists, abolitionists, Democrats, Republicans, soldiers, the great and the horrid. Those were the days. Long remember."},{"Title":"Reveille in Washington, 1860-1865 (Universal library)","review":"Margaret Leech's &quot;Reveille in Washington&quot; is a fact filled book that betray's her origins as a novelist.For the Civil War afficianodo, there are many tidbits that add to one's understanding of the Civil War as viewed from Washington, D.C. These involve fascinating interactions among the players (Lincoln, members of the Senate, Stanton, Seward and Chase), and also reminders that even in the midst of war, Washington still minded the habits and customs of society in our nation's capital. Lincoln still had (as the first host) parties, endured the countless details of administration and grinding demands of petitioners, and found time for levity and respit.Like its counterpoint &quot;Ashes of Glory,&quot; an excellent account of wartime Richmond, Reveille in Washington will broaden the understanding of those of us who have waded through countless military oriented books of the Civil War. Ms. Leech also includes a helpful timeline and an excellent appendix on scores of the characters in her book. For those who often wonder &quot;what happened after...&quot; to historical personages, the appendix will satisfy by tying up a lot of loose ends. More history books should follow this habit.My only slight criticism is Ms. Leech's overuse of adjectives. She describes every person and proper noun, sometimes to the point of distraction like a florid romance novel. This both helps and hinders the tale. While it makes the events and persons more imaginable to the mind's eye, she undoubtedly takes some literary license in describing thoughts, feelings and descriptions that can only be surmised. All in all it is not a major distraction, but does sometimes become tiresome.That having been said, this portrait of Washington fills the gaps to a great story. Not only are the principals covered, but ordinary people, nurses, city jailers, prostitutes, hucksters and regular folk are given their due in this fascinating book that at times throbs with the pulse of a City that struggles to accomodate a war often at its borders and its need to reflect it's own normalcy and image as a first city in the midst of the great distraction outside it's gates.An enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Reveille in Washington, 1860-1865 (Universal library)","review":"or one of those long running soap operas from the golden age of radio.

This subject has not been covered as heavily as the various battles & endless biographies of the notable figures of that war. The book was written 76 years after the war.

So you may want to pass on this edition and go for the one recently released that has an introduction by James McPherson.

Her creativity became habit & habit led to the act of writing by a writer whose goal was merely to continue to write.And that's when reading Reveille - at the onset, a very enjoyable experience - turned into an unpleasant ordeal.In 2001, Ian Frazier's overland summertime journey from Leningrad to the Pacific Ocean, through eight time zones, lasted five weeks & three days.Given Leech's endless accounts of what people wore; where they ate & danced & slept; who had been invited to what balls & pageants; & where they stood in the grandstands reviewing the marching soldiers, I was beginning to wonder if the time it would take to finish Reveille would be longer than the time that it took Frazier to travel the length of Siberia.Crappy Editing, Dept.:Believe it or not, what follows is only half of one sentence:\\"...And Mrs. William Sprague, with a languid smile on her lips, swept confidently into a life whose misery not the poorest girl on the [U.S. government] Printing Office, not the weariest of the superannuated trollops would have envied her.\\"A competent editor would have slimmed this down to:\\"...And Mrs. William Sprague swept confidently into a life whose [eventual] misery not [even] the poorest girl in the Printing Office would have envied.\\"This is but one of hundreds of similarly constructed sentences that, if each were a limousine, the front end of which would be visible as it exited the Lincoln Tunnel at the same time that its rear end would still be visible in New Jersey.(I know of only one contemporary author who truly mastered the art of writing exotic prose: Lucius Beebe. His \\"The Big Spenders\\" is recommended - but only for truly patient readers.)And above, what was commended by another correspondent is, rather, just another mundane example of what survives the absent-minded scrutiny of a mediocre editor:\\"No city [Washington D.C.] ever heard the noise of cannon in its suburbs with a greater appearance of sang-froid.\\"To which Will Strunk would have stated, \\"Omit needless words\\":\\"No city ever heard the noise of cannon in its suburbs with a greater sang-froid.\\"Reveille does have two genuine saving graces that should be noted & appreciated:The inclusion of an indispensable exact date \\"Chronology of The Main Events\\" (which to some extent, counterbalanced Leech's having repeatedly omitted the months & years in which crucial events occurred), &;Lengthy, solid \\"bibliographical notes\\" on the post-Civil War activities of the surviving antagonists, whose war-time experiences are recounted in the main text.Now, about that 1942 Pulitzer prize...Margaret Leech became Mrs. Margaret Leech Pulitzer in 1928, by marrying the son of the man who bequeathed a fortune to Columbia University - in whose name the Pulitzer Prizes are bestowed each year.How can you be married to a Pulitzer & be eligible to receive a Pulitzer Prize?"},{"Title":"Reveille in Washington, 1860-1865 (Universal library)","review":"This book provides a good survey history of the US Civil War based in Washington DC.

The rich experiences of God, distinctive and diverse, are seen through the eyes of many cultures and the women who struggle for justice. Using the figure of Sophia Wisdom as an example, the author shows that there are many still unplumbed images of God to discover. The Introductions in Feminist Theology Series explores various theological topics that challenge patriarchal theology and suggests liberating alternatives. The authors and editors seek to expand the theological discourse by providing reliable guides to the history of thinking, current issues and debates, and possible future developments in feminist theology.

As a Turkish-American, I was surprised by the title, which addresses the Ottoman Empire as Turkey. The reading of the book truly takes me back to the last two decades before the fall of the Ottoman Empire. I strongly recommend the book, since it has successfully painted a picture of Turkish society of 1880s. I am stunned to find so many commonalties between then and now in terms of culture and interaction among individuals. I also appreciate the beautiful and skillful language used in description of those times.The book is particularly humorous and insightful to an individual such as myself, who is considering a career in foreign service."},{"Title":"Basenjis","review":"This book has a very small section that talks specifically about Basenjis.The rest of this book is a formula book.

He would not leave his ground crews and pilots so he elected to stay knowing that he would be captured. He endured the Death March which is described in this book. He witnessed the oughtright murder of many Americans. He made his escape and wrote this book. It is one mans eye whitness story of one of the darkest times in W.W.2 for the U.S.A.. He does not come across as the great hero he was, it is written in a very modest style. He did not live to see the end of the war. He died in a plane crash in the United States.

Contrast that with we humans, who write books such as The Savage Nation, Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them and Bushwhacked.Forget the human nonsense and read Xena's book, with amusing quotes from real cats.

As a person who has six cats, I read it through in one sitting and enjoyed every page."},{"Title":"Remote people,","review":"Evelyn Waugh compares his 1930 trip to Abyssinia to cover Haile Salessie's coronation to 'Alice in Wonderland', but there's something 'Brigadoon' about his whole journey to alien Africa, where intolerable heat, unreliable timetables and capricious inhabitants seem eminently preferable to the noisy social inanity back in England, so familiar to us from his classic comic novels.Waugh divides his African travel book into two sections (one dealing with the Abyssinian trip, the other with an extended tour through Zanzibar, Kenya, Uganda, the Congo and South Africa), and three nightmares, vividly detailing the various, accumulative problems that beset the traveller, such as unhelpful officials and lousy food. Waugh is a much more sympathetic voyager than the more heroic likes of Chatwin or Raban - his whining about lack of bath water or pesky mosquitos is more refreshing than some writers' spiritual journeys.Despite his attempts at objectivity, 'Remote people' is written, as we might expect, from a very jaundiced viewpoint. Waugh's experiences aren't really 'Alice' at all, simply a concatenation of minor mishaps, local eccentricites and cultural differences in very poor countries that only a very insulated Englishman would blow up and find surreal. Some of Waugh's ill-advised political theorising, especially his unconvincing defence of the notorious white settlers in Kenya's Happy Valley, make for distinctly ncomfortable reading, although one is grateful for Waugh's evident and lucid integrity to his own beliefs. It is surprising in a book of 1931 to see how many of the issues raised by post-colonial theory were already being painfully argued about.Of course, we don't read Waugh for politics or sympathy to foreigners. Although written in a more descriptive, less dialogue-driven style than the novels, we find the same account of bewildered, uprooted Modern Man faced with the problems (and comedy) of the simple fact of other people (American professors absurdly reverent of Ethiopian religious practice; Seventh Day Adventists prone to seasickness; colonial magnates encouraging staff and guests to climb life-threatening volcanos etc.). The travelogue is less interesting than the rich set-pieces - the Abyssinian coronation; the bathetic trip to an ancient monastary; a rooftop cinema where the audience wilt sleepily in the sun; the efforts of native scouts to light a fire; a berserk ship journey down river with the captain trying to shoot game from his cabin, his passengers leaping off to search for any hits."},{"Title":"Remote people,","review":"This book is fantastic! It covers Waugh's journey to see the coronation of Emperor Haile Selassie in the 1930s, then his long and tough trip to get back home to England afterwards.Evelyn describes the journey vividly and tells a range of amusing travel anecdotes. The only shame is that he did not visit more of Ethiopia.."},{"Title":"Etale Cohomology","review":"When I made a first pass at this book, I was a little annoyed, basically because I found a lot of the opening sections too brief. Since I wanted to learn this etale business, I then set about using the \\"classical\\" references...which are in French. At the end of a long year (reading French books), I returned to Milne's book and now really see that what this book accomplishes is pretty amazing. In a book of only a few hundred pages he has managed to compress many years of difficult mathematics. Most importantly, he was able to convey the geometric and arithmetic ideas behind the results in fairly down to earth terms. He also includes some nice stuff on torsors and the Brauer group. I would recommend using this book. If you want to know more about something, you can always find other things in SGA 4, 4 1/2 and Freitag & Kiehl's book."},{"Title":"Etale Cohomology","review":"Milne's account of \\\\'etale cohomology is sometimes useful---in that it proves various little lemmata and criteria that come handy in practice---but disorganised the rest of the time. What's more, the proofs are often just sketches of the sort: \\"To see this, use the argument of Theorem 3.66 combined with the devissage of SGA 4, exp. XII, Prop. 3.14 to reduce to the case of curves; now the claim follows from my comments on page 45.\\" (The previous sentence is not a direct quotation from the book, so it might suffer from mild exaggeration on my part.) Furthermore, the book doesn't cover Deligne's proof of the Weil conjectures.If trying to learn the theory for the first time, I'd recommend you read Deligne's extremely lucid and concise SGA 4 1/2. As a good exercise for your new-found knowledge, then, try to go through the same author's \`\`Weil-II'' paper. This should probably serve you better than reading Milne's Etale Cohomology."},{"Title":"Etale Cohomology","review":"This book is a rigorous overview of an approach to the study of schemes that uses a generalization of the complex topology called the etale topology. For the case of of ordinary complex algebraic varieties, the etale topology is simply the complex topology, which gives more information about the variety than the Zariski topology. The etale topology gives rise to sheaf and cohomology theories for schemes that parallels that of the cohomology of complex manifolds. These concepts are discussed in great detail in this book, and the reader is expected to have a substantial background in algebra, algebraic geometry, and topology. With this background, the reader will encounter an exceptionally well-written book full of fascinating ideas and constructions. There is also a set of notes on etale cohomology written by the author that he has posted on the Web. The notes compliment this book and treat the case of varieties rather than schemes.When one is dealing with a complex algebraic variety, most of the usual concepts from algebraic topology carry over. For example, the dimensions of the rational cohomology groups of the variety, namely the Betti numbers, can be defined. For a variety over a general algebraically closed field, one has to deal with the Zariski topology, which is not fine enough for the usual techniques of algebraic topology. One example of this are the integer cohomology groups, which for an irreducible variety are all zero except in dimension zero. When one uses the etale topology though, the corresponding cohomology groups give the correct Betti numbers and the standard results of algebraic topology carry over. That the etale topology is a generalization of the complex topology is easier to see in the context of varieties rather than schemes as is done in this book. An etale covering of a nonsingular complex algebraic variety can be refined by a covering for the complex topology. The reader familiar with Riemann surfaces should keep in mind the concept of an unramified covering when studying this chapter. The first chapter emphasizes the role of etale morphisms and their role in defining the etale topology. To reinforce this connection even further, the author asks the reader to show that a morphism between two smooth varieties over a field is etale if and only if the morphism induces an isomorphism on the tangent spaces. When going over to a general scheme, this geometric picture is lost, and one must rely completely on algebraic constructions. But the author does show effectively that etale morphisms for schemes are essentially local isomorphisms in a sense. He also discusses the fundamental group of a scheme in this chapter. When reading this section, it is best to think of the fundamental group from ordinary topology in terms of the universal covering space instead of simple connectedness as it is the former concept that is employed to define the fundamental group of a scheme.The author turns to sheaf theory in the next chapter and shows how etale topology does give exactness for sequences of sheaves that are not exact in the Zariski topology. The notion of a flat topology, even finer than the etale topology, is integrated into the discussion. The author gives a nice example of a sequence involving a scheme of characteristic p that is exact relative to the flat topology, but not the etale or Zariski topologies.The next chapter moves on to the cohomology of sheaves on flat and etale sites. He convinces the reader right away that the sheaf category is more general than the abelian category by showing that the former does not have enough projectives. Cech cohomology is introduced mostly as a device to compute the cohomology groups, which is difficult to do directly when expressed in terms of derived functors. The author takes greatcare in explaining the connection between these different approaches, for example showing that for a separated scheme over a quasi-coherent sheaf, they coincide. Also, several very insightful examples of the actual calculation of the cohomology groups relative to the etale topology are given. In addition, the author compares flat vs. Zariski, flat vs etale, and etale vs complex cohomologies.The next chapter covers the Brauer group, which was introduced by Grothendieck as a generalization of central simple algebras over fields. The Brauer group is defined in terms of equivalence classes of Azumaya algebras, with the cohomological Brauer group defined as the torsion part of the second etale cohomology group. There is an injection of the Brauer group into the cohomological Brauer group, and this chapter outlines what was known at the time of publication when this is a bijection. It is now known that for schemes of dimension less than or equal to 1, regular surfaces, Abelian varieties, unions of affine schemes with affine intersection, smooth toric varieties, and separated geometrically normal algebraic surfaces that such a bijection exists.Starting with the construction of a Lefschetz pnecil, so powerful in symplectic geometry, the calculation of the cohomology curves and surfaces is taken up in the next chapter. The author's proofs are very concise but understandable and he explains the need for using constructible sheaves in obtaining the usual Euler characteristic and Poincare duality results from algebraic topology.The situation in characteristic p is treated in detail.This sets the stage for the last chapter which proves the Kunneth formula and the Lefschetz fixed point formula. The all-important L-series is proved to be rational when it arises from representations of Galois groups. This chapter should satisfy algebraic topologists who are curious as to what extent the usual results in their area carry over to schemes."},{"Title":"Lone Voyager","review":"Howard Blackburn was one cool dude!

Chapter 3 explains what you need to know to prepare for a hospital stay. I liked the list of healing objects you can take into the hospital to make you feel less stressed. This could range from a favorite quilt to favorite music, photos, healthy snacks and your laptop computer. This section addresses issues like having a private room or sharing a room, dealing with aromas and intrusions.Part II: Healing Strategies for Family, Friends, and Caregivers - This is a section for those who are looking after someone who is healing.Part III: Healing Ways - An interesting section on bedside yoga, breathing exercises, stretching and massage.

For those of you that have been to my office, I had the \\"tropical\\" themed curtains separating my treatment tables.I had the pleasure of spending three days this week with Yosaif at a Coach Training Institute event in Manhattan. When we met, we immediately hit it off. He told me that he was there to hone his skills as a health care coach. He said that he wanted to help people negotiate our complex health care system. He said that he wants to help them empower themselves to make better health care decisions, and ask better questions of their health care professionals. When he told me that he had actually written a book about it, I went right to my kindle and ordered it. Within seconds, it was delivered to my device and I was reading it on the Jitney home. From the preface, I was hooked. I have to admit, I am biased. Patient empowerment, a holistic approach to healing, using humor as a force for empathic healing! I am all over this stuff! As many of you know, these are the very things that I am working on as Executive Director of the Optimal Health Alliance.The book begins by helping you establish your rights as an empowered patient.book on three main principles:1. You have the right to heal, no matter what your life experience has been.2. You can create a healing team.3. You can learn to become the master of your life's time.As a professional, I found that the book helped me re-connect with why I do what I do. It helped me to cut through the accumulation of meaningless trash that has crept into my professional life and helped me to re-focus on what matters. . . helping people restore balance, richness and wholeness to their life.As a former, and potentially future, \\"patient,\\" the book helped me to remember that a time of illness is a time to gather your tribe. Assemble what matters most to you and use those resources (family, friends, pets, reminders, memories, affirmations and attitudes) for your healing. It reminded me of the importance of not suffering in silence. The importance of making the most of what you got and accepting those gifts as honest tools for recovery.As a man who morns the loss of the most important man in my life, my dad- (the picture is of me and dad on \\"Shadow\\" sometime in the late 1960's)- the book helped me to understand that healing really is about restoring wholeness. It is not about avoiding death. The book helped me to see that dad had a \\"good death\\" and that our love and support made him whole. Oh sure, I wish he were still here. I miss him every day - but my father died with dignity, honor, bravery and a love beyond all comprehension. This book validated much of that experience for me. I was so grateful to read that my part in my father's passing played a big role in him leaving me complete and whole. If you are caring for a loved one (even if it is you), I implore you to read this book."},{"Title":"Help Me To Heal","review":"This is an excellent resource for any person involved with someone's healing.

Softly she asked if we had anything else by the author of \\"A Room With a Zoo\\". My library is notorious for getting new books in late, but in this particular case I had seen the title already in a bookstore. I showed her Jules Feiffer's other books, like \\"The Man In the Ceiling\\" and \\"A Barrel of Laughs, a Vale of Tears\\". She looked them over vaguely but they were obviously not what she wanted. What she wanted was another book exactly like, \\"A Room With a Zoo\\" and I (not having read it) was hard put to find her something similar. Time has passed, I have read the book, and I STILL cannot for the life of me figure out what I should have told her. Feiffer has deftly tapped into a single child's love for the animals she keeps in such a one-of-a-kind way that animal loving kids out there are sure to find a kindred spirit in the character of Julie. Using everything from slapstick to sweet moments to the reality that comes with owning a variety of different animals, Feiffer is always real, always interesting, and never dull.Based on Jules Feiffer's real family and real family members (though to what extent I am not certain) the book is told through the eyes of nine-year-old Julie Feiffer. Julie wants one thing in the entire world. A Chihuahua. A cute little doggie that she would tend to and take care of. Her parents insist that she is too young for such a responsibility. So instead she gets a cat named Timmy. But Timmy isn't a sweet cat, he's a frightened one and to make up for him they buy her a hamster named Hammy. Problem is, Hammy tortures Timmy with his edibleness. So to distract Timmy from Hammy they get an Oscar fish named (oh so appropriately) Oscar. That's all well and good until it becomes clear that Oscar likes to eat the other fish purchased with the sole purpose of keeping him company. So she gets a turtle for comfort. Then Julie wants to bring home the class rabbit, she gets a new kitten who is as friendly as Timmy is distant, and all this reaches a screeching climax when fish, hamster, and cats combine to bring the story to a slam bang finish.I'm intrigued by the reviewer of this book who responded with horror to the fact that Julie makes poor judgments with her animals. They seem to be under the impression that the protagonist in a children's story should always do the right thing and never make mistakes. Julie is nine and some of her addle-headed theories result with a sticky end, but this isn't one of those books where the kid makes a mistake and gets away with it. Each time Julie does something stupid she (and the animals) pay for it. And, by paying for it, learns. To the animals' detriment, of course, but in this story only two critters get eaten and nobody (aside from the eaten) dies. There's a strong sense of reality to this tale, leading me to believe that much of this story must've actually happened to Feiffer & Co. When one of Julie's goldfish is eaten by the Oscar, Feiffer's accompanying illustration of Julie screaming is dead on. I well remember the horror of waking up in the morning, walking over to the fishtank, and seeing half a skeleton of a fish floating at the top of the bowl. \\"A Room With a Zoo\\" is hardly so graphic, but it acknowledges right from the get-go that pet ownership is not for the weak. The individual personalities of the pets ring true each and every time. Plus I think that no children's book describes quite so well the agony some adults feel when their backs go out.There are wonderful little touches spotted throughout the text that make for a great read. When Julie discovers the Oscar fish her parents have bought for her the fish is describes as follows: \\"His eyes were black like a gangster's, and on top of his eyes there was a bright red line the color of his speckles. \`He reminds me of Tony Soprano,' my father said, so he called my fish Tony\\". The book isn't afraid to do a little shout out once in a while as well. Though it's never mentioned by name, proud parent Jules mentions his daughter Kate Feiffer's new picture book, \\"Double Pink\\" at great length. I was amused that he would be so gutsy as to unrepentantly draw attention to his daughter's work in this fashion. Not every daddy would do so much.It's the truth in this tale that is its strength and its weakness. Some parents will bemoan the fact that Julie is a real little girl and not a perfect-pet-takin'-care-of-machine. She does pretty darn well, all things considered, and some elements of this tale are so real (such as a classmate's family trying to drop a sick rabbit off onto Julie's family) that they could only have been inspired by true life situations. Most importantly, kids really identify with Julie. She's one of them. They understand what she's going through, even when they don't agree with her decisions at all times. It makes for a great story, an amusing tale, and an altogether hepped-up storyline. Bound be beloved for quite some time."},{"Title":"A Room with a Zoo","review":"Julie is an animal lover who has always wanted a dog. She asks for a dog when she sees one on the street, and then again when she sees one on television. \\"Not until you're old enough to walk it yourself,\\" her parents tell her. Then one day Julie has a new idea. \\"You don't have to walk a cat, do you?\\" she asks. Her parents let her have Timmy, the first animal for the zoo in her bedroom.A ROOM WITH A ZOO is about Julie's adventures with animals. One animal at a time, her room fills with pets. Her parents get her Hammy, a hamster, when Timmy isn't as cuddly as she imagined. Next they get Oscar, a mean, ugly fish, to take Timmy's mind off of eating Hammy. Then there's a turtle, and a visit from the classroom rabbit.Each pet creates some new adventure, or disaster. The book culminates with a trip to a relative's farm. Julie sees all kinds of other animals she would like to have, including goats and a newborn kitten. But each time she asks for a new pet, she worries she's using up her chances to get what she really wants...a dog.Children will identify with Julie's passions and anxieties about her animals. Adults will relate to what Julie's parents experience each time a new pet is added to her zoo.

So the little girl's parents bought her a dog for the house. She also wanted a cat to join the small family. She even wanted a gerbil and a turtle but her parents only got her a dog even though they said that she can't have a pet until she is old enough to take care of it by herself she also wants a fish to take care of by herself so she can act more responsible. Halley wanted all different kinds of pets like for example a dog. But her parents wouldn't trust her with a pet in the house but her parents thought that she was old enough to take care of her own pet if they bought her one. So they both bought her one pet for now. And Halley's parents bought her all the pets that Halley asked for in the boob called a room with a zoo actually if you read it you should find it quit interesting because she wants a bunch of pets that she wanted to live in the human house with them but only if they bye a pet other wyes they won't have any pets to play with on the weekends but Halley's parents actually did buy Halley a dog ,a cat, a fish ,a guinea pig for her pets. Halley is trying to get her parents to buy her all of those pets that she wants to have because she thanks that she is old enough to take care of her own pets that she wants because she finds them quit interesting interesting because I would want a lot of pets myself if I were Halley because she loves pets and I love pets because I have a grate Dane that is how I now that Halley loves pets as much as I do. Halley begged her parents for a pet and she got a pet from her parents but she only got a cat that was very sick and they thought that the cat was going to dye but the cat did not dye because they took very good care of the cat because they cared about the cat very much because it is their responsibility to take care of the cat people should care about their pets if they want a pet to take care of their pet.

About half way through it becomes obvious the writer (cartoonist) has run out of ideas. Last half drags."},{"Title":"A Room with a Zoo","review":"This book isn't cute at all - it's actually chilling if you like animals, understand that an animal isn't a toy, and realize that sometimes a kid isn't ready for a pet. This is clearly the case with Julie, the young \\"heroine\\" of this book. In her first misjudgement, she tries to introduce her hamster to her full grown cat, despite having been warned repeatedly that it would not work. The cat naturally tries to kill the hamster. Is this supposed to be cute? Funny? Whichever it is, or not, her parents respond to this display of bad judgement by buying her an oscar (a carnivorous fish). After a time, she decides the oscar is lonely & buys some goldfish, which she adds to the tank for the oscar to \\"make friends\\" with - again, despite a warning from a knowledgeable adult (in this case a pet shop owner, who proceeds to sells her the fish anyways in yet another display of the adult idiocy with which this book is rife - at least Julie has the excuse of being nine) that a hungry oscar will eat anything it wants to. She wakes up the next day to find that the oscar has indeed eaten one of the goldfish. Even after that, the menagerie continues to grow, with things spiralling further & further out of control as the work required to properly care for the animals far outstrips the young owner's ability to look after all of her charges. If anything, this book should be read as a cautionary tale about making sure that a child understands the responsibility that an owner has to care for an animal properly prior to indulging that child's request for even one pet, and as a warning of the fact that the parents need to be ready to step in & take over that responsibility, should the child not be ready."},{"Title":"A Book of Country Things","review":"Want to know how to make lye soap, build a split rail fence or tap maple trees and make syrup?

But for readers interested in the business end of raising cattle, there are several good books to entertain their curiosity. This is one of them.Duncklee, while a young man in his twenties, leased a small ranch south of Tucson for three years during the long drought of the 1950s. This well-written account of that experience, building a herd and keeping it fed and watered, provides a fascinating look into the heart and mind of a rancher, whose intelligence is pitted against a number of challenges: unpredictable weather, less than scrupulous stock buyers, the fluctuating markets for both cattle and feed, the vagaries of government programs, untrustworthy neighbors, and the risk of loss as disease and mischance threaten to make any of his cows a meal for buzzards.Ths story is told with good humor, intelligence, and some sentiment, and the men whose work lives engage with the author's come to life on the page, especially the 80-year-old vaquero, Chico, who works with him and becomes a dearly loved friend. Also recommended: John Erickson's \\"Panhandle Cowboy,\\" David McCumber's \\"The Cowboy Way,\\" and Linda Hasselstrom's \\"Windbreak: A Woman Rancher on the Northern Plains.\\" Also, for a good history of the cattle industry, read David Dary's \\"Cowboy Culture: A Saga of Five Centuries.\\""},{"Title":"Good Years for the Buzzards","review":"According to Duncklee, the drought of the fifties that affected the entire Southern tier of states and Northern Mexico was good for the buzzards and not much else. Describing one of the greatest challenges a cattleman can face in that manner tells you a lot about the author.Raised in the East and rocked in the cradle of Ivy League tradition, Duncklee had wanted to be a cowboy since the day his father took him to a rodeo at Madison Square Garden. At the age of 12 he was sent to a private ranch school in Arizona, where he studiously applied himself to helping the neighboring ranchers. Later, he turned his back on Dartmouth, worked his way through college as a horse wrangler, then leased an Arizona ranch in the middle of the Southwest's greatest drought in 400 years.\\"Good Years for the Buzzards\\" is a chronicle of how he maintained his herd during the drought, learned much about the forces of nature, and a great deal about the importance of neighbors.The author lived his dream of becoming a cowboy and rancher and, evidently, became a fiercely independent individual along the way. He later earned his living by writing and making furniture.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Good Years for the Buzzards","review":"I actually got more out of my second time through Good Years for the Buzzards because I kept referring to the sketched map of John Dunklee's O Bar J Ranch opposite the preface as I was reading. This is helpful because Dunklee's chief concern in this engaging ranch memoir is the practical problem of managing the O Bar J cattle ranch through the drought of the late 1950's-- the worst period of drought, we learn, in the Southwestern United States in 400 years.Little rain meant scarce feed for Dunklee's cattle. This confronted Dunklee with the problem of optimizing the forage and water of the harsh desert range to keep his cattle fed and his cowboy dream alive. The trick was keeping his cows on the move to where the forage was, and keeping the precious water flowing from the ranch's two deep wells, the mellifluously named Pozo Hondo and Pacheco wells. Navigating the map gives one a feel for the logistical difficulty of Dunklee's problem.After studying agriculture in college and adventures serving in the Navy during the Korean War and cowboying for wages in Alberta and Wyoming, Dunklee learned that the O Bar J ranch, two large desert pastures on the slope of the Sierrita Mountain range southwest of Tucson, was up for lease. Dunklee signed a lease in the spring of 1956 and bought the owner's cattle, thus beginning a four year battle with drought, cunning order buyers, thieving neighbors, drunken cowboys, careless hunters and miners, wild heifers, government drought relief scams, and various other crafty characters of all types.Apart from being an entertaining portrait of the cattle industry in the Arizona border country in the late 50's, the text is a minor classic of applied, or practical operations, versus academic theory. As such the book would be useful as a narrative companion to theoretical texts in university level business, economics, agricultural economics, or business law courses.After a particularly contentious sale of O Bar J calves pursuant to a contract calling for \\"weighing the calves at the Southern Pacific yards off the trucks\\" during which the buyer-because of currently falling prices-tried every trick in the book to shrink the calves before weighing (calves lose weight while being shipped on trucks or standing in corrals with no food or water, costing the seller money), including showing up a half hour late claiming a flat tire and telling the truck drivers to take extra time driving to the stockyard, Dunklee reflects:\\"While attending the university I had enrolled in a course called Livestock Marketing taught by the chairman of the department. I remembered how his lectures were straight from the text. Neither professor nor textbook mentioned such things as pencil shrink, finagling order buyers, or Twinkie-eating rodeo-hand truck drivers-probably because the professor had never marketed any cattle.\\"Dunklee won that battle, however, as the stockyard boss put the cattle in a corral with a trough of water, letting the cattle drink back the lost weight and then some.\\"Get those (...)out of that wet corral!\\" yelled the buyer, seeing too late that his flat tire ruse cost rather than saved him weight.This memoir deserves a far wider audience than it has heretofore gotten-perhaps a general business audience, as it recounts an informative history of entrepreneurship and risk taking, determination, work, and sound management. As a young cowboy riding for wages, Dunklee had naively believed that the first concern of the rancher was caring for cattle and riding. After leasing the O Bar J, however, Dunklee shortly learned otherwise. During his years managing the ranch, the husbanding of the herd became something of an afterthought to be fit into early mornings, late nights, and spare time, while his primary duties concerned the finances, marketing, contract negotiations, and general wheeling and dealing necessary to keep his operation alive during the drought.If you were a cow, however, you could have done far worse than being in John Dunklee's herd, as ranching was plainly more than his business, it was a calling-Dunklee was constantly occupied during his tenure at the O Bar J looking after the cows, tending to their health, and working them with the objective of disturbing the herd no more than absolutely necessary. The yielded the result that even during the drought, the average weight of his calf crop increased significantly over the prior owner's. The drought, however, took a toll on the herd in spite of Dunklee's best efforts, and the book contains more than one heartbreaking scene when the buzzards of the title get the upper hand.Leasing the ranch thrust Dunklee into the actual business of raising cattle, with opportunities and problems in all directions. His first responsibility became making good decisions: To cut his losses and sell the herd, or risk everything in an attempt to outlast the drought? Who to hire? Who to trust? Which calves should be sold at auction? Which cattle should be kept? It was a second education in self reliance, lessons that plainly served Dunklee well in his subsequent careers as a cattle order buyer, college professor, furniture designer, and author-some of the history of which is recounted in the author's other memoir of the U.S./Mexico cattle trade in the early 1960's, Coyotes I Have Known.It was touch and go at first on the O Bar J, as Dunklee learned his trade and came to understand how truly tough it would be surviving this drought. But he learned on the job, and slowly he gathered the information and skills to tough it out. One summer day in June, 1956, just as Dunklee was beginning to think his situation hopeless, as he was scanning the Arizona Cattlegrowers Weekly Newsletter, sort of a pre-Internet message board used by ranchers for sharing rain reports and tips, he came across a \\"note from a rancher in the Prescott area which mentioned that he was paying fifty-three dollars a ton for 2:1, including delivery, from Western Cotton Products in Phoenix,\\" far less than the going price of range supplement in Tuscon (2:1 being a type of feed for when there's no forage). The following day Dunklee was in Phoenix checking it out, and when the quoted price turned out to be valid, his mind was made up.\\"I was going to fight the drought!\\" he writes. It's a triumphant moment.Dunklee's book is moreover an entertaining chronicle of the wild cattle markets of the times, as prices careened up and down in reaction to the drought. He plainly relishes recounting the details of the cattle auctions, contracts, and freewheeling negotiations which were his primary activities as a rancher managing a going concern.Though raised in New York and New Hampshire, Dunklee writes with the plainspoken, independent voice of the westerner. His prose is direct and spare -plainly a product of self reliant western culture-and at times wryly humorous.One day Dunklee came across a bull which had become addicted to prickly pear, a cactus plant which slowly and surly kills cows by puncturing their innards, as prickly pear spines don't digest like the spines of cholla cactus. One of the symptoms is really bad, black diarrhea. As Dunklee drove the bull off to auction, a brand new white sports car driven by an impatient young woman pulled up behind the truck, beeping the horn . . . and you can guess what happens next. There's a lot to laugh at in Good Years for the Buzzards -Clearly, John Dunklee was the kind of cowboy who kept his sense of humor no matter the hand he was dealt."},{"Title":"Good Years for the Buzzards","review":"I have read this book and enjoyed it immensely.

Either he has an amazing memory or, more likely, he's embellished a bit of this to fill in the gaps to make it a readable memoir. I can't remember what I ate for breakfast, never mind what I ate or longed to eat for breakfast when I was wee child.The book reads like a novel and I quickly forgot it was a first hand account of growing up in a slum with absolutely nothing but an exhausted mum, a lush of a dad who can't keep a job and a slew of younger siblings who seem to die off as soon as the next one is born. Frank grows up quickly because mom is tired, dad is lazy and he and his younger brother must take of the younger kids, scour the lane for bits of coal to keep his family warm, steal bits of food to survive and then face cruelty at school. The book is pretty grim but compelling enough that I wanted to continue reading to see how Frank makes it out alive.I've seen criticism that this book is a one-sided view of Ireland during the depression and from what I read it looks like that is true. Many times in the book the author points out that other boys had shoes and weren't eating a pig head for Christmas dinner but the author gets away with it because he is writing from his experience and not of the experience of the boy with the full belly and hard-working father.This was a thoroughly compelling, wryly funny, and often tragic read. It's much longer than most of the books I read but when the end came it was too soon."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I knew Frank McCourt in New York City, although not well. He kept so much to himself I didn't have many interactions with him. He sat on a stool in the corner of his brother Alphie's restaurant/bar on the Upper West Side of New York City, where I worked, sipping a glass of something, always alone. This was a decade before he published Angelia's Ashes. If one word described him then it would be \\"calm,\\" although I once heard him refer to a bar customer as \\"a bloody Englishman.\\" He was quiet, polite, his gray hair well barbered, his clothes always neat. The loudest thing about him was his Irish face, which for all the McCourts shouted \\"Mickey.\\" Sometimes Frank's brother Malachy came in and there would be three McCourts at the bar together. Whenever a McCourt brother was asked a question he raised his eyebrows and stared off into the distance several seconds to ponder, pursed his lips, then answered in a resigned sigh as if loath to let go of the words. This was usually followed with an ironic joke of some sort and then maybe a \\"Hah, hah!\\", with the accent on the last \\"hah.\\" Frank was an okay guy. All the McCourts were sociable sorts.I never suspected Frank had a rugged childhood because there wasn't a hint of it in his demeanor. In his memoir he describes being one of an underclass of County Limerick poor (some of whom today contest the veracity of his memories) who were destitute and starving in the 1930s and 40s, living on tea and bread bought from the public dole. The McCourts' father, Frank writes, could not go three weeks without spending all his wages on an alcoholic binge, losing his job as a result. Their father left for work in London during WWII and seldom sent his family back anything, presumably drinking what he made and lying in English gutters on the weekends. The harsh nature of Irish culture in Limerick at that time exacerbated the shame and humiliation felt by the McCourts for being destitute.I have a feeling that, like all good autobiographies, some events and characters in Frank's book were enlarged, some reduced, others adjusted and sculptured to focus and shape the narrative. If George Orwell did that sort of thing in books like Down and Out in Paris and London then Frank McCourt deserves the same latitude. Frank certainly re-spun the dialogue from what he remembered, aided by years being as aspiring writer and playwright. Be that as it may, the text rings true and it is a thoroughly enjoyable book, narrated well by its writer. It's a tribute to endurance and decidedly a book worth reading or listening to."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"How do you tell a tale of a poverty-stricken upbringing with humor and grace? Frank McCourt does it in his memoir in a way that will keep you turning pages long after the last time you said to yourself, \\"I really must put this book down and get ... done.\\"After the tragic loss of his 7-week-old sister Margaret, Frank's family (dad, mom, 3-year-old brother Malachy and 1-year-old twins Oliver and Eugene) moves back to Ireland when Frank is four. They are promptly turned away from their paternal grandparents' house and sent to Dublin, where they are told that Frank's father should be able to get some compensation for having fought for Ireland's cause. This turns out to be untrue, and, penniless, they end up at the police station, where only the kindness of the officers gives them the money they need to continue to their maternal grandmother's home.Frank's father is a drunkard from Northern Ireland who can't keep a job longer than the third paycheck, and even the dole money he is given when out of work winds up going to drink rather than to feeding his family. They live with fleas, in a unit that floods on the lower level, forcing them to spend much of their time upstairs.The reader finds out about the peculiar prejudice of the southern Irish against those of the North, easily distinguishable by their accents, and also about the injustice bred by poverty. We see Frank and his family going hungry while other families eat, and Frank wishing that someone else could be his mother simply because then he could always have mashed potatoes or soup. Siblings sicken and die, and his mother is shamefully reduced to begging for scraps to feed her children. Other fathers go to England to work, as does Frank's father, but, unlike the other fathers, no money is sent to his family. In spite of Frank's intelligence and the recommendation of his schoolmaster, Frank is turned away as an altar boy due to his poverty, and other doors are closed to him as well.In spite of it all, there is hope and laughter in this novel. There are people we want to punch, and people we want to hug. There is the small joy of having enough to buy a piece of candy or go to the movie, and the larger joy of sometimes having a full meal or a couple of coins in your pocket.This is a tug-at-your-heart, in your face look at a hardscrabble life that many of us couldn't imagine, written by someone who falls in love with the words of Shakespeare and with Wodehouse novels while recovering from typhoid fever in the hospital. It is a tale that all readers will love, and I highly recommend it for anyone's shelves.QUOTESShe says that if Dad's job lasts we'll get proper cups and maybe saucers and some day, with the help of God and His Blessed Mother, we'll have sheets on the bed and if we save a long time a blanket or two instead of those old coats which people must have left behind during the Great Famine.That dog is a right Hindu, so she is, and that's where I found her mother wandering around Bangalore. If ever you're getting a dog, Francis, make sure it's a Buddhist. Good-natured dogs, the Buddhists. Never, never get a Mahommedan. They'll eat you sleeping. Never a Catholic dog. They'll eat you every day including Fridays.Your mind is your house and if you fill it with rubbish from the cinemas it will rot in your head.

The book took me a lot longer to read then i thought it would, because i was constantly falling in and out of love with it (so to speak.) There were parts in the book that (coming from a mothers point of view) just ripped me to pieces.. and made me want to read more and more... and other parts that made me want to put it down and leave it for a while. At some points as i moved forward in the book, i felt as if i were re-reading the previous chapters.. only every once in a whlie was something new and exciting added. Overall the book was great! It made me very thankful to be surrounded by such caring family and friends.. and have a roof over my head and food in my belly. The ending was abrupt.. but there's a sequel, that i have already added to my wish list."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I'm an avid reader, and after much critical and popular acclaim, I read Angela's Ashes, and was not disappointed. By now most people know what the story is about. I for one didn't love the style in which it was written, almost as a stream of consciousness, with not much use for puncutation and I found that distracting at first. It written in the first person present tense, which I agree with other reviews gives the reader the notion that this is happening now, and the events are described to you through the eyes and voice of this child.I came away with the impression that Angela is the reluctant hero in the boy's eyes. She was not, it seemed to be, a mother who moved mountains with her sheer will and determination for her family, but rather she did what had to be done, knowing there was noone else who would do it besides her, since her husband was an alcoholic who could not keep down a job for very long and drank what little money he made. I found curious the comment that young Frankie made about how they may not have had enough money to buy a little food, but that \\"Mam always had her\\" cigarettes. I also found it interesting that Frankie didn't make similar comments about his father. He speaks of his father as if he understands he is a broken man, and that he doesn't mean to disappoint his family, that he doesn't intentionally do the things he does. Frankie reminisces fondly of the time he spends with his father on his lap, listeneing to his very imaginative stories, or spending time with him early in the morning before everyone else gets up, so he has his father all to himself. He never speaks of his mother that way, and I wonder why. Is it because he knows his mother is too consumed with misery and worry over where their next barely adequate meal will come from, where the rent money will come from, to be able to enjoy such moments with her children? I suppose that's what we are meant to infer. I didn't appreciate the ending, the not knowing what happens to his mother and his brothers after Frankie leaves for America. It seemed rather abrupt the way the novel ended, with him saving enough money for his boat trip to America. We don't know what becomes of him afterwards, but i suppose that's so we will buy the next book 'Tis.All in all, I did enjoy this memoir. It is an uplifting story, one that should make 90% of us in this country hug our children closer and thank God in Heaven that we didn't share Frank McCourt's background."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"One of many feelings this book will give you is guilt. Frank McCourt is just one of millions who lived in horrible poverty in ireland in the 20s. From the drunk father to the strict religion, Frank McCourt deals with the stereotypes of a irishmen times 10. He lives in terrible poverty in a very wet, dieseased, dirty Ireland, and loses siblings left and right. This book will dry up every ounce of water in your body and make you laugh terribly hard at the same time. The sorrow Frank McCourt goes through is unimaginable, but still seems to include humor into his book. The sing songy way of writing and the run on sentences have a poetic way about them. Reading Frank McCourt working his way to getting to America with all of his struggles and setbacks really make an impression on a reader. The book is a great overwhelming combonation of happiness as sadness with near perfection. Imagining such a lifehood is like a fantasy. -TGS"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Most focus on the darkness of this novel (as sadly did the movie), but to me it represented the ability to find humor in the darkest days. I read this book and thought it was really funny. I lived outside the US at the time in an underdeveloped country and my work mates thought it depressing. I thought - it must be me. Later, I asked my mom what she thought (being the child of Irish Americans who were born at the turn of the 20th century). She thought it was funny. I then chalked it up to my family having an odd sense of humor or just my own maligned memories of my childhood visiting with my super elderly Irish great aunts and uncles in New York/Newark who had a similar sense of humor. I then returned to the US and began to work with another Irish American, older than I, whose Irish-American wife read it. She thought it funny too. Then I realized that it must be an Irish American thing, this odd, dry sense of humor even in the worst situations. So, conclusion is that if you don't like a dry sense of humor in the face of very difficult times, then this book isn't for you. But if you can find humor in the more dire of circumstances, this book is absolutely for you. Good reading."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The memoir Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt takes place in Brooklyn, New York and in Limerick, Ireland in the 1930's and 40's. The protagonist, Frank McCourt, is the oldest of eight children. His parents are Malachaly, who is described as \\"shiftless, loquacious, and alcoholic,\\" and his mother, Angela, whom McCourt calls, \\"pious, big-hearted, and overwhelmed.\\" The big Irish family soon has to leave their home in Brooklyn and moves to Limerick after the tragic death of their beloved daughter, Margaret, just as the Great Depression takes hold in America. Their home in Ireland isn't ideal to the family; their rented flat is a complete rat's nest and they share one bathroom with all their neighbors. For years, the family only eats bread and tea because that is all they can afford on their welfare money, when Mr. McCourt doesn't take it all and use it to get drunk. Eventually, the kids have to steal food just to get through one more day; they even become beggars on the streets at times. Life in Ireland for the family is very brutal and harsh as the Great Depression and their own father's self-destructiveness swallows up their hopes as well on the other side of the Atlantic.Though the storyline is sad and heartbreaking, Frank McCourt does an amazing job brightening up the memoir at times. \\"Mam turns toward the dead ashes in the fire and sucks at the last bit of goodness in the Woodbine butt caught between the brown thumb and the burnt middle finger. Michael . . . wants to know if we're having fish and chips tonight because he's hungry. Mam says, Next week, love, and he goes back out to play in the lane.\\" This is an example of McCourt taking a deep and dark moment and using humor to lighten it up. This moment is very symbolic to Angela's dreams and shows how the family struggles for food on a daily basis. As I was reading this passage (insert a comma here) I tried figure out why the title is Angela's Ashes, I think I've figured it out but I won't ruin it for you. While reading Mr. McCourt's remembrance, it was clear money was always an issue for the family, but after finishing the book, I realized that money wasn't the real conflict. Family, loving one another, and being together are the true conflicts that the family endures the entire book. The father is unable to find a job in Ireland and travels far away to work, he promises to send money but he is never heard from and trying to feed eight hungry children is difficult for Angela. This broken family sticks together and battles their miserable lives in multiple homes that they stay at throughout the town of Limerick.At first, this book was both depressing and sad, but as I read through it, I saw more than that and discovered that it has more of a deep and a more underlying meaning than I thought it would. From reading this compelling memoir, I got a better understanding of how life can be so cruel but yet the McCourt family managed to carry on with little food and thin clothing during harsh winters. At one point, I got sucked into the book and I felt like I was one of the eight kids searching through dumpsters trying to find any scraps of food, and yet I managed to laugh at the funny and nave things the younger kids say. I don't think I've read a tome that has ever made me feel so many different emotions. As one reviewer wrote when McCourt's book came out, \\"It brings tears and smiles together as close as they can ever be.\\""},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read this book many years ago, and I still find myself thinking about it from time to time. This was a wonderful, yet morose, novel. This story lays out a compelling story of how Frank (barely) survived childhood in the hands of poverty and alcoholism. Frank's story just gets more and more depressing as you read, but his need to survive is unquenchable.Truly, a wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"My father gave this to me awhile ago and I recently passed that copy to his brother at my dad's funeral. My father and his sister found strong similarities in McCourt's book to their Irish Catholic childhood in Boston. And I found much of my father in this book, perhaps not the abject poverty but the hard life, the Catholic school severity and many of the sayings, language and attitudes, even the alcoholism, especially the alcoholism.It's a great tale of overcoming adversity, with humor so poignant to be laugh out loud and done so well as a first person child [Frank as a youth]. We root for Frankie and he does not disappoint. The language is raw and the narrative pure, he relates the ugliness in life and his own adaptive nature; perhaps that's why it succeeds despite some of the controversy it stirred up.Thank you McCourt for the insight into a childhood of hardship and adversity as well as into my father's own life.When I asked my uncle at the funeral about their tough childhood and poverty, he said, \\"We were mobile, we realized we didn't have to stay in this life. We could move.\\" And they did.As Frank also does.Painful, insighful and relevant.

To add to his dreadful,poor little life,Francis had the added burden of an alcoholic father who would rather drink his wages than feed his starving,malnourished children and a well-meaning but ineffectual mother who produced babies regularly,only to see them die.

If only I could give them a taste of my watermelon, a bite of my steak, a drink of my milkshake..... Some people commented on the book jacket that they couldn't understand how Frank could have risen from that dismal life in Limerick to become so successful.

My God! Was it because we have Irish roots &amp; souls? I did NOT find this book to be &quot;self-pity tripe&quot; as others have described it. I thought the author spoke in a unique running narrative, with a matter-of-fact rather than &quot;woe is me&quot; tone. Hell, I challenge anyone describing this as their history to make it sound upbeat. The truth was a story in itself and it has occured many times over throughout our human history. That he survived in an indifferent world was uplifting. I have many connections to this. I come from a long line of passionate, creative people who love and live hard. Many of them have made the mistakes of McCourt's father and mother. A handful have gone to succeed like the author and his siblings. But the very best was Frank McCourts opening. The first few paragraphs of the book set the stage nicely. In short, he says a happy childhood may not have the worth of a difficult one. Hard beginnings have created some of the best characters out there. I'm sure I would be a very different person myself if I came from &quot;soft&quot; beginnings. But I did not. I'm the strong and passionate person I am because I did not, and that is the way of the world.

Frank's memoir of his childhood begins in Brooklyn, New York in 1935 when his mother, Angela, and his father, Malachy travel from Ireland in hopes of a better life. Frank was born out of wedlock, forcing his parents to eventually marry. Frank is raised in the house of a cigarette addicted mother and an alcoholic father, and is forced to take on many grueling responsibilities. Their family continues to grow, causing them to fall deeper into poverty. The dreadful poverty and the devastating death of his sister, Margaret, eventually drove Frank and his now growing family back to Limerick, Ireland. In Ireland, Angela's mother bought them an apartment which eventually became their home. Frank and Malachy are enrolled in a Catholic school, where they are often tormented by the other boys for being less fortunate. The boys are not only looked down upon by their classmates, but also by the school masters. Frank's teachers chose to treat him inferior because of their lower social status. As Frank grows older more responsibility is placed upon him to raise his younger siblings. He is forced to lead his family as they beg for food and money from neighbors and church. Their poverty becomes even more serious as their father continues to throw their money away to satisfy his alcohol obsession. Frank is now old enough to hear his father stumble in at night belting Irish songs. He is old enough to hear is mother yelling and sobbing at her husband to become a respectable man and look after his failing family. Despite these late drunken nights, Frank remembers the stories his father shared with him when he was a young boy, and the lessons he instilled in him, trying to position that image over his now drunken father. His father then decides to move to England to work in the factories at the onset of World War II, hoping to earn money to support his family. As expected, he is unfaithful to his word and spends the little money he earns on drinks. The McCourt's are no longer able to pay their small rent, and are forced out of their apartment. Reluctantly, Angela's relatives offer to house the struggling family. At the age of fifteen, Frank has experienced far more then the average grown man and decides that it is time for change. He has lived through hunger, devastation, tears, and death and has witnessed his family fall to pieces. He is certain that this is not the way for him to live, and is ready to become an independent, self-sufficient man. To begin his path away from these horrors he finds a job as a mailman, hoping to someday earn the money to escape back to America.Frank McCourt was able to open my eyes to the horrors and tribulations of poverty. The everlasting hardships told through the eyes of a young boy allowed me to realize the sincere pain that is experienced. As jobs were lost, and deaths occurred I fell deeper into the misery of the McCourt family. As I read through his life, both laughter and tears were shared. Frank McCourt told this novel using the first person, sharing his stories as if they were occurring for the first time. As he grew older and experienced greater troubles, his writing style became more serious. Although mostly a horrifying story, McCourt used a humorous style to express childhood memories to at times relive the reader from the sometimes upsetting stories. However, the visions of Frank's struggling family still linger in my mind. \\"When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.. . . nothing can compare with the Irish version: the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bullying schoolmasters; the English and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years.\\""},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I love family dramas and reading this book made me feel like one of the family.

Anyway, I give thisbook my highest rating of 5 stars:)"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes tells the hard life story of Frank McCourt. The book starts out in New York where he was born. His Family fall on hard times and they move to Ireland, where they live in poverty. His father is a drunk and is always in the pubs and drinks all their money away. Through the book it shows how McCourt over comes his family problems and becomes a better person from it.The content of the book starts when he is five to till he is seventeen. The book is easy to understand this way, because there is no jumping around. The dialog can be confusing with the Irish dialect, but at the same time it is nice to hear exactly what they would say in certain situations.All in All the, book was great. The author shares with you his hopes and dreams. You want to cry for him in the book because you feel so bad. Then you are so excited when he over comes all the hard ship.I give it four stars. I thought it was a great book. It made you take a look at your life and to see how lucky you really are for what you have. There are some people that have it worse."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Who says publishers are not interested in your life. Frank McCourt proves otherwise. The book is very informative about the life in Irland in the age described by the author. The language is simple, including understandable accent. The story is very touching and realistic though sometimes I got the impression author is taking sadistic pleasure in so thoroughly describing painful experiences.If one is successful in life past painful memories are not painful in present but they give a triumphant feeling having conquered difficulties in life. I am sure Frank McCourt is enjoying his success. The presentation of dialogues has been done in a very peculiar fashion - an unorthodox way for sure. I also enjoyed a comic twist given to otherwise sad situations - kept me reading, otherwise I would not have continued. I am looking forward to reading 'Its.'"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"What really sets Mr. McCourt's story apart from any other memoir, or the rather dramatic (and appalling) childhood he led - what really sets it all above the rest, is simply the style. The lack of punctuation, the run-on sentences, no quotation marks; all give us a truly genuine sense of his thought processes and the swirling madness that was around him. I felt miserable at times, particularly at any point involving going to the restroom in a little hovel outside the McCourt home. Not that it will change anything, but Americans need this kind of literature more than anyone else. We have it so easy, and that is so rarely the case elsewhere."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is an autobiographical memoir of Frank McCourt's childhood. Born withthe \\"odd manner\\" of his North of Ireland father, Frank spent his early years in New YorkCity. His father, Malachy, seldom kept a job for more then three weeks. On that thirdFriday, he would stay out late drinking the wages away, and then get his children up whenhe came home to make them promise to die for Ireland. Frank's mother, Angela,remained at home and prayed her husband would bring home the money so they couldhave a good dinner for once. The family was constantly growing, and by the time Frankwas four years old he had a brother who was a year younger than him, baby twin brothers,and a new baby sister. With the loss of their little girl and hope of a better life, theMcCourts left America for Ireland. The family settled in crowded Limerick where theyhad to live off the dole and charity. As Frank grew older, he not only has to deal with lackof food, but strict Irish Catholic school teachers, more family loss, crude relatives,sickness, ignorance, and extreme poverty.Reading Angela's Ashes was a truly moving experience. Frank McCourt's writingstyle is unique and witty. His earthy words add a humorous edge to an otherwise diresituation. I recommend this book to everybody."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I am particularly impressed by the innocence and true rendition of his memories as a child. I recognize a great amount of similarities in details from my own childhood, which has been clouded and judged by the victimhood-labels I have acquired as an adult. Frank McCourt has inspired me to reevaluate my memories and remember them as I experienced them at each stage of my childhood. This book makes it easy for 'outsiders' to appreciate the 'less fortunate' (to say the least) histories of mankind, whithout being dragged into a searing, guilt-inflicting journey. The humor, and the honest, endearing descriptions of his experiences at the different stages of his childhood, make this book a pearl."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt recounts the deeply moving story of his childhood in Catholic Ireland... an Ireland where bigotted religious zealots make small children feel guilty just for surviving... an Ireland where the Irish detest the English and the Ulstermen, yet are not too proud to take their money off them... an Ireland where the injustice of life is thrust in your face by the tale of a small boy struggling to survive a broken marriage and an alcoholic father.You couldn't fail to read this true story without admiring the spirit of the boy who crawled his way out of the gutter to a better life. His typically Irish sense of humor (and of the absurd) shines through the squalid settings and the dismal truth of the story. You will be touched by his acceptance of burdens that most of us could never even imagine... living in absolute poverty... relying on charity for a pair of boots three sizes too big... collecting scaps of coal that have been ignored by others... always in debt... always cold... always in bad health.We have a lot to be grateful for."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Who would have thunk that a memoir written in the voice of a 10-year-old Irish lad would win the Pulitzer Prize?Well, it did and the recognition was well-deserved.Yes, it's about desperate poverty, alcoholism, consumption, death, you name it - just one damnable thing after the other that confronts Frankie McCourt, his brothers Malachy and Alphie, and mother Angela.But the beauty of this book is its voice, the voice of the very young and very Irish Frank McCourt. It sings, it dances, it laughs at fear and despair, it's a melody of innocence in the midst of a purgatory-on-earth.Angela's Ashes is timeless, a treasure that is sure to stake its claim as a classic."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is the account of Frank McCourt and the reminiscences of his childhood spent in Ireland. The story is told from the perspective of young Francis Mccourt, from the young age of 5 until he hits the age of 19, and we see him mature before our own eyes as the writing manner changes from chapter to chapter. This is a story of how Francis McCourt lived and survived through the desolation of his childhood, with a drunken father. The start of the book is very depressing, with the death of Frank's baby sister, following deaths of his twin brothers, many parts of the books still have funny descriptions. I found myself laughing along the way reading this book and defiantly putting a smile on my face. It is truly amazing the kid has not gone into depression in such an inconsiderate atmosphere. He even had dreams of going to America and earning big bucks, which many had tried to convince him to forget. Frank is one determined person to succeed. This is a book not to miss, the insight of Frank is truly amazing and you see life through a totally different light!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"With trepidation, I started reading Angela's Ashes. I was afraid that: 1) I wouldn't get out if what everyone else has; and 2) I'd find a descriptive memoir like this boring. Happily, I am a third of the way through, and I love the book. I go home during lunch so I can read a few more pages. It's an incredible tale....by the way, how did McCourt remember all this stuff? So far, I can say that I love the kid. Thank goodness for his naivete, which prevented him from realizing how horrendous his upbringing was and allowed him to find some joy and humor in his everyday confines. Wow. The religious angle, coming from a Catholic background, is hilarious, too. There were a lot of thumps on the heads for Frank and his schoolmates. This book brings out other emotions as well, since it's very hard not to greatly dislike his irresponsible father and not to feel so sorry for the other poor kids who starved and had no shoes. I can't wait to get to the end... which brings me to the word &quot;Tis.&quot;"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"After buying this book I thought,&quot;This looks pretty boring&quot;, but after much persuasion I began to read it. I found it so wonderful in fact, it took me three hours to finish!Frank Mc Court writes truthfully about life and his experiences in those days. The young boy's life is very sad. The boy himself is full of wit and charm and has an innocent yet electrical sense of humour.It took me a while to get into the story because a lot of the start of it is descriptive. If I am honest, after the first chapter, I would have to say I was completely and totally engrossed.This is a very sad and depressing story about a family's struggle to cope. My first thought's were &quot;Oh no, I am going to be so depressed after reading this&quot;, but Frank Mc Court really brought about a magical feel to the book.In my opinion, he has done jutice to this story and nobody could have done it better!

Now, after picking it up and reading it, I can honestly tell you that few books have affected me the way this one has.For those who love the language, you're struck with the beauty of the writing, but most importantly you feel helpless as you grow up with McCourt. It's true, everybody has a story to tell, but this one is most special. He has a gift, and I am glad he shared it with us.Put it in your shopping cart now.

It is an account of lives actually lived, not a fiction. Frank McCourt has given us a long slice of life where the world is throwing its all at a family, and the individuals are responding with varying degrees of courage, determination, rage, hope, love and countless other admirable and despicable traits. Those who are disgusted by the details or the tone, I can't explain. But I can offer that this does not demean the Irish who did make wonderful lives for themselves on both shores. My mother's family 'made it' - but she 'got' this story as did I - whose life can't hold a candle to even the mildest of the McCourt's trials. And to those who would rather not look upon such hardship, while Limerick is a very different place today, a large portion of our planet still lives under such conditions - or worse. We do take such suffering and frame it on our walls - only the frame is a TV and we only wish to look at it for mere seconds at a time - where the gravity cannot reach too deeply into us. Bravo Mr. McCourt for showing us how to scale the most extreme hurdles dropped in our way. This is in some way a test of seeing the glass half empty or half full - to live thru this with humor intact is the greatest triumph."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"At first I had absolutely no interest in reading a book about someones hard life in Ireland, even if it was a #1 NY times best seller. There is a lovely Irish woman I ride the bus to work with every day, and we talk for very nearly the whole hour of our ride into work. This woman is in her early 60's. The movie ANGELAS ASHES was about to come out and she mentioned that she read the book three times and cried all 3 times because the book was exactly her life in County Kerry. Every page that she read brought back memories. The extreme poverty, going without shoes all the time, the meanness of the teachers, and a father that drank at every opportunity. She told me that if I want to know what her childhood was like in Ireland just read ANGELAS ASHES. After talking with her I became more than curious and intrigued. The first page of the book is very powerful and sets the stage for the rest of the book. I could not put it down. Who the hell cares about the run on sentences &amp; lack of punctuation. I was so engrossed that I didn't even notice any of that. Some of the best books I've ever read were written in plain language. No fancy, its obvious I've got my PhD jive. Frank McCourt still manages to pull the reader into his story &amp; draw emotions. At least that is what Frank McCourt did with me. Once you are finished reading the book you continue to think about it long afterwards. I am a member of an African-American book club and I put ANGELAS ASHES on the list of books for the other members to read &amp; for us to discuss.

For one, best sellers are not something I typically rush out to read, but also the last thing I was interested in hearing about was yet another woeful &quot;poor me&quot; story about somebody's awful life. However, while wasting time in a bookstore one day I saw the book, read the first page, &quot;...But worst of all we were wet.&quot; and was (almost begrudgingly) hooked. When I got home I read the first 100 pages immediately and, as many others have remarked here, I could not put it down.I have never before experienced a book that made me laugh so hard that tears came to my eyes, while at other times absolutely broke my heart so severely that I had to set the book aside until I was ready to go on.Written from the perspective of a child, the humor of the book is often wrapped up in simply how a child thinks. &quot;If you ask grown-ups anything they just give you a thump on the head and tell you not to ask so many questions.&quot; If you don't care for this interesting perspective for story-telling then, of course, don't buy this book. On the other hand, if you are wondering whether or not it is worth the read-- despite all the hype-- then definitely you should take a look. The only &quot;story telling&quot; drawback I can see is that, it being a memoir and not a hollywood movie, the ending left me dangling: Of course I suppose that's what sequels are for, eh?"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Words can not really describe my feelings as I was reading this autobiography. McCourt captures the experience of the Irish Catholic childhood with faultless accuracy.

This book will make you laugh, cry and seethe with rage at the injustice of it all.For me it was a great source of comfort.

My advice is that you turn off your cell phone and do not attempt to make any appointments or speak to anyone for the next 15 hours. Once you begin to hear this sorryful tale, you will never be the same. You may never stop driving for 15 hours.

Frank McCourt was born in Brooklyn. His mother was a poor Irish Catholic girl who had recently arrived from Ireland. He was conceived out of wedlock but his father, a &quot;man from the north of Ireland, what can you expect,&quot; was forced by his mother's sisters to marry him. The family's circumstances are so desperate they cannot survive in America. His mother, who Frank calls &quot;Mam&quot;, is distraught when her newborn daugher Margaret dies. When Frank is about four the family returns to Limerick, Ireland. There they depend on the dole for survival. Frank's twin brothers die. His father, a drunk, dissipates even the dole money and cannot hold a job. He disappears to England. His mother suffers from illness, loneliness and the humiliation and embarrassment of virtually begging for food. There is no medical care except for the worst situations, and Frank nearly loses his eyesight. The family picks up coal off the street to boil water. Fried bread is the staple of their diet. They live in flat where the lower level is not habitable due to flooding. That level is called Ireland. The upper level is tiny but dry - it is called sunny &quot;Italy&quot;. Just outside the flat is the one lavatory for the entire lane - it always stinks. Despite it all, Frank's intelligence and interest in books is recognized and supported by his schoolmasters. A priest forgives him and blesses him when he confesses to taking a loaf of bread to feed his starving family. Frank works as a telegram boy, saves his money and finally at age 19, makes it to America. The book is written in long sentences that parallel the Irish way of speaking. The writing incorporates Irish humor, religious values and philosophical musings. It is beautifully and engrossingly written. I enthusiastically await volume 2 - how he made it in America."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt writes his memoir much like a run-on diary. I didn't mind this, but I did question some of what he wrote. This book encompasses his life from age three to age nineteen. Most of the book focuses on his earliest years in this time span...from three to nine or ten. I found it difficult to believe the minute details described by Frank from the very beginning were actual memories. I certainly don't remember what I was doing every day of my three, four and five year old existence. He describes returning to Ireland when he was three and his Dad carrying the twins who were crying from hunger, his Mam stopping every few minutes to sit and rest on a stone wall, watching the sky and listening to the birds. Page after page, he describes precise conversations on non-consequential things, describes when and what they ate (or more precisely what they didn't eat). It seemed the entire family lived most of their lives drinking tea and eating fried bread. Three of the children died, and when reading the book, you will wonder how it is that any of them survived. They lived on the public dole through the majority of Frank's years in Ireland. The story is fascinating, but the author has been accused, by his Irish neighbors, of exaggerating the poverty and other events his family endured in the book. When reading his bio, his own mother, Angela, discounted some of the story. Whether she didn't want to admit to these things out of shame or was being truthful is something you will have to judge for yourself."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"McCourt's story could inspire anyone -- even those abused or abandoned in childhood. It will lift the he reader's spirit out of the ashes as if a phoenix. I once heard Mary Tyler Moore say that no one gets through life without pain. True. Who, if anyone, emerges from childhood without wounds? Angela's Ashes teaches that even the devastated can heal, live, laugh, and love.

It's a word you see alot of in this book. Also the repetition of a familiar theme: Drunken father comes home in middle of the night after drinking his wages (or his dole money) at the pub and wakes his children up. Forces them to stand or march in place as he offers them a penny to die for Ireland. What precedes this madness is dysfunctional, codependent mom waiting hopefully, then less hopefully as time goes by, for said husband to come home with wages. Och, och indeed.In between this sad tale we have the McCourt children, in constant need of food, milk, coal, housing, and most of all, sane parenting. The miracle of this book is that McCourt finds the humor, the blessed humor in what otherwise would be one of the most depressing tales since Dickens. Their poverty is just plain awful to read about. Three of the McCourt children die in infancy or a little beyond, because their parents do not get medical care in time.It's a tale of survival, a lyrical jaunt through the madness of dysfunction, ignorance, and threadbare familial love. You could see it as a tale of hope, if only you don't wonder what damage was done to these McCourt child survivors that can never be repaired. If your childhood was tough, this book is for you. However bad it was, this might make you feel like you did a lot better. Cheers to McCourt for this bitter tale of woe with a pinch of hope thrown in."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This memoir by Frank McCourt 's Irish childhood has been praised to the sky. Not only has it won major acclaim, but everyone I know has loved it. I can see why. It has great characters and tears at your heartstrings. You'd have to be made of stone to not relate to the sad and impoverished childhood of the author, and his matter-of-fact courage acceptance of it.The one word that stands out when I think about this book is &quot;food&quot;, or lack thereof. It's surprising this man is still alive and kicking at the age of 68 when I read about his childhood diet. Mostly small pieces of bread and tea and sugar water for babies' bottles. He yearns for an egg as if it is the most precious thing in the world. And when there is nothing else, he licks the grease off the newspapers that have wrapped fish and chips.The family lives on the dole. The father is a drunk. And yet I can't hate the father. He comes across as a man with a problem who loves his family even though every penny he has goes to &quot;the drink&quot;. There's lack of clothing, unheated living spaces, cruel relatives, illness, and the death of little children. All is sad. And very moving, And real.I think of my own childhood. More food than I could eat. Electricity. Plumbing. A warm house. A father who supported the family. A mother who wasn't worn out from hunger and overwork. There's a lot to be thankful for.It's a good book. I have to recommend it. And yet it took me over a week to read because every time I picked it up I kept falling asleep.I read a lot of books. Some of them pull me right in and I can't put it down till I finish it. That's rare though. I'll abandon others after the first few pages. Mostly I generally look forward to reading what I've selected though. I didn't look forward to reading this and found it a chore to finish.Perhaps I had heard too many rave reviews and expected more. Maybe it is as simple as that. There's a certain thrill about discovering a book on my own which was missing. However, it seems I'm the only one in the whole world who felt that way. Do read it for yourself though. It's certainly worthwhile."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I loved this book. McCourt's use of the language is tremendously evocative - you can actually hear the voices speaking as you read. His story-telling is superb - he is able to simultaneously tell a hideous story and roll you on the floor laughing - with tears in your eyes. I thought the passage about his first communion was one of the funniest things I've read in years - in the context of a certifiably hideous childhood.I have no illusions that the people and events depicted here are in any way representative of the Irish Catholic population in general - this is a memoir, a very personal story, and never claims to be anything other than that. It's probably dressed up a bit - I never entirely trust a &quot;memoir&quot; with direct quotes of lengthy conversations, especially when the protagonist is too young to really remember verbatim statements. But even tarted up, it's a great tale - makes you glad to be a German Jew!I recommend this book to anyone with an appreciation of fine writing and a keen ear for the nuances and music of language."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I will be absolutely frank (no pun intended) here and let you know this was a difficult read for me. The memoirs of Frank McCourt were so devastating that I simply wanted to put it down and never remember that I had ever heard of it. So why did I continue to read it? It is beautifully written and I had such hopes that these children who knew nothing but starvation, death, chilled bones, bed bugs, and tragedy from the day they were a seed in their mothers womb, could find a bit of joy and happiness in their lives. And as Frank McCourt shared his dreary childhood with me through this novel, he added lots of humor. I found myself smiling when I knew I should have been weeping. Without this humor, I don't know if I could have read about the alcholic father that worked all week only to take his money and spend it at the pub getting drunk while the children and his wife were home with no food, having to beg neighbors and strangers for something to eat. Without McCourts humor I don't think I could read about how the children were beat and belittled by their teachers as well as other children in the name of learning. Without a bit of humor I couldn't have forged on through the shameful treatment in the name of God that was dumped on this family by the church. When I think about the life of these children and this family I guess without a few laughs in their lives they wouldn't have made it through their lives either. So I guess you are wondering if I recommend this book...yes. Why, because this book is life. Maybe not your life, and maybe not my life, but sometimes we need to know what other people have went through, and are going through to know.... my life isn't as bad as I thought!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt's book Angela's Ashes was a MEMOIR. It was intended to be a truthful and vivid account of his REAL life. I thought it was wonderful, and I learned a lot about what life was like for indigent families in Ireland. Yes, the scenes were graphic and tragedies seemed endless, but it was VERY well-written. I think a lot of people didn't like the book, either because they were expecting a delicate, sugar-coated tale of his childhood or simply because the story forced them to evaluate how many things they took for granted in their own childhood. Guilt can be a terrible thing...Also, how can anyone say that there was too much sadness? This is an ACTUAL account of someone's life. I applaud Mr. McCourt at having shared his pain with his readers. For all of those who did not like this book, next time, pick up one of those predictable romance novels from the grocery store; leave the emotional truths and real-life stories to the rest of us."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"At first I was sceptical about a book that claims outright monopoly on 'miserable childhoods'. There are plenty others in the world who have had to endure miserable circumstances as a child, so the opening passage of the novel rather turned me off with its self-pitying tone. But after reading past the first 5 pages I was transported to another world and couldn't help but be convinced of the harshness of the reality facing little Frank McCourt and his brothers, both in New York and then, in wet and cold Limerick. And the 'miserableness' isn't the point of it at all - what shines as a beacon through the dark cloud of poverty and depression described in the book is McCourt's matter-of-fact will to survive, and to find humour and grace in an otherwise adject existence. The book really made me both laugh and cry at the same time, and stands as a masterpiece in combining both humour and misery, without destroying the integrity of either. If the subject matter doesn't convince you to buy the book, then buy it for its unsurpassed language - McCourt has produced the definitive story told in an Irish accent. 'Tis a fantastic read indeed..."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I believe this book splashed the name Frank McCourt onto the international writing scene. And I think he deserved it. I imagine there are millions of other stories much like his, and I can't imagine that it took this long for someone to tell it and gain such a massive audience. But McCourt is the one who told it and told it very well. Perhaps the best general word for the book is poignant. McCourt experienced such losses and challenges that he had to grow up long before his time. One senses that boyish struggle between wanting to just be a child and realizing that he had seen far too much of life to do that. I will not recount the crises and incidents that make up this life, but I will say that you will be moved profoundly by reading it. That is because there is heart and soul in this account."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"If I were sitting on the Pulitzer Prize committee today deciding who gets it, this book would win hands down and I'm glad it did.In honor of Frank McCourts' passing just a few weeks ago I decided to give his book a try.I remember all the hoopla when it came out thirteen years ago but I'm not one for hoopla.It sat on my shelf for years but I just never got to it.I'm glad that I finally did.Written in a beautiful,clear and distinctly Irish manner it was a delight to read.Chapter after chapter of abject poverty,hunger,filth,disease,alcoholism death and the human struggle of class are all presented in a way that's real and hard to imagine happening,but it did.If what McCourt writes is true and we have no reason to doubt him, the mere fact that he made it to where he did is a miracle and an example of fortitude we can all learn from.The fight for life despite horrible living conditions and the manner in which both his frustration and hopefullness as well as his growing intelligence helping him survive were conveyed in a palpable and at times very funny narrative.After reading this book which in my opinion is destined to be considered a true classic work,it will I'm sure, leave an indelible imprint on your brain that will remain there for a while.Just because it took me thirteen years to read it doesn't mean you have to. Read it now so you too can see the beauty of what a little hard boiled egg and a slice of ham could mean to someone.It might taste differently to you after reading this classic memoir."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"If not for his sense of humor, would Frank McCourt have survived his childhood?

Despite miserable poverty, an alcoholic father, and the death of three siblings, Frank manages to work his way towards a dream of returning to America. Major hardships are the backbone of the novel, but the author's use of colloquial language and religious symbolism adds lightheartedness to the suffering.

This quote is from Frank McCourt's memoir, Angela's Ashes. The constant theme throughout the entire memoir is the suffering McCourt went though during his childhood.Frank McCourt was born in New York, and grew up in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. As he takes you through the memories of his childhood, the suffering at times is hard to believe. McCourt and his family lived with hardly any food or clothing, due to the pure laziness of McCourt's alcoholic father. And when you believe that things can't get any worse for the family, they do. Countless deaths, many illnesses, taunting school children, and small triumphs, all color the book and its many pages.McCourt uses descriptions that put vibrant images in your head of his keen memory of his childhood. You can almost feel his hunger pains at times. When the slightest happiness occurs, you are there to feel the joy. Although the book is saddening, McCourt makes light of even the darkest of situations with his subtle humor.His great ability to retain all of his life memories is truly remarkable; yet his childhood seems to the utmost extreme. We formed a sense of compassion for his family's mishaps, but some scenes leave us disturbed. With the repetitive deaths, illnesses, and poverty factors, we feel that tends to bore us. Overall it is a descriptive and valid piece of history.We find this memoir to be one of the best pieces of literature we have ever read. Filled with emotion and with undying attentiveness, McCourt has caught our eye and has kept us there, by his side, throughout the book. His story illustrates a piece of world history that we must not forget, and it leaves us more thankful for what we have."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"yeah i read the book Angela's Ashes, in my college english class at my high school.

Frank's childhood shows not only the anguish he faced as a child, but presents a logic that the reader must adapt before finishing the book. The simple yet imaginative mind of young Francis kept me reading hours on end, and when I finished I had no choice but to find it's successor, 'Tis, in order to continue on his personal journey to find something worth living for."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is definitely worth reading. The tone is similar to 'Life is Beautiful' - poignant. It's a great talent to be able to recount a sad, perhaps bittersweet, childhood with a sense of humour and yet that's what Frank McCourt is able to do. He is able to take you into the past with him. You can hear the accents (especially when it's set in his early childhood in Brooklyn, NY), almost smell the scents, both pleasant and unpleasant, and see the surroundings. He paints an interesting picture of his family. Though he honestly recounts his father's alcoholism he does so without judgement - he merely states the facts. When his father basically abandons the family he just simply disappears from the storyline without Frank McCourt expounding any further. Yet at times through the memoir I laughed so hard that tears came to my eyes. Closer to the end of the book you can sense a change of pace. There's a certain loss of innocence with the discovery of the opposite sex and what it can lead to. But all in all a very good read. It was so engrossing I finished it in one day. I look forward to seeing the video though I can sense it won't be as good as the book.

Easy and smooth reading, no intellectual effort is required, although some readers are annoyed by the excess emphasis on poverty (rats, lice, diseases, hunger, dirt, etc.) The story reflects the cruel reality of poverty, be it in Ireland or in any other part of the world. It is all viewed from the perspective of a small child and his struggle for survival, his awareness of the distortions between a fanatic Christian environment in which the teachings of love, sharing, respect, are far from his daily reality. The story appeals to our feelings of sorrow for the existence of so much misery in this world, which explains why the book has been so successful. A more demanding and critical reader might find the book lacking in terms of structure, style, and historical depth; all of these compensated by abundant human feeling."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Very slow read. I found it hard to get into because the same things kept happening to Frank, (hunger, drunk father, poor home life)but the only thing that changed was his age. Read it in my book club and none of us really liked it. We watched the movie and it was okay, but it skipped a lot of the story and the order of things that occurred in the book were not the same as in the movie. The movie gave the mother more of a voice and made the viewer want to feel sorry for the father-the book did the opposite. My opinion: don't bother with it."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read this book with one prevailing thought - thank God my mother got out of Ireland and came here! Frank McCourt is an extremely gifted writer, and his words flow seamlessly, but I would much rather read about people who didn't just experience adversity but overcame it. While the author obviously had the necessary survival skills, both his parents, while disappointed with their lot in life, seemed content to let their misfortune wash right over them and their children. There is no fighting spirit, no desire to improve their condition, just the vague hope that someone will come along and miraculously provide food, shelter, and most importantly alcohol to keep the children and parents going. At best, it serves merely to reinforce the stereotype of the Irish as lazy, drunk irresponsible and undereducated. McCourt would have done better to downplay his mother's role in his life and concentrate on his brothers and himself. In fact, the book should more aptly be titled &quot;Frank McCourt's Ashes,&quot; since apparently he was the Phoenix that rose from them."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"chapter 1 pa's drunk and ma's crying and the little wee ones have soiled themselves. it's raining here in limerick. i.chapter 2 ma is sitting by the fireplace crying. so i go down to the pub and there is pa. he is drunk.chapter 3 so we go to america. tis a wonderful place. it might rain in limerick but it gets godawful cold in new york. and by the way, pa is drunk and ma is crying by the fire and the little wee ones have bees knees and thrushes ankles before them on the supper plate. i."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Not quite as good as had been recommended to me but I would read it again - a bit different style of writing - Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country - am I at 20 words yet?"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I can't really add more than the other more insightful reviewers have written.

McCourt's writing style is annoying and he seems to dwell more on sexual issues than necessary (especially his own masturbation). The sequel to this book was even more disappointing.

I think he should have also focused a bit more on his mother Angela as he did entitle the book after her. I also think he was constantly repititive in every chapter, \\"Oh my dad drank all his dole money away\\", \\"We are poor\\", \\"excitement\\"I still give this book a 4 star rating because it was a good book, just some flaws that I personally think McCourt could have worked on."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Do you like to read autobiography? Then, Angela's Ashes was written for you. The book is a non-fiction work. In 1938, Frank McCourt and his family lived in America. Later that year, his sister was born and died one night when she was an infant. His alcoholic father and his pious defeated mother and Frank and his brother's moved back to Limerick, Ireland.This book is a classic, of what an Irish childhood was like living in poverty. Frank McCourt made it clear from his book that Irish Catholic childhood his miserable.Frank was a poor boy who lived in America after the death of his sister Margaret. His mom couldn't stay in the house. She would often hear Margaret and smell her and see her even though...They move back to Ireland. Were it's worse then America. When they got to Limerick the Irish people lived in poor houses they were starving. Frank's father who has a problem with drinking. Who can't hold a job, when he gets a job he gets paid, spends it on beer. Angela Frank's mom is sad, loves her family, but hates her husband for drinking. Angela's mother doesn't like Malachy, which is Frank's dads' name. They don't like him because his from the north. So one-day Frank's dad left and never came back. It was hard on his mother, frank got a job. They had to move out of their house they lived with some guy. Who control his mother....I've reviewed this this autobiography and I loved it. The way his family believed in the Catholic Church how much love and strength they had for one another. The survival of Frank and his brother's is what the book is mainly about. They were poor and hungry. This book inspired me and made me feel good about myself that I come from a culture that takes care of me.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashed by Frank McCourt is a story about a man looking back on his childhood. This is a really moving book. You see a kid who had to act as a adult at a young age. This author shows us the tragedies he had to go through as a young boy. First they lived in Brooklyn, New York during the depression and then move to the slums of Limerick in Ireland. The McCourt family barely ever has food. They had to beg on the streets and to the church to survive the day. I and anyone else can walk away from this book and feel grateful for their life in America. Through this book Frank McCourt takes you through his whole life from before he was born till he got away. Reading about such a determine kid inspires you.

It remains one of the finest I have ever read."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"My High School Junior English class was assigned to find a book that portrays the American Dream in some way. I chose this book because I had heard it was a great piece of literature and it described the hardships of Irish lives in a way that few others could even fathom. This book made me realize how lucky I am. Francis had to live in poverty, sickness, despair, but he always tried to find a brighter way out of things. The book brought tears to my eyes with his descriptions of his drunk father who wouldn't support them to his mother who had such high hopes of a good life for them that were crushed by the life they lived. It was an eye-opener to me as far as to how people lived. I live in a comfortable house with heat and electricty but it made me realize that not all people are as fortunate as I am. Mr. McCourt used analogies in his story that I would never have even thought would have made sense until I read them here. I love the one where he talks about how his father is like the Holy Trinity with his three different personalities. McCourt uses the power of words to portray sadness and hope in a way that is not normally found in books. This book was incrediable and I definatly would recommend it to anyone who needs an eye-opening experience. I know it opened mine."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The book Angela's Ashes was a self account written by Frank McCourt. The book goes back in time and through Frank's childhood and talks about all the troubles he had to experience while growing up in a poor catholic Irish family. The book starts out by Frank remembering as much as he could from his childhood as young as he could remember it (although he does include how his parents met, I'm sure this is from what stories he has been told by relatives). He goes onto tell about the hardships his family went through and how hard they had to work to overcome these obstacles. Frankie grew up changing housing quite often because his father couldn't hold a steady job and back in poor Ireland, landlords wanted their money just like everyone else. The hardest part about Frank's family trying to keep a home was that any money his father would earn he would go and spend at the pub and then he would show up to the job drunk and therefore get fired instantly for being late or drunk to work. Frankie's mother had to stay at home and raise their rapidly growing and rapidly diminishing family. He accounts to the several deaths of people quite close to him that he witnessed at a young age and the hard times he himself had to endure as he was sent to work to help support his family and himself at a young age. There are many things Frankie himself had to do which caused him to mature and become the status of an adult long before his time. While other boys and girls were out playing in the streets kicking rocks to pass the free time, Frankie and his brothers were walking around by the coal docks picking up the coal chunks that were left on the streets. From steeling food to try to keep his family living to going and living with relatives to get a higher and better job, Frankie didn't have much time for himself to grow and realize who he really was. This book was touching to the spirit and adjusting to the eyes.As a young middle classed person, it showed me how it really was to live in times such as these for a poor family trying to make things work. It shows the relationship between mother and father and children and how they wanted the best for their kids. I couldn't put this book down and many nights sat with a box of Kleenex next to the bed as I sat and read. I would recommend this book to anyone who I thought would take it for what it's worth and understand just exactly what Frankie and his family had to go through to get to where he was in his life at the stories end.While I was reading this book, I thought a lot about my friends and family. Living in a totally different time period made a difference but there where things that could apply to times of today. I would often read something that Frankie had to go through such as a death of someone, and I would think how would I be able to handle that at his age? Or the fact that Frankie started working when he was a young boy, I don't know how I would have been able to give up my childhood as easily as he did. Reading this book really made me think about how far would I really go to help my family survive. Frankie put not only himself on the line but all of his family members and even through the hardships loved them all unconditionally."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is the type of book which no film can capture the atmposphere of - a truly sad yet funny story at the same time.

Then my friend encouraged me to read it as she said it was funny and so I decided to give it another chance.I started laughing on the second page in - it was fantastic.

Here is the story of a young man who is raised in the poorest of the poor in Limerick, Ireland who had to beg for food to eat, pick up coal off the streets for heat, write threatening letters to friends and family for extra money, and even help tear down a wall in his house to feed the fire. It sure made me feel spoiled and appreciate the good life that I have.I liked the stories. Every childhood is this eventful, or at least should be. You learn to like Frank McCourt and even identify with him as he questions the things in life, like the angel on the 7th step and religion in general. You read as Frank McCourt spends years saving up money so he can do what his teacher urged him to do: Go to America where he can have more opportunity.I loved this book and the movie did a very fair job of depicting the events of this book. My only complaint is Mr. McCourt's lack of quotation marks. Sometimes it is very hard to understand who is talking at a given time. You can figure it out from the context, but you would expect more from an English teacher. The quotation marks would have made it flow better.However, I would not hesitate recommending this book to anybody."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I'm 17 years old and I had to read this book for summer reading for school.

But, when I was reading it, I found myself gradually thinking here I am, inclined to give this man a lot of credit because he had horribly difficult beginings and his style of retelling them is so humble and warm. It's not a book to make you think - at all - that is, unless for some reason you've never had any other occasion to think of the misery of other people. It's not a book that challenges one's way of approaching the world, at all, unless one has never considered the differences between having and not having, before. In other words, if you're really smug and insular and have gone around all your life thinking that waiting in line at the supermarket is an inhuman punishment, Frank McCourt will rock your world. Otherwise, I'm not so sure. Otherwise, it's just a good book, not the best.

Here is a classic to be reckoned with. Imagine having a pig's or sheep's head as the main course for your Chistmas feast. Who needs ghosts to explain the meaning of life when you have an angel waiting to explain it on your very own step?Frank McCourt paints a tale more poignant and classic than any fiction in history. How could one find fault with a protagonist who is a mere child and one weaned on abject poverty, no less? How could find fault with an antogonist who is the child's father, plagued by hopeless alcoholism and who's dream of a Free Ireland has left him in the mere shadows of the Erin's fighting spirit and idealism?You can hear the accents of each character and the settings' period in McCourt's choice of words. You laugh along side the voice his memories portray, but by the end you are weaping for the meager existence of his family and the loss of his innocence.McCourt speaks volumes to the Irish soul in all of us. He makes us long to recall our own youth with the same sense of humor and pure empathy. If we could all love so well.

Above all that, she wakes up in filth, goes to sleep in filth, but never knows the luxuries that she is missing. That is why I think she survived. Frankie's story is that of a Catholic child.

McCourt may not use proper grammar and punctuation, but he certainly can depict a childhood full of deprivation, neglect, optimism, and wonder. Hats off to a man who survived a depression-era Irish childhood and went on to a fine teaching career at New York City's finest public high school."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Harrowing and haunting yet heartbreakingly funny in its use of language"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I found Angela's ashes to be one of the most touching, sarcastic and humourous books I have ever read - and I read a lot. It's amazing how Frank McCourt manages to express and savour such tragic childhood memories in such a moving way . After reading the book all you want to do is read it all over again because you can feel the love and warmth seep through every page in spite of such a depressing subject. That is Frank McCourt's great talent. I sincerely hope he continues to write because unfortunately it's hard to come across books that stay with you after you've read them. We need more books like Angela's Ashes."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt described his life in Ireland with vivid vibrance and great detail, even after all of these years. The title is appropriate and makes you want to read further into this incredible memoir. Malachy, Frankie's father, was truly an odd one from the north in the eyes of the men and women of Limerick, and maybe Frankie did posess a few of his qualities, but I believe those helped the book along and made it all the more easier to relate to. I too am Irish, and even though I have never been to my country I believe I know it as well as the messenger telegram boys."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is the best book that I have ever read. It is hillarious. The Irish humor and the deep grief that are felt make it an all time classic. I could picture everything in my head as if I had actually been there. I loved it. A definate must read for all. Thanks for sharing your story Frank McCourt"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book projects such a wide range of emotions it's nothing short of amazing. I felt extreme joy at times, extreme anger, and everything in between. If you haven't read this book, you must. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I found the book powerful and moving. I was unable to put it down. However, I was left with some unsettled feelings. What did Mr. McCourt learn from his early experiences? At the books end, he was heading down the same destructive path as his father. At what point did he change? Why? At times his story was repetative, especially his father's drunkeness, Angela's weakness and Frank's own early sexual exploits. I found the ending particularly disturbing. He finally arrives in America, land of hope, and sleeps with a married stranger. All that said, I would still recommend it to others and look forward to the sequel. Maybe my questions will be answered then."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"It's been a few days since I finished reading this book, and I can't stop thinking about it. &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; moved me in a way that no other memoir has. I felt so many emotions while reading this book. I was horrified at the utter squallor that Frank McCourt and his family lived in. I was shocked and angry at the way Frank's father treated his family. I cried when Frank's little sister Margaret and his twin brothers died. And I rejoiced when Frank finaly achieved his dream and emmigrated to America. This book was beautifully written. It was an ingenious idea to write a memoir from a child's perspective because that made the story all the more powerful. &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; did something else for me: it made me grateful for everything I had as a child growing up in America. I wasn't rich by any means. I had a middle class upbringing by caring ,loving parents. However, when I compare it to Franks childhood in Ireland during the 1930's, I realized how very fortunate I was. This book should be read by everyone because it really teaches you to apprecate what you have in life."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"If you enjoyed Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt, the next book you read will have to be My First Cousin Once Removed by Sarah Payne Stuart."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes inspired me to write my own memoir, Project Girl, in that McCourt showed me how to tell an intensely personal and painful story with honesty and humor. While my NY housing project life was so different from his struggles in Ireland, I could still relate to his story. That is a testament to the power of his writing and story-telling which takes the book beyond nationality and national borders. It is a human story that we all can hear. McCourt keeps it real."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"You heard it before, \\"You can't tell a book by its cover.\\" This is ever so true as you gaze pleasantly at a young toddler poised happily against a wall on the cover sheet of Angela's Ashes. Little does the reader know that when you open the book you're plunged into a cavern of death and disappointment. None the less, this is a must read for those of Irish heritage.My tear stained pages are more memorable than Frank McCourt's escape from his blighted Irish homestead. Throughout this book I was emotionally drained as I read one tragedy after another. Who didn't shed a tear at the sudden death of baby Margaret, or Frank's twins brothers. This, along with the heart wrenching loss of Patricia and Theresa, inspired me to look more compassionately at those less fortunate. This brilliant family history captured my heart and then shattered it like fragile piece of Belleek china.The spiteful conduct of patriarch Malachy McCourt infuriated me, building anger throughout this book. How could one man cause so much mental anguish and squalor. Angela, always the loving, caring wife and mother, must surely spend her after life in heaven, for she surely spent her lifetime in hell.Frank McCourt is a genius at developing a story that so touches everyone who turns a page. Perhaps this book affected me more as I was the son of an County Mayo born father. The many words and actions reminded me of my early childhood.Crafting his religion in school to his success in life!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt's memoir is unquestionably one of the most vivid and moving stories which I have ever read.

Esp. not if it was in English (as I am german). But this book makes reading a mania. You want to know how the story is continuing. What will happen with Frank's father? Will he give up drinking? What about Frank's family? Who will survive? How do they develop? Sometimes I had to laugh so much over the story but afterwards I had to be ashamed of myself that I laughed because you don't know if you cry on the misery or you laugh about the thougts of a little boy. Though sometimes the language has an accent it is easy to read. Great, fascinating, wonderful, 1a!

That night I left the library book in the kitchen and was too lazy to retrieve it, so I took &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; off my shelf.

I think that it was depressing, but if his life was derpressing, then he should portray it honestly. I saw that some reviews said there was no misery in Limerick, because of the strong sense of community there. I say that if he was miserable then there was misery. Also, I notice on many of the reviews that are negative, even if its an honest representation of the book, most people find it unhelpful. It's the same for other books. Why is this?"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Mccourt has written what I think is the most ambitious true-story in our lives today!

Well worth it! :-)"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I really truly didn't wish to read this book at first, wondering if i would find it to be both inspiring and entertaining in one package. I eventually picked it up off my &quot;i'm going to read that later&quot; shelf and just read it, finding it to be thought prevoking and beautiful. What surprised me greatly though...was it was also very amusing at times...it made me laugh. That was unexpected to say the least and it made the book more enjoyable and interesting to read.

Worth the money...worth the read."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book had a profound effect on me. I certainly found parts of it difficult to read through and there were several times I had to put the book down because it was too overwhelmingly sad. I wouldn't recommend reading this book while eating either. I was so moved by the author's unapologetic straighforwardness. He told of a miserable childhood but there was very little self pity I thought. I can't wait to see the movie to see if it compares."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was a wonderful memoir.

How Frank &amp; his family eked out an existence under these conditions was amazing to me. Though not always complimentary to the church that was a vital part of their lives, I do think their faith probably helped get them through a lot of the hardships as they concentrated on the &quot;sufferings of our Lord.&quot; The story being told from the eyes of a child who grows into a young man provides some refreshing humor that can only come from the honesty of a child who calls things as he sees them. I am patiently waiting for 'Tis."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"McCourt was amazing how he bought Ireland alive. You could feel the poverty and understand the anguish he endured.

I just finished it in 2 days and have to say I am glad I spent the money. McCourt's literary style is beautiful. I have to admit that it was hard at first to read because of the Irish dilect, but you get used to it. For those people who say that there was no reason for these people to put up with the standard of living that the charecters endured, you must keep in mind that this was over 60 years ago.

I was struck, not only by his gracious, almost shy manner as he addressed the crowd, but also by the awesome intellect he obviously possesses.During a brief question and answer session, he revealed that he is, indeed, writing another book. He also explained that &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; was a title he came up with when he intended the book to extend through his adult years. The reference is to his mother's cremation and his subsequent trip to Ireland where he scattered her ashes.Mr. McCourt is a genius with words, &quot;like jewels in my mouth&quot; and I can only thank him for having the courage to expose his desperate past for our enlightenment."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is so wonderful that I had to write and add my applause to all the other rave messages.

It is a truly brilliant book - I experienced so many emotions whilst reading it - not least of which was admiration at the way someone who lived such a trying life managed to maintain a sense of humour.

It has told me a lot about an Irish's childhood, which is quite interesting. Frank McCourt is without doubt one of the best writers in the world."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Via his childhood memories, Frank McCourt offers a poignant, unflinching view of a poverty so grinding and oppressive as to certainly be almost unimaginable by most readers. Indeed, I had to frequently remind myself that the years described were endured not in some pestilential Victorian-era slum, but in the mid-1900's. My only criticism is the lack of an epilogue to the story. What ever happened to the elder Malachy McCourt, Frank's father, a devastating example of a life wasted by alcohol abuse and a peculiar melancholy which is endemic, I suspect, to the Irish? And Angela, Frank's mother, a sure candidate for sainthood if measured by her daily struggles to keep her children fed and alive? I hope God blessed Angela's ashes and rewarded her with riches in heaven."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Makes me glad my ancestors got the hell out of Ireland.

It made me much more grateful for what I have."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Never mind that you think you can identify with Frankie's devastatingly poor childhood. Never mind that the book will make you both chuckle and sniffle within the space of half an hour. Never mind that you think this is purely over exaggerated self pity. What this book is, and will be whether you believe the story or not is a very cleverly written narrative. No, there aren't any great stretches of perfect prose in this novel - McCourt isn't Dickens, and though his subject matter is similar, he clearly doesn't want to be. But sometimes, his descriptions are so exact, so vivid, that I was left thinking, he CAN write like the best of them, use the language the way we expect so called good prize winning writers to, so why doesn't he? Why did he risk people saying that this book was badly written? Because he wants us to live the story with him. At times I really forgot that this was an old man telling his story, and not a young, ignorant boy. McCourt has managed to pitch his prose at the exact level of the age of the period he is writing about. So we see the world as a 5 year old, 10 year old,14 year old, and 19 year old lad would see it, because he describes the events as we would expect a child to do at each of the stages in his life that he wrotes about. It's a skill that Alice Walker used in the same way and to great effect in &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, which we now know is a great novel, deserving of the acclaim it had. I loved this book; it's a good, and involving story if nothing else. I think once all the hoo-haa and attention dies down, people will start reading it from a viewpoint unbiased by reviews and so forth, and see just how good McCourt's use of his narrative voice is."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I loved this book because of it's harsh reality of the time period in which it was written. I rooted for the characters and then cursed them if they let me down. It was truly an eye-opening look into the country of Ireland's history although it was a grim look. If you are looking for a happy bright novel this is not it. If you are looking for a true to it's time period no holds-barred novel, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When reading this book and its incredible tale of childhood poverty and suffering I couldn't believe anyone could survive such an awful upbringing but Mr. McCourt did. His incredible sense of humour and style must have helped him get through it all."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The author recalls his boyhood of poverty in New York and Ireland. Having suffered through an alcoholic father, frequent moves, siblings' deaths, illness, and near-starvation, McCourt conveys the waeriness that a family in such a desperate situation often feels. He tells his family's story with love, humor, and a child's sense of wonder. Even though the narrative is sad, it doesn't evoke pity or tears. It's an uplifting story told with great warmth. What does come through, however, is a pervasive sense of McCourt's shame and the insensitivity of more fortunate people to those less fortunate."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"YES, IF YOU ARE TRULY IRISH, NOT JUST &quot;ST.

I think McCourt fully deserves the Pulitzer which he got for this book. The way he framed the story was excellent. I personally found it boaring while i was reading the first chapter and I thought I wasted my money and they wasted their Pulitzer prize, but after that It became more and more addictive.

I feel like I have been to the streets of Limerick, slept in a bug- infested bed, and fish and chips and &quot;tay&quot; will never again be taken for granted by me.

His ability to establish a coherant story with begining, middle and end, out of a real life story, without the benefit of creative license, is awesome. Another book similar in style which runs a close second to this is &quot;The Liar's Club,&quot; also a memoir of childhood, but &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is the best book I have yet to read."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt's writing is incredible.

I am an avid reader and had so many great literary works (and a few trashy novels) on my list that it took me this long to get to it (despite near tears, threats and bribes; they were desperate for me to read it.) Well, I picked up and devoured it in its entirety the same day. Yup, it was indeed everything they had promised it would be and more. I think I'll go read it again. Best piece of writing I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing! Thanks to you all for keeping after me about it!!!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt had the courage to be painfully honest, to give us details that most of us would find hard to face, and not to sugar-coat. Wouldn't it be easier to leave out those parts that would make readers cringe, and the recounts of his own very private and sometimes less than perfect behavior? Yes, it would have been easier, but Frank McCourt never took the easy way out. He dares to introduce his own style, a flow of thoughts like that of a child, and any creative thinker and adroit reader can easily keep up with the story and never want for the missing punctuation. A MASTERPIECE. Frank McCourt takes the most painful situations imaginable and finds love and humor in them. Amidst too-much-of-the-same misery, he finds ways to interject side-splitting anecdotes that make this book a delightful page turner. I have incredibly vivid memories of my own childhood; what I was eating, what I was wearing and who said what, verbatim, so I had no problem believing that his memories were that vivid. Wouldn't they be, considering the major life events that were surrounding life's daily toils? McCourt never feels sorry for himself and never casts blame, but he is not a martyr either. Brilliant and totally refreshing. Again, best book I've ever read! I will be hard pressed to ever find another that leaves me so enthralled. It is not the actual story, but the spirit with which the story was experienced and is now told, that makes this book one of the most deserving Pulitzer Prize Winners of all time. I have great sympathy for anyone who was unable to capture that spirit.

Angela's Ashes caught my eye, so I picked it up and began the first page. Needless to say, I didn't have to look further. Once I got in my car and drove home, I went in the house, sat down, and began once more to pore over its pages. I tell ye what, me little darlins, I couldn't put this'n down til' it was finished. I was completely stricken with the sadness of poor little Frankie's life in Limerick, Ireland, and even to this day I find myself still mulling over and over in my mind, the Irish dialect within its pages.Afterwards, I practically begged others to read it, knowing they would no doubt have the same reaction. Not so. I even loaned my precious copy to a dear friend. A few days later, she handed it back, saying, \\"I just couldn't read it. I found it to be much too depressing.\\" I couldn't believe anyone would refuse to read such a fine piece of literature, all because they found it to be a bit gloomy. Life isn't always sunshine and roses. We should familiarize ourselves with the reality of hardship such as Frank McCourt's heartbreaking childhood. I, too, faced difficult times during my own Appalachian boyhood in the 1940s-'50s; however, Frank McCourt made me feel as if I had been raised by royalty in comparison to his seemingly hopeless existence in Limerick. Later, I loaned it to another friend. She told me, \\"I stopped reading it. He got too personal in his writing.\\" I thought, \\"What's wrong with these people anyway?\\"To this day, I'm still seeking others who will read this book and find the same level of entertainment I felt when I first held it in my hands.From the hills of West Virginia, I am...David Lee Thompson, AuthorRiver of Memories: An Appalachian Boyhood"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The fact that I am the seventeen-hundred-and-forty-eighth person to review this novel probably says it all.

He was born in Brooklyn in 1930 to Malachy and Angela. His family had immigrated to New York from Ireland not long before. Malachy is either out of work or spends his whole salary drinking, leaving Angela with no money to feed the children. First was Frank, the eldest, followed by Malachy, Jr., Michael, twins Oliver and Eugene, Alphie, and Maggie, who died as a baby in New York. The family's prospects in New York were poor, so they moved back to Limerick with high hopes for a new life.Unfortunately, many more troubles awaited the family in Ireland. Angela had a miscarriage, the twins Oliver and Eugene died within months of each other, Malachy continued with his alcoholism, and Angela had an affair with her cousin, Laman. Perhaps what kept any hope or spirit alive in Frank were the stories his father would tell him of Cuchulain, the man who saved Ireland and of the angel who brings babies to his mother. He sung many songs in his drunkenness and encouraged his sons to die for Ireland - a beautiful cause. Frank wore rags and begged on the streets. He and his brothers would spend days wandering the streets in dirty diapers and were forced to plead for a pig's head for a Christmas dinner, for which they were mocked and ridiculed. He had to gather coal from the gutters in order to light a fire and cadge his neighbors who were better off than they were. He made new soles for his shoes from tires and walked around pubs looking for his father to get some money for food before he spent it all on liquor. Frank endured poverty, starvation, and cruelty even from those who were closest to him. Once Frankie grew up more, he began to hate his mother for her affair with Laman, and his father for going to England to find work and send back money, which of course he failed to do. Frank felt guilty about sexual feelings that went against the word of the church when he began a sexual relationship with a woman who paid him to be a messenger. Her death from consumption broke Frank's heart.The title, Angela's Ashes, came from the ashes that fell from his mother's cigarettes and the ashes in their fireplace. The mood of the memoir feels dark, gray, and ashy. Their life was sunless, lifeless, dull and feeble. The ashes represent Angela's hopes which deteriorate and fall. She could not achieve anything she had hoped for - a happy family or a supportive husband. Her only comforts in life lay in ashes - cigarettes and a smoldering fire.When Frank was grown and had saved enough money, he moved back to New York. He was sad that he had to leave Ireland, where his roots were planted, his family remained, and his childhood would be remembered. On his first night back in New York, he went to a party where he slept with an American woman. Towards the end of the novel, he began to mature and lose some of his childlike innocence while still being a person with good morals. He left Ireland with high hopes for a prosperous life in the United States as a grown man, able and willing to support his family.Frankie grew up deprived and somewhat alone although his family was always near, and learned to fend for himself; the entire premise of the book is summed up in just a few sentences:\\"When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\\" (p. 11).I have to admire Frank McCourt for enduring more than most can imagine, and with perseverance, determination, wit, and imagination, overcoming adversity in this poignant memoir."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite novels. I had my English Honors class read it for their summer reading assignment and they absolutely LOVED it. Usually the kids don't do their summer reading, but they devoured this book. The story is such a gutwrenching sad one, but it was Frank's reality growing up. The conditions in which he lived were unthinkable, and he does such a wonderful job of detailing them for the reader. You feel so attached to Frankie and his siblings, and you really develop emotions for his mother and his drunk of a father. It really makes you just want to take this family in and care for them. I recommend this book to anyone...it is truly a magnificent piece of literature."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When I started reading this book I found the first twenty pages interesting.After I proceeded to read I felt I already knew all I had know to about the family and their situation. The book then became boring and repetitious. I understand the book was about this family and their terrible struggle but on every page there is just another explanation of how poor they are and how they barely did anything about it.I chose this book for a school project. It grabbed my attention because it was about an Irish family. I have an Irish background so I was interested in reading about the Irish and hopefully learning more about the culture. All though I didn't really enjoy this book I did learn a few things. Some people can be extremely careless and selfish even when it comes to family. Reading this book also reminded me of how fortunate I am. I've very grateful for everything I've been blessed with. I recommend this book for an older audience looking to read about hard times and poverty."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"One may look back on their childhood to remember the once joyful and free-spirited moments of life. This is not, however, true in Frank McCourt's case. When reviewing his childhood, all that comes to mind is devastation, death and poverty that followed the lives of so many families in the time period. Through his autobiography, Angela's Ashes, McCourt depicts the depressing Irish Catholic childhood he woke up to face each morning.Born in New York in the 1930's into the house of a miserable cigarette-addicted mother, Angela, and an alcoholic father, Malachy, who spends most of the money he earns on buying pints at the local bar, Frank McCourt is immediately given much to deal with. Being the oldest of seven children in his family, Frank has much more responsibility then the average child today has ever experienced. Frank's father figure returns home each night completely drunk singing songs of Irish patriotism while abusing and shouting at his family, providing no example for his sons to look up to. His father's behavior changes for a brief period of time when Frank's mother gives birth to a young girl, Margaret. His father stops drinking and begins working for the good of the family, however, it isn't long before this \\"tiny angel\\" passes away, destroying all hope of the family's success. Never again would Frank's father show such devotion to saving his family. The devastating loss of their only daughter made if unbearable for the family to stay in America with complete memory of the child. The McCourts move to Ireland, which Frank later admits was the worst decision they could have made at that time.Reaching Ireland with not a cent, the McCourts first find shelter with their father's relatives then their mother's siblings until finally they could settle under a roof of their own in Limerick. Frank and his brother, Malachy, are sent to a strict Catholic school while his father finds a job to support the family. Their conditions, however, do not improve and it is not long before their father looses his job and two of Frank's youngest brothers become ill and pass away. There seems to be no hope of a better future for the McCourts in these new surroundings. The family is soon forced to beg neighbors and churches near by for food or money. They grow weak and desperate with what seems to be a slim chance of survival. Numerous nights consist of Frank's drunken father returning home to his silent mother smoking and starring blankly into the ash filled fire place, eyes full or tears. So many nights the McCourts spend freezing in their beds with not a single flame in the fire place or a hot scrap of food on the table. One night, the McCourt's result to picking up scraps of wood along the River Shannon. \\"She says that's what she missed most of all in America, the River Shannon. The Hudson was lovely but the Shannon sings. I can't hear the song but my mother does and that makes her happy. Mam tells us gather anything that burns along the Dock Road; coal, wood, cardboard, paper. She says, There are them that burn the horse droppings but we're not gone that low yet\\" (69). To me, McCourt's writing comes off as a intriguing style that I have never seen before. McCourt is able to depict such a compelling story of his miserable childhood so vividly that it makes one feel very sympathetic while reading. The conditions he lived under are unimaginable, and it is extraordinary he survived such a challenging youth.The book concludes with Frank's father finally deciding to move to England and work in the factories to make money that will support his family. As usual, he is not always faithful to his words, and most weeks spends the money on alcohol. As a result, the McCourts can no longer pay their rent and are forced out of their home and move in with their mother's relative. At the age of fifteen, Frank longs to be independent and takes off to become a self-responsible man, finding a job as s mailman in the local post office. It is at this time that he realizes he has had enough of the desperate life in Ireland and decides to save each bit of many he earns to buy a ticket to America, the land of hope and dreams.Angela's ashes represent the ashes which fall from her cigarettes and the ash-filled fire place Angela stars at so blankly each day. As she revolves so many of her days around these ashes, the book begins to obtain an ashy feel of its own. It is a dark, lifeless and sunless feel that coats the novel. The ashes represent Angela's crumbled dreams of raising a healthy family with a supportive responsible father. Instead, Angela is left with cigarettes for comfort and the warmth of smoldered ashes in the fireplace. Angela's Ashes not only opened my eyes to the true extent of misery one's childhood can possess but also showed me how unexpected life can be when under the most deprived of situations a family is able to survive."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I resented Frankie for worshipping his father who neglected the children, caring not whether they lived or died (except maybe for his daughter), then rudely scolding his mother for having an affair with another man after the father inevitably left them for good.

Without his encouragement, I would have never entered a citywide essay contest sponsored by a New York City maritime association which earned 2nd Prize as well as prize money shared by us.

He accurately conveyed the thoughts a child would have, which is one of the best aspects of this book. It was, infact, the reason I would even pick up this book, as I enjoy reading books where the main character is a child because I can relate. (I'm 13.) Yes, it is sad, but it's so gripping somehow that you don't stop reading it.However, the last 60 pages when McCourt reaches 14 and begins working, he frequently spoke of his sexuality, which made me a bit uncomfortable.It's still a WONDERFUL book, and I highly recommend it. I truly understand why so much of the time there seems to be more Irish in American than in Ireland."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A life of poverty disease and heartbreak awaits author Frank McCourt when he arrives back to Ireland from America. The situation at home in Ireland is worse and we see the families sruggle to find work, food, money, and the charity of others. One thing the McCourts are not short of is tragedy and it becomes a normal part of life in Angela\`s Ashes. Frank McCourt the oldest child in the McCourts intermediate family, is a young boy growing up in the Irish Depression. This story written in an Irish accent gives details of their Catholic Religion. In Ireland Religon sets the tone for the way people should live. Frank tries to be a good Catholic but after all, he is just a boy. Malachy McCourt, Franks father, is an alcoholic and seen through out the book drinking his paycheck and dole money and therefore loses his jobs. &quot;It\`s bad enough that Dad loses jobs the third week but now he drinks the dole money&quot;, says Frank after a night without a meal. One thing about the book that kept us reading is that there was a surprise around each corner. For example, in one chapter, the McCourts lay down to sleep and woke up being devoured by hungry fleas. Franks reenactment of this was expresssed when he said, &quot;We saw the fleas, leaping, jumping, fastened to our flesh.&quot; However, it is not all sad, it is also guite funny. Like when Franks friend Mikey tells a story of Cuchulain, Franks superman, haveing a pissing contest to find a wife for himself. The one thing we all didn\`t like was all the depressing tragedies, such as Frank\`s one and only sister and two brother dieing. Frank also suffers aflictions both physically and mentally, like when he feels the shame of wearing shoes repaired with rubber. We recommend this book to anyone looking for a challenge or feels like their life is insufferable."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I liked McCourt's book for its realism and humor. I have to admit, that I've never been to Ireland. But maybe because of that I hold a certain perspective of how paradiselike a life on the &quot;Green Island&quot; may be, of people mainly happy, drinking their guinnes making good music like the Corrs or Clannad. McCourt robs you any illusion of that kind, and shows you a different life in poverty and misery, where even a supposed nationalistic heroism has no place as it doesn't provide any food or human housing either. Written from the perspective of a growing up teenager, who wonders about things happening around, the book never gets into severe a mood but always plays with a fine and sublime sense of humor. This may be nothing for those who cannot stand description of human misery less for those who cannot stand smiling at it. It may even disturbing for those who still want to hold an ideal picture of Ireland. I rather smiled and was delighted."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Although I felt like things were bogging down about half way thru, I did finish the book. A friedn who reads tons of novels couldn't finish it, which surprised me. McCourt tells a tale of deprivation and sadness, but not in a maudlin fashion. He manages to salvage some humor from whatever situation he recounts."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When I first heard about this book, I didn't understand what all the fuss was about. Then I bought the book and read it and understood. In life there isn't much difference between tragedy and comedy. The two outlooks come from the same source, the difference is that one offers some hope and the other doesn't believe there is any hope left to offer. Tears and laughter flowing from the same fountain.ANGELA'S ASHES is like that. What the McCourt family suffered through was severely depressing (though most of the world was suffering just as much too) and reading about their trials makes one realize how lucky we are. One feels a deep sympathy for Frank and his family (except perhaps for his father). Yet, the story is told in such a way that it makes one laugh rather than cry. McCourt is honest and forthright and though I was disappointed (rather than amused) at many of his exploits, his story gripped me nonetheless. This book more than deserved the Pulitzer it won, but should you read it bring a hanky just in case laughing is too difficult."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I see a lot of the reviews use the words sad or depressing to describe this novel. I wanted to let everyone know that you smile or laugh a lot as well. Yes, Frank had a VERY hard childhood, but some of his memories are precious and wonderful. Frank, as only a child can, was able to enjoy little moments in his life even during the worst of times. I would like to add; the people that are upset because readers might believe that all of Ireland was like Limerick should realize that we are not ignorant. This novel describes certain classes in a certain city on certain lanes. I never read in this book that Mr. McCourt was describing all of Ireland."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is humorous and sad at the same time.

The way that Frank McCourt begins the book is so direct and imformative, but it still says nothing about certain experiences. It doesn't tell about getting typhoid or the &quot;knee tremblers&quot; or of the deaths of his brothers and sister. It doesn't give away what will happen in the book, it is rather a thesis statement for the story. It tells you that the book is about his childhood and how awful it was. It really sets the scene and background.The joys and sorrows of this book, Angela's Ashes, are so realisticly told and described.

But as authors know, one should keep in mind the audience. If he had kept it shorter, I would have given him a 10.

Also when refencing family members in general and his mother in particular, Mr.McCourt was quite indelicate and defamatory in his discription of certain actions which should not have been included in the narrative. His own sins of the flesh were of no interest to me and he should feel shame and dishonor for disclosing them to the world. I am aware of the poverty during the depression and I had known many Irish American families during that trying time having become buddies with their sons and I can definitely say,no matter their poverty, personal hygien, in so far as the times and circumstances would allow, was never wanting. Mr. McCourt should have been more circumspect. He will make millions from this book but he should also feel quite uneasy!!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"We just read this in my book club and I can't wait for our review session next week. We are serving food and drink in the spirit of the book (we might all end up drunk and famished when it's over). I'm recommending this book to everyone who wants to read a very important story on human nature. I'm dying to know what happened after Frank arrived in America."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I expected this book to be one of those that I would not want to put down. Instead, it was one of those that I could not wait to finish just to say it is over. I thought that the author belabored his trails and tribulations to the point of no return. At least, I'd never return to reading this book again. It is a depiction of the life and times of an Irish family coping with unbelievable hardships. However, by the end of the novel, the 'hero' seems to have fallen almost as far as his father - stealing, consorting with lowlifes, etc. And, to me, the worst thing he did was to turn his back on his family. People who grew up with hard times and hardships usually tend to help their own when and if they make it. He didn't seem to worry about helping anyone but himself when he made it. Another reviewer said to those who thought this a great book -- read more! I second this thought -- read any great piece of literature and this will pale in comparison."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Like several other readers, I was amazed by those reviews which found the book &quot;repetitive&quot; or &quot;depressingly full of details: or even more oddly, &quot;not representative&quot; ( they presume their own memories were, I suppose...). Some complain that McCourt's entry to America and the events leading up to it were less than perfect, as if the mere comtemplation of great US of A should have somehow enobled him. And one or two think his mother should have shown more strength, and his father more restraint....in other words, should have been different people, so that the book could have been easier (more like their conception of how they want to believe life is for everybody I gues) I was a little uncomfortable with the adolescent sexuality myself, but this is a memoir dammit, not as one reviewer put it, &quot;some Danielle Steel&quot;. It was a great memoir, recalling a time past relived with compassion, humour and wit - and not inconsiderable style."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes written by Frank McCourt (born in 1930) is a memoir of his life until the age of 19, beginning in New York then in Limerick, Ireland. The author writes the story from the perspective of a child which he often shows through his child-like interpretations of things adults take for granted and never explain to a child. This innocence and amusement with everything going on around him helps him survive this poverty stricken life. The story begins with the introduction of his mother, Angela Sheehan who went to New York and met Melachy, an Irishman from Northern Ireland, who did the &quot;knee trembler&quot; with her. Her family forced Malachy, who had the &quot;odd manner&quot; to do the right thing and marry Angela since she was expecting little Frankie. Malachy could never provide for the family and was always spending his sparse earnings on &quot;pints&quot;. The family moved back to Ireland for a better life and found things to be worse there than in America. In Ireland, Frank really brings the reader to feel as if they are going through everything with him. Since the family never seems to have much to eat, any time they get some food the reader enjoys it vicariously. While the story is written from the memories of Frank and of course by Frank you always have the sense that Angela is really the focal point of the story. Frank never lets the reader know what Angela is thinking because he is writing it as a child and wouldn't really know her inner thoughts and she never explains anything to him. Therefore, he only describes her behavior and leaves the reader to imagine what Angela is feeling. The reader knows that she is trapped and the only happiness she knows is the love of her children and her occassinal woodbine cigarette. But because her basic physiological needs are not being met she is not able to be the mother she could. She is either lying in bed grieving over the death of her children or out begging for food and clothing. You feel her pain as she finds out that again her husband has gone to the pub and spent the week's wages or their government assistance &quot;the dole&quot; on the &quot;pints&quot; while she and the children are sitting up in &quot;Italy&quot; starving and freezing for lack of food, and wood for the fire. As a teenager, little by little Frank begins to understand many of the things he was confused about as a child. The &quot;Angel on the 7th Step&quot; did not bring his mother her babies, the &quot;excitement&quot; caused that to happen. Then he began to experience the excitement for himself and continuously had to go to confession for breaking the 6th Commandment which meant thou shall not have impure thoughts, impure deeds or impure words. This excitement left him in a state of constant sin in which the enjoyment of it all outweighed any guilt. Just to be on the safe side though, he found an old priest that was deaf to confess his sins to daily. I gave the book a 10 because I thought it was extremely well written and I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When reading Angela's Ashes, I had a difficult time imagining that all those events in McCourt's life could actually have happened, but I was amazed at his story-telling. He told the story through the eyes of a child allowing the reader to feel, see, and even smell the heartache around him. I was surprised at every page because something new and different was happening, even though McCourt's memoir was always bleak and depressing. I highly recommend this book to everyone. It is a very humbling experience."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I bought this book in Ireland only because I was in a bookstore and was looking for something to read as I flew home on the plane. I had been traveling on business for quite a while and missed all the hype the earlier reviewers mentioned. So I was not prepared for the emotions this booked evoked in me. I found this book difficult to read only because it made me so depressed. I have lived and travelled in the poorest states of Africa and India but never have I felt the poverty and hopelessness that this book recounts. This book was not just about Ireland but about the turn of the century. It is truly enlightening to know what people have gone through. Especially we of Irish descent who tend to glorify the homeland. Angela's Ashes has made me curious for other historical books on Ireland and leaves me wanting to know more than the fanciful side that we've been inundated with lately. Present day Ireland is absolutely beautiful and the people are the amongst the most courteous and friendliest on earth. I had wondered why so many had left but with Frank Court's book I have a better understanding."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"To be brief, I was amazed by some of the negative reviews I read on amazon.com. The most frequent complaints appeared to be these: 1. uncomfortable with the sexuality, and 2. dissatisfied with the repetition in the story. I felt compelled to respond. One, discovery of one's sexuality is human and normal and part of life. One should not be ashamed of this discovery process, shame on those of you who think Mr. McCourt should be. Second, real life happens the way it happens. To those of you bored with the same events repeating themselves, I am mystified by your request for change. The real human behavior recorded in this memoir cannot be scripted to relieve you of your boredom in repetition. Perhaps you should avoid memoirs and stick to fiction."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Memoirs about lives of suffering have become quite fashionable, and many published are not worth the trees. Angela's Ashes is a glowing exception! The opening page about the baleful effect of the river on the city of Limerick is magnificent. The story calls to mind A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, not only because of similar family dynamics but because the theme in that earlier bestseller of the tree pushing its way up through asphalt and wasteland is such a metaphor for the minds and spirits of the children. Angela's Ashes also brings to mind Thomas Wolfe's Look Homeward, Angel, for the full-bodied depiction of a dysfunctional family that shows warmth as well as meanness and pain; for example, Frank's father, despicably no-good bum that he is, has his moments of being not only a charming storyteller but a gentle mentor to his son.My mother's family were Irish, and plagued by alcoholism. I find it surprising, and somewhat heartening, that McCourt's tale of poverty became a bestseller in America during a time when the political climate seems to support a return to those Bad Old Days that McCourt depicts so well: the days when the dispensing of charity or The Dole had to be accompanied by gross humiliation, and teachers routinely heaped children with verbal and physical abuse.Sadly, as terrible as McCourt's childhood was, there are many in the world that are worse: he was severely neglected but not physically abused by his parents; they loved him (within their limitations); he was able to go to school (unpleasant though it was); his family could fall back on that dole (which our politicians are working now to eliminate); and apparently he did not grow up with the major mental and physical handicaps that malnutrition can cause in children.It's a moving book; I look forward to McCourt's next. CHRIS"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The subject of Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt was what I think drew me into this book. Not that I had as hard as childhood as he did but that he had such a hard life and is able to tell about. Many people live through experiences like that and block them from their minds. I think that McCourt wrote this story to inform readers of what a horrible childhood people in this country experience and how we pass those in need, don't help them and think nothing of it. To see three siblings die and watch an alcoholic father and a severly depressed mother crumble before your life is very hard on a child. I think that McCourt chose to write this book as a young child to give a better effect to his readers. I rated this book a nine because I believe that in all my AP English readings this has by far been one of the best, not only because of the subject matter but because the author isn't trying to confuse the readers with a difficult plot or confusing vocabulary. It makes me appreciate the fact that everything has been handed to me in life and I've hardly had to work for anything except extras. It also makes me appreciate the parents that God has given me and everything they have given me. I think this book should be placed on the required AP reading list. EMILY SMITH"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes was a book I will never forget. The reader gets a one on one overview what life is like when you are faced with the unending problem of poverty. I felt very sorry for this family because Frank's dad was a sorry excuse for a man. He wastes all his hard earned money in saloons rather than supporting his family. The are so poor that thay have to wipe themselves with newspaper. How digusting! I have never been in the postion before where I was faced with the problem of wondering what I was going to eat the following night. In my opinion, the reader is forced to sympathize with this grief stricken family. I found myself at times crying and wishing I could be there to help this family. Throughout the book, I believe that Frank McCourt was a very strong willed, intellignet child. Although, in some parts of the book I felt that Angela did not play her part as a mother. When Magaret was born she would dress the twins and send Malachy and Frank to the playground with them. She did not provide any supervision to these kids when they needed someone there. It seemed to me like she was revolving her life around Magaret. Also, when Magaret dies, Frank's parents act as if life is over, when it is not. Angela lies in bed all day while Frank's dad steadily drinks and wastes his earnings. Throughout the whole book, I kept wondering what kind of father is he? I look up to Angela is some aspect because through all the tough times, she was there and stuck to the fight. As they say when a couple gets married, &quot;Through good times and bad times, through sickness and in health, though rich or for poor&quot;. Angela proved that she had what it took, even though her life was not royal gold. After reading this book, I understood what it was like growing up in hard times,also it made me appreciate what I have and thank God for the blessings he have bestowed on me. I would most definitely recommend this book to anyone, without a second thought!

I laughed, cried, moaned and applauded the people in family. After reading this and 'Tis I took a trip to Ireland."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is a very heartwrenching story. Born to a drunken father and a desperate mother, Frank learns at a young age to be the man of the family, caring for them in any way he can. When Frank is about ten, his father goes off to England in order to work a good job and send money home. What he actually does is drink away every penny of his earnings leaving his family of five to starve in the streets of Ireland. He never does return and Frank works doing anything he can find in order to feed his four brothers and mother. With each paycheck, however, he saves a bit to go to America where he imagines all of his worries will be over. It is a world most of us can hardly imagine, constantly consumed with hunger, never knowing how the rent will be paid or food provided for the next day. To have survived a childhood like this one, Frank McCourt must be an extraordinary man. To have written such a memoir, McCourt must be an even more impressive mind and soul. I look forward to picking up &quot;Tis.&quot;"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I adored this novel. Frank McCourt is not only a wonderful writer, but an honest one as well. Many other reviewers have said that they know Irish people who didn't grow up this way, so therefore McCourt must be imagining all the poverty of his childhood. Well, just because your buddy is Irish doesn't mean that he knows about Limerick. Everyone in Ireland didn't grow up in the same place, there is variation in every country. There are people in New York living in penthouses, and just a few blocks away people living in cardboard boxes. At the beginning of the 20th century Ireland was a poor country, and he happened to grow up in one of the most poverty-stricken districts of it. Just because his life was so different from your own doesn't mean that he fabricated this entire tale. Of course some of the story would be filled in in places, no one can remember their childhood with complete clarity. The fact is that I beleive this novel to be true because McCourt was so honest. He shared his feelings and thoughts, most of the time thoughts that you would never admit to having. His story telling style is unique, the lack of quotations is confusing a bit at first, but if you are an intelligent person, you soon get over it. He made you feel his conflicting emotions of anger at his father for wasting his paycheck, and his intense admiration of him as well. I don't believe that this novel is reinforcing bad stereotypes about the Irish people. It is portraying, rather, their ability to survive, and make a living in an unimaginable situation. It is a testament to the strength of the Irish people, as well as their weaknesses. I highly recommend this novel to anyone who would like to see how those less fortunate live, written in honesty, intelligence, and remarkable humor."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is one of my favorite's .

He has an abusive teacher and abusive relatives. He lives in an ally where everybody throws their wastes to the streets,and smells rank all the time.

Yes, it moves very well between laughter and tears, between giggle-worthy childhood exploits and other more sobering experiences, and hardly ever fails to lose the reader's interest. It is easy to visualize his relatives and friends, even if the descriptions of them are kind of sparse. It is pretty amazing that he can remember so clearly events that happened when he was three onward.

Unfortunately, now they are all passed on and I am old enough to appreciate those stories there is no one here to tell them to me. Frank McCourt gave me those stories.

I don't believe McCourt meant this to be a &quot;poor little me&quot; book, but simply as a synopsis of the emotional and intellectual development of a young boy, who just happened to be Irish, and who's quality of life happened to be pretty damn awful.

She now reads to me. Angela's Ashes is by far one of the best books we have read, tieing with The Little Prince as our favorite. Frank McCourt's writting style comes to life when read out-loud. The style is fresh, and unique.My daughter enjoyed the story perspective of a young boy, and we both found ourselves laughing at the colorful situations that young Frankie paints. Angels leaving babies on the 5th step of stairs; and children awoken from their sleep to vow to die for Ireland, while their father lines them up like soldiers...remembering his own youth through the haze of too much alcohol, are just two of many of the sweet times of Frankie.I have heard that many find the book sad, or boring. We can't believe those comments about this story. We found Frank to never miss the humor of a dismal situation. We came to love the characters, and the style of writting that lent to the intimacy and viewpoint.Frankie honors the memory of his mother and father with this story. Dispite the parents' inability to do better for themselves and their children, Frankie writes about them with love.Mr. McCourt, if you read this, my daughter wants you to get busy and finish the story that picks up after Frank gets to New York as a young man.

His view is sharp, unblinking and longing for things to have been different. His voice is strong, his memories are harsh, yet tinged with the warmth of love and hope. I heard thee Audible version. I did not read the print version. In 13+ hours Frank McCourt reads his own book. In 13 hours we hear/see/feel and know dire poverty, a longing to belong to another or better class of poverty. We hear the pain in the young boy's voice as he tries to make sense of his wayward, loving, funny, supportive father. We hear the pain of the man-child recognizing his mother's desperate straits.We learn about all the players in this comedy he called his childhood. All the while, the big pink elephant dwells in the family's midst, some side-stepping it, some succumbing to it.We suffer for his mother, for his lost siblings, for the loss of a real father. We rejoice in young Frances' accomplishments -- stealing, lying, and generally getting over -- just to survive.Yet the main theme of this tremendous treatise on dysfunctionality is that of Frank's father, Malachy. We love him, hate him, pity him, loathe him and try to understand why Angela tolerates it all. And through young Frankie's burning, sick eyes, we see a desperation that cannot go away.The children grow up not questioning their lot in life, though Frankie's thoughts are ever clear and demanding. Somehow through all the neglect and borderline abuse that Frankie survives, he is polite, kind and knows his place.He is a true Catholic, reared in the old ways of repentence, shame and forgiveness. He can sin and when he is able to, confess and then be redeemed, knowing he will slide again and repeat the cycle.The peripheral characters in his story are as strong and shaping as his absent father and unconscious mother. They shape him. Alcoholism abounds in his world and it too shapes him.. without saying it, it is the omnipotent pint that shapes his views, his mores, his goals.Frank stumbles into adolescence wiht a bang. He is ill, his eyes are horrific, but his sight is clear, his voice is strong and his will to \\"go to America\\" prevails.America represents his infancy, when there was hope in Angela's heart, when Malachy reluctantly claimed Frankie as his son, yet lived his \\"Northern Irish\\" life as if Frankie was not there.America beckons young Frances whose real first name is NOT Frances, because life in Ireland was so, so bad. During his years between 14 and 19 he longed for and saved for America, knowing America would change his life. He was a minor criminal, far beyond stealing to survive. He was able to save money and eat and do all sorts of things separate from his hungry mother and siblings and felt no remorse.Already he was becoming Malachy's offspring. Frankie would do whatever he had to do or wanted to do.. to pursue his dream --- in this case, America.Frank's father Malachy wanted only enough money to drink and declare his love of country. Malachy never wanted a family; his ready made family came as a result of a momentary dalliance with young Angela in America. Though they had six children, Malachy never accepted his role as father or provider.Angela reluctantly took on her role as bearer of children, but not one time, not once in the entire book did I hear the words love from either parent or any child.This was a life of obligation. Children were born, children died. Sometimes they ate, sometimes they starved. No matter how little money or food (the babies had sugar water instead of milk), Malachy Sr. had his pint(s) of Guiness.While Frank studies his childhood with a poignant view of his pains and privations, he has warm, loving memories of moments with each of his family members. He loves the time in front of the cold fire place with his father, who is fatherly at those morning meetings. There are the moments on the stairs of their first apartment, the long walks in the country stealing apples and milk, all those wonderful things he recalls.But Frank's eyes look for America as his salvation. Ironically, his eyes are his major physical weakness. We wonder at the end... what about his eyes?Frank does get to America and is welcomed by a great event that proves right off the boat that America is the land of opportunity.In summary, it is a long, longing and profound look at a life, a country, a time of life and a perspective that rings true and truly harrowing all at the same time.I came to cheer Frankie on in his exploits, while wincing in discomfort as I realize that these are the traits he will take with him into adulthood and to America. How honest will Frank be in his lifetime, will he become an American criminal too?These are the elements that make for good stories, strong characters that create a \\"need to know\\" in the reader.Throughout the book I came to realize that had I read this book when I was a young parent, my children would have turned out differently today. I would have been more restricting, given them less and taught them more. Frank's family got by on virtually nothing -- and nothing within a community of little more than nothing. Someone described one of their apartments as resembling Calcutta.They were poorer than dirt and they had no way out.Read this story with joy and anticipation. The pay-off is slow and agonizing, but in retrospect it is there.\\"Patricia G.

Over the radio, it was like the bedtime story you hoped would never end. This is because McCourt is the consummate Irish story teller.Unfortunately, in print, the same story is bleak and largely devoid of the magic Frank McCourt brings to it in the telling. So, if you haven't read Angela's Ashes yet, see if it is available on tape. If so, buy it and save yourself the unpleasantness of encountering this trying story without Frank McCourt as your personal guide.

Most of the childhood events are narrative and not original. And it reads that way! If I could hear the author it may be different, but there are sections on sex, etc. which try to out-Joyce Joyce's Portrait of an an Artist. I know: I heard exactly the same lectures over 1/2 a century later with the same effects: hell-fire and damnation for all you wankers! And how we laughed when face to face a Jesuit tried sex-education. We responded as Frank might have: What do you want to know, Father? The book is tremendous in narrative description but the constant dwelling on the bog-side of life and his heroic effort to drag himself out of it by any means show how desperate the situation was. All in all when I got to the end, I was left dissatified and had a ton of questions: where were the ashes? what about the promised land of fish and chips? (I achieved that, only to skid in some-one's leavings!)I hate the Jesuits as much as he hates the Church for slamming the door in his face. That they did to me many times. Not because of my accent, North Yorkshire, broad English! but because of my parent's job...he was a manual worker and he brought his money home every week! So, Frank, lots in common with you but you hide too many things &quot;en passant&quot; or in your case with the Church &quot; en pissant!&quot; I look forward to an improvement with &quot;Tis&quot; and I bet the Church plays a little if no role in your upbringing from age 18, 19 on, till later in life!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I found this book to be very repetitive and depressing. After finishing this, I gave it to my mother to read. She is 66 years old and was born and raised in Galway, Ireland. After reading it, she was furious. She grew up on a farm and said that she NEVER saw the kind of poverty that McCourt was talking about. Her father was NOT a drunk, either. Many people who have read this book apparently think that this is what life was like in Ireland for everyone. My mother had a very happy childhood over there. She ended up coming to America because of the lack of opportunity in her homeland. Today, Ireland is one of the wealthiest nations in the world. I have no doubt that McCourt grew up in poverty, but many Irish people feel that he got carried away with himself in this book.

Trepeditious because both of them seemed like con men to me. I think this is a whining, complaining, self seeking journey with an ending which bespeaks the true character of McCourt and his family, get-what-you-can, get laid, and get to America. My own Irish ancestors on my mother's side were just as poor, had just as much sickness, has their share of drunks, and their own personal tragedies. Did they resort to knocking Ireland, knocking the Catholic Church, making fun of native customs? No, their faith was a bedrock upon which their lives rested, their humor was directed toward themselves, not others, and their poverty was overcome by honest means--not by stealing. This book may have been on the New York Times best seller list for eternity. It was a waste of my time. McCourt has a lyrical Irish voice.

Well, it's certainly not your polished, wholesome family home is it? We've all heard stories about the tortured life of Irish poverty. There were no surprises at all in that respect. All the standard cliches were there but rendered with such insight, sympathy and truthfulness that I simply couldn't put this book down.I thought at one point though that if another baby or child died I would not be able to read another page.

Frank learns to deal with many expected and unexpected happenings, and in the end fulfils his childhood aspirations. Drunken fathers, sin and begging are features,which sum up the main storyline of the novel.This novel is a non - fictional memoir of a childhood is filled with adventure, poverty and sin. The style in which it is written takes you on a journey back into the past, discovering a life, which can be seen in a new light. The novel is a spyglass into the past, and shows the conditions of a different age, and supposedly a different world altogether.At the beginning of the novel, there are four main characters. These characters consist of Malachy, Frank, Angela and Mr Mc Court (who is also named Malachy). However as life takes its toll, family members come and go, and more and more strain occurs. Each of the characters is very different (personality wise). They each have very different views on how life should be lead, which sometimes leads to a head on collision.I think this novel is very unique and absolutely amazing. I believe that I connected with the characters and felt what they felt. At times I found the storyline a bit depressing, however this shows how well the novel has been written. I would recommend it to anyone aged 13 upwards, as it is an extrodinary tale of love poverty and sin. I was captivated by the sadness, and enlightened by the happiness, and can honestly say it was an amazing experience. I think that I would definitely read it again, and I am currently reading the sequel \`tis to Angela's ashes."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The book talked about life in Ireland for the very poor. I enjoyed his memories with sadness and laughter."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In my High School Independent Literature class, I was given the assignment to read a multi-cultural book and the book I chose was Angela&#65533;s Ashes, by Frank McCourt. I had heard many great things about it and I had wanted to read it for a long time. After reading it, and reading a few of the reviews, I agreed with every word that people said about it.Angela&#65533;s Ashes is about Frank McCourt&#65533;s life as a young boy growing up in a run down apartment in New York and living in the poverty stricken society in Limerick, Ireland. Frank&#65533;s father was an extreme alcoholic and would come home almost every night wreaking of different smells from the pub and having his boys promise to die for Ireland. If that was not enough for young Frank to deal with, he also lost three of his siblings to consumption. It was while living in Ireland Frank promised himself he&#65533;s move back to America to create a better life for himself and his family.The ideal audience for this book is probably around the ages of fifteen years old and up. I feel that some of the actions taken place in Frank&#65533;s book should not be read by young readers. For example, Frank would describe some of the horrible things he witnessed or did himself which might influence younger children. Another reason why this book is targeted more for the young adults is because of the language used. Even when Frank was young, he would say cuss words that most adults would use. It wasn&#65533;t Frank&#65533;s fault he began cussing at an early age, it was all he knew. He had grown up with the drinking, smoking, and cussing all his life.One of the most powerful literacy elements that Frank McCourt used in his book was the technique of suspense. He continually used suspense to pull you into his life story. Frank&#65533;s life was constantly filled with sorrow and pain and when his baby sister died and he used suspense as a way to tell you the story behind his mother&#65533;s actions. You never knew if Frank&#65533;s mother was going to get through the death of her daughter or not. Another literacy element Frank used was imagery. Frank used imagery in his book to describe the &#65533;lanes of Limerick.&#65533; Frank lived in a run down old house and he used imagery to describe the way the house smelled, looked, and felt.While reading this book, my emotions were going wild. I was mad and in shock of how selfish Frank&#65533;s father was, yet at the same time I felt sorry for him. As I mentioned before, alcoholism was a reoccurring theme in this book and from it I have learned the true horrors behind it. Alcoholism is a disease that people cannot control. It takes time and Frank&#65533;s father never took that time. Frank&#65533;s father spent his daily wages at the pub even before Frank was born and the hassles of a busy day drove him to drink. When Margaret, Frank&#65533;s baby sister, was born something inside of Frank&#65533;s father made him realize he needed to control his drinking, but when she died, his drinking only got worse! It is because of his actions I have learned that alcohol is never the way to get rid of your problems.Over all, I really enjoyed reading this book! If I were to give this book a rating, I would give it a five out of five. It is hard to put excitement and tragedy all into one book, but Frank McCourt did it. I highly recommend people read this book if they enjoy suspense mixed in with a little bit of comedy."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes focused on Frank McCourt's poverty-stricken childhood. Any money the family was able to obtain was drank away by his father, leaving the rest of his family (including the mother Angela, brother Malachy, brother Michael, and other siblings passed away) to starve and fend for themselves. He tells of growing up in this life, and his efforts to raise this family for the better, even though he, too, messes up.In reading this I think to get the full message and comprehension, along with some swearing, one should be fourteen or older. Also, it could give kids nightmares with its bleak, dark tone. It's discomforting to know of the sufferings in the world and how horrible they can get. Its sometimes lightened by events happening that doesn't focus so much on poverty (when he finds Teresea, and goes to the hospital for another time.) He had a very dry sense of humor, and that could have done with the way he was raised and he surroundings in his growing up. He uses run-on sentences a lot. This can get irritating and distracting to the initial thought, but it also is a way of putting so many emotions in one sentence. (When he looses his virginity he writes in a way that anyone could understand his swamp of thoughts). As the story goes on, his sentence-structure improves and shows him growing up (pretty creative).While reading, the first half seemed very repetitive, and almost in a whining manner. The second half seemed better, with more of a plot line. The book was extremely emotional at times. It made me think of how it must have been having one or two slices of bread and water a day, wearing rags and old shoes with tire rubber soles, and made me sick to even acknowledge this actually happens in real life. It made me realize that even though my life may not be perfect, I have it a lot better than some. I think it was a good book people should read, but be prepared to unsweeten that sugar coated view of the world around you."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This novel was more than just a tale of misery and poverty, it creates an image for readers of the Irish Catholic Childhood and brings to life that time period. Although depressing at times it jumps out at you with wit and intelligence. It catches your eye and keeps you reading on and on."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Most people would agree that life is frequently difficult. Life may seem easy after reading Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt. Angela's Ashes is a true classic. It is timeless, addresses the history of Ireland, and evokes emotion. Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt is a memoir of the hard times he and his family experienced during his life in Ireland during the 1930s and 1940s.Angela's Ashes is a timeless memoir that will last through the ages. Twenty to thirty years from now people will still read and enjoy this book. People are easily taken into the well-written memoir about families that are poor, living under inhuman conditions. There was little heat, food, or clean water. Christianity was and is the main religious belief in Ireland. Today people continue to attend church each Sunday and Limerick is still the holiest place in Ireland. The description of the life of the McCourts, sixty to seventy years ago, is so vivid and tragic, many readers were waiting for a sequel, hoping that some good could come to the lives of these children who lived with abuse and hunger.Readers may not easily relate to McCourt's stories of Ireland, the church, and the suffering experienced by the poor Irish, but they can feel the pain and suffering through McCourt's descriptions. Angela's Ashes actively involves the reader with the hardships the McCourts experienced. Frank McCourt addresses the history of his place of birth, Limerick, Ireland. Malachy, Frank McCourt's father, often made the children promise to die for Ireland. Frank McCourt's father demanded, \\"I want you to jump out of that bed and line up here like two soldiers and promise to die for Ireland and I'll give the two of you the Friday penny.\\" (111) England was Ireland's enemy for many years. The times were hard and men were asked to die for Ireland, if needed. Frank McCourt was a part of the history and suffering of the poor Irish. The reader will feel the pain his father puts upon his family, due to his beliefs, his anger, his drinking habits, and his lack of good work ethics.The well-written memoir of Frank McCourt's life evokes emotions. Three of the children die depressing deaths. Margaret, McCourt's only sister, died at a young age. Oliver, one of the twins, then died and soon after Eugene appeared to have died of a broken heart. The family fell apart after the death of each child. The story is written with an emotional impact for the reader.Angela's Ashes is a classic of the highest quality. Angela's Ashes, by Frank McCourt, is a memoir that is visually stimulating. It evokes emotion and should be read and enjoyed by all. The memoir is so moving that McCourt stated, \\"I could never have written this book while my mother was alive, she would not have liked it. We were always ashamed to have grown up in the slums.... She suffered a lot.... She was a depressed and angry woman.\\" All readers will definitely feel compassion for Mrs. McCourt and her family."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"My book is called Angela's Ashes, it is by Frank McCourt. I found my book very interesting, because it was rough to learn that they were so poor. I really liked the spirit Frankie and his family had for Ireland and their heritage. I agreed with Frankie about how the most miserable childhood is the Irish childhood, and worse yet the Irish Catholic childhood. Sometimes things would get so bad to the point were he thought he couldn't go on. I felt that Ireland is somewhat similar to what America was once, when we were divided into the Confederacy and the Union. It angered me to read about how everyone was critical about people, and where they were from. For example on page 247 Frank said, &quot;She calls me scabby eyes, she says I'm the spitting image of my father, I have the odd manner, I have the sneaky air of a northern Presbyterian, I'll probably grow up and build an alter to Oliver Cromwell himself, I'll run off and marry an English tart and cover my house with pictures of the royal family.&quot; It seemed as if most Irish people were biased where the McCourts lived, they were so particular. In addition, I didn't understand why even just one person would be smart enough to not drink or smoke. And why didn't anyone even limit the number of drinks a person could have? I felt really sorry for all the people of Limerick because not only were they in poverty, but also they were so unhappy from getting drunk too often.In Angela's Ashes the theme or message that the author was trying to portray was to make the best of your situation and be happy with it. Frank and his brothers were so excited when they got a piece of toffee or went to the Lyric Cinema; it seemed to me like it was the best thing in the world to them. I definitely agree with that. I feel it's so important to make everything special regardless of how horrible the conditions. This book doesn't relate to my life, but I learned so much from it like about how what life is like for people with a completely different childhood than mine. There seemed to always be one more challenge or problem that Frank had to face, which I had never had to deal with. As I read more I became more thankful for the little things that came upon him, and for what I have experienced growing up.I would recommend this book to people who can handle reading anything sad, and have an interest in other cultures. This book was very well written and realistic. I became involved in it, and couldn't stop reading. This book, Angela's Ashes, is a great true story."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is a beautifully tragic book. Frank McCourt's style of writing is unique and fresh. His ability to remember such detail from his childhood gives the book added depth and emotion. The hardships and sufferings he endured as a child humble the reader. Just from reading his remarkable story, I have come to realize how fortunate I am. The book serves as a wake-up call for those who take simple luxeries, like clean bathrooms and electricity, for granted. This book deserves the Pulitzer Prize and whatever awards that are avaliable. My praise to Frank McCourt for this classic."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Born in the slums of Brooklyn, NY, Frank McCourt embarks on a childhood journey that takes him back to his parents' homeland, Ireland. In a period of national depression Frank's family finds no other choice of staying alive than going back to Ireland where they would have to face the hardships of poverty, and bear their father's reckless vice of drinking away their money.Angela's Ashes, by Frank McCourt, is yet one more poignant story that recounts how a child is forced to survive around the ignorance of their ambiance, and the social prejudice that abounds between our human races. It is the story of fighting to see your dream come true.In this captivating novel I was able to sympathize with McCourt through his accounts of how life treated him and his family, as will anybody else that reads it. The story wraps its readers, zooming in and out of events that forever took a toll on the lives of all of Frank's family. This novel is a stunning memoir worth to read anytime by anyone; it transports its readers into the Irish essentials and ways of life."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is a wonderful testament to the human spirit, good and bad."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book affected me in ways I was not expecting.

The reader experiences a poverty stricken life through the young eyes of Frank and his siblings. It is a great artist who can create a portrait with words left unsaid. What is between the lines in this work is more important than the lines themselves. The memoir follows the author's family from Ireland to New York City (where Frank is born) and back to Ireland in search of a quality of life that seems to be just beyond their reach. Beset with death, disease, near-starvation, and addiction, the Mcourt family struggles are the things of which nightmares are made. However, this was no dream, but a reality so harsh that Frank Mcourt was able to relate it with humor and hilarity. If you haven't already read this, do so before the sequel becomes available. You'll laugh,cry, and wonder why, but you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I thought that this book was a beautiful reflection of human nature and triump over poverty."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"If you didn't think someone could live as poorly as the McCourts did and survive past childhood, this book would be a real revelation.

Being of Irish descent, I was looking forward to the tale, but I feel that after I had read the first 50 pages, the rest of the book just beat to death the same general topic...that the author had a dreadful childhood. His style of writing put me to sleep at times and I would have to re-read portions when I realized that he had slipped in some significant event. I would love to know the standards by which one can win a Pulitzer prize. The book was not terrible, but I did have to exercise some discipline to get through to the end.

Frank , determined to leave Limerick's poverty stricken life, takes on many jobs, including stealing, as a young man. At nineteen, he achieves his dream and migrates back to his birthplace.

McCourt relates wrenching moments (like listening to his mother sing &quot;The Kerry Piper&quot; to an old beau wracked with consumption) using straightforward, matter-of-fact prose and avoiding cheap manipulation. ANGELA'S ASHES is reminiscent of Hugh Leonard's wonderful memoirs (HOME BEFORE NIGHT and OUT AFTER DARK) and his Pulitzer Prize winning play, DA, and embodies the typical Irish ability to appreciate humor in the midst of despair."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I've never read anything about Ireland but for the times it makes the headlines. I found McCourt's memoires so moving and lively, one can almost see and smell Limerick and hear its noises.

The way the dialogues are &quot;written with an accent&quot;, all the achs and oye's, is great! a masterpiece in phonetics! I am about to finish the book and I don't want it to end.

McCourt and his family were extremely poor and resorted to begging at times. They relied mostly on the goodness of neighbors and friends and the charity of the St. Vincent DePaul society. It is a tale of humor and sadness alike in which McCourt is very effective in portraying some aspects of his impoverished childhood and not so great at others.McCourt does an excellent job of characterizing his parents, especially his father who liked to come home from a night of drinking and make the boys line up and promise to die for Ireland, who was at war with England at the time. He also does a great job of capturing the methods of the priests and nuns in their attempts to make their congregation more devout Catholics. Many of McCourt's confrontations with priests are somewhat comical, especially when he tries to explain to one priest during confession why he was doomed for \\"going at himself.\\" The priests used the threats of Hell and Eternal Damnation to ensure the proper behavior of their congregation, the children especially. It is with great perspective that McCourt represents how his views on life were influenced by the Catholic Church. Lastly, he paints a very realistic picture of what it must have been like to live in the abject poverty of Limerick, Ireland. From his descriptions of \\"going on the mooch\\" in farmer's fields to scrounging for scraps of fish and chips outside pubs at night, McCourt is able to capture the methods by which the impoverished people of Limerick made ends meet.There are, however, a few areas in which I felt that McCourt came up a little bit short. For instance, I think the book gets a little bit repetitive at times. Almost every story was some variation of another in which McCourt was worried about his father's drinking, his mother's health, his eternal damnation for \\"going at himself,\\" where his next meal was going to come from, or earning his fare to back to America. I was also opposed to McCourt's justification for stealing from one of his employers. He stole just a few pence at first, but eventually 50 pounds from his deceased employer. He fancied himself a Robinhood of sorts, but to me he came off as just another petty thief.All in all, McCourt did a great job with this book. I did not give it the full 5 stars because of some monotonous and boring portions and the persistent rumors that this was only loosely based on his childhood and is in fact a work of Fiction. If this is true, it would be a great testament to McCourt's writing ability, but I would feel betrayed."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In \\"Angela's Ashes,\\" Franck McCourt recounts his turbulent childhood in Ireland, ranging from the extreme poverty of the McCourt family, his father's alcoholism and the death of three of his siblings in a memoir that is both witty and full of sorrow. McCourt was able to grab my attention from the first page; unlike other books that tend to drag along at points, I found \\"Angela's Ashes\\" gripping and impossible to put down.Born in Brooklyn in the 1930s, Frank McCourt takes the reader through his early years in New York, the McCourt family's return to Ireland and the daily struggles of his life (including some humorous scenes with his headmasters in school). \\"Angela's Ashes\\" is one of the few books that I have read in the past year that keep my interest, caused me to laugh out loud and feel extreme sorrow, anger (at Malachy, the father) and pity for the McCourt family.The movie version was excellent, but I recommend reading the book before viewing the movie because it is the only way to fully appreicate McCourt's prose, humor and optimism. I'm looking forward to reading \\"Tis,\\" the sequel to \\"Angela's Ashes.\\""},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt&#65533;s memoir of his childhood in Depression Ireland is a tale of a struggle against poverty, orthodox religious affirmations and nationalistic fervour. What lifts him from human degradation is ambition and the sheer will to live. His fascination for America is his salvation as he drives himself to achieve the ecstatic vision of the Statue of Liberty. McCourt&#65533;s depiction of human strength is simple yet profound. He is a talented storyteller. This is a must read for all who are in the brink of giving up hope."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Despite the misery that the McCourt family had to live through, there was a tremendous amount of love and warmth holding the family together. Angela, the mother, did everything she could for the children, often depriving herself of food and clothing to give to her children. In the end, it was the love and nurturing that greatly contributed to the strength of character that her children developed with at least two becoming successful authors in the US. A good story about parenting even in the harshest of conditions."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"McCourt's hellish surroundings and bright spirit continually play off each other in a tension that keeps you turning the pages. Will his childlike faith in God carry him through his next defeat? Will he succumb to the misery? It is certainly not a book for the weak in spirit. I was tempted to lay it down because of the sheer multitude of extreme situations, especially in regard to his father, but I kept reading - out of my own sense of hope I guess. I found most of the book to be believable, except for his sexual experiences. These seemed to be more personally redemptive and fantasy oriented than realistic. It made me question his character and pity him somewhat; Whereas before I strongly admired him and applauded his painstaking honesty and depth. Because of this incongruence, I gave the book a 4 rather than a 5."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"While the situation that Frank McCourt grew up in is nothing to laugh about, he somehow makes you laugh. By looking at poverty through a child's eyes one cannot help but laugh at the stories he tells. The way he viewed the church and religion. The movie does not do justice to the book at all. It lost all the humor the book exuded.

I enjoyed the details about Irish life during the depression, and the ways that people survived, and tried to keep their dignity even on the precipice of despair and death.

It reminds us that it is only a stone's throw to where we came from. The poverty that characterised The Depression is still within living memory in our so called developed world.When you can share the laughter, the joy, the tears and the pain with warmth, wit and good humour, when you can make a reader ache for that book just as he ached for food, when you can make people laugh and identify with some of the most excruciating parts of your life, then you've written a true memoir.God knows how many souls he'll send to purgatory for reading and laughing over his sins, but sure, it's worth it."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"McCourt's childhood was filled with poverty, neglect, and heartbreak.

I have two copies now (people have a habit of borrowing it) and have reread the book more than once.The reviews, although old, are well worded and convey the crux and atmosphere of Angela's Ashes very effectively; I wanted to update the fact that all that is said in the reviews is still true today. The most striking thing about reading Angela's ashes is the in the moment and present voice of the author as he revisited his childhood with the childlike eyes, and feelings of a powerless and vulnerable child whose dysfunctional parents controlled his world. And what a tragic world they were all thrust into when the small impoverished family were back in Ireland living in the dark and dank slums during the rainy season. The only thing that rivaled the dark environment was the family dysfunction and abject killer-poverty.The beauty of Angela's Ashes is that the power of the human spirit comes through, despite the odds."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I first read this book when it first came out.

The fact that he had such a complicated childhood and still managed to find so much humor in all of it, is somewhat bizarre, but human. I did not know if I was supposed to laugh or to cry at certain times, but what captivated me the most was his sincerity. A sincerity that I had not found in a book since J.D. Salinger. Completely different authors, but both very honest about life.

Without a big booming ending it made it's success in the mind haunting, beautiful details. It will make you take a trip to Ireland and pretend you're Frank McCourt in Limerick again. I'm glad he shared his life with us."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Simply, an irresistable book you can not stand to put down for one moment. A journey of hardship, courage, and strength, told through the eyes of a child. The naieve notions of Frank McCourt will have you in stitches. A MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt's autobiography, Angela's Ashes, of his difficult Irish childhood is a stunning memoir of hardship, death, and love. McCourt beautifully recounts his ordeals of growing up Irish, Catholic, and poor and the problems he faced along the way. Through simple diction, but superb imagery, McCourt shares with the reader the problems of growing up in the slums of New York, but the reader finds out those problems get even worse when the McCourt family moves back to Ireland. Even in the first 10 pages, McCourt makes apparent the racism and stereotypes in the early 20th centruy that still exist today in society. Most importantly, the application of real world problems of one boy let the reader relate those experiences to everyday life. This book is the perfect mix of drama and humore. Frank McCourt learns to deal with the death of his siblings, the awful stench of sewage outside of his door, and a drunken father who spends the family's welfare money on alcohol. Even though McCourt's memori is tragic and full of sorrow, the story still exhibits a strong chararcter to live by and humorous undertones such as a longing for lemonade and fish and chips."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"McCourt writes so well, I wish it weren't a memoir. I would read anything he put out there. Really good stuff. And the history of Ireland, it really put a picture in an impoverished region I had no idea of. This book was so vivid with emotions and places I still see the lane in Limerick where they lived near the loo in the tiny apartment called, &quot;Paris&quot;. Pulls at your heart, riveting."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Just finished rereading Angela's Ashes for the fourth time and it is as entrancing as ever. One of the best books around and an absolute miracle of writing. On this one book alone, Frank McCourt should get the Nobel."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This would be a very sad story except for the way it is written, through the eyes of a child. He makes you laugh out loud many times. I did not see the movie because I thought it would be very depressing not seeing it through the eyes of the boy.However, I was very disappointed with his book, &quot;Tis&quot;. I suppose it is a good book but I wanted his wonderful humor again and it was not present at all in &quot;Tis&quot; where he is now an adult."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Absolutely spellbounding tale of a young person's early life in poverty. He writes in beautifully colored language, painting the portrait of a child who watches siblings die and other horrid circumstances.

This book was incredible, everyone should read it."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When I started reading this book, I was unsure whether I would finish it. The young lives of Frank McCourt and his brothers and sister were so bleak. McCourt's wonderful writing style pulled me through. At every turn, the odds seemed to be against the remaining McCourt children (2 brothers and a sister died) ever seeing adulthood. Despite the grinding poverty and despair of his family, McCourt somehow maintained his sense of humor in many parts of the book."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"From the opening lines, McCourt gracefully foretells his miserable Irish Catholic childhood. Throughout the book he paints a portrait of the idiosyncratic and at times hypocritical Irish culture of the early forties. The reader can see the door being slammed in his face, him praying to St. Francis, and his desperation in licking the grease off the newspaper. In addition, McCourt does all this masterful storytelling in the mentality of an repressed Irish Catholic child. Although he may have exaggerated a few details, the author creates a poignant memoir that makes the reader feel that they are miserable and suffering along with the McCourt family."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt's memoir of his childhood experiences presents an interesting and enlightening journey into the past of a young Irish boy. McCourt tells the story of how his family moved back to Ireland, from New York, when he was five. Throughout the novel, McCourt describes his innermost feelings, thoughts, and fears surrounding the events he encountered during his youth. In addition, McCourt conveys the tragedy and misery that was so typical of the destitute life in the Limerick of the mid 1900's. Despite the tribulation and sadness that is depicted in the book, McCourt's emotional and heart gripping memoir is ultimately delivering a message of hope. In addition, there are many humorous moments in the book which are, in turn, made all the more comical by the innocence and honesty of the young McCourt as the narrator. I truly enjoyed this book; even upon reading the first few pages, I was instantly pulled into the activities and events of the story, and I found myself rooting for the success of McCourt all the way to the end."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt displayed the truths of harsh poverty through a child's eyes. I didn't know when to laugh or to cry! He satirizes many things because he doesn't know better being a child. The McCourt family were very poor and many times, their childrens' hunger was so much that they died from it. I am still amazed that four children lasted through that childhood. This book is a realistic depiction of life in Ireland in the time of war and it kept me very amused. I never wanted to put it down."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes was a book that I really enjoyed. This book helped me understand how hard life was during the years of the depression. Frank McCourts style of writing captured my attention on the first page and kept me reading till the end to learn more about the harsh life he experienced. This book for the most part is depressing but there are moments when you will laugh with Frankie. This book also gives the reader a sense of hope. Through the hard times there is always hope. This is a powerful book that conveys deep message of poverty and hope."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Great piece of literature. Once started I couldn't put it down. The innocent ways of the Mc Court children through the tough times and their basis for judgement on what they learned from their drunken father and depressed mother made a comically sad novel."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I just reccomend this book to anyone over 12 years old who loves to read stories of hope, love, and to help you really appreciate what you have in life. I have read soooo many books from anything to the Holocaust to this book about the depression in Ireland but I will trully always remember this book becasue of the way it made me laugh and cry."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is one of the best books I have read that's been written within the last 50 years. The story follows, in grand detail, the life of a young Irish boy and his family. The author, telling his own life's story, writes in a voice reminescent of both the nature of memory and the wonder of childhood. Certainly there are moments in the book that will seem utterly sad to a reader today, but one should expect that--Irish stories are rarely happy. This one, however, manages to toe the line between grief and triumph in a way that never compromises the reality of it all.All in all, you've had a wonderful life, Mr. McCourt. Thank you for taking us along for the ride."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was a moving work of literature. It showed the hardships that the Irish had to go through. Frank made me feel as if I was there experiencing these hardships. From a heartless father to a sacrificing motheer who would give up her life to provide food for her family, Frank McCourt paints a vivid picture of what life for an Irish Catholic was really like."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"For anyone who was reared in a less than economically favored household, this book will put your life into perspective. A stunning achievement with an exquisite writing style, Mr. McCourt takes us into his poverty stricken childhood in Limerick, Ireland but like the Phoenix he rises again in New York. A classic that should be read by students and adults everywhere."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I'm not Irish although I do have a little lineage there, I'm not catholic (nor particullarly religeous) but I have beliefs of one sort or another. But I found this book deeply moving, not for the religeous or ethnic content, simply for the struggle this family went through to survive, Mr Mc Court's writing is simple and devestating, true from the heart and I can't wait to read 'Tis'"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt's story of growing up in poverty touched me deeply. I read this book through and later sat back and thought about how hard his life was. Yet, McCourt never makes the reader &quot;feel his pain&quot;. Instead, a reader comes away laughing and crying at the unbelievable situations the McCourts found themselves in. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"From the moment I opened this book I knew I was in trouble. Being brought up a Catholic, attending Catholic school and being raised in a home where my Irish heredity was given emphasis over everything else I fell in love with this book. Anyone raised Catholic with even a distant relative somehow Irish can't help but smile through all the memories of how it was for Frankie McCourt. Frank McCourt had me shaking my head with grief one moment and laughing out loud the next with his beautifully recounted memories of growing up. A mixture of beauty and sadness, of his wonderful Angel of the 7th stair only steps away from the lavatory and all its stench. I'm almost afraid to read his sequel for fear of not captivating me as much. Definitely a keeper"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A review this short could never do justice to Mr. McCourt's story. It is tragic, funny, and completely honest, and most amazing of all, based on the author's actual childhood. Told from a child's perspective, it is a sometimes brutally honest view of the world and human imperfections, and yet it never descends into bathos, never becomes judgemental nor condemnatory.The storyteller is Frankie, an old soul of a child, grappling with the deprivation and strange magic of poverty in Ireland. Mr. Mc Court leads the reader by the hand quite matter-of-factly, weaves his spell, and doesn't let go until the end.The abject poverty of Frankie's childhood Ireland will shake up the complacent reader. Living in the Philippines I can identify somewhat with the desperate living conditions that Frankie lived through. A searingly honest wake-up call."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I was totally engrossed with this book until Frankie began hauling coal. The characters were alive on the pages. I could visualize the squalor, smell the stench, sense the hopelessness. The bittersweet humor tugged at my heartstrings. I was telling all my friends and family to read this book. Then suddenly Frankie reaches puberty, boinks the American tart, and reaches America. What happened?? Deadline? Sequel offer? Movie deal? C'mon, Mr. McCourt, it is obvious you can do better."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"&quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is quite simply one of the best books I have ever read--it has stayed with me long after I finished it, and it is one of a handful of books I've bothered to read twice. While a few readers have utterly missed the point and dismissed McCourt's memoir as &quot;too depressing&quot; or &quot;repetitive&quot;, he has achieved one of the goals of great literature: &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; takes you into a life and world that is far beyond the imaginings of most readers, and makes it live and breathe. Though now in his sixties, he skillfully narrates his story through the perspective of the child he once was, perfectly conveying a child's fear, confusion and occasional obliviousness to the bleakness of his life, his mother's sufferings, and his fathers alcoholic rampages. Through it all he writes with grace, tenderness, irony, and even humor-- and not a shred of self-pity. McCourt's childhood was certainly hell, and the miracle is not that he not only survived it, but did so with his humanity and compassion intact. The normal pains of an average childhood, which so many people seem to want to blame for all their adult failures, pales to insignificance by comparison. You may never look at your own life in the same way once you have finished it."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Wow- I was really shocked to see some of the one and two star reviews. Apparently, some of you are not too astute. To those of you who thought the book &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;repetitive,&quot; think about your remarks given that the book is an autobiography. How truly unfortunate it is that the RELENTLESS tragedy and brutality of McCourt's life wasn't more palatable to your short attention spans! It is incredibly disturbing that you thought the worst part of Frank's childhood was that it wasn't quite entertaining enough--maybe that's not the point. Maybe the point is precisely that these things DID happen again and again, and that Mr. McCourt's alcoholism didn't just dissapear in a more expedient, Hollywood fashion. And to those of you who found the contents of Angela's Ashes &quot;embarassing&quot; and/or &quot;crude, I think you ought to quit your finger-wagging, re-read the book, and realize that judgemental people like you made Frank's poverty all the more shameful and difficult to survive. Okay, I just wanted to get that off my chest. I can sleep peacefully knowing that most of you are not oblivious to the profound impact of this book--particularly the comletely unique way that McCourt blurs the line between comedy and tragedy, and his unforgettably poetic manipulation of the English language. A magnificent and inspiring read!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When I was assigned to read Angela's Ashes as a summer assignment, I thought, &quot;how am i ever going to finish this AND the six assignments that go along with it?&quot;. As a matter of fact, I could hardly put the book down and most of the assignments were a breeze. Of the 362 pages, I read at least 50 pages a day because the book was so undescribably great. I've never read a book like McCourts. Although his childhood was so depressing, McCourt mixes humor into his story, that'll make you laugh and cry at the same time. For example, when Frankie and his brothers tear the remaining beams of the house on Roden Lane down and the house collapses, I was laughing and upset at the same time. Frank McCourt just has a way of telling a story that no one else does, and that's what makes his book so truly great. It's also beautiful to see that he came out so successful despite a bad childhood. Actually, when you think about it, his childhood wasn't as bad as it seems because there are so many funny things in his story. The book also produces another emotion: thankfullness. One day after reading about poor Frank's meals, my mom called me to the kitchen for dinner, which was macoroni and cheese, pork chops, mixed vegetables, rolls, and soda. Imagine what Frank would've given for a meal like that. It also showed me not to take things for granted, such as my closet full of clothes or my house. I sometimes complain that I want more clothes or that I wish we had a bigger house, but I think about the rags Frank had to live with and his the leaky lower floor (Ireland) in his house on Roden Lane, and I am so greatful for what i have. Well, all I can say is that I can't wait to read the sequel and to see the movie, and if a 14 year old enjoyed this book, surely any adult would."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In my opinion,two things are important in a book.Firstly, the story itself and secondly, how its narrated. In &quot;Angela's ashes&quot;,the story is so vivid and real ,that in my mind a clear picture of Court's life was spontaneously created when I was reading this book,even though that much poverty and ardeousness was far from what my eyes could see.I must say that,I couldn't imagine this much hardness before I read the book.Now I feel more aware of the world and whats more I feel more strong than ever.How little Francis survived from that world of absence and cruelty and became a Pulitzer winner author is a miracle, or what?I liked the book and I'm looking forward to read his upcoming book called &quot;Tis&quot; which will be the second part of his story."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Firstly: we already know how the story ends, though we may not know how the book ends. He grows up, writes a boo-hoo story, and gets rich. It may be too late since it's been out for a long time and made into a movie and all that, but if it's not too late: DON'T READ THIS BOOK. Secondly: I don't know how it won the Pulitzer. It was not well written. Thirdly :It was so boring I couldn't finish it. Granted, great books are often boring. Moby Dick, for example. Took me weeks to read that, but at least it was WELL WRITTEN. My dad said \\"give it time, it gets better.\\" I said, You mean sadder? \\"yeah, that's what I mean.\\" Give me a break. Let's all feel sorry for rich Frank McCourt who has more money than we've ever seen."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I was so disappointed by this book, especially the ending. I don't understand why people rave about this book. In my opinion it was poorly written, and exaggerated. I'm not doubting he had a tough life, but come on! I was anxious to finish the book so I could see the movie.. but now I don't even want to see it.Don't waste your time reading this book!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I am only giving this book one star as I was so disappointed in its content. It starts out slow and I would have put it down had I known the ending at the beginning. The author makes one feel something with real meaning is coming, but it never does. He does do an excellent job of describing the poor and the hard times they had which makes one want to cry and weep over the misery of that period. However, he puts so much sexual content in it that I don't think is necessary. Over half of the book I would say involves sexual overtones, and I am just don't think all that vivid description is necessary. I think the author has never really gotten over that aspect, and that is probably why it comes out so much in the book. Maybe this was his cartharsis, and if so, then I understand and hope it brought healing. I am glad so many enjoyed it, maybe I am the oddball."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"No Title AvailableAvailability: This item is currently unavailable.2 of 3 people found the following review helpful:The Hardships God Puts Us Through., March 5, 2005Frank McCourt wrote the famous bestseller, ANGELA'S ASHES. In this book, you learn about the personality of Angela and the events just prior to her death. His version of the Irish funeral 'doings' at a fancy mortuary in New York whre they partied with lots of beer is almost sacrilege. He had suggesting putting her ashes in a body bag and leaving them on the curb for garbage pickup. He and Frank were in financial straits at the time, but brother Alphie was doing okay. Frank became the possessor of her ashes in an old bean can.Bob Miller wrote this account from McCourt's avid remembrances. Like Eddie Fisher's BEEN THERE, DONE THAT, he reveals the bad with the good. Malachy's narration is spelled almost phonetically, the Irish sayings Americanized, which I guess his fans would get a kick out of -- it reminded me of the old man in 'Brigadoon.'Since I don't watch soap operas I have not recognized him as a young man, nor at the age of 69 when he was diagnosed with cancer. He had a sad life in Ireland, but after coming to America drank his way around the world to forget his past.Part of this book is about the retarded stepdaughter and the experimental program they agreed to at the Willowbrook State School for the Retarded on Staten Island. To get a place for her, they signed consent for her to be used as a guinea pig in a hepatitis program funded by the U. S. Army. The place as described resembled the one in the movie, 'Suddenly Last Summer,' in which Elizabeth Taylor is committed by a demented aunt and she wonders out on a raised landing above a mass of humanity \\"driven totally mad\\" by the place in which they were drugged, abused and locked. These things actually existed, and he and his wife Diana witnessed it first hand.He tried to expose the horrible abuse through the media (radio and t.v.). He said, \\"Media types will come to the 'field of dreams', but don't ask them to cover the plains of nightmare.\\" Finally, they were able to get Geraldo Rivera to tour the back wards with a cameraman. It took them two years to get heard in Court in 1972. It was a historic case, followed by similar suits across the country, that all people have a right to decent human conditions no matter what their mental status.He made his mark in Hollywood and New York in movies and plays, and was host of t.v. and radio talk shows. So I'm sure he has a vast following of those who've seen him -- and read his previous book, A MONK SWIMMING.He was the Boston police lieutenant in 1978 'The Brinks Job' and was in 'Mass Appeal' on Broadway in 1982. Then his soap opera career started in 'Search for Tomorrow,' 'One Life To Live,' 'Ryan's Hope,' etc. Now he has embarked on a career as a writer, or at least a storyteller to beat all. All in all, his is a success story."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"this book was great!

He could have stayed and worked and helped his poor toothless mother and his brothers but he came here and we never find out what happened to his mother, nor his brothers.If this kind of trash wins the pulitzer prize , then ill never read another pulitzer prize winning book ever again.I was disgusted by the book at the end .

After listening to hour after hour of pain, poverty, hunger, filth, and misery, to say \\"I'm enjoying the experience\\" would be a lie. In my opinion, some books just should not be written, like Stephen King's _Misery_, for example, or Nevada Barr's _Hard Truth, and I think this is one of those.

Oh, well that's fair game in a memoir. So why one star? The book pretends to be a biography.

McCourt may have intended this as a literary device but I'm sorry a lie is a lie is a lie."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes was not my favorite book at all. it was interesting in some points of the book, but there was too much &quot;stuff&quot; that just didn't need to be there. it would get really interesting and then he would talk for two or three pages about a lot of things that i didn't even need to know. it kind of made me upset that everytime she had a kid, one would die. after the third child, it really got old.it took me a long time to read it too. i wouldn't recomend this book for anyone who doesn't like to read a long book."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book offers no real story except that the author grew up poor and did terrible things while he was young.

I found it to be insightful on how he dwelved into his soul and came up with such a wonderful way to get his feelings into words. I recall seeing someone's review where he mentioned McCourt being an English teacher and about how he could remember all that from the age of three. I'd just like to mention that all English teachers encourage you to either make it up or infer on some topics or points if you don't actually remember or know."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is one book that I did not expect to enjoy at all. I don't usually like the genre, and the story didn't sound even a bit interesting. It didn't help that my mom, who had read it before me, called it \\"depressing and pathetic\\". But I had to read it for school, so...what can ya do?I'll start by stating the bottom line: I DID enjoy it. I don't agree with the reviewers who called it boring. It was actually the kind of book that you could read a hundred or so pages every day and not really get tired of it. \\"Exciting\\" may be the wrong word, but I guess it was so easy to read and interesting enough that it drew me in. The prose is this certain style that I haven't found in any other book--conversational, not much punctuation, and lots of slang and run-on sentences. However, this isn't exactly a bad thing. In fact it's one of the things that made the story sort of \\"roll off the tongue\\", if you know what I mean.Besides boring, it seems a lot of one-and-two-star reviewers called Angela's Ashes depressing (one of them being my mom). This I can see, more than boring. However, I personally didn't find it depressing. Sad, yes, but not depressing. There was enough humor to keep it from being overly-sad. If I were to use one word to describe Angela's Ashes, it definately wouldn't be \\"funny.\\" But there were a few quirky things throughout that made me smile, or even laugh out loud.So some more positive things to say about this book...~McCourt comes across as a likeable character, who you really \\"know\\" by the end of the story. And even in the scenes when he's, um, a little less likeable, there's still something in him that you can relate too.~It paints a good picture of a childhood. Which, in the end, is what the author wanted to do.~It's the first book that really-truly-genuinely made me think, \\"Wow. I've got it really good, ya know that?\\". This is the only book I've ever read that actually made me greatful for what I have. Theoretically, I suppose, I've read a lot of books that SHOULD have made me feel this way. But I think a book really has to be GOOD to get through to you in this way. And the author cannot present his life, however tough it may be, in a manner that seems to beg for pity. Angela's Ashes fit these criteria.Sounds good, right? But now I have to go into why I gave the book only three stars.The first, and by far the most minor, of my complaints is that Angela, as a character, was never well developed, especially considering the book was named after her. She had one personality trait, which I guess you might say was \\"desperate\\".But the main reason I gave this book such a low rating is that it REALLY went downhill near the end. It started when he first told about how he had been \\"interfering with himself\\", to use the author's own words, and how it was a mortal sin, and oh God I'm gonna go to Hell, but I couldn't stop looking at the girls in their underwear in the magazines. First of all, to put it simply, it's just TOO MUCH INFORMATION. I do not WANT to know about you interfering with yourself, it's not a subject that I WANT to read about (as I'm sure you can imagine). Secondly, he goes into great detail. It's not that I haven't read \\"explicit\\" stuff before, but a couple of the R-rated scenes in this book I really think the author could've left out, without taking anything whatsoever from the quality of the story. I get that he's just telling it how it was, but there is something called good taste. And thirdly, content aside, it just became repetitive, like a few other things in this book (his father's drinking, for one). After a while, I found myself thinking, \\"Oh no, not again!\\"But the real disappointment was the VERY last scene in the book, in which 19-year-old McCourt has a fling with a married woman at a party upon returning to America. I mean, what kind of way is that to end an otherwise fairly good book? The reason for putting this in, as the author implies, is that it shows how he no longer had to worry about it being a sin, and that he wouldn't have cared if \\"the pope himself\\" had seen him. As I read this, I was thinking \\"Well, maybe you SHOULD care!\\" And then you wonder what McCourt is trying to say, and what this says about him as a person, and it kind of puts a damper on the tone of the whole book, making you wonder if McCourt really IS such a likeable character(NOT a good thing to do in the last scene!) Even looking past the fact of WHAT exactly is portrayed in this scene, I think he should've ended with something redeeming or inspirational or even SAD, just to get some kind of emotion from readers (yes, emotion is good!).Anyway, taking everything into consideration, I'd say this rounds off into a fairly average 3-star book. Worthy of the Pulitzer Prize? No. Worthy of your time? Yes. Just, by all means, don't expect it to be perfect."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"After 52 pages, I had to stop reading.

I usually avoid the most popular books - I guess I'm not a joiner. But when I saw this in paperback, I figured it was time. This book goes a long way to enforce the misconception that every Irish mail is a potentially unemployed alcoholic. And that they have such large families to make up for the fact that so many children die. Sometimes it seemed they had children dropping like flies. I was in a plane at 30,000 feet at abbout 11 PM reading about another child having died, with tears rolling down my face. If you are looking for a good emotional catharsis, this might work for you. It is certainly cheaper than an hour with a psychiatrist."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I realize I'm in the minority here by not breathlessly extolling the virtues of this book, and I'm quite aware it has been both critically and popularly acclaimed. In fact, that is the only reason I read this book: I wanted to see for myself what all the fuss was about.In my opinion? Nothing.It brings to mind that wheatgrass juice they sold in the organic section of my grocery store. People raved about it, but when I drank it, my senses were filled with nothing more than the green liquid that emerges when I rinse the underside of my lawnmower. In the same way, I can't help but think that people like this book because they are \\"supposed\\" to like it, not because it was in any way enjoyable or stimulating to read. So, I'll have to go on record as being a literary Philistine when it comes to praise for McCourt's style and Pulitzer Prize-winning story: Didn't like it. Didn't get it.In \\"Angela's Ashes,\\" Frank McCourt gives us his memoirs, from toddler to young man, providing a gritty look at what it was to be a child of the Depression. McCourt paints a picture not of America as a land of dreams, but as a land of broken dreams, where his immigrant parents eventually give up and return from New York to their native Ireland when McCourt is just a small boy. McCourt then proceeds to give us a recounting of a place even more depressing than the slums of New York: Limerick, Ireland in the 1930s. Poor, Irish, Catholic, and with completely disfunctional parents, McCourt feels compelled to pour forth every bitterness of his soul from a seemingly bottomless well. The story closes with McCourt returning to America as a young man, not as an attempt to find the American dream that had eluded his parents, but simply to escape.The more astute among us will ask some very reasonable questions while reading this book: How exactly can the author recall with such vivid clarity the events of his life as a 2- and 3-year-old? Shouldn't one's memoirs have some purpose...some destination they wish to take the reader rather than just aimless meanderings? Why are none of the individuals who seemingly played such a huge role in McCourt's life developed more fully and instead portrayed as 1-dimensional Irish stereotypes? Could it be that in McCourt's universe, nobody else was as interesting or deep as himself? And, why do so many Irish people despise this book rather than regard McCourt as a local Limerick boy who made good?What I emerged with is the story of an individual who lived an admittedly difficult childhood, but then again so did millions of others from the Depression. One does not get the sense he is speaking for all of them; with McCourt, we get the very distinct impression that he is speaking only for himself, and that we had better well feel sorry for him.If you don't require any purpose or well-developed characters in your reading, then perhaps this is the book for you. If you find it redeeming to read about a childhood that was not only bitter, but as told by someone who is bitter about it, then perhaps this is the book for you. I can simply say that it wasn't the book for me.I have some rather simple criteria for judging a book: Did I enjoy it? Was I a better person for having read it? To which I must answer quite honestly: No. In fact, I found this one to be pure drudgery with nothing to offer in the way of education or redeeming content. McCourt simply plods from heartbreak to heartbreak with mediocre writing and a story that appears to have no real purpose. Just a sort of \\"life's hard and then you die.\\" And it is my understanding that although he purports to give us \\"true\\" memoirs, at least some of what he presents here is embellished, if not outright fiction. There was a whiny, \\"poor me\\" timbre to this book that I found particularly distasteful.Sure, it had a few upbeat moments, but all in all I felt like I'd been given a mouthful of ashes. I refuse to succumb to the \\"madness of crowds\\" and award this book 5 stars. I didn't like it, I didn't think it was well written, and what could have come across as a gritty but redeeming ride on what it was to be a child of the Depression came across as simply a collection of mostly bitter recollections.Finally, the book doesn't finish, it just ends. It was as though McCourt had finally reached the end of his endless repository of depressing memories...or his pen simply ran out of ink. I realize he published two sequels that perhaps provide more closure to his own life and those of the people who influenced him. But those books will have to be read by those who actually liked this one.And that would not be me.Footnote: If you'd like to read about an Irish childhood by a truly fine writer, I suggest \\"Portrait of the Author as a Young Man\\" by James Joyce."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I found this to be a well written book but hopelessly boring. Just when you think his life couldn't have been any worse as a child, things got worse. There was no end to it. I pushed through to the end and was dissatisified with the hollow feeling this book left me with.Again, if a depressing book with little plot variation interests you I would recommend this one because McCourt turned out a quality product. I just need a little more variety in the plot to satisfy me."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I thoroughly disliked this book. The subject matter was dealt with flippantly rather that sardonically and I do not see how anyone could mistake one for the other.There is no valid message or gain to be had by treating poverty or religious oppression, crime, and abuse in an offhandedly light approach. These are serious issues, and although we can be stoic and brave if we are personally involved and overcome our problems, rising above these conditions, we need to pay heed to the physical and psychological damage that this brand of environment brings into adult life and not dismiss them with frivolity. This is not to say that one has to be a victim, but the scars remain with the best of us. In opting to make this a laughing matter, the author sends nothing less than a tortious message.With regard to the writing style, I find that the author held my attention for the first chapter or two then it became one repeat chronicle of suffering, woes and perdicment, over and over, again and again, ad nauseam, without depth, freshness or resolve.Adding further salt to the author's gaping wounds of poor prose, the book's ending seems to convey a justification for thievery and disrespect for humanity that I found pointless at best and at worst a sad moral statement of the Irish people and society in general.Had this book been marketed as &quot;Monty Python Meets the Little People&quot;, I could understand the humor. However, this is not the case.Save your money gentle folks."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I love the way this author writes but felt depressed reading his book Angela's Ashes. That his father was such a drunk, was more than unjust to his family. I can't imagine what it would be like to endure the kind of life Frank lived as a child. What sticks out mostly in my mind, is the part where the mother started to remove the wooden trim in the apartment and use if for firewood because they were so poor and cold. What I do not agree with, is that this author tells this story as if his mother was some kind of hero. She was lazy and one of the most horrible mothers I have ever heard of. Nothing heroic about that woman. She had no backbone even to the point where she would let her own kids starve to death. If you can read a story like this one, without getting depressed then I say go for it. Otherwise skip this one."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I haven't being looking forward to reviewing this book. I honestly don't know what to give it. I feel almost guilty for giving it 3 stars. Nothing about this book really stands out to me. I don't understand Irish traditions and customs, nor do I really understand War torn Europe during World War II. And this books doesn't really help with any of that. I keep waiting for someone to admit this is a exaggerated fabrication of what life was really like. I have to admit every time the drunken father shows up I'm reminded of an episode of Family Guy. Plus, I'm curious were did the father go? Am I suppose to feel in awe of this young boy who made something of himself by saving money stolen from an elderly women? Does it make his story more interesting than those who weren't able to escape poverty? I just don't know.... I do want to know what happened when he reached America, but I'm not sure I will read the next one."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"An alcoholic father drinks all his familiy's welfare money and causes the deaths of the majority of his children through malnutrition-related diseases.

The sadness, tragedy, ugliness, and despair are laid on so thickly as to become improbable in combination. Bad things do happen to good people, but in McCourt's world, the worst always happens. When the family moves, it is to the worst house on the lane, next to the only outhouse. When it rains, their house is the one that floods. When he develops conjunctivitis, it is permanent (he still has it years later). When other kids' alcoholic fathers go to England during the war to earn money, his is the only one who drinks his pay away and loses the job. Nothing is ever halfway for McCourt. If there is a tragedy to tell, it will be the most tragic conceivable.There are inconsistencies, such as time frames that make no sense, as well as improbabilities, like his grandmother making several walking round trips of over a mile, all in one night, months before her death. There is also the issue of whether McCourt could possibly recall such detail (as his lengthy story about the IRA refusing to helping his father out and why) during his very early years without any context. It would be as though you were four years old and heard your father talking about the New Deal, and you remembered everything about it even though you had no idea at the time what all the acronyms represented. Oddly, while McCourt goes into great detail about his early childhood, his timeline becomes increasingly compressed as he approaches adolescence. There is much less detail, and whole months are passed by just at a time when a person would be more likely to remember more -- and to be experiencing more. It almost feels like he grew tired of the tale (and fabricating it) and was in a rush to get to the end. Or perhaps, having gone through a sleazy conception, rats, fleas, sewage, open sores, tuberculosis, vomited blood, corporeal punishment,prolonged hunger, his mother's prostitution, etc., etc., etc. (no horror goes untouched), he simply ran out of material.So, from early on, I viewed Angela's Ashes as a work of fiction in which none of the characters is likeable. While many would say the father is the worst, as he is a hard-core alcoholic who cannot and will not support his family, I found him to be far more sympathetic a person than his mother as portrayed. When sober, the father often shows his sons small signs of affection and empathy, but Angela herself is nearly always cold, distant, and unsympathetic toward her children. She is always more focused on herself than on them. I'm not sure how many people could write about their own mothers as dispassionately as McCourt does. If she had one good quality, McCourt is careful not to present it.As a child, McCourt seems relatively balanced, likeable, and ethical, wanting to do the right thing, but adolescence seems to turn him into a different person. He lies, he steals, he takes advantage of people -- and the only guilt he seems to feel is that imposed by the Catholic Church. There is never a sense, even when he achieves adulthood, that he has any deep thoughts about who he is, what he is doing, and how he affects others. Even his agonizing over his belief that he is responsible for a consumptive girl's descent into Hell because he had sex with her is tainted by the selfishness of his focus.In the end, I must concur with an author acquaintance who said, &quot;Angela's Ashes? 'tis as phony as the photo on the cover.&quot;But it is certainly well written and compelling, if you happen to have a large grain of salt handy. Recommended under those conditions."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I did not like this book at all and I cannot believe that so few people share my opinion. Mr Mc Court's description of the Irish people does not fit at all with those I have been acquainted with since I married into an Irish family 40 years ago. The Irish I know are all very dignified people, they respect themselves and others, they are sincerely religious, albeit somewhat parochial, they raise their children with a great sense of morality, and I must say Irish women especially are strong, hard working and very honest. There was not one person in this book who had any redeeming value whatsoever. I have to admit that it was extremely well written, the description of poverty was well rendered in all it's abject truth. So maybe this book was Mr. Mc.Court very personal experience, it does not represent the Irish as a whole. What are Angelas'ashes ? What fell from her many cigarettes? Why did this book get such a high prize?"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The rave reviews are a joke, right?

I forced myself to read the entire thing eventhough I found I could only read a few pages at a time before I fell asleep entirely. Only after 200 pages of repetitive storyline, drunk unemployable father, death, depression, did this book actually begin to get better. I enjoyed the last 100 pages when Frank seemed to begin getting his life together. Wish I had spent my time reading something else."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was a wonderful break from the average traditional memoir. The story is not only told through the eyes of the subject (in this case, young Frank McCourt himself), but it is told through the eyes he had at that time. For example, when recounting events from his very early childhood, he writes as a very young boy would think. He doesn't understand death, he doesn't know why his father is an alchoholic, he doesn't know why his mother is always crying. As the story progresses and he gets older, his perception changes and he begins to see the world with the greater understanding that each passing year brings.In the midst of this tragic tale of poverty and despair, one cannot help but notice the humor. Oddly enough, this fits in very well with the tale. We have to laugh as the young 'Frankie' attempts to understand the elements of life (death, poverty, etc.), and does so by creating for himself explanations which, though they seem to us absurd, could easily be conjured by a young boy.The great strength of this book lies in the way Frankie looks at the world. He lives in horrible circumstances, and as he ages he becomes increasingly aware of this fact, and yet he still manages to find pleasure in life. He does not, of course, think his life is perfect, but he knows it's HIS life and he seems to accept it.If this book were nothing more than complaining and whining about his poor, miserable childhood, it would be a waste of time. Angela's Ashes is just the opposite, however. We truly can see a childhood filled with sadness and poverty, not from the point of view of a grown man looking back, but through the eyes of a dirty little Irish boy."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes has to be one of the greatest books i've ever read. it was written with so much love and candid honsesty. i laughed, cried, got angry, and laughed some more.

Though at times you can feel his bitterness you can also hear his forgiveness in the way he writes. you grow up with him and by the end of the book you are sad to put the book away.

His parents loved her alot,because she was the only girl in the family,besides the mother.Frank's father would always hold her and sing to her.The father never did this to his other children.I would Recomend this to People who like Biographies on people of the past.Some people might think this was a really boring book,but to me it was one of the best book i have ever read."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is possibly one of the best memoirs of the last century...

I was personally shocked by some parts, because it describes the scenery so vividly it's almost haunting. The special thing is that Frank does not write this from an adult point of view, but from a child's, never writing what he regrets now or lamenting too much on his mistakes or tortures. I also read &quot;Tis&quot;, his second book about his life in New York, and i have to admit it's not as good, partly because he's all grown up and partly because Ireland thoroughly fascinated me...

There is one part that sticks out, one where I laughed out loud, it was were Malachy and Frank were trying on their parents teeth and then the teeth got stuck. I could see that happening to those two, that's why it was so funny. I was actually a little disappointed when the book was over, I wanted to know what happened to the family especially Frank's brother Malachy.

Some of his recollections are so real...when his Grandmother makes him take the can of hot dinner to her new boarder at work, you actually feel the hunger Frankie felt as the smells wafted past him and he gobbled it up with childhood innocence. This book is fairly well written and definitely believable. Many countries still experience the unsanitary conditions so vividly described by McCourt.Although it does get a little dragged down by the religous accounts, it does make us better understand the decline in the church in the past generations. I shared my thoughts on this book with my mother and was overwhelmed to find her crying at the thoughts of her own childhood. This book does that. It makes you examine your own childhood. I recommend this book to anyone who thinks they had a difficult childhood. Frankie's suffering, constant hunger, childhood innocence, losses, and family indifference will make you think twice.

I could not believe the unrelenting trials and tribulations with almost never a happy and contented moment. Were there really people in the world as vicious and as cruel as the characters in this book, including even the blood relatives? The father obviously drank to escape their miserable lives, but would he not just one time provide even a meagre portion of his wages to his suffering family?And the mother, would she not have just gone crazy on his trifling man as she watched her children suffer and die? She just seemed totally complacent in view of the fact of her children's suffering. It is true that she was no mother of the year, but she showed almost no compassion for her children. Perhaps she learned her own mothering skills from her own slatternly mother.I expected that somewhere in this there would be a saviour, perhaps Uncle Pa. But even he seemed unable to bear up under the wrath of his ill-tempered wife, had he dared try to help.The author certainly leaves us with a yearning for the sequel, which I am sure is in the works. He cannot have attained the success that he has, in the face of his miserable childhood, and not have more to tell."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I went from laughter to tears and back to laughter.

You become very involved with the characters and don't want the book to end. Another must read book that is similar, but just as good is &quot;Finding Peggy&quot; by Meg Henderson. It's based in Glasgow, Scotland and is about the author's childhood in the slums of Glasgow and the remarkable women in her life, her Aunt Peggy and mother Nan and the fascinating other cast of characters that are her family.

The food on your table takes on a whole new value with its worth. This book was a emotional eye opener to real lives and real people of Ireland.

The book had many interesting tales of a life I have never known but have heard about. I have known people who had been through some of the same challenges as a child and grew up to be very interesting people as adults.

I love Frank McCourt."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I love memoirs and this ranks in the my top ten. Well written with humor, pathos and charm. This books carries the reader through a heart rendering childhood in Limerick, Ireland. It ends with Frank sailing to America. Frank McCourt was an excellent author and because of this first well written entry I'll be reading Tis' and then on to Teacher Man."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was one of the most interesting books that I have ever read. I've always complained about my &quot;impoverished&quot; childhood, but when I read about Mr. McCourt's life I found that America's defintion of poverty is misrepresented. Were not impoverished, we just aren't flourishing in wealth. We have Health and Welfare that are given to us without disrespect to economical conditions or consideration to our cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Frank McCourt's book is excellent and I tremedously enjoyed the usage of an adolescence voice as opposed to a well-developed, superfluous tone, much like the one being used now. Aside from learning about the cultures, traditions and &quot;requirements&quot; of a true Catholic-Irishman, my favorite was the end. McCourt had dreamt of going to America and having sex with blonde-haired American women with straight teeth. And when he arrives in America his first experience was a sexual encounter with an American women despite the fact that the priest was in full knowledge of his acts. This denoted the spur of McCourt's new life in America, free from the priesthood and the deprivating life of Irish Catholicism. I would love to read a novel describing Mr. McCourt's life here in America. I'm sure that this would be just as interesting as his life in the slums of Limerick."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's could easily become one of the best autobiography that I have ever read, but having read Wild Swans by Jung Chang before, make Angela Ash a bit inferior. Can you recall, how many time did Mr. Mc Court told about he and Malacy was forced to sing and die for Ireland? In the end, the story really make me feel about the struggle and humiliation of living under poverty."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Wonderfully moving book that makes you finally appreciate the old line &quot;there is always someone worse of than yourself&quot;. Which McCourt proves as whilst relaying his own dire curcumstances he can still point out others who were in sorrier shape. A tragic comedy that highlights how adaptable and resilient the human spirit is. I couldn't put it down and literally found myself laughing through the tears."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Never has a book touched me as much as Mr. McCourt's Angela's Ashes. Any reader will admire this man who, when faced with adversity one could only imagine, never felt sorry for himself. His thirst for knowledge and longing to succeed seems to be the driving force that got him through to where he is today. This is one of the few books I will read again and again, and give to my children to read. It is a lesson everyone should learn, but not have to live through. Mr. McCourt, through it all, has become the epitome of class and character."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This was the last book my mother read before she passed away last year, and she had urged me to read it also.

Written by a man who has expierienced life. He tells us about his misfortunes and tragedy in way that although sad, he finds a humorous way of expressing himself. He doesn't make you feel pity for him. He actually made me feel guilty for laughing. I guess that's why he is who he is today. For if we do not laugh at ourselves, we would just cry and get nowhere.

Frank McCourt made me feel I was right there with him in Ireland and able to see through his eyes. He was able to get across the stark realities of the hunger and filth he had to endur as well as the humilities. McCourt made me suffer right along with him. Also, the strong bond and love between family members were brought out very well. I cried, I laughed, I was repulsed,I was angered,and I cried some more. Granted this is not an &quot;uplifting&quot; book in the sense that McCourt's childhood was so full of deprivation, I still think it is a &quot;must read&quot; for everyone. I am anxious to read Frank McCourt's next book."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have to admit. This was one of the first books I read on my own. I had heard how good it was. Believe me. I was NOT disappointed. The book is so brilliantly written. I would be laughing and crying at the same time.

It was wonderully written and extremely truthful. Its extraordinary, a must read!!!!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I laughed, I cried, I howled at the wonderful, painful stories of McCourt's childhood in Ireland, and at the end, I threw the book across the room. McCourt shows us how he never seems to have outgrown his adolescent sexual obsessions. After reading for many pages of his exploits, at the end of it all, after McCourt arrives in America, he proclaims it is a great country. Why? Because it brought him freedom and he is able to finally be himself, and leave his suffering and errors of judgment and honesty behind him? No. Because he is able to bed an American married woman--with a priest in the next room--within an hour of his arriving in New York. What a summary there could have been, of learning by mistakes, of appreciating other people, of growth. Instead we are left to assume that McCourt learned nothing, except lying, stealing and adultery are the way to go. No balance. No maturing. No thanks."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I found Angela's Ashes to be boring. It droned on with the depressing and shocking accounts of Frank McCourt's childhood. There were so many of his experiences that could have been left out. I do not need to read about his first sexual experiences (both with himself and others). I kept reading this book, and hating to see that I still had so far to go. This book was a chore to read and a disgrace to the McCourt family. The world does not need to know that Angela McCourt slept with her cousin. I also do not like the fact that Frank McCourt is getting such praise for abandoning his family and stealing from so many people. I also found that this was 400 pages of little punctuation. Please Mr. McCourt, learn how to use a comma! My last major fault with this book: Frank McCourt is a wonder to science. To be 70 years old and have such a detailed account of his earliest years, let's just say that you are a miracle Mr. McCourt. Still, this was a good attempt. If the author could have done a little more editing and left out a few things, this would have been a decent book. This was, however, far from Pulitzer quality."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I gave up after the first couple chapters. The Irish twang was annoying, the story was BORING! I bought the book because it was The Strand's (bookstore in Manhattan) number one seller, plus a Pulitzer winner, so I figured I'd give it a try. I still don't undertand what all the hype was about. I guess if you were dirt poor and Irish at one time, then you could relate-but I got NOTHING from this book-not even an entertaining read."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was great right up until the last few pages and then...WHAT? After that horrible childhood of poverty, he did WHAT? He steals money from a dead woman and gets HIMSELF out of poverty, leaving everyone else behind without so much as a fare-thee-well, has a tawdry fling with some low-lifes and decides that he has finally arrived? Didn't he learn anything at all from his mother's struggles? Shame on the author for telling tales that reflect so poorly on himself and, by extension, on the mother that raised him!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"&quot;Have you read that book by Frank McCourt? It's sooo good, you positively haaaaaave to read it!&quot; This statement would then be followed by close to ten minutes of ravings about Irish accents, something about a pig's head, overflowing latrines and dirty Limericks.A few weeks ago, I finally got tired of being continually gushed at when I would reply that I haven't read Angela's Ashes. I bought a copy, went home and prepared to have the most profound experience of my life. I was somewhat disappointed.The first several chapters of the book were interesting and I found myself laughing out loud several times. The childlike narration is good in the beginning, but you would expect it to mature somewhat throughout the book as the child/narrator grows up. It doesn't. The latter parts of the book are what gave me trouble, I suppose. The gruesome details of every sort of sickness imaginable and the description of horrible living conditions is pretty compelling stuff, but after awhile it just gets gross. Not to even mention that there are some very personal things about Mr. McCourt that I would have rather not known.It would be unfair of me to say that I didn't like the book at all, because I felt it had it's moments. But to me those few moments don't make up for the number of times I have been accosted with &quot;Oooh have you read that book by Frank McCourt?&quot;"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes didn't do much for me, except makeme wish I hadn't spent the money on it.

Largely a disappointment."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Enter the mesmerizing and memorable world of Francis, who survives by any means available to his child's wily spirit and will.

The book then became boring and repetitious. I understand the book was about this family and their terrible struggle but on every page there is just another explanation of how poor they are and how they barely did anything about it.I chose this book for a school project. It grabbed my attention because it was about an Irish family. I have an Irish background so I was interested in reading about the Irish and hopefully learning more about the culture. All though I didn't really enjoy this book I did learn a few things. Some people can be extremely careless and selfish even when it comes to family. Reading this book also reminded me of how fortunate I am. I've very grateful for everything I've been blessed with. I recommend this book for an older audience looking to read about hard times and poverty."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I'm Irish and I loved it!! - If you don't buy, read and enjoy this book then you must have been \\"dropped on your head as a child.\\" This reference is just one of Mr McCourt's MANY unique and original one-liners throughout the book.Hard to believe he lived long enough to tell his story AND that he can tell his story in such a way that will make you laugh and cry at the same time. I think it is fair to say he hasn't lived a perfect life - but he sure has lived an interesting one!!I listened to the book on CD, which is aprox. 14 hours total in length and it was worth every minute!! The time flew by, it was as if I was sitting and listening to my grandfather tell a story.Despite the bleak backdrop and the dreary storyline - ironically I REALLY enjoyed this book!!! Mr. McCourt did a beautiful job with the narration as well.As a side note: Everyone should have been so lucky to have had just one teacher like Frank McCourt in school. What a storyteller!!I think you will enjoy it too! I suggest you buy the audio version to get the full effect."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"If you haven't read &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; and simply read a plot summary of it, you'll probably groan. In this book, Frank McCourt tells of his terrible Irish childhood in the 1930s and 40s, his alcoholic father, depressed mother, and the poverty he lived in. Before I read this book, I heard it described and privately thought, &quot;That's really sad, but do I really want to read another one of 'these' memoirs?&quot;But &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is not remarkable for the story it tells, but for the way it is told. So many people have stories like McCourt's, only a few can tell them so well. As I read this book, I realized that while the events in it were usually horrible, McCourt didn't attempt to overdramatize them. He simply described them. And described them, I will say, with beauty. His words are filled intelligence, keen observation, and some incredible kind of humor that manages to unforgettably color the experiences and show the fighting spirit that lead McCourt out of his miserable existence. On the other hand, this understated and almost poetic writing style lends itself so well to describing the horrors of the author's life. Because of his wit, determination, and charm, displayed through his writing, we come to care deeply for the author's character, and his misfortunes impact us all the more deeply.Many &quot;prize-winning&quot; books are too strange and artsy to really be appreciated; &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is just the opposite. A Pulitizer Prize winner, it will capture you with its rare beauty and astonishing power."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"THIS IS THE MOST DEPRESSING NOVEL I HAVE EVER READ.

McCourt's family went to America and then back to Ireland. The story continues until Frank is nineteen and leaving for America. The strength of the book lies in the vivid characterizations, the honesty of the narrative and the beautifully descriptive writing. McCourt puts you in the town of Limerick with the feckless McCourt family and their troubles. The book has its imperfections. McCourt indulges in a great deal of repetition. We hear over and over again about a relative who was dropped on his head as a child. Over and over, McCourt's father goes to the pubs to drink up his wages. There is an inevitability to the suffering that is incredibly depressing. The McCourt family is reduced to begging, to painting their legs black in order to hide the holes in their stockings and to living in a house with a sewer inside used by the entire neighborhood. &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is a story of survival against great odds, and it breaks your heart to see people suffering like this. McCourt certainly captures the feeling of what it was like to grow up in Ireland in abject poverty, suffering tremendous hunger and humiliation on a daily basis."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Okay if you want to hear what a 12 year old thinks of this book read the rest of this review .

Soon after she has another son.There dad moves and her oldest son eventualy moves to America.If you like a sad book then I really recomend that you go and get this book it will really make you think about the less fortunate people in this world."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt delivers what seems to be a truthful, and at times painful story of his childhood. Although the readers will draw various conclusions, the book is worthwhile and will draw some sort of an opinion from the reader. A very good book, written with humour, knowledge, and more importantly compassion."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have read a lot of Maeve Binchy novels set in Ireland, and from that gained a love and respect for the it, but this is not Binchy's Ireland. Frank McCourts Ireland is one of poverty, disease, death, loss, alcoholism and stringent religious ruling.He begins the with \\"My parents should never have left New York\\" and I think that speaks volumes about the Ireland he endured. My Grandfather grew up during the same era in America and his family was also very poor, but next to the McCourts his family could have been the Vanderbilts. Not only is Franks family poor in the daily necessities - food, clothing, blankets, shoes, furniture, healthcare, etc. but there is no extended family support the grandmother, though she does help them monetarily a few times, is the proverbial \\"old bat\\" she is mean to the children, and terrible to her daughter. The Aunt is so bitter over her own infertility that she can't a find an ounce of love or compassion in heart for needy nephews, although her husband Uncle Pa Keating provides something of a male role model for young Frank and possibly the only compassionate member of his extended family. Inside Franks immediate family though you find a different story altogether, though you don't word for word read the brotherly love, you can tell by his actions how much he loves each brother, and his mother, what more his alcoholic father, who leaves them all to starve. Though Frank understands that his father is basically worthless, you also come to understand that he loves him, and in his own way he knows that though he is a hopeless drunk he loves them as well, from the way he never finishes a meal, leaving it for his children to eat, to the way that he tells each child stories meant only for them. Which is why I loved this book so much, he never tells you this is how I felt or what I saw, he tells you what as a child was perceived and lets the reader intuit the truth. I felt a bit abandoned in the end as I never learned what happened to the rest of the McCourt children, or Angela herself.In all this was a book that was rife with sorrow but also made me laugh, Franks follies are so typical of a boy coming of age, and he is so honest in his depiction of his humiliation. I think I would like to know Frank, he must be an interesting and wise individual."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I found this amazing book totally refreshing - Frank McCourt has such a unique style of writing. Although the actual content of the book is very emotional and depressing, the personality of the writer and his descriptions of the other characters (I love his description of the girl he met in the city hospital)makes the book very uplifting.I've also read the sequel ''tis' which tells the story of his time in the states. I loved this book too. Frank McCourt is my favourite writer - can't wait until he brings out another book!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I chose this book because,I have seen the movie and I wanted to know what the book was like.This book is about a young irish boy named Frank Mcourt who was born in New York in the 1920's with his two irish- immagrant parents and little brother Malachy jr.He moved back to limereck ireland whe he was four.His mother's side of the family really dislike his father, because he is from Northern Ireland and has a funny manner also because he dosn't take care of his family.you might think that's not fair, but the father isn't very caring. whenever he gets paid money from his job, he goes to bars and spends all his money getting drunk, while his wife and children are starving and go to bed hungry.frank and his family are very poor and can hardley pay for catholic school.this story is very sad and helps you appreciate what you have.

McCourt's narrative uses all the expressions I had heard around the dinner table and in the household. I was especially taken by the mean spirited people he came in contact with, and his personal struggle to help his family survive. Life certainly was not easy for him, but his story was not at all uncommon for those times.

This was one of the greatest books I have read in a great while. What I could say about this book does not do justice to it. This is a book that you must read in order to get the full effect of how great it really is. It is one of the all time best. The money spent on this book was well worth it. Hurrah to Frank McCourt for such a finely written memoir..."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Just finished the book last night, am having trouble describing what I liked so much about it.

Thanks Frank."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is such an inspiration. It's raining outside and I have to run to my car without an umbrella or coat - I hesitate thinking how wet and cold I will feel - then I remember little Frank McCourt and him sopping through Limerick with his little brothers in tow, shoes with no soles, torn pants, never a coat and nothing in his little tummy to warm him - and I feel inspired, ashamed of myself for being afraid of a little rain, thankful for all that I have in my life (job, home, family...). The characters in this book come alive in front of your eyes, I have grown to love them, to feel so angry at some that I could rage at them with my fist held high - before realizing where I am - alone, at home in my room. I have about 80 more pages to read and I can't get myself to read them, even though all I want to do is pick up the book any spare moment I have to join Frank and his brothers and see how they ultimately rise above the squalid, heartwrenching drama of their little childhoods, but then the book will be finished! Oh what a sad day it will be! I will miss Frank and his brothers and his dear, sad mother. I will have to reread it - oh what a pleasure that will be. And only hope that Mr. McCourt will bless us once again with his immense talent and magic with words by writing a sequel!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela ashes:a memoir, continues the great literary tradition of Joyce and Faulkner"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I lost five pounds while reading this book, so vivid and nauseating did I find the descriptions of runny eyes and ropy yellow coughs and overflowing latrines, and I lost all notions of the poverty of Ireland (or anywhere) as quaint and charming or enobling. It is wretched and brings out the worst in people. The shortcoming and the strengths of the Irish come through Frank McCourt's narrative--literate and steeped in Irish songs and poems while subsisting on stolen apples and licking the grease and salt off of discarded fish and chip wrappings. From this book I understand the harsh humor and grim stoicism of my Irish Catholic family, and I appreciate the circumstances that motivate people to immigrate to the USA. I'm grateful my relatives escaped the potato famine. Also, we have come along in our understanding of alcoholism as a disease--but not far.

However, I had the good sense to buy the book and now everyone on my Christmas list will get a copy. This book manages to tear your heart apart in one scene because of the injustice and unfairness of it all and then on another page, it lifts you up again in ways words can't decribe. It inspired me, even changed me. As I sat in the warmth of a big comfortable chair, sipping hot chocolate, I read about this child who literally had no warmth, no comfort, no hot drinks and it made me really, truly appreciate the small things in life. In this age of grand scale commercialism and celebrity hype, Angela's Ashes is a refreshing reminder of what truly counts. And I had a revelation, that these things like warmth and light are not such small things after all."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"An adult who is able to not only remember childhood, but verbalize it through his eyes as a child is Frank McCourt's gift. While reading this book it brought such vivid memories of all those explanations adults gave me when I was a child that truly never made sense until I was close to adulthood. He pulled me into his life as his shadow and only when he finally came to terms with his life experiences on his sixteenth birthday did I cry with him. If Mr. McCourt wrote another book, it could never be the same as the child who wrote this one."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"What a lovely book and warm testament to Frank McCourt's family; especially his Mom.

This book reads like a novel, but provides the heartbreaking knowledge that THIS IS REAL. How could he even have grown up with all the evil times he had to endure?

It all came flooding back as I read the reader comments, most of which mirror my thinking: How can anyone in America today complain about life's circumstances without reflecting how F.

I'd wake up bleary-eyed but tell everyone about the stories in this book...from the knee-trembler to the one where Frank's dad has to take matters into his own hands to relieve Frank's younger brother of his congestion (readers of this book will know well that I am trying to put this delicately).I saw Frank McCourt in an interview he did on &quot;Out of Ireland&quot; on PBS and I was immediately taken in by his unassuming charm. Reading this book I've discovered that his writing style is quite the same. I've recommended this book to many people and I don't hesitate to now.I myself grew up in an Irish Catholic home - to a woman who wanted her son and daughter to become a priest and a nun! But you don't need to have grown up Irish-Catholic to be able to feel his pain, anquish or frustration.

Using an energetic style which conveys the intense tumult of his youth in Limerick, Ireland, McCourt packs into whole paragraphs, sometimes huge unpunctuated run-on sentences, the horrors and wonders of his childhood. I can't contend with any of the thousands of reviews here, and probably echo what each says: This is a modern classic. McCourt gives away the struggles he and his family went through for decades, but through it all the book remains full of love, wonder, trimuph of spirit and will, exuberance and hope.A five star book, sometimes too painful to get through, but written with a spirit like no other I have ever read."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I enjoyed reading this book; the innocent humor of a child brings the whole book to life, not to mention the vivid potrayal of the lives of the poor. I'd recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is a book like no other. Told from a child's point of view, it is very basic in text but very deep in meaning. The story is about an Irish family and the troubles they have to go through in order to survive. Angela, the narrator's mother, constantly has to deal with one hardship after another and remains helpless as she watches her family endure poverty and hunger. Her husband throughout the book wastes most of their family's few shillings on the local pubs just because he needs a drink to keep him sane.The book itself is captivating and moving, however, the tone of it may bore those who are \\"thrill-seekers\\". Since the book is told from Francis' point of view, most of the story is told without meaning and from a child's perspective. This book is one that you may want to put down, as it is depressing to read about any family that has to go through such a horrible life. What kept me reading is the fact that in disregard of all their troubles, they bring humor and life to every situation they have to encounter."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Lyrical, tearful, flowing, the near-perfect memoir of a family torn apart and a boy who grew into a man who could yet see humor in it all."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt's memories of his early childhood in NY and then eventually moving and growing up in Limerick, Ireland was something I truly enjoyed reading. The movie which I saw after reading this book did not have the heart the book had. Although McCourt grew up very poor, with an alcholic father who eventually abandoned the family, and a mother who tried her best, it was written and told very honestly and to the point without an ounce of self-pity, with such heart, nostalgia and care that even the nastiest of characters didn't seem all that nasty. I don't really know how to explain it but it was clear to me that though McCourt certainly had a miserable childhood you know he would never ever trade those experiences and those times with his family for a much better one if he was given the chance."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I have read and re-read this book and I love it. Triumph over adversity is always a good read! I went on to read the sequel- \\"'Tis\\" and also loved it."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In his memoir Frank McCourt tells us the story of his miserable Irish childhood without holding a thing back. The tone is the same throughout - neutral and half-conscious; it is as if a child is narrating the story, not quite understanding the situation. There is no wallowing in self-pity and exaggeration, it is the events that make the reader gasp and not the writing that could have easily been overdone with the topic. There is no fluff to the story, it is simply a story of survival."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is young Frank McCourt's childhood memories. Frank grows up in Ireland: a poor, cold, damp, ugly, depressed Ireland. The Irish blames a lot on the English, Frank's family is dysfunctional to say it the least, and life is not just tough - it is very tough. The lives of Frank and his family seems doomed from the beginningAnd still, Frank McCourt manages to write an inspiring, heartwarming, funny and touching story. But also a story that will make you very sad, a story which, at some points, seem utterly hopeless. Between the lines you are able to read the humor, the humor that must have kept Frank McCourt (and his family) alive, even during the worst times.All in all, you get the feeling that Frank and his family really want life, as ugly and meaningless as it sometimes seem.I liked this book a lot, and look forward to read 'Tis."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The greatest aspect of Angela's Ashes is that you feel like Frank McCourt really put himself in that book. The narrator really is him. Unlike most memoirs, you get the sense that you are sitting with McCourt at a table and he's telling you his story. You can tell he's being facetious, you're not sure all of the story is exactly how it happened, but you don't care because the story is so good and the message he's trying to deliver is so honest that it doesn't really matter. The narrator and the author just happen to be natural born storytellers and they tell it to you the way they felt it because sometimes that's more honest than telling you the way it was.With most other memoirs you get the sense that they don't share seem to have any feelings about any of the events happening. The author, of course, felt the story because he's the one being written about, but somehow they never place those feelings in the mouth (or words) of the narrator. The book might as well have been written by a biographer.But McCourt writes in his own voice. And you can almost feel him reliving these stories as he tells you about them. At one minute, he's crying over heartbreak and the next he's laughing at the irony spread throughout the story of his life.When he's at his best, he is laughing with you at the child he once was, the beliefs he once had.The book is terrific, but I don't have to tell you that because you already know."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt has a rare gift for storytelling, that is evident throughout this autobiographical novel. It could not have been easy to write such a book, let alone such a book about your own family. His childhood was amazingly difficult, his parents were hardly able to take care of themselves, let alone 2 children and innumerable dead babies. The Ireland McCourt shows us is divided, cold, rainy, chauvanistic and impoverished. A country that inspires its citizens to love it and hate it simultaneously.This is a fascinating story, that many of us with Irish relatives can relate to stories we heard growing up about the old country. I find the book to be much better than the movie and would recommend it to anyone who wants to read an well written, moving, true story."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Of course after months on the best seller lists and millions of copies having been sold, everyone has heard of Angela's Ashes. I have owned the book for a long time, and just recently decided to read it, but it was a wonderful read. I liked the informal and personal style McCourt writes with, that was only a small part of the book's effect. I learned a lot about immigrant's in America, conditions that the poor lived in here and in Irealand, and about family structure in a time when family values was not a buzz word like it is today. The characters in the story come to life and it McCourt makes it possible to relate to them and understand them.

A lot of the incidents now strike me as &quot;mythic&quot;: stern attitude of the Church, love encounter with the sick girl, escape to USA. Almost a quest motif. That is not to say that the book wasn't at all interesting but the second time through I began to notice things. A great work of literature for me can open up to me with each new reading, open up with something new/hidden/outsanding/astonishing.But I would like to answer the reader from Ireland. This is not &quot;Irish&quot; writing at all. McCourt spent years as a writing teacher at a NYC high school. This is American literature, pure and simple, simple enough to play to the heart strings. When I think of Irish writers, I think of Yeats, Joyce, Mabinogion, Flann O'Briens' novels and newpaper columns."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I really didn't need to write another review as there are already over 1200 here, but I couldn't help it.

Well, I was right, but I never counted on the incredible humor that this author is able to intertwine into the most miserable circumstances. So just as I feared, I cried out loud for these poor little children, but I also laughed out loud many times. What a talent to be able to write about such tragedy and sorrow and yet still manage to convey a sense of hope and redemption. I'm still wishing I could give that little boy and his brothers everything that I took for granted as a child - most of all, I just want to reach through the book and hug them."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Having listened to Malachy McCourt for many years on WBAI, I feel like I know Frank McCourt.

Frank McCourt and his family were ones that made it through it all.Frank McCourt took on the roll of a man, something his father never did when he'd work.

Afterwards, write Frank and beg him for more!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt had six brothers and sisters, all baptized in the same lace dress. Only three survived their brutishly poor childhood in Brooklyn and Limerick. Frank not only survived; he triumphed--and he produced this work about the triumph of spirit and the triumph of language. McCourt is a great storyteller, and these stories about his life through adolescence are wonderfully written. It may even be that his ability to detach and see his life as a tale to be retold accounts for his triumph over his station. But make no mistake about it: these are stories. It is impossible for the reader to tell where literal truth--even remembered truth--ends and where the embroidered story begins. At some level, perhaps, it may not matter, because we love the audacity and freshness of each of the stories so much. Whether or how much of it is apocryphal is hardly relevant, since it is so well told. In essence, this is the adult version of how Mr. McCourt would have, should have, must have seen the world as a child. One theory of human dynamics says that we fulfill our perception of others' expectations of us. Frank McCourt thinks we think he is a witty, resilient, triumphant storyteller. And so he is. I'm just not so sure that we know what he really felt as a kid growing up in Limerick, which is where the lace dress in which he and his siblings were baptized was made."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is the wonderful memoir of Frank McCourt, born during the depresson in Brooklyn, New York.

The fact that some events kept occurring (i.e. Dad drinking up all the money) had a continual impact on his life. Without being reminded of those events, we wouldn't be able to transport ourselves to his childhood - and wouldn't as a result have been able to understand what he went through.I too can't wait for 'Tis.

I particularly enjoyed the youthful Frank's perspective on faith and the Roman Catholic church in general as well as his naivete about many things in his young life. There were times where his degree of poverty exceeded what can be conceived by most and absorbed by many. Great ending, but a bit repetitive throughout in regards to the father's irresponsibility and the fixation on the unsanitary conditions, etc. A tragic yet envigorating tale, overall a good read."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Mr. McCourt, I admire you. You certainly have my respect for your story telling. I loved your book and read it straight for 3 days. Your story of your childhood is inimaginable to most. I thought growing up poor in America was bad until I read this book. I really understood when the onslaught of WWII was good for Ireland as it but its out-of-work men to work, feeding their families and giving them self-respect and off the dole. This story is a story never told and one we can all learn from. It tells Frank's story of his life in New York until the family moves back to Limerick after a baby sister is found dead one morning. The family struggles to survive from the first page until the last. The father is a drunk. The mother is a baby factory and the children are always hungry. The book gives us a little glimpse of the Irish/Catholic Church and how they treated the poor. It tells the story of the proud people of Ireland and the stories they pass down to their families through song and poems. I would reccommend this book to the avid reader who can't put a book down and wants to be thankful for the life they behold in America."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A book you won't be able to put down"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I couldn't put the book down, and I was sad when it ended. ..Someday I will read it again. If you liked this book, or want to read one that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read Angela's Ashes at the behest of my sister who raved until I could resist no more. She sent it to me and there it sat; naturally I picked it up and was drawn into the beautiful writing and entertaining stories - as has been every person I know who has read it. It was a very good read.However, when I reflected on the book I started to feel Mr. McCourt had overly romanticized a grueling and cruel childhood. I began to recall the tone and flavor of Roddy Doyle's books &quot;Paddy Clarke- Ha Ha Ha&quot; and &quot;The Woman who Walked into Doors&quot;, two novels which deal with a similar subject matter. Those books went so much deeper to reveal the heavy oppression and despair of poverty in Catholic Ireland. I would highly recommend both books to anyone who wants a more realistic and truthful portrayal of the Irish Catholic experience.I find it hard to believe that a childhood such as that told by Mr. McCourt can be both a revealed truth and so completely anecdotal and humorous. There is not expressed the pain in the child that I firmly believe must be there. Surely there resides in him a core of damage and a modicum of bitterness that, unexplored and unrevealed, will not go away.It reminds me of a Hollywood movie with a happy ending. It makes one feel good, but is it true? I have read many reviews of this book and have not heard this criticism raised. I wonder if anyone else feels as I do about the book.Comments?"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"What this book says about the Irish people and in particular Irish Catholics is truly sad and awful. Many people grow up in poverty and hunger, but there is simply no excuse for the blatant misery these people imposed on each other. The Irish are portrayed as mean, ignorant, vindictive, and highly hypocritical. They hold to the forms of religion (Catholicism) without experiencing the truths. There are few true heroes in the book, except perhaps Frank himself, who eventually rises above the conditions. The father is a hopeless alcoholic. He loves his family but is powerless to overcome the ravaging effects of alcohol in his life. The people walk around like victims and losers - no wonder the English dominated them for 800 years. The mother is no hero for staying with her hopelessly useless husband. This book reinforces what I have always suspected about the poor of any race or nationality - much of their condition is their own fault. Even so, I must admit that the book has high literary quality. I finished the entire text quickly and re-read parts afterwards. Do not read this this if you like heart warming stories - this is depressing and awful."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was a page-turner and kept me interested from beginning to end. Unfortunately, it did not live up to all the hype surrounding its publication. I was ultimately disappointed that the funny parts weren't funnier and the sad parts sadder. In a nutshell, the characters in the book: Drink, drink, have a baby, drink,have another baby, bury a baby, drink, go to church,have a baby, drink, bury a baby, drink, drink, go to church, and drink. They are desperately poor and feel very sentimental about Ireland, so they also sing songs while drinking, having babies, burying babies, or attending church. I love Irish writers; they are natural story-tellers, and McCourt is no exception. And I guess it says something that at least a few of the babies survived to become successful adults. But the constant theme of wallowing in sorrow was pretty depressing."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read the book. It is moving and sad, but I don't understand how the author won a Pulitzer Prize for it. It was difficult to wade through the first four chapters.

And as much as he tells us about the hardships of his childhood and how tough life at home was, he doesnt fail to stick in a good anecdote or two about school or him and his brothers.

The book reveals his entire life. Francis McCourt, son of Angela and Malachy of Limerick Ireland. WIth a family if constantly changing numbers Francies battles through the worst challenges that the Irish slums can throw at him. Malachy is a depressed alcaholic who never holds a job for more than 2 weeks. Even when he does work he drinks away his pay check and leaves his family to suffer through life without his assistance. Angela is severly depressed and doesn't know herself well enough to know her own children or anyone else either. Francis is her first child, one of 8 he soon learned the value of being independent and remaining primarily self sufficient. Around age 7 he takes on the role of taking care of his younger siblings. With no heat, shoes, shabby clothes, little to no food and a life of eviction and confusion Francis rose above all the odds to concor his dreams of moving to America and making a better life for himself and his family if he couuld. By working hard and getting any job he could he tried to save everyone, espeacially himself.I highly applaud this book and think that everyone should read it at least once in their life. The story reveals remarkable clarity and unique perspectives of a world seldom explored by choice and all too often overlooked. The new view of an old clishe flows with interesting details and remarkable feats. Life is constantly changing and this book reveals the details of survival in a harsh world where life is often taken for granted and things are worse than they appear. The inncent clarity on the bitter reality proves the true intention of the book. Not to change the reality of that life but to realize its there, perhaps not as obvious as it once was but it is still present and will remain so for a long time to come. The book wasn't perfect but it was the truth. The hardest part for me was reading Angela's views and decisions. I think her hope was sadly misplaced and often did more harm than good. Being optomistic in the worst of situations is admirable but providing false hope when life repeats failure again and again only hurts those people.This book is one that almost anyone could read and the vocabulary level is simple yet precise. Anyone is capable of reading this book and easily understanding the text as well as the underlying messages.

The characters aren't greatly developed and Frank (and Angela) are stoic, at best. McCourt's style of writing is difficult to read and I found myself having to reread paragraphs to get the gist of some things. However, he doesn't waiver from the story (so I guess that makes the style &quot;easier&quot;). Overall, it's a good book. Worth reading, however depressing it is.

The man has passed the hat and wants for nothing; in fact, he still has his day job.A hollow echo of Irish life that harkens back more to Darby O Gill and the Little People than to anything real. The dialog is hollow and inane, the story line serves up one cliched scene after another. A thorough waste of time. No stars, not even a barren asteroid.Forget this book."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I also heard what a wonderful book this was, so I borrowed it from the library. Although the description of poverty and alcoholism did touch my heart, the lack of love and caring for others, and his failure to notice and appreciate the help given to him and his family made me thoroughly dislike Frank by the end of the book.I also agree with other reviewers. It did not finish, it just ended, and badly. The writing and subject matter seemed to deteriorate in the last half of the book. The excessive emphasis on his sexual cavorting, increasing reliance and casual acceptance of stealing and taking advantage of other people, and especially the unapologetic admission that he hit his mother in the face while drunk, left me disgusted and made it clear that he failed to develop compassion and the capacity to love anyone.He judges his mother so harshly for the \\"knee-trembler\\" that brought him into the world, and her \\"excitement\\" with her cousin, (done under duress to provide a roof over their heads!) yet he romps with the wife of a veteran off fighting the war the minute he gets to the US, without any apology. He has casual sex with the dying, virginal Theresa yet only thinks of himself and his own damnation after her tragic death. Where is the understanding for his mother and her moment of weakness that led to a life of misery? Where is the lesson on why the choice of spouse is probably the most important one we can make?He has nothing nice to say about his mom, even though she stays there for her family and does everything, even begs to provide them food. Instead, he is ashamed of her. We find out almost nothing about her feelings, disappointment, or guilt. Her grief over her dead children is turned into a criticism of her as the reason for neglecting her living children, and he paints her as a nagging shrew who constantly demands money from her husband. Even though his dad doesn't care if they starve, and his misplaced pride, selfishness, and lack of self control causes years of misery and heartache, Frank seems to hold him in higher regard than his mom. Though the book is named \\"Angela's Ashes\\" he does not seem to love or appreciate her, and I can't understand the title. He seems to be blaming his sad life mostly on her.It also makes the Irish people appear totally hard and uncaring, cutthroat, and unable to love even their own families. He obviously dislikes Aunt Aggie, and didn't seem to appreciate the new clothes she got so he could start his first real job. There is no real attempt to understand the pain of others. I too found the endless description of filth and squalor repetitive and it lost its meaning after a while.If I had known the ending, I would not have continued to read it. It just leaves me hanging without resolving anything. He dumps his family and selfishly seeks hedonistic release, kind of like his dad, and he never seems to examine himself in an honest way. The book really is just superficial description of sad events without deep reflection and seems filled with bitterness and harsh judgments.Suffering can build character and empathy for others, but not in his case. I kept thinking he would turn this horrible suffering into a valuable lesson on value and compassion, but he never brings it out of the gutter, just descends further into it. I don't know why this won a Pulitzer, but I don't think it merits such high praise. I also think it was poorly written and could have used some more editing.All in all, it left a bad taste in my mouth, and was not worth the time to read after the first 100 pages. I'm sorry he suffered as a child, and especially that the suffering did not help him to become a more understanding and loving person who appreciates goodness. This book does not depict or develop forgiveness, but rather indifference and a lack of depth that leaves me sorely disappointed."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Anyone from Limerick who was listening to the local station last night or anybody listening to it on the internet would have heard Richard Harris, a contemporary of Frank Mc Court point out the inaccuracies in this book. Harris says that there was no misery because of the sense of community that surrounded and still surrounds the city of Limerick. Also it appears that Angela's ashes were lost by Malchy Mc Court on an Icelandic flight and are still probably in the lost luggage department of Kennedy airport. As to the book itself, I believe along with most of Limerick, Richard Harris and even Brian Friel has said that this book lacks any literary merit whatsoever.Angela Mc Court was often described as the angel of the lanes and was a big heavy woman and not a waif like Emily Watson thogh Frank Mc Court himself said it brought a tear to his eye how much she reminded him of his mother.Don't buy this book if you want a good read.

The need to find out what happens next just about encourages the reader to keep reading despite the awful style. The need to keep reading was mainly due to interest in what happened in Limerick having heard first-hand stories from other parts of my home elsewhere in Ireland at that time.

After having seen the movie trailer while in the middle of reading Angela's Ashes, I stand amazed that this book has drawn such an avid audience (and no doubt the movie will too). The author spends so much time with graphic descriptions of hunger, poverty, disease and filth, but character development, growth, or even self-reflection barely surfaces in this book. I kept reading just to see who was going to die next. As for humor, maybe McCourt's reading on audio makes it funny, but the droll tongue-in-cheek humor that is often based on mockery and ignorance didn't even make me smile. At the end, turning to thievery and adultery could have even been a bit ironic, but in the drab context of his endless laundry list of &quot;this happened, then this happened&quot;, it barely registers in this novel.

To equate the McCourt's, their struggle,and vacuuous existience with THE Irish is a huge mistake.(One reviewer mentioned that her college class was given this as required reading...disturbing if this is going to be that student's ONLY link to the Irish!)

God rest his soul. But one recurrent thought I had while reading was \\"How can he remember so many minute details from so long ago?\\"All in all, the story was interesting at first, but became very repetitive after a while.

One last thing I'll throw out there: I'm no prude by any possible stretch of the imagination, but the ending is a real prize. Somehow we're all supposed to laugh along wisfully as he recounts a throw with a war veteran's wife. Wow. He convinces me with that disgusting story that he's nothing more than a classic selfish pig.

Did he think his life was so different from anyone else's in that terrible time? The Depression went around the world, and most of us did the best we could with it. My wonderfully Irish parents did their best here in America, and we kids survived and became useful citizens.McCourt had an alcoholic father -- that was reprehensible, but he also was a nasty little brat. In my opinion, Angela's Ashes is a book of self-pity, self-obsession, and self-interest. As a woman of Irish descent, I'm ashamed of a fellow Celt who could pewl and groan the way Frank McCourt does in this book. He ought to be ashamed of himself.The Irish people have fought the Brits for 800 years and haven't moaned and groaned. McCourt happens to be living during a world-wide depression, and he falls apart.

I enjoy the very lyrical prose (at least in the beginning of the book before it became redundant)of the Irish story teller who told a painful story of childhood that wasn't much of a pain to read, unlike most other sad stories. I won't reiterate all the strong points that many of the readers have already brought forward but I do want to provide a few different thoughts. First, perhaps the light humors that were added to the story was a way to balance tragedy and comedy but I, unlike many readers, found some of the humors to be unfitting. Secondly, I'm not sure what the author's message was about the various sexual experiences throughout the book, especially in the final scene. Were they meant to be humorous or saying something about the desire for freedom from the \\"miserable catholic childhood?\\" Either way, I didn't laugh and didn't see a connection. Thirdly, I read the book twice and still couldn't capture the elements that would make this book among the Pulitzer winner list. I've enjoyed other memoirs just as much, if not better, and they were much less than well known. Somewhere along the way, maybe because of the movie deal, the book became overrated.

Frank gets inside your head and transports you back to Limerick in a rapturous literary wave."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The childhood of Frank McCourt was a whirlwind of experiences that created the intelligent, quick-witted, and storied author of the memoir Angela's Ashes. Relentless class systems, decrepit, poverty stricken communities, gnawing hunger; all of these themes are superimposed over the early life of strapping young Frank McCourt; a talented young boy living \\"the miserable Irish Catholic childhood\\" in the slums of 1930's Limerick. Parks, grocery stores, train stations, coalmines, and the post office are the locale for the adventures of Frank's childhood. There are no heroes or villains, just people; people who struggle and grieve and rejoice together in a city wrought with poverty and misfortune.Angela's Ashes takes you though the memorable adventure that was Frank McCourt's childhood. McCourt begins the memoir with the meeting of his parents at a pub in Brooklyn. Frank is borne a sister, and his life seems to be changing for the better. Her tragic death sends his mother into a depthless depression and amplifies his father's already ruinous alcoholism. After moving back to Limerick, Frank nearly dies from typhoid, but finds solace in storytelling and the written work of Shakespeare. Frank gets his first job at the local post office, through which he finds himself in his first sexual relationship with a woman. Her death gives McCourt the money he needs to pay for passage to America, where a bright new chapter of his life awaits.Parts of McCourt's life fit in with how his memoir relates to journalistic history. Frank lived through the Great Depression. His realistic account of what life was like in the slums of Ireland give new insight to the time period. McCourt brings the reader right in to the grittiness of his childhood. He showed the world that hope could exist in even the darkest of times, and that sometimes stories told through the eyes of a child can be more powerful, memorable and thought provoking than those of experienced writers.Frank narrates his story in a plethora of different manners. Symbolism is an important and effective mechanism used throughout the memoir to illustrate elements of Frank's life in a compelling and relatable manner. The River Shannon is an appreciable example. Ever-present in Limerick, the River Shannon represents the bleakness and desolation that Frank is stuck in. As Frank grows up, he changes, and so does the river. The River Shannon becomes a symbol of hope; hope of escaping Ireland and forging a new life across the Atlantic. A very different symbol is ashes. Ashes represent the dark, lifeless world that Frank grew up in. They represent the cloak of depression around his mother; the cloak woven from her crushed dreams and failed attempts at raising a healthy family. Ashes are the stark reminder of the reality Frank lives in, and the semblance of what life could have been.All in all, Frank McCourt weaves a timeless tale that readers can relate to. Symbolism, songs, sadness and story telling all come together in startlingly emotional tale of a young boy and the man he becomes; the adventures of life paving every step of the way."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Rarely does a book make me so angry and laugh out loud as well.

A great read."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I couldn't put the book down once I started reading it. The harrowing life the mother and the children endured keeps gnawing at my soul. I kept putting myself and my siblings in their place, wondering how we would have survived the hardships. I can't fathom how Angela navigated life's vagaries. It is a story that touches at people's biases, pride and weaknesses. There was no relief for the children in the church. It was a little hell on earth for them - the beatings and the fatuous stories. The story is a testament to the indomitable human spirit and the resilience of children's vitality. Frank's father was a loving man at heart, but deeply crippled by alcohol. It should be required reading for all prospective parents."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I really enjoyed this book, it showed a lot about the poor of Ireland and the Irish men who all had one weakness the drink. It shows a lot about the catholic church and it also make me understand why my relatives were thought of so badly when they came to America. The Irish in the book were poor and relied on the government and the men leave their children and the mothers don't know what to do. I saw my own family in this story, especially my Grandfather. I saw the real Ireland not the land that is told about in fairy tales. Ireland has come a long way and is so much better for it. This is not putting down the Irish this is showing how the survived.

McCourt grew up during the late 1930s and 1940s and faced several conflicts such as hunger, death, his father's alcoholism, and illness. While amongst the lower-class, he faces opposition with people in all positions of authority such as schoolmasters, priests, and family members. However this does not make Frank's goal of rising up from poverty and leaving Ireland impossible.Frank McCourt tells his story in an eccentric intriguing style. He mixes humor and wit with the harsh experiences of his childhood while also informing the reader of the stereotypical Irish lifestyle. The memoir is told in the present tense and written as though he is experiencing specific events that very moment. \\"I'm on deck the dawn we sail into New York. I'm sure I'm in a film, that it will end and lights will come up in the Lyric Cinema. . . . Rich Americans in top hats white ties and tails must be going home to bed with the gorgeous women with white teeth. The rest are going to work in warm comfortable offices and no one has a care in the world.\\" This gives the reader a sense of the emotions he was facing at the time and lets you picture the event taking place. He also aligns the tone of the text with his progressing age. McCourt ties in the themes of family, love, religion, and social relationships, drawing the reader into his tragic life. \\"My brothers are dead and my sister is dead and I wonder if they died for Ireland or the Faith. Dad says they were too young to die for anything. Mam says it was disease and starvation and him never having a job. Dad says, Och, Angela, puts on his cap and goes for a long walk\\". His writing style gives the reader the opportunity to see the care for family, Church and society, dedication, tragedy of alcoholism, and the harshness of life in Ireland.Angela's Ashes is a story of survival of the spirit and body and an unforgettable memoir of a boy searching for a childhood in a world where he is forced to take on adult responsibilities. Frank McCourt, the book's author, narrator, and protagonist, tells his own life story from the perspective of an adolescent looking out onto the world. His early childhood consisted of his mother, Angela, struggling to feed her growing sons, paying the wages, and coping with the deaths of her young daughter. His childhood is a time of some adventure and continued deprivation. After the tragic death of his younger sister the family moved back home to Ireland. Soon enough Frank witnessed the death of his two brothers.He faces several conflicts such as hunger, neglect, his alcoholic father, oppressive weather, poverty, starvation and harassment. However, Frank remains strong. McCourt descriptively shares his memories of searching for coal along the streets, begging for food, and the ruthless, cold nights. Frank increasingly condemns his father's irresponsibility but worries also about the morality of his own behavior. He determines to make a success of himself in America. He portrays an independent, determined young boy who eventually found himself as the \\"man of the house\\" instead of his own father. Frank still loves his father regardless of his alcoholic habits. When his father's attempt to earn money in England fails, Frank finds work on his own. This gives him the feeling of responsibility and lets him dream of hope for providing his family with food and clothes. Frank soon faces conflict again when his family moves in with Angela's cousin, Laman. A sexual relationship between the two is formed which brings anger to Frank. Frank soon starts a sexual relationship of his own with one of his customers, who soon dies of consumption, leaving Frank with a broken heart. Near the end, a priest pardons Frank of all his sins. This allows Frank to leave for America with a clear conscience and to take hold of his thoughts for his potential future. At this point, Frank's dream of leaving Ireland and overcoming poverty becomes possible. Even though he is sad of leaving his family back in Ireland, he earns enough money to move to New York and bid his farewell to Ireland. Angela's Ashes is a beautifully written memoir. The story captures your heart and gives you an idea of the hardships faced in our past.Frank McCourt brought numerous emotions to the reader. The fast moving memoir allows you to picture the tragedies as if they were happening right before your eyes. With great detail, you can create images within your mind of the dark streets of Ireland and rough living styles. As a result of the incomparable life in the 1900s, the reader is pulled into Frank McCourt's personal experiences, investing every emotion. His description of his life is matchless. Angela's Ashes won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Critics' Circle Award, and spent 117 weeks on The New York Times hardcover best-seller list. Angela's Ashes serves as a living record of the strong moral values and sense of humor McCourt maintained despite the suffering and despair he suffered as a child.\\"When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all.\\"--Frank McCourt"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is one of the those rare books that can apply in almost any situation where poverty is involved. Forgive me if this seems a little strange because it's a memoir, but just hear me out. Poverty is around all of us every day and weather we like to admit it or not, everyone has had some sort of brush with it, whether it be seeing a homeless man on the street or having been poor at some point in your life. Mc Courts memories unlock a world which is usuallly locked out by what is considered the respectable world. Mc Court's childhood hard ships took place in Ireland, but there are simlar things happening to children now all over the world. His book alows you to slip in to the shoes of an impoversihed child struggling to survive, and when you finish you feel like you've been through the experience. Personally, this book made me want to learn how it's possible to help people in this kind of trouble. As well as making me feel lucky that I have what I have now."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourts ANGELA'S ASHES relays the adolescent hardships of a poverty-stricken life. This novel serves to portray the aggravation of an alcoholic father who spends the little money the family has on alcohol, and ultimately leaves the family completely penniless. An underlying idea of the novel shows the satiric view of the Roman Catholic Church in which McCourt was raised. Throughout McCourt's lifelong struggle to save enough money to return to America, he faces many and is confronted with many problems in his everyday life. The novel brings to life the inhumanity of the life lived in poverty, with the natrual regularity of death and disease, and the despair of having to steal for food to live. McCourt adequately relates his views of the difference between classes, his view of pompous Irish schoolmasters, and his idealistic view of America. This is a heartening yet sometimes depressing read that allows the reader to relate to the overall strife of human existence, and shows the extraordinary will to succeed of a young boy trying to overcome his circumstances with dignity and character. McCourt's novel is inspiring, though-provoking, and heart-felt. This novel is a must-read. It is a literary jewel."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"After I read the book, Angela's Ashes, I felt as though I had lived and experienced a whole different life.

One of the sad parts of this book, at least to me,is the gradual losing of innocence as the book progresses,particularly in the final third or so. We want the maincharacter to remain the lovable child he was at the beginning ofthe story, but he does not. That's because we're dealing withreal life, not a fairy tale. Life just doesn't always work outthat way, and that's something we either accept or we wind up ina dream-world.

His story is one of incredible sadness. His father spends the family's mother on drink, several of his siblings die in early childhood and he grows up in desperate poverty in Ireland. Nevertheless, Angela's Ashes is an extremely optimistic and light-hearted book. As a child, McCourt has the outlook of a Tom Sawyer, looking at every hardship as an adventure while retaining the love for his family that Tom Sawyer never had.McCourt loves his alcoholic father for sharing Irish patriotism with him, loves his mother for caring for him through such difficult times and clearly was a good older brother to his siblings. Despite the great love for his family, McCourt is also a rebel, ignoring arbitrary rules set by his parents, his teachers and his priests while never harming those he loves by his rebellion.Angela's Ashes has the rare ability to remind us of our good fortune without seeming preachy. The lesson of Angela's Ashes is not &quot;be happy for having such a good life because others have it worse off&quot; but rather is &quot;no matter what adversity you face, life is a wonderful thing.&quot; This is truly a wonderful lesson and will uplift you while reading this book."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is an amazing book as is his second book ('Tis) which follows this one.

He has vivid memories that start as early as the age of four or five.McCourt is born in Brooklyn, New York. His father is an alcoholic and can't hold a job or support his family. They return to live in Ireland where his father eventually abandons the family. Some of McCourt's siblings die. He faces hunger, illness, death and homelessness. The family is so poor that they live without the basic necessities that many people take for granted. Yet, they are always kind to others (humans and animals) less fortunate. When McCourt is 19, he returns to New York City.McCourt describes a lot of touching scenes, like the time his little brother, Michael, brings home a blind greyhound. Michael sacrifices his supper (bread) to the dog and lets it sleep in the bed that all the children share. Later they find the dog dead. His brother is so upset that their mother allows them to stay home from school so that they can have a funeral.Chapter Four is my favorite chapter, where the author describes his experiences in an Irish school - the strict teachers, learning the catechism, his first communion, his first confession, his confirmation, giving his first collection, and watching movies starring James Cagney.McCourt tells his remarkable story, many times with humor.ANGELA'S ASHES is a reminder of the many children in this world who have to grow up in poverty.

It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\\"It is almost impossible to ignore the strong imagery and personal experiences that Francis McCourt shares in Angela's Ashes. The story's subject matter concerns a world of poverty that few readers have experienced, yet they are invited to share McCourt's thoughts and feelings while growing up in Ireland. It is a memoir that is potent, funny, sad, and yet dignifying. In an interview, McCourt says \\"Even though we were poor, at the lowest level, even below the lowest economic level, we were always excited. It was rich in the sense that we had a lot to look up to, to look forward to, to aspire to, a lot to dream about. But in economic circumstances it was desperate.\\"Frank McCourt is the oldest of seven children - three of whom die at an early age. Born in New York City in 1931, the book follows his family's move to Limerick, Ireland when he is three years old. Ireland at this time is immersed in poverty, made only worse in McCourt's case by an alcoholic father who cannot hold a job and drinks away all of the money received from the dole. From age three to nineteen, when he leaves for America, McCourt endures a struggle with Protestants, the English presence in Ireland, strict Catholic school masters, bullying classmates, and the sickness and death associated with poverty.Although the events he lives through are dismal, the impact of the book is not disheartening. It is a memoir written from a child's perspective, which creates a more personal feeling when reading the book. McCourt tells you everything he is thinking in a child's words. He describes the experiences the way he felt them when he was a child. This creates a jovial yet heavy sadness to the book.Angela's Ashes is a fantastic book that gives an insight into what it would be like to live in poverty, and how a person could prevail over it. McCourt survived his childhood through a combination of virtue, hope, luck, and humor. He faced his obstacles with a child's innocence and conveys this through his perceptive writing. He won both the Pulitzer Prize for Biography and the National Book Critics Circle Award.

He is born into a poor family in New York to his parents Angela Sheehan And Malachy MCcourt. They later move back to limereck,Ireland hoping they will have a better life. Frank tells about his harsh life growing up at those times.My favorite part the book was when his baby sister was born.Frank had many siblings in the past, but most of them starved to death back in New York. His sisters name was Margaret and looked like her mother with black curly hair and blue eyes. margaret was so special because she was the first daughter to be born in the MCcourt family. Her father loved her very much. Every time she started to cry,he would sing to her until she stoped crying. I thought this was very nice of the father.I would recomend this book to people who like to read about the harsh realty of life. This book helped me realize that I should appreciate what I have. this book goes into detail about the how hard it was to live at those times."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is a good read, not difficult except for the excess of names in Brooklyn and Limerick which you think may be necessary to remember but are not. A strong point of the book is the subtle way author Frank McCourt piles superstition upon superstition, contradiction upon contradiction in his description of how the salt-of-the-earth and the not so salty Catholics live out their religion. He seems to speak to the folly of organized faith. A weak point is the mundane presentation of illness and death that slips by on page after page while eliciting little of the sympathy and none of the horror such tragedies produce in real life.I did not discover a truly interesting character until chapter four when introduced to cross-eyed Mikey Molloy, 114 pages deep. Here's an eleven year old book-reading boy with flair and personality who is creative enough or cunning enough to turn epilepsy to his own favor when the situation dictates. Mikey fades away as the story grinds on but not before he has helped point Frankie McCourt toward books.Frankie, himself, gradually develops a sympathetic personality, which is fortunate since he is Angela's surviving narrator. He is a smart boy who made me laugh when he ate white Bill Galvin's lunch. I laughed again when he was forced to learn how to Irish dance and was worried he'd look like he had &quot;a steel rod up his arse.&quot; This poverty haunted, shoeless, snot-nosed kid didn't want to dance the Irish. He wanted to be Fred Astaire until--bedridden with typhoid fever--he discovered a love for two short lines of Shakespeare's poetry which led to &quot;The Highwayman,&quot; and to P.G. Wodehouse and eventually opened the world to Frankie.I suppose I should have felt compassion for Angela, herself, but I didn't. She was no more a victim of poverty's circumstance than were her children or friends or enemies in the Irish slums. I was surprised to discover that she was never cremated. I mean the title makes you think her remains would be on a mantle someplace or buried and waiting to be dug up by her sympathetic adult children. Angela's were the stagnant ashes in the crummy fireplace at which she stared in order to escape her dismal reality. The title of Frank McCourt's book would translate just as well into &quot;Malachy's Pints&quot; or &quot;Linus's Blanket.&quot;The one character I loved and cried for was Theresa Carmody, the sweet and fragile girl who finally brought pleasure and meaning to Frankie McCourt before he fled to America. Theresa didn't take up too many pages but she boldly grabbed a handful of excitement where she found it and followed her passion until she coughed up her life.

That and more! Frank Mc Court has manipulated the range and depth of the reader's emotions from joy to abject sorrow so skillfully that one is sometimes driven to laugh and weep almost simultaneously. In the words of Lincoln Steffans (&quot;A Miserable Merry Christmas&quot;) describing a similar experience, 'It covered the whole distance from broken-hearted misery to bursting happiness -- too fast. A grownup could hardly have stood it!'McCourt's characterization of his complex father is suberb; from this flawed man he received his greatest gifts. The book is rich in comic exaggeration, which is an ingredient of his artistry. I take issue, however, with his shabby treatment of the Catholic Church which borders on the sacrilegious. Further, his revealing the degradation of his long-suffering mother is neither necessary nor honorable, however the artistic merit. It is, rather, an injustice and a shameful exploitation.Frank McCourt: Which of your special, unique brothers would you have eliminated to insure a better quality of life for the remainder? Which would the reader wish had never been conceived? I myself rejoice in the gift of each, and mourn the untimely death of the twins and the infant sister, longing for the unfilled promise of their lives. All life is precious and the human spirit prevails even in the face of abject poverty and perverse sinfulness, a theme which McCourt so skillfully illustrates."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I was born and raised in Limerick and lived there until I was 27, as was my Father. Limerick may not be Paris but neither is it what the author describes it as. Yes there was and probably still is poverty but Limerick is a relatively modern and progressive city with mostly middle class residents who work in the electronics sector. My Father lived near Limerick during the same period as the author and did not come from a wealthy family and had tough times, including the death of 2 siblings, but also many more good times and fondly remembers his youth. He worked hard in the city and finally moved to one of the 'big houses on the Ennis Road'.

I wanted so to like this book. I didn't. The narration seemed somehow dishonest to the memories, through a lens that didn't just cloud them with gauze, but adulterated them.I was put in mind at the beginning of Dicken's Mrs. Gammage, who 'feels it more' than anyone else.Self pity is never pretty. There are so many better writers who have tackled the same territory. To be fair, it was not so much the narration of events that struck me as dishonest, but the characterizations.

However, by the end of the book, I found more reasons to dislike it than I did to like it.#1. Yes, as many others have said, it was supremely depressing. I can tolerate a lot of depressing literature as long as there are small victories, or occasional heartwarming lessons, or true humor toward the situation, but I found none of that with this book. I'm not sure what had others \\"roaring with laughter.\\" The most I could find were tiny oddities and ironies that could render no more than a smirk.#2. Can you really win a Pulizer with that many references to masturbation? I really could have done wihout that.#3. This was the most disappointing of all. I realize that it was an autobiography, and, therefore, isn't supposed to have a regular plot, but it did need some form of resolution. After reading a novel, one shouldn't have to read the sequel to find out the ending. Perhaps a good editor could have helped Mr. McCourt cut away some of the the masturbation so that he had room to finish the story."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I could not believe how fast I received this book.

Thank you"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is a touching portayel of McCourts &quot;miserable Irish Catholic Childhood&quot;. It is the sad story of growing poor in Ireland. McCourt overcomes his father leaving him, starving, and constantly being in the hospital for illness. McCourt is a vivid writer and describes his childhood graphically. Overall a good book with many memorable moments."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"\\"When I look back on my childhood, I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: The happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\\" Experiencing this life of Frank McCourt through the novel Angela's Ashes was fascinating. McCourt's perception of events and people was amusing and clever. It was especially interesting seeing what the world and its actions appeared to be to Frank McCourt. In a memoir, like any piece of writing, it's important to have an opening sentence that intrigues the reader and is interesting. Frank McCourt definitely accomplished that. He begins the book with the sentence: \\"My mother and father should have stayed in New York where they met and married and where I was born.\\" This leaves the reader with the question, why. Why should they have stayed in New York? What was it about where they moved that was so bad? Where did they move? In order to receive answers for these questions, you have to read on. By the time you receive answers, you are hooked on the book and most definitely will continue reading. It's also important to establish a clear setting so the reader can picture where the action is happening. I had a remarkably clear image in my mind of his many houses. I could also almost feel what it might have been like to be in the house, what the mood was. This is as important as being able to clearly see the setting. The one thing Frank McCourt lacked when he wrote this novel was knowing how to end his story. There were a lot of extra stories that he told towards the end of the book that made it go on just a little to long. The actual ending, the last thing that happened, was quite good, however. Angela's Ashes was an entertaining telling of McCourt's difficult childhood. Although it was a miserable Irish Catholic childhood, McCourt did survive it and retold it with wit and sincerity."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Obviously, and rather slyly, Frank McCourt informs us that reading about a happy childhood isn't worth our time. Geez, with all the hype about the misery portrayed in the book, I would have expected the majority of McCourt children to be have been wiped out. Instead, the grim reaper gets only 3 out of 7, and the reader feels cheated. Okay, maybe not that cheated.So, McCourt's memoir treats us to 360+ pages of misery. Starvation. Desperation. Drunkenness. Classism. It would all be pretty unbearable, except that there's the sly humour poking out here and there. Can we really trust Frank? He knows that the more miserable he can make his life the more credibility he has.He treats us to a variety of scenes, many of which we've seen before, in, oh, Oliver Twist, Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All, Rachel and Her Children. It's all very fresh though. I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt -- either his life was appallingly miserable, with enough Irish charm and humour to make up for the lack of nutritious sustenance; or McCourt himself has enough charm and humour to repackage a few dozen literary cliches as a tragic but uplifting memoir.Either way, I'm never touching a Guiness ever again. And I'll probably finish 'Tis pretty soon. And I'll still dock McCourt for failing to use quotation marks -- an annoying device that fails to communicate anything worth the reading confusion it causes."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"How many reviewers here have exclaimed that they could not put this book down, how much it affected them, and yet gave it less than 5 stars? I don't understand! No, Mr. McCourt does not write in the prose of Shakespeare, nor is he a scientific storyteller ala Isaac Asimov. But, even better, Frank McCourt has his own voice. Is that why a reviewer would give it less than 5 stars? Whatever the reasons I think it's undeserved. The honest, lyrical voice of Frank McCourt was as refreshing to my psyche as when I first discovered Kurt Vonnegut Jr, and I could not put &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; down.It isn't often a book comes along that compels you to forfeit sleep because you are lost in the author's world: &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is such a book. It isn't often that a book will make you laugh out loud and squeeze tears from your eyes within the same paragraph: &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is such a book. Few writers could create a book that is as much about childhood as the bleakness the child survives: Frank McCourt is such a writer.Mr. McCourt has written a classic memoir that will, I believe, remain timeless. He deserves every accolade he receives, not because of what he went through but because of the engrossing, enlightening, gut-wrenchingly honest writing that has sprung from his old soul. McCourt has taken a life of poverty, pain, humor, guilt, and yearning, and given it as a gift to the world.And for that we are all surely the better for it."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"What a depressing yet uplifting tale told from the eldest childs perspective (Mr Frank McCourt) narrating his families harrowing life in hilarious detail while growing up in Limerick, Ireland.Dispite their tragic circumstances, Frank and his brother (I hesitate to use family, youll see why when you read this excellent story for yourself! ) manage to rise above it all using humour and streetwise intelligence to see them through.

But Frank McCourt describes poverty beyond imagination; unfortunately a painfully true story. Day after day he and his family went without food, without heat, without decent clothing, without a bathroom.It takes courage to write a memior - one is under scrutiny not only for their writing style (McCourt's is wonderful!) but also for their own actions through life.McCourt manages to describe his life with dignity when it would seem there was none to be found. When he steals food to survive, it is in desperation, and yet with dignity, and we are convinced he did the right thing.We need to remember that there is still too much poverty and hunger in the world.

His story begins in Brooklyn during the time of the Depression. His recent immigrant parents, Angela and Malachy, force Frank to take care of his younger siblings, and watch them die. He must be his mother's strength as she waits for her drunken husband to come home every night without food. Little Frank continues to have hope as he his family moves to his parent's homeland of Ireland. As his dreams of a rich life in his new home diminish due to his father's continual drunkenness, he is able to find optimism in his father's tales of Cuchulian, an ancient heroic Irishman who saved his country. Every week Angela is forced to beg to a council for food and clothing. Because of the overwhelming poverty in their small town Frank learns to live with shoes repaired with tires, a pig's head for Christmas dinner, and having to take two jobs to provide for his family.This book is recommended because of the genius of Frank McCourt's writing. He is able to capture the essence of a poor Irishman's life with humor, satire, and strife, while at the same time telling a touching story. As he writes of his everyday life the accents and culture of the Irish can be felt. McCourt also brings out diverse emotions, from laughing at his father who would make him wake up at all hours of the night to sing about his \\"Pride for Ireland\\" to crying as Malachy holds his dead daughter in his arms due to lack of medical attention. This book also opens one's eyes to the life of poverty, and the obstacles that must be overcome in order to survive. Before reading this account, I was never aware of the struggles that people must go through if they do not have money. The fact that Angela is forced to get down on her hands and knees and had to beg for money to go to the doctor is preposterous. I was educated and my eyes were opened to a whole new world as I read the horrific details of having to live in solely the upstairs of a house because of flooding on the first floor of the poorest lane in Limerick, Ireland.While this book is entertaining and heartfelt, it is also incredibly depressing. Learning about the grim realities of Frank McCourt's childhood is extremely difficult. I often would have to put the book down because of the intense sadness that came through the details of his life. Particularly memorable was Frank's description of the extra jobs he is forced to take in order to provide for him and his family. The fact that the McCourts are forced to plead for boots three sizes too big, and scrounge for the next meal is sickening and extremely sad. Reading about the hunger they were forced to go through because of a father's addiction really stings the heart.Angela's Ashes makes me realize how petty the obstacles are in my life, and how inspiring Frank McCourt is to have survived such a life, and then to go on and win a Pulitzer Prize. When anyone is feeling sorry for himself he should pick up this book, and realize how fortunate most of us really are. This memoir is a superb portrayal of the difficult life uneducated poor people lead in order to survive, while at the same time providing insight into the Irish culture, and creating a moving, earnest story."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The basic problem with it is that while McCourt's life of poverty in Ireland is interesting and there are a couple of dozen well written passages and anecdotes, the work is atrociously edited. All the more galling for the lack of good editing is that this was McCourt's first book- he needed the help. The book is about 450 pages long and the 1st 300 pages deal with his first 6 or so years of growing up. We get the same images of infant death, Irish blarney, drunken dad, suffering mom, stalwart Frankie, and colorful Eriniana. The problem is that early childhood is necessarily the least interesting part of a life because a) the percentage of real memories per year is very low and b) the remembered is rarely cogitated upon enough to produce any coherent thesis of its import or meaning to a life.At describing these things McCourt is excellent. The scene of him and his brother getting bananas from a vendor in Brooklyn and his mom thinking he stole them is excellent, BUT such only works its charms once. After about 50 pages we get the idea already: McCourt's early life was bleak- it's as if he wants us to really, really know he suffered. The opening page or so at first read seems to poke fun at the Irish habit of bemoaning their woes, but it quickly becomes apparent that McCourt intended no irony in its felicitous prose. He truly wants the reader to know the Irish suffering is on par with that of Jews, blacks, and American Indians. By going on for 300 pages with this the reader starts to turn off about a third of the way though, then skimming between the Godotvian feeling anecdotes of misery.Things only pick up when Frank reaches his teens- he gets various employment, has a falling out with his mom and her lover, rues his dad's departure, loses his virginity to a consumptive girl who dies, then heads off for America. There are many moving images and wonderfully non-stereotyped characters. The scenes with his tubercular lover are priceless, yet their whole affair is accorded a mere couple of pages vis-&agrave;-vis the dozens allotted the repetitious sufferings. A good editor would have told McCourt he had an intriguing 1st draft, but told him to cut the early years down to 100 pages, and double the teen tales to 300 pages. That 400 page edition of AA would have deserved all the acclaim the canonical edition has, while also being over 10% leaner.This is the main reason why the film version of the book is actually better than the written version. That said, it's far from a great film, but it more judiciously accords the interesting portions of McCourt's life, with about the film on the early years, and the rest on the teen years. As a writer I've often said that the poor practices of editors, publishers, and critics have had a disproportionately deleterious effect on contemporary literature. A bad editor either does not realize a gem that falls in their lap, passes on it, or butchers it, or they get a diamond in the rough, like AA, but have not the sense nor insight to demand the necessary revisions. Toni Morrison has made a career out of having her ill-edited novels published. Yes, she's gotten acclaim, but once dead her trip to the canon will be fruitless because the poor editing of her work will become ok to speak of. But, McCourt was not Morrison- he was a first time author- his editor should have done a better job."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I could hardly put this book down when I started reading it. A wonderfully crafted memoir of an Irish family living in poverty, Angela's Ashes is funny, charming and depressing all in one."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"As someone who spent the majority of his formative childhood living within the realms of a struggling blue-collar Irish-American Catholic neighborhood housing project, much of the atmosphere and flavor so memorably and powerfully described in this best-selling memoir seems like familiar territory, from the hard-drinking and somewhat remote and indifferent fathers to the sainted mothers, from the raucous black humor to the spasms of terrible drama and tragedy, often visited on helplessly impoverished children. Yet Frank McCourt manages to display a unusually colorful and quite unique descriptive power to the florid retelling of this life lived under conditions of extreme privation and misery, a life which he largely describes in terms so dismal, dark and devoid of hope that it is remarkable to witness the degree of grace, resilience, and good humor that he so often brings to bear. It is this most prominent feature of his creative writing that gives such a powerful testimony to his ability as a writer.Like James Joyce's personal glimpses into Irish lives in his classic series of short stories, \\"The Dubliners\\", McCourt evokes the suffocating and smarmy atmosphere of flagrant poverty, to the point that I often found the story difficult to read. Thus, regardless of how well he illustrates the ways in which he and his family struggled to overcome the circumstances, it was, for me at least, often difficult reading. For any of us who have actually lived under such circumstances of privation, these powerfully drawn recollections can be challenging and painful to recall. And while I would never suggest that my own experiences approach the extremes of want and squalor described herein, I took a long time to finally work my way into the portions of the book where the McCourt brothers finally triumph based on their American citizenry. While the tone of the memoir is sometimes downbeat and sullen, the progress of these two young pilgrims toward a life of greater promise is one that gains ballast as we progress toward the end.The memoir is, as one has come to expect, full of the usual Irish complaints, from the egregious and often outrageous alcoholism of the father and Irish men in general to the full McCourt treatment regarding the so-called Irish troubles and the unmitigated perfidy of the dreaded English. Having heard all this throughout my fifty years, it finally becomes tiresome, boring and irrelevant to hear all the highly polished and crudely embellished litanies again and again here. We who are either Irish or of Irish ancestry must learn to live with what we have, to do the best we can to make the most of what we find our existential circumstances may be, and I for one would hope that the reading of books like this, books which faithfully chronicle the consequences of all the particulars of traditional Irish working class culture, would act to mollify the most extreme of these conditions and save the next generation of young Irish men and women from its manifest dysfunctions."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Writing a good memoir is very hard to do. This one is phenomenal. And while many sad things happen in this book, it is not truly a sad book, because McCourt is not a sad person; he is the archetypal story teller, and he has a basket-full of stories. This book is a treasure."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I picked up Angela's Ashes with some dread. It sounded, and looked, like it would be too depressing to read. However, though many terrible things happen, through Frank's eyes, it is all readable. This book is written so eloquently and with such fine execution that you wonder how Frank can recall so many emotions from his childhood. McCourt captures the essence of childhood in an extraordinary manner. Sometimes the descriptions were so true that I found myself brought to tears at childhood memories that I had forgotten. While the subject matter isn't the easiest to deal with, the way McCourt writes the novel makes it palatable. I don't know if I could have stuck with it under most circumstances. However, McCourt is a pure genius, and there are even some quite comedic scenes in this masterpiece. My recommendation: A must read."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is a true story about a boy named Frank McCourt. The story is about his life in Ireland and America. Words can't describe how much pain and poverty Frank's family suffered. It's amazing and wonderful that Frank is still alive to tell it. This book is sad, but also funny. Frank has to watch three of his siblings die, but also is able to watch three of them grow up. His father leaves him, his mother, and brothers without any money. Luckily Franks old enough to get a job. This book tells how him and his family manages with their misfortunes. I really liked this book because it makes you grateful for what you have."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"ANGELA'S ASHES is the memoirs of Frank Mccourt and the recollections of his childhood spent in Ireland. The story is told from the viewpoint of young Francis Mccourt, from the young age of about 5 or 6 til he hits the age of 19, and we see him age before our eyes as the writing style changes from chapter to chapter.Frank's mother is Angela, and she suffers daily trying to keep her children fed and clothed, trying to make ends meet because her husband is so lazy and full of drink that she can never depend on him to do a full day's work for pay. And when Malachy McCourt does get paid, he ends up at the local taverns and pubs, drinking his weekly pay. Angela has to resort to finding the odd job, or worse yet, to begging at the welfare offices.Frank and his family start out life in America, but move to Ireland to escape the poverty they knew in America, thinking they would find a better life in Ireland. They were wrong. The McCourts live a life of extreme poverty in their new homeland, but the book is told in the voice of someone who sees life in a different light. You want to laugh with Frank when he describes the terrible conditions they live in - an entire section alone was devoted to the stinking toilet that they had to share with the rest of the neighborhood. It was a hard life for them all, but from the tone of young Francis, the reader does not always get that impreession. All he and his family knew was poverty, and they existed in this way as best they could.ANGELA'S ASHES won the PulitZer Prize and it was well deserved. Frank Mccourt's masterpiece on life in Ireland told in the voice of a young Irish American boy is haunting yet real. It's a serious book, but the tone is light-hearted. The spirit of young Francis McCourt shines through each page, and you root for him when he inches his way toward his goal: to buy a ticket to America."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is one of the best books I have ever read. I alternated between crying and laughing out loud. Frank McCourt's use of language is instrumental to the story. Rarely does a book &quot;read&quot; like it is meant to &quot;sound,&quot; but McCourt practically had me speaking with a Limerick accent by the time I was finished reading.McCourt's ability to speak the truth from a young boy's perspective is also uncanny. We are as bewildered as he by the hypocrisy shown by childhood authority figures, the education system, and the Church. The beauty though, is in his ability to get past it all. Angela's Ashes is ultimately a story of survival.Parents of young children beware. The first 100 pages are heart wrenching. I caught myself checking on my children during the middle of the night and thanking God for antibiotics."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I chose to read Angela's Ashes for a school assignment because my older sister recommended it to me. Before I checked out this book, my high school literature teacher warned me that I would need to keep a box of tissues close while I read it. She was absolutely right.In this memoir, Frank McCourt tells the story of his childhood. The book begins in New York where Frank lives with his depressed mother, Angela, his drunken father, Malachy, and his younger brothers, Malachy, Oliver and Eugene. After Frank's baby sister, Margaret, dies, the family goes back to Ireland, their home country. The McCourt family lives in a poverty-stricken neighborhood. They rarely have money to buy food or pay the rent because Frank's alcoholic father always drinks his wages. This book tells the hardships and tragedies of the McCourt family and the desperate measures that had to be executed as they struggled to survive.Angela's Ashes is truly unique because of the way it is written. Frank McCourt creatively wrote his memoir without the use of dialogue in quotations. Instead, he wrote everything in paragraph form. This style of writing stunned me. At first I was confused, and it took some time to get used to it. As I read more and more of the book, I grew to appreciate Frank McCourt's individualistic writing that I found was often humorous.Many book reviewers on Amazon dislike Angela's Ashes because it has a repetitive storyline and is overly depressing. Truthfully, I thought the same exact thing while I was reading it. However, I realized that the element of tragedy is what makes this book successful. Angela's Ashes made me realize that life is not always easy and how important it is to remain positive even through the toughest times. Angela's Ashes is an excellent read."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This memoir of young Frank is written in the most accurate, detailed, and stunning way an author can relate to his reader.

The viewpoints of Frank living as a Catholic, poor, and the oldest of his family is completely realistic, as he writes from the mind of a older child. Excellent dialog, phenomenal imagery, accurate details, and this book can be read again and again to learn of the human experience. This book has stood its test of time and will continue to be a great read forever. Absolutely epic book."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I honestly can't imagine how anyone could give this amazing book less than 5 stars.

This is a book that is full of sadness, but the sadness is intertwined with immense humor, hope, love, and some of the best storytelling you will find.This is a book that will stay with you long, long after you finish it. Highly, highly recommended for all except those who can't handle a book with sadness."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Written with verve and plenty of style, plus inundated with a lot of dark humour. This is a modern Dickens-like autobiography of poverty first in New York and then in Ireland. This is no sociological study and there is little self-pathos - thankfully. Much of their poverty would have been alleviated if their father was not drowning in pubs. If there is anyone despicable in this story it is Frank's father - a man who father's children with no moral rectitude for their upbringing. But the remainder of the family battle onward and not necessarily upward - at the end the author is back in New York with a new life to begin.All the characters are colourfully depicted. The poverty, more so at the beginning, is rather unrelenting. When the author enters school his world begins to diversify. Some of the anecdotes (particularly the sexual ones) do seem apocryphal.In Ireland, as one character narrates, the Irish dancing style is akin to having a \`pole up your arse'. This restrictive dancing becomes a metaphor for the country which is plagued by tribalism and Catholic indoctrination. Fortunately the author sees beyond this limited horizon and we have a magnificent story."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The trials of the Mc Court family were nothing to laugh at but I often found myself trying very hard to suppress laughter while reading.

If not for the \\"brogue\\", his story is not that different than what many of us go through growing up poor, and that includes many of us who are born and raised here."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Anyone who has an interest into the struggle of the Irish nation ought to read this book. I never knew much about it, although I know that extreme poverty was a reason for so many Irish people to leave their homeland for America. But I never realized how bad the situation was. I became aware of this book when I read in the newspaper that Frank McCourt had died and I read his obituary. The book was available at Amazon in a large print which was extremely important to me."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I really enjoyed this book!! It had been on my \\"to-read\\" list for awhile; and the passing of Frank McCourt earlier this year reminded me that I wanted to read it. I am very glad that I did! Yes, the book was a tad repetetive (drunk dad drinks away family's money, leaves, repeat); but I was still engagaged the entire read. Yes, the writing was nothing spectacular; but that helped to create the feeling that you were witnessing the story through the eyes of a child. Many reviewers called the book depressing. While McCourt no doubt had a difficult childhood, I did not find the book depressing at all. McCourt frequently injects humor into the story; and there were multiple instances when the goodness of humanity shined through amidst the poverty and despair.As a teacher, I think that this book could be used in a high school literature class (or even history class...I learned a lot about Irish and Irish-Catholic history from reading this book). The language is accessible to younger readers, but the themes become more mature as McCourt passes through adolescence. It would also be an interesting book club pick. Many interesting discussions could be had about coming of age, poverty, politics, family, and resilience.I wavered between four and five stars. I ultimately chose four, as the writing itself was not five star quality, and I wished some of the characters had been more fully developed. A recommended book nonetheless!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A sad yet humorous memoir of Irish childhood... Frank McCourt gives a no-holds-barred account of growing up in a family riddled with domestic tragedy - dead siblings, poverty, drunkard good-for-nothing father who drinks his dole money while his children starve, desperate and helpless mother, less-than-sympathetic aunt and grandma - amid tyrannical schoolmasters and the ever-oppressive Catholic priests in the background.But to pare the cast that informs McCourt's growing years down simplistically to stock-characters is to do injustice to the at-times dual nature evident in the true-to-life personalities one encounters in real life.The following lines reveals his contradictory feelings he has about his father, which also provides a glimpse of the heartbreakingly innocent perspective McCourt employs in his narrative:'I think my father is like the Holy Trinity with three people in him, the one in the morning with the paper, the one at night with the stories and the prayers, and then the one who does the bad thing and comes home with the smell of whiskey and wants us to die for Ireland.'Rough-hewn honesty that will touch the most-hard-hearted and cynical among us."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"5/19 Frank McCourt is in a life-or-death battle with cancer, according to the site IrishCentral.comhttp://www.irishcentral.com/news/Angelas-Ashes-author-in-life-or-death-cancer-battle-45346397.html"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Many times as I was reading this book, I wanted to put it down. Angela's Ashes is not a happy story. In fact, the abject poverty, squalor, desperation and death make it downright depressing. But it is masterfully told. McCourt's first person writing style is real, genuine and so you feel along with the protagonist: abandonment, disappointment, shame, grief, anger, betrayal but also hope and joy and pleasure in the simplest things. The turning point is when Frank finally decides to forget about his father, a drunk who abandons his family, and become a man. The story becomes more poignant as we watch Frank struggle to transform himself. As the story ends, though, the reader gets a sense that life is going to be better (the protagonist finally makes it back to America after scrimping and scrounging and working his \\"arse\\" off to pay the fare. He feels in America he'll be able to do great things and the reader hopes so much that \\"'tis\\".*"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"What stains and is a lifeless form? An ash. In Angela's Ashes, there were many ashes scattered in the form of tragedies. Life as it was in the Irish Catholic community of Limerick was extremly harsh in the 1930's. It was particularly cruel to the impoverished as it was for the McCourts.This unforgettable story was written though the eyes of Frank McCourt, the oldest son of the family who depicted the squalid conditions he and his family had to endure. He describes his family that journeys through misfortune and overcomes incredible odds. The ashes that are left behind include losing two twin brothers and a baby sister to typhoid fever. The permanency of the dark ash comes out very clearly as the young Frankie attempts in becoming a man at the tender age of ten when he comes to the realization that his dad is a hopeless drunkard incapable of supporting the family. More ashes cover Frank McCourt's essence as he watches his mother Angela, beg on the streets, turn to antagonizing relatives and surrender her body to an abusive man in order to ensure the survival of her children.No better example of resiliency of the human heart is conveyed than in this true story of Angela's Ashes. A story that takes you through the anguish pains of motherhood, the humiliation of being without basic needs, the mysteries behind the religious rituals, but most important of all is attaining the dream of a young writer."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is an all around emotional autobiography. The author, Frank McCourt, gives the reader a deep inside view of what his childhood was. He describes life in Ireland during the depression.Almost immediately after the book begins, feelings of grief, sadness, and lament start to flow through the reader's mind. As Frank McCourt describes the hardship and struggles he experienced, suck as extreme poverty, a drunken, careless father, deaths of young siblings, and lack of food, the reader is led to a dead end of feelings of depression. Nevertheless, reading this beautifully written story of a poverty stricken Irish family in the midst of the depression, the reader understands and realizes truths that may be taken for granted in life.Despite the depressing subject matter of the story, it's quite uplifting, as in the end, Frankie fulfills his goal and earns enough money to move back to America, where he was born. He has to begin working at a very young age to support his family after his father deserts them, when he at last reaches the age of 19, he finally puts enough money aside for himself and is able to return to America.I would highly recommend this book to others. I feel that it allows one to feel better about life even though it may be full of suffering. It shows how important family is and how we humans should care about others."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I am always leary of books showered with awards and praise. In this case, it is not just well deserved but I must add my own. This is one of the best books I have ever read. It works on every level. Interestingly, the book starts off almost with a dare. A kind of you think you had it rough growing up? Mr McCourt then uses the language of a child to describe his childhood in the slums of Limerick, Ireland among the poorest of the poor. Without a hint of self-pity he describes in crystal clear detail the sights, sounds, and smells of heartbreaking poverty. But with every sadness, there is laughter. Sometimes he seems to be revealing another layer of the human condition on every page. His compassion, his chicanery, and his remarkable use of the English language make you feel as though you are reading not just a fresh novel, but an entirely new insight on life. Missing your morning meeting, getting a flat, etc. will forever be placed in their true perspective. This book is what literature is all about."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a classic book. Having roots in Ireland, I was instantly interested in reading this book. It actually took me about 6 months to read it becuse I had to stop reading it every time I had a book assigned for school. It is very sad, but at the same time, very enlightning. It's amazing how Frank found happiness in the smallest things. This book made me cry, it made me laugh, and it made me proud of my heritage. Frank Mccourt, I commend you."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is funny from beginning to end and makes you appreciate what you've got. I've never read of such destitute poverty before, but still laughed all the way through, which is a testament to McCourt's writing.

I couldn't put it down for the suspence of what was going to happen next.

The factual book made me realise how hard it was during the war with so little to eat and so little to survive on. I would recomend this book to anyone who is willing to read a true story which is full of emotion and poverty. An excellent book, highly rated!!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Through the eyes of a child. Frank McCourt's New York Times best seller is one of the most vivid and beautiful books ever written. His way of writing from an innocent boy to a teenager is so appealing and so brilliant. This book is the story of Frank McCourt, who was born to an alcoholic father and depressed young mother in the Depression in New York. His earliest memories are in New York where his brothers, Malachy and the twins Oliver and Eugene were born along with his sister, Margaret. After the death of the infant Margaret, the McCourts move to Limerick, Ireland, Frank's mother's hometown. There he experiences more deaths and more births along with rude Catholics, a mean aunt, strict teachers, an uncle who works in the coal factory (therefore his face is always black) and fleas. Hilarious compared to its darkness, this book deserves more than five stars."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt is an artist: his medium is language; his pallet is the world. In the sense of being a true artisan, McCourt has recreated his life as a poor child growing up in Ireland with a realism that is unparalleled. Assisted by an amazing survival story, McCourt uses a style of writing that brings you right into the shoes of little Frankie. McCourt is masterful at evoking the gambit of emotions from the reader. He implants in the reader a seed of hope-the hope that Frankie will be able to overcome the adversity that he meets almost every day of your life.This book gets put down once-when you are done. Highly recommended for any reader."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"How I admire Frank McCourt's ability to have gained such character through such incredible adversity.

For 3 days all I talked about was this book. In spite of the stark sparcity in Frank McCourts childhood, he was indeed a very rich boy. My heart ached as his childhood story unfolded, yet his unique way of looking at things through a childs eyes and his humor was what made this book hard to put down. Angela's Ashes tempted me to look at the content of my own heart and challenged me to become a better person as a result. Thank you Frank McCourt."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Okay, you know from the numerous reviews and comments that this is an autobiographical tale about a boy, born of Irish parents in America, yet reared (if it can be called that) in Ireland. There is much in this book that will sadden and anger you. In fact, you mightn't think that a story about a boy and his family living in a state of squalor in the generally cheerless environment of wet and gloomy Limerick would be much fun to read about, or to laugh about for that matter. But the author makes it not only readable but engaging and entertaining, with healthy portions of humor, sardonic, irreverent or otherwise, laced throughout. That Frank McCourt can actually make the reader chuckle, considering the bleak subject matter is remarkable, but also remarkable is the story itself, one that almost screams to be made into a movie. Of course it has but I haven't seen it and, to be truthful, I'm kind of scared to; judging from some of the reviews I've read, I'm afraid it may spoil the book."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes dragged me through the poorest streets of Ireland and I laughed through my tears the entire trip. I found the book very hard to read at first as I've never experienced Frank McCourt's writing style before. But I heard his distinct brogue and it comforted me and made me continue trekking through his often times difficult dialouge. In the end I was tortured that the book had ended but the story hadn't.Angela's Ashes is unlike any other story I've read, fiction or non-fiction. It's hard at times to believe it is an autobiography. Surely no one could have survived such a childhood.This book is a must read for anyone even remotely Irish - and all who wonder just how poverty affects our youngest citizens."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Mr.McCourt walks us through his life of extreme poverty,without any &quot;light at the end of the tunnel&quot; and yet,he prevailed.

But this beautifully written story opened my eyes to understand why my parents and grandparents behaved the way they did, where Catholicism is not just part of their lives; it IS life. This book was enlightening on a personal level.To those who don't share the McCourts' background, there is still something to be gained by this book. It is a poignant story of survival. Frank McCourt never once takes pity upon himself; he shares the the strength of his mother, determined to do whatever necessary to get by, without the &quot;you owe it to me&quot; attitude. Told with a humorous tone, Frank, the true survivor does not become the stereotypical Irish male drunk, but had his mother's obstinance and one track mind of survival.He observes the fanatical devotion of his family and neighbors to the Catholic church, probably the one driving force that gave these pitiful families a purpose and reason to continue living. He conveys the same confusion and questions many other Irish Catholic children, but offers no answers, as we've learned there are none.Frank McCourt is another great Irish writer."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Living in today's American society, one tends to forget what life was like for many of our immigrants before they came to this country.

But here in the office, the book was brought up as being depressing etc. So I read it. I think being Irish definately helped this reader grasp the total enormity of what the McCourts went through. It is sad to think that some (very very few) families went through this in Ireland all those years ago. His father was an alcoholic and that is the end of it all. Having gone to College in Limerick, Ireland I can relate to the areas in his book. Limerick was a totally depressing city built totally of red brick and when it rains the whole city takes on a look of sheer gloom and depression. The McCourts should have stayed in the States. They would have survived and lived a better life. But that Irish stubborn streak shone through to return to the home shores, where we would be amongst our own. I found the book to be humorous more that that of total depression. But it all stemmed from the scourge of the plight of many of the Irish males DRINK.

You laugh as he gets &quot;the exitement&quot; on the green couch and hurt for him as he is on his knees in front of St. Francis for even getting &quot;the exitement.&quot; This book is for certain, deserving of the Pulitzer it was awarded.

In pubs, steam rose from damp bodies and garments to be inhaled with cigarette and pipe smoke laced with the stale fumes and spilled stout and whiskey and tinged with the odor of pee wafting in from the outdoor jakes where many man puked out his weekly wages.\\" (p. 12)Angela's Ashes begins in Brooklyn, NY where Frank McCourt was born to Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan. His parents were both Irish immigrants. Frank McCourt writes about his very early childhood stories in New York such as when his family had to sleep in a. Frank, along with his three brothers, his sister, and his Mom and Dad, soon move to the slums of Limerick, Ireland, in hopes of finding a better life back home as well as a well earning job.Life wasn't nearly as easy as they expected back in Ireland. Frank's mother Angela, a depressed mother, has little money to feed her children. Frank's father, Malachy, rarely worked because of his drinking problem. When Malachy finds a job, he immediately drinks his weekly wages away. Frank and his family have to survive and live through appalling and dire living conditions. They are forced to live in a flat so miserable that every year Frank's family had to pack themselves into one upstairs room when even the winter floods made the first floor unlivable. \\"The upstairs room was \\"Italy\\" because it was warm and dry and downstairs was Ireland, for it was wet and cold.\\" (p. 96)Though life may have been depressing for Frank's family, Frank finds humor in his miserable daily life. The book follows Frank McCourt through the pre-mature deaths of his brothers and a sister, his depressed mother, and the sacrifices she makes to feed and shelter her family. It also highlights his adventures with his Catholic school friends, and at his Catholic school brought on by a strict teacher who convinced him of damnation if he did not perfectly behave. Angela's Ashes highlights a number of jobs that Frank has to help aid his family upon the departure of an alcohol-enslaved father, such as working for a poor Englishman who is handicapped, and finally his own departure to start a life of his own back in America.\\" When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood; the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic Childhood.\\" (p. 11)The answer is clear how Frank McCourt survived through his childhood. Frank McCourt finds humor through everyday life. Although Frank shows anger towards his father many times throughout the book, he loved to hear his father's stories. Frank lived to hear his father's tales of the Angel on the Seventh step, which brings his mother's babies and Cuchulain, the hero who saved Ireland.Frank McCourt tells his story honest and realistically. Though there isn't a clear climax, after Frank is dropped from his current job, he has to beg for any food or money he can obtain. Frank is near starvation, he is cold, has no shelter, and even catches typhoid fever. But Frank's dream of moving to America is not ruined because of his near-death situation. Will Frank ever be able to live a healthy life back in America?Unlike other biographies or non-fiction books I have read, Frank McCourt right his story as it was. Proper English isAngela's Ashes is by far the best book I have ever read. Though Frank McCourt may have had a distressing childhood, he uplifted the book with his unique and enjoyable humor. His writing is hilarious. I chuckled at even the little things. Frank described his threats of eternal damnation because of the naughty things he thought of in his boyhood. I was uplifted by Frank's hopeful perspective of life and his funny little anecdotes of his childhood. My favorite anecdote was when Frank and his brother try on their parent's fake teeth, and Franks brother get sent to the hospital to get the removed. The ending of the book was not as captivating as the rest of the book. It was long and tedious as it described Frank's job as a telegram deliver.Frank McCourt shares with his readers an honest, vividly detailed, and humorous memoir of his childhood. This is a fascinating book that I would recommend for ages 13- through adulthood. As I finished the book with an uplifted spirit, I was blown away by the reality of what it was like growing up in Irish Catholic poverty. It definitely taught any reader to not take things for granted. Angela's Ashes is truly an incredible and marvelous book."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is by far the most deeply depressing book I have ever read. Every page I read makes me thankful that I have a warm place to live and good food to eat. I think that this is the reason I liked this book as much as I did.In the beginning chapter, Frank gave a short summery of his family's sad and morbid history. He then ventured into the meeting of his parents and his birth. This is where you start to get a sense of the sadness and depravity that he experienced though his life. This feeling lingers for the remainder of the story.Death within his family frequently occurred through out his childhood. Most of his siblings die because of mal nutrition. The reader gets the feeling that Frank doesn't understand the death of his only sister and the twins. This is another aspect that I like about McCort's writing style. He writes as if he is the character, and is at the same comprehension level.With every chapter there is a sad aspect and with every uplifting moment there is a downfall. I don't think that Frank at that age understood his father's addition, which made it harder for him to see the reason his life was like it was. He was constantly trying to impress or get approval from his family, and especially from his father. This made it even harder to see him fail at most of the things he tried to do, like being an usher for example. The only times I saw a least bit of happiness in his story was when he was ill with typhoid and his father kissed him on the head and told Frank that he loved him. The other was when he saved enough money to go back to America, where the book came to a close.This book was a tragic and really showed the audience what it was to live in the great depression as a poverty stricken young boy, and actually survive it. The book was descriptive and realistic, as was his life. This is why I give this book four stars."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes has certainly lived up to it's quickly established good reputation. From the very first page, McCourt grabs you with his poor Irish mother bearing him in America during the Depression and doesn't let go until age 19. Even then you're left curious about where his life will lead. After the sad death of Frank's baby sister due to lack of nurishment and warmth, his mother, Angela and father Malachy, bring him and his three brothers to there homeland in hopes of a better life. Life in Ireland is full of sickness and hard times for the McCourts. Through out the book you follow Frank's life of being a poor Irish kid with an American accent. School's rough, home is rough, and work is rough. So, by age 16, Frank's goal is to raise enough money to go back to America and later on send for his family. By the end of the book every reader will surly have their fingers crossed in hopes that he'll make it. This is a book that will tug at any age of heart and come alive for any reader's mind. Angela's Ashes gets my total recomendation. It's a great read."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I am the daughter of an Irish-American who was born in the U.S. during the mid-twenties. Admittedly, I read this book because it was a best-seller, but after reading just the first paragraph, I knew I had to read it. Not only did this book give me some insight into the reality of poverty (from which I've been spared, thank God), but it gave me a great understanding of my father. I brought up and read various passages from the book to my father and he couldn't have agreed more whole-heartedly. Besides enjoying the biography itself, I enjoyed Mr. McCourt's writing style. I've never come across such a way of writing; it was quite intriguing. I disagree with the 3-star reviewer about the lack of thought on McCourt's part as a teenager. When a person grows up in a certain milieu, why should one question it? As was stated in the book, one just didn't ask questions of ANYONE that wasn't a peer. Nowadays, we offer greater diversity in schools and a chance for questions by all students, so we see the disparity very clearly, almost painfully. I haven't read 'Tis yet, but I am sure Mr. McCourt will be sharing his thoughts one life and how it can be different."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"There are a number of words that might describe this wonderful book - haunting, beautiful, lyrical, tragic, sad, funny and loving. Frank McCourt grew up in Limerick in the kind of poverty that is unimaginable in the present day and yet survived to tell the tale of his useless drunken Protestant looking father with the odd way about him and his neglected, lazy, anxious and bewildered mother who picked coal off the road and begged for food and slept with the landlord to pay the rent with love, affection and, above all, unvarnished truth and supreme wit. Told through a child's voice, sparing no feelings on any side,including his own, this is a book that is so beautifully written and so hard to put down that you will find yourself laughing and crying until the early hours of the morning. Unforgettable."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I was hooked from the first page! I am usually a stickler for grammar and punctuation, but in this book lack of such WORKS! He has written the book in such a way that you can almost hear the characters. What is amazing to me is that a man of his age remembers so clearly, not only the things that happened TO &amp; AROUND him, but the WAY A CHILD THINKS! Some readers seem to think that he has embellished and that it is not possible to remember things from the age of 3 or 4. This may be so for most with ordinary childhoods, but I know from experience that when your circumstances are EXTREME, the feelings are still very real even years later.Thank God most of us do not have to endure such hunger, dispair, and hopelessness! To the readers who couldn't take READING it, imagine LIVING IT! Nothing but tea and bread on most days, and that's if they were lucky! How did they ever make it to adulthood? I think we all need to remember that this is no novel, but a real account. There are many people right now who do live in overwhelming poverty, the likes of which most Americans cannot even comprehend. Too bad there is not always a ray of sunshine to lighten things-but in real life IT JUST AIN'T SO!The subject matter was grim and sad, but there is just a bit of light humor to keep it from being overwhelmingly depressing. However, I did finally break down weeping at the same time Frank does in the book. 'Tis surely a gifted writer who can make the reader feel exactly what he does!I am going to buy 'TIS today!

The writing is not that great and it is boring and repetitive.

A deserved winner of the Pulitzer and easily the best book I have read this year!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I received this book for Christmas and did not get around to reading it until this week, while on a plane. I am a guy in my 30's, and there was an event within the first hundred pages that got me so choked up that I had to put the book down on my lap and look out the window so that people would not see my eyes watering up. I can't remember a book ever doing that to me before. This story has many powerful and graphic descriptions of Frank McCourt's childhood experiences. Most of them are very sad, but McCourt does not describe them from a whining, martyred perspective. That's one of the strong points to his writing style. I recommend this book to all adults because of the insight it provides into a life of intense poverty that most of us have been lucky enough to escape."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank, named after my favorite Saint, St. Francis of Assisi, was unfortunatly born into a life of poverty. His mother and father were married in America, but eventually moved back to their homeland of Ireland. They lived in Limerick, the holiest town in Ireland. Frank talks his whole life how he wants to go back to America, while his father pounds it into their brains that they must eventually die for Ireland. This book was depressing, yet it was very inspirational. How a family, after all of the death they have seen, all of the poverty they have experienced, and all they had to deal with, manages to remain together lovingly untill the end of the book, which most likely isn't the bitter end. I hear Frank has another book out and one of his surviving brothers also."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"McCourt tells his story well. It starts off with him as a young child in America and continues with his family's struggles in Ireland. McCourt's story is rich in detail and keeps the reader interested. He completely examines his childhood, which seems so miserable at times that it is a wonder that he can describe it with no bitterness. He doesn't leave out one embrassing moment from his youth and tells everything in simple honesty. While McCourt tells a compelling story, there seemes to be some gaps. He uses a great deal of the book talking about his younger years and talks much less about his life when he is older, breezing through his older years quickly. Also, the book is named for his mother but he seldom seems to consider her except to mention that she was sick or growing tired of his father's drunken actions. He analyzes his father more, while I thought he should have spent more time on his relationship with his mother. While Mccourt's poignant tale is interesting, the style he uses adds even more to the story. He uses clear, beautiful language. Certain passages have a faint echo of Joyce to them. Also, his blunt honesty throughout his story could be linked back to Rousseau's completeness in his tell-all, &quot;The Confessions&quot;. Overall, &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; should be on the 'must read' list of most people. It is destined to become the classic example of autobiographies during this time period."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is glorious.

The harsh, unblinking depictions of his ineffective, preoccupied and exasperated mother; alcoholic, irresponsible but kind-hearted father; and the sharp, unflinching attidudes of a vast parade of other family characters all set against the cold, stand-offish backdrop of Ireland explained for me why the book received such stunningly negative reviews from members of my own family -- It was too close to their experiences growing up Irish and poor in the states.

McCourt's book is a beautiful account of an exhausting childhood. Yes, there are your typical Irish stereotypes (ie. the drunk father), and this does anger some folks.

In the beginning of this book the characters are frequently changing in every way imaginable. Death and relocation are unavoidable consequences that cause this to happen.The main character, Frank, is an extremely dynamic person. He starts out mild and meek but as the book progresses he becomes a more independent person. He begins to do more things as a child, than most people ever do as adults. As he grows and develops his independent he becomes a leader to his siblings. He felt he no choice but to take on this role.We have not read a book with as much deep and profound meaning as this in a long time. The detail that the author goes into is incredible in some areas. The way that he is able to make you feel what is going on is inexplicable. He does this even without using useless words, which bore the reader.The overall plot of the book is lacking in our opinion. Frank grows up and life sucks, that basically sums up the book. One of Frank McCourt's writing traits, which we don't like, is how he starts something and then, just like that, he will end it. We might have been a little more interested and focused on the book if he would have elaborated on a few more of his memories.As a suggestion, from a group of students whom have read Angela's Ashes, do not read this book unless you feel like you can understand what is happening when you receive very little information. The book has its moments, just like every other book, yet there are more bad moments than good.

They were very poor, and went through numerous difficulties dealing with deaths, lack of food, lack of money, and housing conditions. Basically, the McCourt family had difficulties with everything. Their ultimate goal was to earn enough money to go to America, where they were convinced their troubles would be over.The reason I rated this book 4 stars and not 5 was mainly for boredom's sake. While it was humorous, and, for the most part, quite interesting- it remained practically the same throughout the entire book. What I mean is that it had no variation! \\"Angela's Ashes\\" was very depressing- mainly consisting of poverty, depression, and sadness. I understand that that's because Frank McCourt's childhood was made up of poverty, depression, and sadness, but personally- at times I found it rather uneventful.Overall, \\"Angela's Ashes\\" was very good, despite the occasional boredom. To learn about Frank McCourt's life in all its poverty makes me realize how lucky I am today to have everything that I need, and more. It was extremely moving, and I am glad to have read it. I assure everyone who reads it will also be!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In an amazing way Mr.McCourt is able to present his thoughts as a child in the mature age he now is; There were moments that I cried reading this book and many others that I laughed out loud (being in Frankfurt International Airport as well) and I think that we all know that not many scripts can make a person laugh out loud in public; It's amazing, fulfilling, sad and funny, but most of all, a life statement and a good written one; I highly recommend it............"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book has every thing you want in a book.It can make you laugh and some parts make you want to cry.If this book does not move you nothing well.This book covers Franks life in New york to Limerick,Ireland back to New York.I would recomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"While this book details the Ireland we are all familiar with...poverty, war, alcohol...Frank McCourt defines every humorous memory which brightens the scene. I admit I wasn't drawn to this book like some good stories. It began very slowly and every member of his family seemed to be dying left and right. However, once I got to the final 150 pages (Frank's teen years), I couldn't put it down.It is disturbing how much control religion has over one's mind; however, seen through the eyes of a child it is entertaining.Don't expect a close-knit family when you sit down to read this. This is not a family that sticks together. Aside from his father, McCourt's aunt and grandmother are &quot;tight&quot; even when they have a little to spare. However, those in the lane who have less always seem to come through for others in the town which is enlightening.I am still debating whether I want to read the sequel, 'Tis."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is definitely a story of a young boy who overcame many obstacles and misfortunes to fulfill his plan of making it to America. Young Frank McCourt tells his story of his Irish catholic Childhood from his early years to age nineteen. The book focuses on many issues in McCourt's life. For instance, he makes many references about the church, his inhumane poverty, Irish stereotypes, and Irish folklore. Each piece not only represents Ireland, but also effects the decisions in McCourt's childhood. The story almost immediately begins to seem depressing and sad. But, Frankie's knack for telling stories is definitely highlighted in his book Angela's Ashes. Frank McCourt gives great detail to his story which makes for some pretty sad times. His life is one with discomfort, constant hunger, an absent father and an adulterous mother who sleeps with a man to house her children. But, the story is not a tragedy, for the protagonist, Frankie, achieves his desire in the end. What makes the story a success is McCourt's progression into young adulthood. People and teens alike enjoy it because it seems more of a coming of age and a drama. I personally enjoyed it for this reason. Angela's Ashes is a wonderful, yet sad story. Readers enjoy McCourt's style of first person narration, as well as learning about the Irish traditions.

The experience he describes through his eyes shows a world that I could never image. A world of pain, sadness, and suffering but at the same time filled with love and joy. Frank and his younger brother Malachy were born in America during the Great Depression. Life in American was not at all wonderful for Frank's family but it was more than they could ever dream of having in Ireland. However, they wouldn't stay there for long. Frank's father lost his job while drunk at work. For some reason his father thought life would be better back in Ireland, so the family traveled back to Limerick where his mother was brought up. Living in Limerick wasn't easy for anyone however, it was even more difficult for Frank's father because he was from Northern Ireland. He was never liked by anyone on Frank's mother side of the family. His father never did much for the family but spend the family's money in the pubs. Frank grew up with the pain of losing his three baby brothers and sister as well as his first love. Later in Frank's life he plans to return to America. \\"I know I don't have to tell Mam anything, that soon when the pubs close he'll be home singing and offering us a penny to die for Ireland and it will be different now because its bad enough to drink the dole or the wages but a man that drinks the money for a new baby is gone beyond the beyonds as my mother would say.\\" (McCourt, 186) This quote shows how miserable his childhood was like with his father around. Because his father left the family when he was at a young age, we see him develop into the man his father never was. He knew the importance of bring home the money to his family."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is a well written memoir about the struggles of a young boy growing up in Ireland. Frank McCourt uses aching sadness and desperate humor to tell the true story of his life. The story is told in first person point of view, which is why this story has so much detail and is so heartwarming. This book has parts that are kind of disgusting, yet without them the story would loose it's them. The book would probably not suit everyone's taste but it is a book everyone should read to help them understand that no struggle is too hard to overcome. Frank McCourt tells the story in such a way that you feel as if you're there struggling with him and although the story has many struggles and sadnesses, it has humor to balance all this out."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt retells his unfortunate past in Angela's Ashes. McCourt begins his unprivaleged life in New York, and after his father was fired from drinking on the job, many times, he moved to Ireland. The book Angela Ashes gives the reader a different point of veiw on a poor Irish Catholic family.This book introduced new writing styles to me. McCourt writes in long run-on sentances for example. It was easy for me to loose focus when sorting my thoughts through the endless commas. This could have been McCourt's way to emphasize stories. I am unsure. Another element McCourt uses in his book, which differs from most books I have read is his unique dialect the characters carried. Dialect helped the imagination create a face.All of these elements help to create the big picture in Angela's Ashes. McCourt shares with the reader a special personal story. The tones he sets are so unique and personal. The way he describes his crumy life makes the reader so depressed. Yet, the way McCourt shares joy with his family, and his self is amazeing. There are complications with his father, but love too. McCourt commonly uses the &quot;show don't tell&quot; method to demonstrate these feelings. Athought McCourt uses this method to describe situations he does not use this technique in describing the scenes. He leaves the details to your imagination. Even though he writes no vivid details you have this gut feeling you know what everthing looked like.This is a special book. It opened a door that helped me realize hardships in life make you who you are. They made Frank McCourt a successful writer. God works in special ways. I especially enjoy this quote from McCourt that describes Angela's Ashes, &quot;When I look back on my chilhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was, or course, a miserabke childhood: the happy childhhod is harldy worh your while. Worse that the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood&quot;. This quote gives a definate meaning from the author.

I recommend it to all readers."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"There are not many books that draw me into them so far that I feel like I am accompanying the author on his life's journey, but Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes and its sequel 'Tis do just that. The imagery his wonderful use of words evokes is strong; he paints a bleak picture of his youth and the powerful feelings of inadequacy that attended it, but, yet, avoids my pity because he is so matter of fact in his reporting and so darned funny in describing the people who made up his world and using endearing repetitive phrases for emphasis.

Frank goes through a life of poverty while living in an atmosphere where the death of loved one's is a regular occurrence. He watches his two brothers, sister, grandmother, and lover all die.

McCourt does a good job of using a child-like voice and then transitioning as his character approaches adolescence. Even though his story was depressing at times, he has a way of keeping interest up through his clever and at times, sarcastic style. I also like how he used food as a motif to represent what kind of poverty he was experiencing. While I was reading it, I felt the hunger that he was describing with great detail. Overall, this book was a real view on a normal person's experiences of growing up and living with poverty."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"i thought this book accurately described the life of a boy growing up in Ireland.

After the first few pages I could not put the book down! Reading some of the recent reviews, I found it hard to understand why some found the book boring and drawn out. This memoir was written through the eyes of a child, as he was growing up. During the book, I found myself seeing the horrific conditions through the eyes of a child; although knowing that there was pain, suffering, and poverty, he accepted it because he did not know a different kind of life. As he grew older, the frailties of the adults around him, and the beliefs of the Church and his environment began to become evident to him. In spite of all his misfortune and disadvantaged childhood, he managed to survive and succeed in accomplishing his dream to be different and live in America. I would recommend this book to everyone - especially parents; as it truly make you realize the impact of your behavior on the future of our children!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Love and tenaciousness override the poverty that colors this book's details, making this a true memoir and proving that a strong-spirited human being can maneuver his/her way through the messes and mazes. Did Angela give up? Frank didn't. We may not like or agree with the details of some of his actions, but he set his goal, worked toward it for years, and finally got to America. Rising from the ashes of Angela's struggles, and helped by the love his parents truly had for their children (despite their emotional weaknesses and addictions), Frank learned to persevere, no matter how cruel his bullies or how hard his lessons.I believe that the author fairly balanced the good with the bad. Some examples: the stench of the common latrine vs. the sweetness of eating apples in the country; the kind, understanding R.C. confessors who truly reflected God's love vs. the worldly R.C. orders who, with prejudice, refused to mix with the poor, etc. The contrasts made the book easily readable and universally appealing. It was painful and funny, full of the worst and best of people, the way anyone's life can be.Little Frankie was a hopeful optimist, with self-esteem that seems unreal. He is a real study in how heredity and environment affect human development, and yet he provides no conclusive answers as to how others in his situation can be &quot;saved&quot;. He just is!I learned some things, I was inspired, I was saddened, and I was angry, as I read about 30 pages each night before going to sleep.I am still &quot;talking&quot; to the characters, yelling at them, comforting them, and cheering them on!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt is literary brillance.

However, the fact of not just survival but lives of excellence give credence to the theory that love conquers all. Any childhood spent in the throes of the helpless poverty of the McCourt family will either breed a contempt for civilized existence or a strong commitment for change.

As a scholar in literature and an avid reader, I was truly disappointed in this novel. Frank McCourt's childhood was certainly miserable enough to warrant his desire to tell his story, but his inability to tell the story in a concise manner was frustrating. The novel could easily have been wrapped up in one hundred pages or less. It was the same drivel over and over and over. Was anyone surprised when Malachy drank all his wages, after the third time? Did any of you actually expect he would send home money from England? As for Angela, I found her character weak of body and will. So what if she was depressed? She had children that needed her. She was portrayed as flat, and spineless. This book was nowhere near the read I expected it to be. I liken it to a movie that is only worth seeing on video. I should've waited for the paperback. Then I wouldn't feel so ripped off."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I first read a portion of Angela's Ashes in the New Yorker, a battered copy of which I found under the bed while I was recovering from the flu and bronchitis and thinking, martyr-like, that I was certainly near death. The more I read, the more ashamed I felt. I felt ashamed for laughing, and ashamed for feeling that I knew even remotely what suffering was. When I finally read the entire book, I could feel that things would never be the same. Only a few books in my life have affected me this way, but when they do, for good or bad, I know the author has done what it is that compells authors in the first place--change the world, one person at a time. I laughed, I bawled...I read at least half the book to my sister over the phone, and have pestered my husband unceasingly to read it for himself. Frank McCourt has given the world a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I think it is wonderful that such a well written book that has deep things to say has become a commercial success! However, if you have a soft heart for kids, you might find the pain of this book a bit overwhelming. I loved the book and glad that Mr. McCourt has written it, but I doubt that I'll ever read it again. Some in my family (of Irish background) couldn't finish it because the early chapters were too painful. On the other hand, I look forward to the day that my very comfortable middle class children are old enough to read this in some literature class in the future. Reliving someone else's pain is good in small doses."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"McCourt's style instantly sucked me in, helping me to see again the world from more innocent eyes. It was very touching to see his portrayal of the resilience of children's souls. But when those souls slowly grow older, and recognize things for what they truly are, you are also reminded that those souls struggle to escape the world in which they are born. While much more realistic than a story in which the child grows up to earn billions or win a world reknowned award, the final third of the novel is flat and unrewarding. If the book were to teach me something, it would be that I could quit my life and somehow still manage to get by. Never once would it teach me to stand up for myself."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt. This memoir displays a chronicle of events throughout a family's life which makes the novel worth reading. It tells a story of mercy and love on both ends of the family, the children and the adults. The language the author uses provides the source of the personal feelings evoked in the reader when reading this novel. When I read the novel, I cried, and I felt devastated at some events that took place in the book. I also felt the urge to laugh at some points in the novel. This novel goes deep into the poverty that the children growing up in Limerick have to face, which, by the way, makes this bok so interesting. Eventhough some people may say, when they were growing up, they had to live in poverty; they never had food on the table, none of this can compare with the horrible conditions these poor people in the slumps of Limerick had to face. Although the McCourt family was an impoverished family, they still possessed wit and they stood strong for their morals. Also, it is intriguing when Franks gets typhoid fever and is hospitalized in a typhoid ward, like Mary Karr says, it &quot;seems a blessed relief from daily home life on and off the dole.&quot; This book undoubtedly deserves the Pulitzer Prize. It has proven itself to be full of liveliness and beauty, inside and out. This book proves worthy to receive the rating of 10 and nothing less.

All the struggles this poor little boy had to experience in one lifetime, &quot;The boys sneer. . . we wear our shoes with the rubber tires . . .&quot; (106). The family has no money and a very dim future. Frank has to struggle with an acholholic dad, a depressive mother, a hateful grandmother, and a very dreary future. Back to how I enjoyed the book. Well, I gave it a seven because I found myself feeling like I was reading the same old story over and over again. They had no money, the father came home drunk, the children died, Angela would sing when she was happy, the family would move, and Frank just observes. Altough it was interesting to read about life from a child's perspective, I felt like I had the heard the same stiry twenty times. It is humorous to hear Frank comment on different aspects of life, such as when he received First Communion and just learned from his father and the master that one must die for Ireland or Faith, &quot;I'd love to big and important and parade around with the red Confirmation catechism but I don't think I'll live that long the way I'm expected to die for this or that&quot; (113). But then Frank grows up right before the readers eyes. It is such a moving moment when Frank finally saves up his fiftey-five shillings to board the boat headed to America. When the officer comments on how beautiful the country looks and then a whole chapter dedicates itself to Frank's reply, &quot;Tis&quot; (364). For a child who has seen and been through so much, such a rush can be felt through his simple reply.

Frank McCourt tells of his life from the point of view of a young child forced to grasp maturity at an early age. Only a child could provide such an honest outlook of the world amidst such hardship, for only a child, lacking in worldly experience, would not realize that his life was a trial in the first place. Born of Irish immigrants in New York--his father an alcoholic who nearly drives his mother to mental instability--he first experiences life's struggles in the grand melting pot during the years before the Great Depression. After the hard times of 1929 and losing a child, the McCourt family moves back to Ireland where the children are met with contempt and sometimes persecution. From this moment on, young Frank lives the life of the poorest of poor even among the troubled Irish, but he lives. Frank McCourt has survived well indeed to tell this tale to a generation which often takes its wealth and comfort for granted and to provide hope to those who might feel they are burdened with the world's problems."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Dear readers,After reading this memoir by Frank McCourt, I honestly believe that he has earned his Pulitzer Prize and I give this exemplory work a nine rating.With the turn of each page one gets reeled in to the life of a poor, Irish, Catholic child as McCourt seems to confide in us with his frank, yet honest, memories. He indulged me with scenes which were so elaborate that I could have easily been a fly on the wall.&quot;We slept the rest of that night, and in the morning we saw where the fleas had feasted, our flesh pink with flea welts and bright with the blood of our scratches&quot; (61).Such troublesome aspects scarred not only the events but the characters as well. McCourt never had a respectable man in his life as his father, Malachy, was branded with the &quot;Irish curse&quot; of drunkenness and song. This motif of 'reality' continued as his mother often lacked social favor. This Catholic mother had a child out of wedlock, married a slothful husband, and never seemed to get quit off of her feet, distraught from losing several children within a reasonably short amount of time.Though, from my selected excerpts and points, this book seems too miserable to endure, it was not.

Mccourt definitely opened my eyes and made me realize how fortunate I am to have the luxuries of food, clothing, a home, and a college education. I think many of us fail to realize that we are lucky, and when you read a true story about the life of someone who grew up without all the necessities of life, it almost makes you feel guilty for having so much.

I found the opening pages confusing, since the events described are not in chronological order. However, the background information included in them is vital to the story. The reader must remember the events and connect them as the plot unfolds. I have often wondered what the world looks like through other people's eyes, and Frank McCourt gave me a complete tour of his world.

Not being Irish but raised as a Catholic, Angela's Ashes brought back memories of catechism classes taught by strict rules adapted to the culture of the times. I remember being taught that only Catholics went to heaven and that any and all sexual thoughts or deeds would damn one to Hell. This is not to undermine, however, the book's trajic story about poverty, alcoholism and growing up in a culture where the &quot;drink&quot; is associated with many social activities. Additionally, Frank McCourt writes a memoir that personifies the American dream. It touches a chord inside all of us because we have all heard similiar stories passed on to us by our own parents and grandparents. Angela's Ashes makes us both proud and sad to be Americans, lets us snicker at some silly long-held beliefs, and forces us to question the wisdom and the teachings of our religious and societal rules. It is a book that stays with you for a very long time."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Alot of people gave McCourt flack for reinforcing the stereotype of the Irish. But I think they failed to realize that this was his childhood and the experiences that shaped his life was through his eyes. McCourt wrote this book as if he was writing a journal.

I was completely engrossed from the moment I began reading it until the moment I finished. This book gave me a lot to think about. The mere openness of Mr. McCourt concerning his life was amazing. I was often times livid about the way in which he had to go about his life, and felt the pain of his mother who in her own way remained strong and hopeful during his father's constant battle to find stable employment.His father was a very interesting man. I believe that he was suffering from a broken-heart due to the loss of his daughter andtwin sons. I believe the elder McCourt could have been an author or story-teller within his own right. I feel that such things can be a given and passed down from generation to generation. I think that this indeed was an interesting point that Mr. McCourt made in his movie and book that his father was always telling him stories in which apparently he remembered and retained.It is hard to imagine how one could have survived such an upbringing; nevertheless this book is a perfect example how Mr. McCourt was ever so eloquent in his one dream of coming to America. I was touched by his willingness on several occassions in which even as a child he worked and tried to take on the responsibilities of caring for his family. I thought that was beautiful when he became in the very words of his father when he left for London, \\"the man of the house.\\"Mr. McCourt honesty and straight-forwardness about the events that occurred in his life makes him one the most beautiful authors that I know. Honesty within itself is a beautiful thing. The freedom to write an honest piece of work is far more intriguing.I love this book it touched my life. I have read this book more than once, and somehow when I want to place myself within a situation of all odds I read this . . . And then I am reminded of the dream of Mr. Frank McCourt and I am totally convinced that anything is possible within my life if only I just BELIEVE!I highly recommend this book to all . . . it is one excellent read!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Another one of those recent books which has to compared with the movie. As ever the book wins hands down. Not a light read but enjoyable none the less.It is the writers memoirs of a poor upbringing mainly in Limerick. Does it really rain there contantly? The downstairs of the family is permanently flooded. The loss of siblings is described in a matter of fact way which emphasises its inevitability.It is not all gloom. There are moments of real humour - particularly the first communion where 'The Lord Jesus' becomes stuck in his throat and is subsequently vomited into the back-yard.As this is a memoir it is unclear how much is historically accurate. but it isn't a history book.I would have given it 5 stars but it was depressing in places.

There is nothing like listening to Frank McCourt imitate the voices of his teachers, relatives and priests. It was impossible to stem the tears when McCourt described the ever-present hunger stalking the family, the useless father, the no-heart grandmother and aunt, the deaths of his sister and brothers. And I laughed out loud as grown-up McCourt inhabited his younger self to report on the always-puzzling behavior of the adults in his life.Even if you have already read the book, I urge you to obtain it on tape."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Being a teenager, Angela's Ashes didn't automatically appeal to me. It sounded more like a book my mother would enjoy, especially because it's a \\"memoir\\"- kind of a scary word for a young person, because it seems to predict a drab, boring life story. The beginning of the book was difficult to get into, mostly because about a million characters are introduced in the first fifty pages.However, after I got into the story, it was really easy reading. It's a very well written book. The main characters have many dimensions and lots of personality, which is probably because the story is a true account of Frank McCourt's life. The story is about an extremely poor family, and their move to Ireland, where the father and mother were born and raised. The McCourts face many hardships, such as the death of children, and the fact that the dad, also named Frank McCourt, drinks away the little money they have in Irish pubs almost every night.I found I was most drawn to the father as a character. He is depicted as a wonderful dad who would do anything for his family. All of his sons look up to him a great deal, and they see only the good qualities in him. He turns right around and betrays their trust, though, by acting as though he doesn't have a family to support. Through a flurry of job loses, caused when he drinks too much on his pay days, and not being able to get up the next morning, he ruins any chances the family has to live normal lives. He is continuously forgiven for his mistakes.Although Angela's Ashes is at times very sad, it is also tremendously entertaining, and in many cases, funny.

Frank describes his one bedroom ramshackle home in Windmill St, and I can automatically bring it to mind. We owned a pub in Limerick called the Windmill just directly opposite Windmill Street, and yes there was a family called the Keatings living in Windmill St, but I hasten to add this was the eighties. The stories of the Vincent De Paul are all true as I remember my times doing charity work for them, and helping people like Mrs. Mc Court. The pubs, the labour exchange, the school are all so life like, as if I could reach out and it was there, but my memories are of the eighties. Very little had changed since the 40's and I still remember the story of the women who picked up the coal from the dock road.

To put your place in the heart, soul, and eyes of a child growing up in such extreme poverty was absolutely mesmerizing. I think this should be required reading for all Americans who have either forgotten what it is to be thankful for what they have or for those whose hearts have never been touched in a way to make them realize what is really important in life. And yet, little Frank McCourt endured the worst of the worst, and at times he even had a sense of humor about his life. To think that a young boy cherished the moments when he could have one whole slice of bread WITH jam on it, the only meal that day, or the only food in 2 days . . . while always looking out for his younger siblings.

Though I grew up in the U.S. and not Ireland, I heard many, many echos of my own life as a poor child and the child of an alcoholic. Yes, life and adults were cruel at times for Frank, but the absence of self pity and the humor found in the most appalling circumstances, saved the book, just as it saved Frank, himself.

Until I read this book, I never new people could be subjected to a life with no meaning other than to find sustinence. Miserable indeed, but compounded with his father, his grandmother, the church, it's like salt in an open wound. It is life with out hope. Alive not because your soul wants to be alive but because of an autonomous nervous system keeping you alive.Frank's memoir amplifies your life. It makes you see your loved ones in a new light.

Frank chronicles his entire childhood..the hunger, the loss of the his innocence, school, and the camraderie between the McCourt brothers. The brotherhood is incredibly amusing and the highlight of the book.This book is great. The vividness that Frank uses to describe his own history is amazingly entertaining.

I have a warm home, clothes on my body, food in my belly and then some. During this time period in Ireland, children as young as 5 or 6 could be working to help support their families whereas in America at the age of 5 or 6 children will only be starting school. I think it is a great book for seniors to read in the World Literatue/ English class category. This book takes human emotion by the core and opens peoples eyes to all the different aspects of life.

It tells the heartbreaking story of young Frank McCourt growing up in poverty-stricken Limerick, Ireland. The book follows the McCourt family through the trials of poverty, birth, death, alcoholism, and everything in between. Only four of eight children survive the tough life that they were forced into in Ireland. Frank if often made to watch his younger siblings while his father is getting drunk is a pub, and his mother is bed ridden with severe depression. He becomes more of a father figure and role model for his young brothers. Frank works odd jobs trying to save up enough money to get himself and his family to America one day. This book is truly very touching and it keeps you on your toes through out the entire novel. You are always wondering what will happen to Frank and his family next. I found myself wanting to laugh and cry through out the entire book. One page I found myself feeling sorry for Frank because of his situation, and the next questioning his morals and values. This story is a perfect example of the human will to endure and will surely be a classic in years to come. It opens readers' eyes to new experiences and challenges that many Americans are not faced with daily. It will stand the test of time well.

Angela's Ashes proves just that. If you've ever thought that your life was rough, give this one a try. Every page reveals yet another tragedy that this young Irish-American must try to understand.Written from the first-person perspective, the book begins it's setting in New York where everything is seemingly flawless. However, in an ironic twist, the aleady Irish immigrants traverse back to their homeland, battling the mobs and mobs of new immigrants coming to the 'New World'.Once in Ireland, the McCourt's begin their struggle to live complacently among their own. Going through many, many decrepit houses, the McCourt family expands and shrinks like a beating heart. Angela, Frank's mother, has a miscarriage, a daughter that dies, a son that dies, and twins that both perish as well leaving the family with father, son, and three brothers.Malachy McCourt the older, Frank's father, deals with getting a place in the work force with his \\"North of Ireland accent\\", unacceptable to those living in Limerick at the time. When Malachy does get a job, he spends all of the wages on the dreaded 'pint' and comes home singing through the streets, waking everyone and disgracing himself in front of the entire town.Throughout all, Frank begins schooling, a religous life, sexual experimentation, getting a job, and finding his place in life. With Frank's unique way of questioning everything, he draws in the reader and makes it truly believable that a child wrote the book.With all the trials and tribulations of Irish life come many valuable lessons which McCourt inserts as prevailing themes. Angela seems to offer up the most advice to young Frank and the climax of the book seems to come when she tells him, \\"never let anyone slam a door in your face again, Frankie.\\" This proves to be a valiant offering from a woman who begs for food scraps and bits of coal from the church.With this, Frank is determined to go back to America where he can live happily among the hardworking, wealthy, 'cowboys' of the Western world.This book truly delivers something special into every reader's heart. It has met praise and unexpected success, \\"I had no expectations. As I said to my wife, recently, I might be reviewed in the New York Times Book Review under \\"Briefly Noted.\\" And then I'd get my Library of Congress catalog number. And then I'd recede into obscurity and I'd get a job like everybody else.\\"This is most certainly untrue.

American by birth, moved back to Ireland when he was a small boy. This is his story from when he was young until he moves back to America in his twenties. This autobiography is both hysterically funny with tales of his communion to crushingly sad with the death of siblings due to poor health and poverty. McCourt writes about his father and the problems he has with alcohol. He also writes about his unloving aunt who also buys his first true suit for work. For me, the most poingment moment of the book is when he comes home drunk the first time and his mother has to deal with him. This book is a true triumph because even with crushing poverty, McCourt writes about good times and friends growing up. This book is well worth the time and once you start, you can't put it down again."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The writing attracted me.

I'm glad that i read this one. I can commiserate with the fear of priests and teachers and parents and tauntings from my peers, the fear of the days to come. I've been there. I think we all have. It discourages me that so many people think that Mr. McCourt should be seeking mental care. I don't think he should be. I'm glad he's of the old breed that can remember his life and laugh about it. We all should be able to do that. It gives me hope that in the end we'll all be able to look back on this and laugh. Better yet to be able to tell others and make them laugh too. It's a tragic story but so what we all have tragic stories which I think McCourt understands and this is why he never lets us pity him. I certainly don't pity him. I'm sorry he never got to know his sister or his two brothers, the twins. But oh well. He'll live and he doesn't make me feel that I should go down on my two knees and beg his forgiveness for him growing up the way he did. I think McCourt wrote most of this book laughing his ass off. I would have. I don't feel bad for him. I'm envious. I've never had an apple freshly plucked from the tree and I doubt I'll ever have milk straight from the cow. McCourt is the sterotypical Irishman. He's got troubles but he still manages to laugh about it and so do I and so should we all.McCourt got over it and I think perhaps his detractors ought to as well."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Life in Limerick should not be this horrific. Lying beside his dead siblings, and wanting for a cut of bread, little Frankie finds the humor about him in a story of self perseverance, and vision.You want to be able to pull Frankie from the death of the River Shannon, and bring unto your own. It is the hilarity by which McCourt helps us through it, sometimes so much so, that, we forget his personal hell. It is indeed an enlightening experience."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Like many others, I was totally immersed in Frank McCourt's book from start to finish - and it's the finish that bothered me.

McCourt is very original, creative and entertaining."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Like all great literature, Angela's Ashes is about more than it seems. Yes, it is about Ireland, poverty, alcoholism, cynical, arrogant priests, the myth of a golden America, sexually coming of age. But what it is essentially and magnificently about is the glory of words, language, stories, the stuff we all carry in our minds to make life bearable. The stories, the language, subvert the best (and worst) intentions of a benighted church and aristrocracy (in the background but always there) to keep the poor and humble docile, stupid and accepting of their miserable lot on earth in hope of salvation in the bye and bye. A brilliant, life-affirming work."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I saw so much of my own family in this book. The attitudes of the older generations are still the same. This book brought back wonderful memories for me and at the same time it was very disturbing.

To my mind, &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; had some of the best elements of both. Like &quot;Tree,&quot; it tells the story of a family struggling with poverty brought about by the father's problems with alcohol.Like Twain, McCourt tells his story through the eyes of an adolescent. And he captures a youngster's point of view in an extremely credible way. In spite of the harrowing story he has to tell, this device allows real and moving humor to brighten the story"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Strangely, I must admit that this is not my usual read. I am almost embarrassed to say that what attracted me to Angela's Ashes in the first place, was the cover art. &quot;God bless the jacket designers&quot;. What Frank McCourt accomplishes in this memoir is astounding. The style is engaging and originally written for its genre. But the true measure of this book is in the genuine pathos it exacts from the reader. It is almost draining. What suprises me most is that after an upbringing like that, McCourt has the depth of heart to write such a poignant memoir. I would gladly shake his hand"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I'd give the book a 10 but those poems and songs of which we had to read all the choruses repeatedly weren't THAT great. Lacing the unimaginable and sickening poverty and disease anecdotes were memorable renditions of speeches and offhand comments made by adults to the McCourt children the like of which one rarely hears today from educated, sensitivity-trained and psychologically- oriented people, but which were all too common in ALL social strata until the recent past. These comments, directly and obliquely derogatory of the McCourt children and parents alike, must have scarred those children like the cold and malnutrition, and these are wounds any middle-aged person with a clear memory of his or her own chidhood can surely feel"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a wonderful Irish book.

Depressing it certainly is, but Mr. McCourt knows how to tell a story in a way that draws you in and shuts everything else around you out until you are lost inside the pages. I literally could not put this book down and the minute I finished it I turned it over and read it again...then ran right out and bought and read 'Tis!Mr. McCourt's candidness and wry humor about the years of hopelessness and despair captured my heart in a way no other book has ever done.

Excellent writing, but eveyone just keeps dying--it's unbelievable. It really shows you how difficult life was back in the day. It makes you count your blessings that we live now and not then. Definately worth a read. Frank Mc Court is a very talented writer."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is a strange book. Frank McCourt's ability to find humor in the least expected situations of life is quite extraordinary. Around the mid part of the book, it is perfect and really unstoppable as the characters grow on you. McCourt lived in Limerick,Ireland with his family after his parents moved from USA.His experiences in school, farms, castles, workplaces, hospitals, Laman Griffin, hills, bars, green sofas and at various grocery stores and sundry are all contained within this book.Despite his character flaws, Frank's father was my favourite character of the book. His awkward style ,his funny formal yet dinty, his och aye's, his mannerisms of an aristocrat(who wouldnt go out asking for help but would let his wife and children do the same), his patriotic drunkards' swag, his silent confused love-hate relationship with Angela and his keen optimistic religious side is what really intrigued me. It was sad when the book ended without a word from him. Also Angela never finds out what happens to her red dress and that was a tad queer but then again, there already are a thousand problems in Frank's interesting life.\\"Angela's Ashes\\" is not just a memoir, it's a confession. There is nothing conventional about the author's overenthusiastic yet calm writing skill. He comes accross as the most patient, keen, willing to work, flexible family man. Frank was the eldest son and he suffered from typhoid and an eye disease. I loved the Uncles and couldnt stop myself from laughing when Frank wore his dead grandmother's black suit. Frank took those jabs at his head with a light heart. To me, one of the funniest points in the book were the ones where the author,as a kid, would refrain from asking questions in fear of getting jabs at his head by the elders.Ireland's description,as a nation, is unique and wins heart. It's good to hear about the opinions of various types of people long gone and forgotten. Religion,catholics and protestants, their hate relationship with their hell and heaven concepts were quite interesting.I didnt know what to think once this book ended and I will definintely be reading the sequel titled \\"'Tis\\" soon. Some other things I loved about this book include Question Quigley, the teachers at school, Aunt Auggie, Paddy, Michael McCourt, Malachy McCourt, Angela's dance partner in the \\"good old days\\" who's also Paddy's father, Eugene and Oliver's twin love relationship.I cried a lot when I read about Eugene and Oliver's demise. It was heartbreaking when one tries to console each other in few futile ways upon the death of a near loved one in the immediate family.I absolutely love this book"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book focused on the struggle that Irish children had to face after coming to America. The story revolved around the central character Malachy. This book amplified the pain and the suffering these kids had to face.It showed how hard it was for them to get a piece of bread. It focused on the mother's struggle and the father's carelessness, for the mother worked hard to feed her kids while the father got drunk and wasted the money. Frank Mccourt painted a vivid image of a restless childhood.It showed the creativity of the writer's knowledge on the subject.

I ask why, because it was a tale of misery or because you actually thought it was bad? This was a wonderfully written book about the life of an Irish Catholic boy. If you thought it stunk simply because it's true, than you must not know a marvelous read when you see one. Another reviewer said the sexual exploit at the end lost them.

I found that in enjoying this novel, i did not have to have been through the experiences he did, nor seen poverty so clearly.

The author vividly describes growing up in Ireland during a time when the country was still adjusting to the division of the island after the Republic received its independence--and we see the children promising to fight for Ireland's freedom. It shows us how children see life--not through rose colored glasses; these children see the good, the bad and the ugly in the lanes of Limerick. The book pulls at your heart-strings--making you want to rescue the youngsters; wanting to punish their father for squandering what little they had; and wanting to soothe the pain suffered by Angela as she tried to maintain some semblance of normalcy within the family.

This story of family life through struggles brings out the worst aspects of life, along with the miraculous times. The novel goes from the flooding of their house, rats,lice, lavatory, and absolutely gross living conditions of the lowest class to the beauty of close family connections, open bluntness, and ultimate love. I for one, extremely enjoy the breaks in the novel where Mr. McCourt takes a hardship and turns it into something the audience can relate to and laugh about. In the case when the boys are starving of hunger at lunch time, the author could have sympathized with the boys, but instead he makes them go out to the country side orchards, eat apples, and then has a hilarious account on how the young men had to go to opposite ends to use the restroom with leaves as toilet paper.I personally love the sickening and vile stories, they make my stomach turn, but put a smile to my face. Not only do I adore this in the book, but I really enjoyed the development of characters through concrete detail, especially Malachy McCourt, the father. Much of the audience could see the father as the antagonist, since he continues to bring the family down to the worst of circumstances time and time again from his horrible drinking habits and lack of good intuition over responsible parenting, but I find myself having all kinds of sympathies and unique likenesses of him. Mr. Malachy, even though, he may totally abolish and destroy the families hopes at certain instances he always does little gestures that show his kind, sincere character of caring. In such cases, when he never eats his dinner for more to be leftover for the children and wife, or when he gives the boys pennies time to time for saying they will die for Ireland, or when he makes up different stories to tell Frank in the mornings. In all, the novel was one of kind, full of diverse complexities of bluntness and struggle. I would definitely read this novel a million times over again, and I do not read much!!!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt creates an intriguing autobiography that leaves the reader crying from laughter and from sorrow. In the novel, McCourt uses gruesome details that vividly poytray his childhood. The novel is an autobiography of a Catholic boy growing up in Ireland. It shows how real poverty was in that time period. The poverty nearly killed the family's pride as well as their physical bodies.This novel also has the humor of a young boy reaching maturity and learning to deal with himself and his impulses. The more one reads the more the story is laid out. I could not put it down once I started. After finishing I was left in awe of McCourt and how he survived his childhood. I recomend this book to all who have a want for survival.

This isn't because it's poorly-written. Far from it; &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; quickly captures the reader with a unique and compelling voice. The difficulty is that the first part of the book is tragic beyond words... and yet Frank McCourt has found words which capture the tragedy of his early years with ruthless honesty.In bone-clean prose, McCourt details the events of his early childhood, first in America and then in Ireland. His story is an interesting one, to be sure, but the most notable thing about it is the way he tells it. McCourt's straightforward style perfectly portrays how a child sees the world and his family. Especially early on, there is no moralizing or judgment; events simply happen, often for no discernible reason (although reasons are clear to the reader). As McCourt grows, so the prose becomes more complex, and his understanding of what is happening to his family crystallizes.McCourt also does a great job capturing the rhythm and cadence of dialogue and regional accents, especially the Irish way of speaking English. While reading the book's dialogue sequences, a reader can hear the people speaking in their inner ear, can hear the thick Irish accents of some, the clear English of others. Simply put, Frank McCourt has one of the finest ears for dialogue of any writer I've ever read.The imagery of &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is simple but vibrant, the story moving and very, very real. It is, in many ways, a difficult book to read, but that is simply because it is so well-written, and portrays a difficult subject with honesty and clarity. One finishes the book wishing that more writers could write this clearly, but even more important, the reader understands what Frank McCourt went through as he grew to a young man. If that reader is anything like me, it will make them very thankful for what they have."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frankie McCourt is the oldest of six children, three of whom survive. This reader wonders how three children could possibly survive such a childhood.Frankie's conception in America, the result of a \\"knee-trembler\\" between Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan, puts Angela in an \\"interesting condition,\\" which incites her fat Irish-American cousins to force a marriage. However, Angela is from southern Ireland and her family forever discounts Malachy as \\"having the strange manner of those Protestant northern Irish people.\\"Malachy's affliction with \\"the Irish problem,\\" means the family never has enough -- money, food, or attention, because it all goes for \\"the pints.\\" Angela is devastated by the death of the baby daughter, Margaret, probably because of starvation. Young Frankie and his little brother Michael never quite know from day to day if they will have anything to eat or not. A good meal to them is usually a slice of fried bread, with tea sipped from a fruit jar. Angela's cousins notify her mother in Ireland of the situation, and somehow the Widow Sheehan scrapes up money to bring the family home. However, Angela's Irish relatives have troubles of their own and aren't able to provide much assistance. Their life in Limerick is even worse than it was in America.Frankie McCourt tells his story in straightforward manner without offering judgment or opinion. That's just the way it was, he says, in his Irish brogue, offering only a few songs in his true clear baritone to lighten the stories with songs of his childhood in Ireland.Angela descends by degree to the deepest depths of humiliation, from the dole to begging. The family moves from house to wretched house, usually carrying everything they own in their arms. \\"Respectable people live on a street,\\" Frankie's schoolteacher tells him. \\"You live in a Lane.\\" Living quarters are less than adequate and McCourt spares us no details: particularly the stench of the one toilet shared by an entire lane, that latrine just outside the McCourt's front door. The family's flooded first floor makes the second floor an oasis, which they dub \\"Italy.\\"They must find a few lumps of coal every day to heat their room and warm their food. They must contend with Malachy's endless pints and Angela's addiction to smoking woodbines and her understandable depression. The family must find food --- onions, bread, water, an egg if they're lucky. Frankie recalls with relish the good day when, after the death of yet another baby, neighbors brought the family a pot of mashed potatoes with butter. The children had enough to eat that night.Those rare times when he had work, Malachy McCourt would come home late from the Pub on payday, line up the boys and extract promises that they would die for Ireland. He drank up the dole, his wages, and even money meant for the new baby --- putting himself \\"beyond the beyonds,\\" as Angela says. Yet he escapes vilification in the book because on his good days, in spite of his alcoholism Malachy loves his children. He inspires the boys by telling them over and over the story of the great Irish warrior Ka-hoo-lan (Cuchulain).There is the emotional pain inflicted by the insults of the charity officers, and the physical pain of street fights, Frankie's infected eyes, the fleas in the mattress, the danger from marauding rats, and a shortage of medical care. Wearing shoes repaired with tire treads, stealing a bag of bananas for his twin baby brothers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner, and searching the pubs for his father, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the unforgiveable cruelty of relatives and neighbors.After urging by Angela, Malachy finally takes a job with the hated English during the war. \\"After the way the English have treated us Irish for seven hundred years!\\" Malachy storms, \\"You want me to go to their side?\\"The boys are sad to see their father go, but are sustained by the hope of finally having enough money to pay for their basic needs. Instead, Angela and the children are worse off than before when Malachy spends his paychecks in English pubs instead of sending the cash telegram to his family in Limerick.Frankie McCourt leavens his story with humor and fascinating details, like the story of his first love, Patricia, whom he meets while they are both hospitalized; Frankie with Typhoid; Patricia with Diphtheria. Patricia shares her books with Frankie, but boys and girls are not allowed to talk to each other in the Catholic hospital so the Nuns move Frankie to the top floor where he is the only patient in a room of empty beds, unused since the plague. After a few days, the janitor brings Frankie the news that Patricia has died. Frankie recovers and eventually works his way up to \\"messenger boy\\" delivering telegrams. He delivers a telegram to a young girl with \\"the galloping consumption.\\" His friends tell him that sickness causes a young person to want to experience everything immediately, so the gal is not responsible for indiscretions. She introduces him to \\"the excitement\\" and Frankie visits Teresa's house regularly. One day Frankie sees a black wreath on the door, learns that Teresa is deceased and Frankie is certain he has caused Teresa to go straight to Hell. Frank struggles with that burden, which causes a conflict for him in his religion.This book is filled with references to the Catholic Church, from the difficulties of confession for a young boy, to the conflicts between the Protestants and Catholics in Ireland, to the \\"collections\\" for boys who make their first confession, to the concern that the Church does not really help the members with their problems and apparently does not \\"love\\" the poor. Yet Frankie never criticizes the leaders for shutting doors in his face.At confession, Frankie admits to stealing food because his father drank the food money away. His confessor responds, \\"My child, I sit here. I hear the sins of the poor. I assign the penance. I bestow absolution. I should be on my knees washing their feet.\\"It is this attitude that offers the dominant flavor in this Irish stew."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt was well deserving of the Pulitzer. This book was so gritty, real and inspiring to the point that it was magical. His prose, the way he tells his story as if he were sitting across from you, it just took me away."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"the product is pretty good as the description, well, it looks pretty new as well... I like this book, but still reading it, the shipping is fast as well."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt came out of nowhere with this raucous debut, a memoir of tragedy mixed with charm. It details the period of his life from child to adolescent in Limerick, Ireland, in the muddy days of Postwar Britain. His father, a man devout to his country and the drink, instills in him an appreciation of the world and its temptations; and his pious mother does her best to teach him values and gratuity. These all combine to make McCourt's literary voice, which is once refreshingly original and carefully contemplative of the tragedies that are continually visited upon the family within a few short years. Any other writer would make this the most depressing book in recent publication history, but in his hands it is palatable, wise, and oftentimes very funny. McCourt's childhood seems light years apart from what most people have today, but there is still a very human optimism and self-sufficiency throughout the keeps the book from wallowing in despair. The end result is a memoir that, while perhaps more imagination than fact, shows resiliency and a wry enjoyment of life that is stripped bare of ann incidentals. The book's success is a no-brainer- its appeal is wide and deep. Recommended for all modern lit fans."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is very interesting.

I can't wait for the sequel, which I understand is coming out in the Spring of 99. I sure hope Frank McCourt tells us everything he can and knows about the rest of his family and friends. I sure hope he sent his mother money and didn't keep her waiting for too long. I am first generation American and my Mom is from Ireland. This book really captured the personality of the Irish. So many times I thought to myself, &quot;God that's something my mother would say&quot;! Also, the book gives so many examples of how people can get so involved in the rituals of the religion and forget it's true meaning. I wanted to smack Aunt Aggie myself after she hit poor little Malachy for asking for more bread. What I liked best about the book was the sense of humor Frank McCourt has even at the worst of times.

Mr. McCourt pulled no punches in telling the full complete truth about &quot;his Irish Catholic&quot; upbringing. That he obviously came out of the experience with such great strength of character is to his great credit.

THE HUMOUR AND IRONY ARE PROFOUND AND FREQUENTLY I FOUND MYSELF BOTH LAUGHING AND CRYING AT THE SAME TIME. MR. McCOURT HAS ENTERED A GREAT PANTHEON OF LITERARY GENIUS, MANY OF THE INHABITANTS OF WHICH ARE HIS COUNTRYMEN,WILLIAM BLAKE AND JAMES JOYCE, TO NAME BUT TWO. IT IS QUITE AMAZING THAT A COUNTRY SO SMALL, SO IMPOVERISHED, AND SO BLIGHTED BY THE SHADOW OF BRITISH ARROGANCE AND IMPERIALISM SHOULD HAVE A LEGACY OF SUCH CULTURAL MAGNITUDE.

I didn't expect much, but I was quickly brought into an unimaginably bleak world.

I also liked how he never made himself out to be the &quot;hero&quot; of the story and included all of his flaws in his story telling. I must say the story is rather depressing, but McCourts wit and sarcasm relieves some of the empathy one would feel for the family. The book also made me realize how much I have and that I should be thankful for my gifts.

He seems to indict an entire country for his family's most particular kind of poverty, which is misleading and unfair.

Can you imagine a book about a stingy Jew, a lazy African-American, or a stupid-but-libidinous Italian? Yet this slumming through Irish life has been a best-seller for two years.

Frank McCourts childhood unfortunately is typical of the tough religious hard upbringing in Catholic Ireland in the 1930 and 40's.Unable to make a go of things in America the family return to Ireland. His mother is downtrodden, proud but often desperate, his father a drunkard, not so much violent as absent, and just as likely to spend the weeks wages on Guinness as food.Autobiographical but written almost in story form, the book is breathtaking. McCourt has the knack of bringing bad news at such alarming regularity, that you accept it. You can almost feel the cold, and share the hunger with them. Considering the subject matter and some of the events it is not a sad book, just a great one."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is the autobiography of an American-born child of Irish immigrants who return to their roots and poverty in Ireland.

Through books, Frank develops his survival skills and a sense of hope for a better future. This strengthens his determination to earn enough money to return to America one day. McCourt's ability to illustrate the humor in his tragic childhood is very inspirational, albeit bittersweet.This book should be required reading for all teenagers. The McCourt saga continues in the sequal 'Tis."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt tells the poignant, touching story of his childhood in Ireland. He was from a poor family and his father was a drunkard. While he did not have an easy childhood, he never let go of the dream to make something better of himself and provide a better life for his mother. McCourt's way of writing is exactly like he's telling a story and I had to get used to reading like I was listening to a storyteller. It takes some getting used to, but once you do, you can practically hear his accent."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book offers real insight into the poverty and life of those in Limerick during Frankie's childhood and of the sadness and grief he and his family must have endured in those days. The loss of life, alcohol addiction, evictions, loneliness, and solitude are ever present in this work---along with the struggle to overcome and leave the ugliness behind.Frank's words filled my heart with sadness and at times with joy. I found this work to be incredibly enjoyable! It is a MUST read."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is fantastic. It was recommended to my class by my British Lit teacher. It led you through the hardships faced by immigrants coming to America. The McCourts have to struggle to make ends meet, especially when drinking is such a predominant expenditure. It gives great hope to immigrants as Frank was able to achieve the American Dream."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt grows in us a dark, shadowy, and haunting picture from the very start of the book. Recounting his life in Lemerick, Ireland, McCourt certainly knows how to get through to the mind. The entire book is sadness, and the only thing that's really possible to say is that his writing is absolutely incredible. I was deeply touched by the book and recommend it to anyone. You won't be dissappointed. But be warned- the book is very depressing!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book brought out some of the best emotional writing I have ever had the emotional pleasure to read. I simply could not put it down, finishing it in two days. I have since read it again and it still brought out the extreme pleasure of the first time. Although I was a little dissapointed with the sequel TIS', I read it just the same to find out what had happened to that wonderfully living Frank. I think the hospital scene in ANGELA'S ASHES rivals any heart-wrenching words I have ever had the pleasure to read. This is living poetry."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Mr. McCourts story is astonishing and powerful. The honesty in his voice draws you in and the his tale won't let you go. This is a story that will stay with me always; the images are forever ingrained in my mind. I suggest everyone read it and learn from it. Angela's Ashes will walk you through life in anothers shoes."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Just finished &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; a few minutes ago. Couldn&quot;t wait to pass on my opinion of it. This was my first biography and certainly won&quot;t be my last. Frank McCourt tells his story in such a way it kept me wanting more. Also, my 12 year old daughter would listen intently as I read excerpts to her or retold parts that weren't too explicit for her. We were both in awe of the brevity of the poverty the McCourt family endured. I don't think either of us will look at the unfortunate people of this world or our own hunger the same, ever again. I am getting ready to start the second book &quot;Tis: A Memoir.&quot;"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I loved this book! Yes, this book can be terribly sad and grim at times, but Frank McCourt tells the story and you are living it along with him! I could not put this book down. This was an emotional roller coaster of a book for me. The author just knows how to put pen to paper and let you in on his childhood by putting you there. One minute you are sad because of the terrible events in his life, the next minute you are laughing because of his amazing humor even at the most terrible times that he writes about. I loved his writing style, can't wait to read TIS, and I hope that he continues writing books. I recommend this book for people who don't just want to read about fairy tales and happy endings, but who can appreciate someone telling a life story in a very unique, not always pleasant, but beautifully done way."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book; the writing, the wit. No other book made me laugh and weep like this one has. I found the story of Frank McCourt's childhood experiences in Ireland to be uplifting, and not depressing as others have mentioned. This book should be required reading for both parents and young people of appropriate age, as it could make you a better guardian in the former and more appreciative of a modern society in the latter. This book illustrates how resilient children can be given little hope or soap, and live to tell us. This book is nothing less than the triumph of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt's childhood account still has an im- pact on my life. I was raised in an affluent town near Los Angeles in the 50's and 60's; we never knew people whose children drank tea and bread for breakfast and dinner and all slept on one bed with coats for warmth. Today, as I enjoy the fruits of an education in an upscale neighborhood, in my memory I still recall the humiliation and hunger Frank and his brother had to survive."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A wonderfully written novel about a boys coming of age in poverty stricken Ireland.

No one has mentioned the superior writing style and the unusual techniques of dialogue that were so well put to use in the writing of the book. I pushed the book back several times in awe of the unique style . I believe that everyone has a story in them...but only the blessed few can tell theirs. McCourt not only had the story to tell but the expertize to tell it well. Didn't anyone else notice the fantastic new dialogue method??? To say that this book provoked memories of my childhood...pulledpathos and pain to my heart and yet showered no blame...would be putting it mildly. I am extremely well read. I have favorites. But this story creates more stories...this story creates more questions...this story creates challenges..so, to Mr McCourt...if he were to ever read this,thank you!!

Frank McCourt is a wonderful writer and I would love to see a sequal in the future. I would like to know why he desided on the name of Angela's Ashes. Whatever become of his mother? His father? His brothers? I need to know!!!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Having spent much of my adult life coming to terms with my Irish Catholic Brooklyn childhood, I read Angela's Ashes with foreboding, relief, recognition, and admiration. Before long, I was green with envy as I &quot;lived&quot; Frank's childhood with him.Some readers who live their lives in denial of the cruelties they suffered as powerless wee folk have to run screaming from this memoir in sheer self-preservation. But those of us who have dared to look the truth in the eye can do no less than EMBRACE this book, and surrender to the helpless spasms of sorrow-- and the JOY that such sorrow spawns . . . joy from sorrow--the true mystery of the universe.Many readers and critics remarked with wonder and approval at what they perceived as Frank McCourt's &quot;forgiveness.&quot; However, I do not see his honest, straightforward, witty, unaccusing accounting as forgiveness. What I see in his narration is simply, PROFOUNDLY, mysteriously: LOVE. These other readers perceive his failure to accuse and condemn as forgiveness. I see it as the fact and the truth that his love for his faulty parents got the majority of his sweet, guileless, innocent votes. Love is the microscope through which he recalls his childhood. It is because of this stupendous love that one can witness the ANGUISH of such a childhood. The anguish IS -- that the child LOVES the parents. Not in spite of. Not because of. But SIMPLY. He loves them.I humbly claim kinship to his experience, his pathos, and his love for the parents. Me hat is off to the talent that makes one JEALOUS that one's childhood was not QUITE as bad; and I need TWO heads to take me hat off again --to the talent that made me absolutely REVERE the humble egg--the solitary egg that could be a Thanksgiving Day feast for four brothers! Oops! Make that THREE heads, for what a talent 'tis that makes one weep for the parents, the religion, the society that inflicts such pain and shame upon such gentle souls.One reviewer said that they kept expecting, hoping, for the Father to see the light and transform the lives of his family. That critique made me realize that that was the key to the mystery of this boy's love, this man's abiding love: we dream of 100% parental aptitude; in this man's early life we are tempted to accept, indeed to revel, in 50% parental effort. But the amazing fact o' the matter is that this profound accounting of a life shows that a mere 10% could have made a monumental difference toward childhood happiness. (I realize that this is off the point, but it is a philosophical observation that I could not resist.)While I am eternally indebted to Frank McCourt for my newly acquired reverence for the egg, as well as all the other material wonders of my adult life, I must, however reluctantly, reprimand him for omitting from his flawless report the tattered, crotchless underpants of my own Brooklyn, Irish, Catholic-school youth.Love ya, Frank. If I were twenty years younger I'd let you have my children.Now, HOW do I entice others to read this marvelous memoir? Maybe with the message that I enclosed when I sent me mither the book: You'll cry.You'll laugh.You'll commit suicide"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"It's not often that I search the web for more informationabout a writer of a book (then again, it's not often awriter like McCourt shows up out of nowhere), but Ifound this:http://www.annonline.com/interviews/960913/It's a 47-minute interview of McCourt in RealAudio.The first half is, frankly, predictable, but thesecond half finds him verbally &quot;penning&quot; more jewels.Now that I know he has an Irish accent, as if thatshould matter, I'm more interested in the audio version.However, I think I'd probably prefer that he remain afaceless, voiceless, and marvelously talented craftsmanof words.Those high school kids he teaches are luckier than theyknow."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I love to read a good book and ANGELA'S ASHES: A MEMOIRis more than a good book, it is a FANTASTIC BOOK and a captivating story. From the moment I opened tothe first page until I (sadly) reached the last I was delighted by the author's voice. This is the type of novel that even while I wasnot reading and busy doing other things, I was thinking about this story and what was to happen to this family. I finished in 2 daysand was sorry there was not more. This is a terrific story about sad and dificult life told without anger and without expecting pity. The author has awonderful voice and a natural ability to tell a story in away that will draw you in and make you want to read on.READ THIS NOVEL!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes, the first in a series of three, contains the memoirs of Frank McCourt. Written straight from the heart, it is a chilling and unforgettable book. Born to Irish parents, Malachy and Angela McCourt, Frank's book begins in America, moves on to Ireland and eventually works its way back to America.Angela's Ashes is filled with strife, poverty, death, despair and sickness. What is also born of McCourt's experiences is hope. Achieving what Frank McCourt has managed to do with his life, is almost unfathomable, when you read about his childhood and his alcoholic father who is absent more than present. I am not an emotionally charged person who cries over a book or movie, but this book did bring tears.What I enjoyed most about the book, was the smooth flowing writing style and lovely Irish lilt. Frank never condemns his father for seldom sending money or the poverty and despair in which they were raised. Rather, he takes a lesson from his childhood and finds the fortitude to become the highly educated, successful man he is today. Hats off to Frank MacCourt, a man who overcame adversity against all odds and accomplished what many others in similar circumstances may only dream of doing.Also recommended are his two sequels, \\"Tis\\" and \\"Teacher Man,\\" the latter soon to be released in paperback."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"What's fascinating about Frank McCourt's story telling is that it is non-pretentious, honest, and humorous. This is a heart-warming chronicle of love for family, the struggle to survive the day-to-day battles with poverty, and dreams fulfilled. This is a story of a boy who matured into manhood early, owing to his desire to give his family a better life. It's such a joy to read this book, because as I've learned, a cheerful disposition and positive attitude, can motivate one to persevere and pursue one's cherished dreams even amidst difficulties."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt's book is the most sensitive and honest memoirs I have read to date. McCourt does not pine for the reader's sympathy, but instead writes his memories as a child in a very matter-of-fact style. He is a boy who knows no other life, and is making the best of what he does know. A boy who loves his family and friends despite their many shortcomings. A boy who finds happiness and joy in the simple things in life. From this, we (especially Americans) can all learn a lot. Because McCourt wrote in this style, at times, I found myself on the brink of sadness, laughter, embarrassment and anger at the same moment. How could a boy write so lovingly about a father so neglectful of his family? How was he able to find any humor in the midst of such suffering? The answers to these elements are what make Frank McCourt's writing so meaningful.I must admit that for the first part of the book I had trouble understanding why McCourt's writing was so fragmented. But as I continued to read, I actually felt myself entering mid-twentieth century Ireland, one with its people and culture. At that point, I realized that this was the way the book had to be written for the reader to truly live the experience. I chuckled to myself for ever doubting McCourt's style.In conclusion, even if you are unable to glean the bits of humanity from Angela's Ashes, it is still definitely worth the read for the sensational storytelling alone. I look forward to reading the other books in McCourt's repertoire."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"There is no substitute for hearing Frank McCourt speak to you, in his own voice, his own words, his own story. Even if you have read the book, you will find fresh enjoyment and an incomparable entertainment experience through listening to Angela's Ashes on audio. McCourt breathes warmth, humor and personality into his reading in such a way that is is more like having a cup a tea -- or at times, a pint of Guiness -- with the author in person as he recalls both the humor and tragedy in his life with neither guile nor bitterness. Anything more I can add to this review will be superfluous after this caveat. Do not deny yourself this (albiet onesided) conversation with a truly admirable man."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is a remarkable memoir in which the author, Frank McCourt, uses an abundance of literary devices to convey the dpressing story of his Irish Catholic childhood. Through his themes, contrasts, and symbolism, McCourt creates a memoir that remains with the reader and teaches us all about the circumstances of life that he faced growing up in Limerick, Ireland. The title of the book is derived from the ashes that fall from Angela's cigarettes and those in the fireplace that she stares at bleakly. The entire setting of the narrative feels draped in ash-dark, decrepit, weak, and lifeless. Angela's ashes also represent her crumbling hopes. Her dreams of raising a healthy family with a supportive husband have withered and collapsed, leaving her only with cigarettes and the smoldering ashes of a fire for warmth.In addition to the symbolism of Angela's ashes, McCourt also provides the River Shannon. Frank's outlook on life matures during his childhood and adolescence. Initially, the river symbolizes Limerick's bleakness and the brooding desolation of his childhood. Frank associates the river with the endless rain that causes so much sickness. However, when Frank grows older, he begins to see the river as a route out of Limerick. As a result, it comes to a symbolic escape, movement and freedom. This is only one of the many literary devices employed by McCourt to strenghten his novel. Also through the many day-to-day situations in McCourt's life, he provides the reader with an emotional outlook on the Irish culture, at least of those who were impoverished. By setting up the entire narrative through literary devices, Frank McCourt has ultimately provided several layers to the story, which can be uncovered when the reader is ready and willing to contemplate the many meanings of his symbolic story."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"It's a shame that this book was written over 10 years ago and I've only discovered it now (but then I would've probably been too young to appreciate the intrinsic value of the novel.)Angela's Ashes has stirred up so many emotions inside me, emotions that I didn't even know existed. The book just deals with so many themes and issues in depth, you get the feel that you're actually there and grew up in those times. But throughout all the characters difficulties you can't help but keep that occasional grin on your face because of Frank McCourt's ability to find humor in these dire situations. This book was so remarkable 3/4 of the way through I really didn't want it to end so I tried to stall just to savor the last moments. I have nothing but praise for the author with his technique and style of storytelling combined with that ever prevalent Irish wit.Angella's Ashes is one of those books that no one should go through life without reading. Yes it's that good."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"It is so fascinating to read the book which combines humor, sadness, cruelty, and everything else. What touched me the most was the fact how Frank McCourt writes the events from the child's point of view... such simple things that catch the attention of a child and how different and full of mysteries life seems when you are young. Honesty to the fullest in this memoir! (sometimes maybe a bit too much) I also enjoyed the presentation of irish life! and how ironic it seems that no matter how poor you are you just don't want to admit it! (the moment when Frank's father refuses to go gather coal, and of course many others)enjoy"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This memoir is one of the most captivitating stories I have yet to encounter. In it, Frank tells the story of his childhood in Ireland with an alcoholic father, dying siblings, poverty, and a mother with her own problems. The degree of hardship will tug on anyone's heart and encourage with Frank's constant hope for something better.However, what I found most refreshing about this memoir was Frank McCourt's earliest memories of his childhood. He manages to convey these memories exactly how I imagine a child would view them. It almost seems as if he started writing this at the age of three. Although I cannot relate to the abject poverty and hardship the author experienced, I find myself relating to the child he portrays. Mr. McCourt reminds us all of those quirky behaviors and thought patterns that we all experience as a child.I wholeheartedly recommend this to everyone."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a rare autobiography where you are given the subject's eyes and ears to experience, seemingly first-hand, their unimaginable and tragic reality. McCourt describes everything in its raw form, as if straight from his senses to the page, without any filtering in between.Frank McCourt grew up in Ireland in a very poor family, his parents loved him, but they could not provide for him or his many sublings. This is perhaps the first story and can recall which so clearly states that loving a child is not enough, rather to be a good parent you must be able to provide for them financially.This book is not all depressing, and at times it is completely hilarious. And in the back of your mind, it's always comforting to know that eventually the little boy will grow up to become a best-selling author, but try not to think about the other 99% of the poor children that never get out."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I couldn't put this book down.

It is probably the best book I have ever read. Everyone should read it!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"These harsh memoirs of a miserable Irish catholic childhood centre around a totally irresponsible alcoholic, but catholic, father. Bawling nationalist slogans, he prefers to be drowned in alcohol, rather than to buy food for his wife and many children: 'I didn't know how a man in his right mind can leave a wife and family to starve and shiver in a Limerick winter.'This suicidal behaviour even prevents his children to have a good education, which is a vital national power factor.But otherwise, he remains through and through a 'good' catholic (you may have sex, but it must be with profit).His belief is however heavily tainted by protestant fatalism: 'Dear God, this is what you want, isn't it? You want my son Eugene. You took his brother, Oliver. You took his sister, Margaret. Dear God above, I don't know why children have to die, but that is Your will.'The overall situation in Ireland before World War II was appalling: unemployment, hunger, poverty, alcoholism, illnesses, a high rate of child mortality, the hypocrisy of politicians, the rich and the clergy.Children fought among themselves for apple peels. Some were barefoot the whole year long.Catholic fundamentalism and sexual repression were more important than food, shelter and education.The school system for the poor was disastrous, run by brutal and stupid teachers, except one: 'this free independent Ireland that keeps a class system foisted on us by the English, that are throwing our talented children on the dungheap.'Only a few members of the lower classes saw through the rampant Pharisaism. One of them was an uncle of the author who teached him a fundamental lesson for confronting life: 'Make up your own mind.'Against all odds, the author took his fate in his own hands.This is a deeply moving and desperate book about the struggle for survival in a family living just above the level of total destitution.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I couldn't put it down. McCourt's style of writing flows at a steady pace that keeps you wanting to know what happens next."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I figured I would pick this book up since I will be living in Ireland for one year. Of course, this book is a very different Ireland from today, but I figured it would answer question's about this generation, and that time.It's told from the perspective of Frank McCourt. The book stretches from the time he's three, to the time he's 16. They move back to Ireland when he's 4 years of age and into even worse poverty than they were in when they lived in New York.The book is not as bleak and awful as I thought it would be. Maybe it's pretty bad and i'm a moron, but I imagined a pretty dark book.Even through the darkness of the book, McCourts humor rings through it in how he perceived things as a child. The dialogue is wonderful. If not made up, it's very captivating.The people that come into little Frank's life are just one jerk or old witchy broad after another, or one Pious schoolmaster or Priest after another. The place he lives is very religious and traditional to the point where McCourt is led to beleive he's doomed to hell for his petty little sins.HIs alcoholic father is portrayed in such a way that I felt awfully sorry for him and actually sort of liked him! THis is despite the fact that he sells the remains of their dead son so he can have money for beer, and despite the fact that he works day in and day out only to spend everything on alchohol till they have absolutely no food, and even despite the fact that he goes to England to find a good paying job, but never sends them back any money! Despite all of this, I REALLY wanted to see his father pull through because he's such a warm and loving character even if he's off his rocker and a total loser.There are so many bad echoes of Frank's past in this book, but i was so intrueged by his style of telling it, as though you know something better is coming.The title, I imagine, probably refers to all the children their family loses throughout the corse of the book; another devestating aspect of the family life.I'm reading \\"T'is\\" right now, which is the sequel to this book, and I love it even better than this book! I can't wait to finish it and I can't wait till \\"The Teacher Man\\" comes out in November."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"As I began to read this memoir I was immediately struck by Frank McCourt's unusual writing style. It occured to me that it resembles the narrative style encountered in Irish pubs. Mr. McCourt's inclusion of Irish speech patterns and patois further added to my reading. This in conjunction with Mr. McCourt's detailed accounting of his formative years lends one the sights and sounds of Limerick at the early part of this century.

His familylife was an extreme - his father was an extreme - the deathof three siblings was an extreme. McCourt does a wonderfuljob portraying his mother's courage and in showing thepsychic baggage the Irish Catholic poor are lumbered with.But this is a mightily flawed book and the acclaim it isreceiving astounds me. The child's point of view is finallytedious and wears us down; the pathos is well-worn andtired; the book lacks any lyricism.

I hope there is more on the way from Mr. McCourt."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angela's Ashes is a book so filled with remorse and sadness, it's amazing that the reader somehow finds themself completely and joyfully satisfied. The novel revolves around the penniless childhood of Frank McCourt and begins in America with four-year-old Frank and his three year-old brother Malachy, who bears the same name as his father, and the infant twins, Eugene and Oliver, and the memories of the baby Margaret, \\"already dead and gone.\\" Your heart goes out to the poor family, blessed with a loving mother, Angela, and yet cursed with a father who means well, but is constantly drunk or yearning for the \\"pint,\\" as they call it. Early in his life, McCourt's family moves to Ireland, with help from his aunts and grandmother. Unfortunately, money is not easily found in Ireland either, and the McCourt family migrates from home to home, barely surviving on the few shillings Malachy McCourt doesn't spend at the local pub. The McCourts experience tragedy upon tragedy. His physical romance with a young lady named Theresa Carmody sick with consumption, his unfortunate habit to \\"interfere with himself,\\" and the sad moment when in a drunken stupor on his first pint he strikes his own mother causes Frank to fear he is doomed to an eternity in hell. Unbelievably, despite all of the terrible things that happen in Frank's childhood, there are moments described in the book that give the reader a complete sense of joy and hope. I immensely enjoyed this memoir and would recommend it to any reader. I was especially enamored of the style of writing in which Frank McCourt chose to write. The words seemed as if they gently tumbled directly out of the mouth of the seven-year-old Frankie, or mischievously flew from Frank as an thirteen-year-old \\"working man.\\" This novel was exquisitely written and is a jewel to read, as well as a treasure to remember."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"What a ride! You'll laugh, cry, exhilarate, and despair-all on the same page. Trapped in a childhood of extreme poverty in Limerick, Ireland, Frank McCourt not only survives but thoroughly conquers. In the depths of even this much misery, however, there are small mercies and kindnesses and they are not lost on him. This is what gives the book it's humanity-the ability to withstand horrific circumstances through humor, determination, and forgiveness-and triumph with soul intact. And the people! They seem more alive in ink than most of us seem in flesh."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This has to be one of the best books I've read in a LONG time. It was refreshing to find a book that could keep my wandering mind and High School attention span in check. The trials of the Mc Court family were nothing to laugh at but I often found myself trying very hard to surppres laughter while reading in a classroom where you could easily hear a pin drop. The humerous sections were not based around the events that were taking place, but more around how Frank, as a child, viewed what was going on. The McCourt children knew very little of life and death. What they did know was taught to them by their drunken father and manic depressive mother. Frank seemed to have a slight grasp on the idea that once his younger siblings died he would never see them again, yet he still had many innocent questions. At a very young age Frank was questioning how death happened. He saw a dog get hit by a car and bleed to death. Later on he made another child bleed on the playground. Thinking that blood was death after seeing the dog die from it, Frank feared that he had killed his friend when in all actuality it was a minor injury. Later on in the novel when others take ill and die Frank questions why there was no blood and yet they died. The lack of knowledge and simple questions that Frank had as a child added a great deal to the novel. It was almost depressing when I realized that he would never get those questions answered and just keep wondering. While reading I found myself often forgetting that this was a true story and wondering how an author could come up with a plot line with this many twists and turns. All in all I LOVED this book. It earned each and every one of the five stars not only because it kept my attention for longer than humanly possibly, but because of the way McCourt took tragic events and somehow made the reader believe that for a split second something comical was going on."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Charles Dickens once said, &quot;In the little world in which children have their existence, whoever brings them up, there is nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt, as injustice. It may be only a small injustice the child can be exposed to; but the child is small; and its world is small.&quot; Angela's Ashes amounts to a brilliant recollection of childhood injustice which is indeed... LARGE! As I read the book, I was appalled at the depth of poverty that Frank McCourt and his family endured, and yet, I can't count the number of times I actually laughed out loud at the &quot;way&quot; in which the story is told. I've never read anything so simultaneously light and weighty. McCourt is witty, and is always in character, and that character is the child who was an eye-witness to every event. (An intriguing, fiercely narrative writing style is consistent throughout the book. ie., there are never any quotation marks).The story is a powerfully moving disclosure of the perils of alcoholism. If it wasn't for the fact that Frank's father could not walk PAST a pub, the family would not have been so destitute. What little money Malachy McCourt earns is forever spent on alcohol, and the amazing thing is that it is spent shamelessly. Mother and children practically starve while dad staggers home in a drunken stupor night after night. Frank says of his father's false promises... &quot;He'll give us a nickel for ice cream if we promise to die for Ireland and we promise but we never get the nickel.&quot; Injustice.In my opinion, the redeeming majesty of this memoir is that through it we learn a wondrous fact... that shamelessness, irresponsibility, and stupidity do not necessarily have to be handed down to the next generation. Frank broke the mold, and chose self-awareness as his aspiration. I believe that the crucial turning point in his life came when, at the age of eleven he was convalescing at a hospital and came to the conclusion that &quot;it's lovely to know the world can't interfere with the inside of your head.&quot; As readers of Angela's Ashes, we become the grateful recipients of this precocious revelation.Mr. McCourt has received much recognition for his book, and all of it is deserved. I have no idea what he has gained monetarily from its publication, but somehow I think it's a bit more than his aforesaid promised nickel. Way to go. You are an inspiration to the world."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Even at the most difficult of times, there is always hope for better to come. The narrator of the story, Frank McCourt, conveys this throughout his acclaimed memoir Angela's Ashes. Born in Depression-era Brooklyn and raised in Limerick, Ireland, Frank lived in poverty throughout most of his life. His mother, Angela, would sing to her children at night, giving them hope that one day there would be enough food and happiness for everyone, even though there was barely any hope left for herself. It is the coming-of-age story of Frank McCourt as he grows from an impoverished childhood to a maturity at the age of nineteen, when he is able to plan his own course in life. Before the age of ten, Frank is a witness to the death of his sister and two brothers. His father does not work much and when he does, he spends all of his earnings drinking at the local pub. He also is fond of telling stories and reminding the children that they hopefully will die for Ireland. Through all of the difficult times he had to endure, he grows spiritually, morally and intellectually. His family remains strong in spirit even through the poverty, near starvation and harassment.This wonderfully written and deeply moving memoir is a story that changes your perspective and captivates your heart. It is narrated in the first person and is told in the present tense. This kind of immediacy centers on the reality of the child's experiences and avoids the impression, as the past tense might, that the story is being reflected upon by an adult on his childhood. The language used throughout the memoir is informal and common. Regional, Irish phrases, and vulgar expressions are used often to convey the way people really talked during the author's childhood in Limerick. Both tears and smiles are brought together as close as they be in this style of writing. An example of type of language used: \\"The master says it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith and dad says it's a glorious thing to die for Ireland and I wonder if there's anyone in the world who would like us to live. My brothers are dead and my sister is dead and I wonder if they died for Ireland or the Faith. Dad says they were too young to die for anything. Mam says it was disease and starvation and him never having a job. Dad says: \`Och, Angela,' puts on his cap and goes for a long walk\\" (113). The theme of poverty is persistent throughout the memoir. To the people in Limerick, poverty is accepted as a fact of life; there is nothing much to help the poor out of their misery.The title of the memoir indicates the ashes that fall from Angela's cigarettes and those in the fireplace that she continuously stares at blankly. Her ashes represent her crumbling hopes of raising a healthy family with a supportive husband. These dreams are withering and have almost died so that all she is left with are the smoldering ashes from the fire that provides them warmth. Frank grows to learn that he must take on the responsibility of keeping his own dreams alive in the end. At the end of the book, he leaves his broken family behind in order to make himself whole again in America."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read!Frank McCourt writes about his youth growing up in NYC and Ireland. He lives in near desperate conditions because of a father who could not keep a job and could not resist &quot;the drink.&quot; Yet young McCourt does not quite despair because of the squalor in which he is living. He finds humor in his daily life, which he describes in much incredibly fascinating and delightful detail. This book follows him through the addition of brothers and a sister to his family, followed by the sad early death of too many of them, the sacrifices of dignity his mother makes to maintain a home and food and clothing, his adventures with local kids, mishaps at school, the threat of eternal damnation he feels for all of the naughty things he does, a number of jobs to help aid his family upon the departure of an alcohol-enslaved father, and finally his own departure to embark upon a life of his own.Frank McCourt's young outlook on life is so unique and enjoyable, you will be delighted by his ever hopeful perspective. The writing is hilarious. You will chuckle at even the little things, including how he refers, in his Irish way, to things as &quot;some class of...&quot; this or that, and his dirty boy stuff as &quot;interferring with himself&quot; or &quot;the excitement.&quot; Frank McCourt shares with his readers an honest, detailed, and humorous memoir of his boyhood.I think everyone should read this book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Like some reviewers, I found it hard to get past the initial extreme emphasis on poverty. However, poverty is not the point. Hope is the point. Reading this book can be a harrowing experience at times, but is ultimately a joyful one. Anyone who came away from this book with a sense of dread missed the point. The story may be sad, but Mr. McCourt writes it with such beauty and forgiveness that it is a cause for celebration."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Frank McCourt piles on so many examples of the overwhelming poverty he experienced during his childhood that I almost put down the book in despair after reading just forty pages. I'm glad that I didn't.Despite the misery of his childhood, McCourt's memoir includes a number of lively and humorous vignettes. Two of my favorites are his the account of his attempts at Irish dancing, and the hilarious description of Frank's ill-fated first Communion.Nevertheless, McCourt does not mask his anger at the institutions that failed him and his dyfunctional family. School teachers (with one exception) were uninspiring, church people shut the door in his face or expected the poor to grovel for handouts, government officials lacked empathy.McCourt doesn't fall into the trap of over-generalization, though. Most people, despite their flaws, have their redeeming qualities in McCourt's account. Most notably, his hard-drinking, criminally irresponsible father also told beautiful stories, regaling Frank with tales of Irish heroes. No hero himself, McCourt's father passed his gift for telling an enthralling story to his son."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I bought the book thinking it would be a very light reading material which I heard from those who read it. I don't know how one can write with such humor and lightness about a very unfortunate life... McCourt's attitude is very much reflected in the way he had written the book.. No bitterness, no remorse... I laughed and cried while reading it...... an excellent read!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I was told about this book in my Creative Non-Fiction class at OSU and decided to pick it up one day. Then I couldn't put it down. Mr. McCourt's style is perfect: other than the first few pages explaining how his parents met and married and had him Mr. McCourt NEVER speaks outside of his age. When he is four you see his world through the eyes of a four year old. When he is ten you see the world through the eyes of a ten year old. Never once does he &quot;reflect&quot; on his life as a child at all; no, instead he re-lives his childhood. This makes the story absolutely immediate. When I tell others of this book I tell them not to bother with borrowing the book at the library--buy it and buy it now! It's a book you'll want to keep."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I enjoyed reading Angela's Ashes, however, I was rather annoyed by the ending. Never have I seen such a blatant attempt to &quot;force&quot; a sequel! I mean, Frank is on the boat, he's coming to America, and then....that's it! What sort of a denouement is that! None! It's as if Frank McCourt said, &quot;OK, now you have to buy my next book!&quot;Two other comments/questions: 1) How in the world was Angela able to afford Frank's dancing lessons when her children were dying of starvation/malnutrition? 2) Why is the book called Angela's Ashes? (Does anyone know? Has the author ever said?)"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"To be as terse as possible: this is one of the best books I've ever read, and I've read quite a few. I am Irish American, and I taught English in the high schools of New York City for 33 years, so obviously I have something in common with Mr. McCourt, but most literature about Ireland concentrates on its wars and on romance. No one I know of has ever told the true story of poverty in Ireland and of the indifference and arrogance of the church. It was only after I finished the book that I realized that the church had done nothing to help the children who came to school without shoes. They never provided even the worst of old shoes for them but simply let them go without. That, and the priest rewarding students with an apple peel they all lusted for are enough to tell the story right there. But it's McCourt's style that really attracts readers to the book and has created such a powerful word of mouth that his story has truly become a modern classic. Thanks, Frank! Can't wait to see the movie and to read &quot;T'is&quot;"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I am an avid reader of non-fiction and find this book to be the most haunting story I have ever experienced. I had an emotional roller coaster of reactions to every line I read. Being of Irish/Catholic descent I recognized the tragedy of alcoholism and the &quot;old school&quot; tactics of the Catholic Church. I was tormented by the plight of his mother and the children starving, living in vermin, and still the father (like so many men in their circumstances) takes the &quot;dole&quot; money to drown out all feeling. Mr. McCourt describes the settings, the essence of the people involved with such vividness that I can put myself right in the story. He filled my 5 senses with all the smells, tastes, sights, sounds, and sensations of his home on the lane that I am experiencing the nausea, the hopelessness and the empty growling stomach. His mother grasping to the continual hope that her husband will share the reality of relentless poverty and him always escaping in pubs, daydreams, and finally abandoning them for a job in England fills the reader with unbearable frustration. I was shocked to see the unfairness of the male dominated world in our century's beginning both in America where the story begins and into Ireland where most of his childhood was spent. All Americans should read this account and they would see how much they take for granted. I hope there is a sequel to this book. Mr. McCourt, I want to know what happened to Angela, Malachy, and everyone else. He exemplifies the talents of a good writer by making the reader want more and more."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Reading Angela's Ashes produced emotions in me that no other book has ever done. Imagine a childhood having three younger brothers, living in a damp, one bedroom apartment without a restroom, eating one or no meal a day (a pig's head for Christmas Dinner), and a father that squanders the family's minuscule income on &quot;pints&quot;. Like an adult, at three years old Frank took care of his brothers; he cleaned their &quot;arses&quot; and and dreamed of the day that he could make a little money and support his family. McCourt's life story provoked so much sympathy inside of me that I wished I had the power to travel back in time to give him my only sandwich for lunch so he wouldn't starve. One must read to believe that a person could survive such a hard childhood. Easing this sadness, Frank McCourt uniquely adds humor with the thoughts he had as a child like excusing his father's mistakes for being &quot;dropped on his head&quot; as a kid. Yes, I enjoyed the book because Frank's life story made me cry and laugh, but I loved it because it made me more caring of other people in life and realize that if Frank McCourt could overcome his hardships, anyone can. That is the potential power of Angels's Ashes. It deserves a perfect 10, and I think &quot;Joseph, Mary, and Jesus&quot; would agree. Brian 2"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"If the extreme poverty endured by Frank McCourt was responsible for producing such a gifted writer, then perhaps a few current best-selling authors should have grown up in Limerick, Ireland, wearing tires for shoe soles and being forced to vacate the bottom floor of their apartment during the winter due to the flooded conditions therein.The most striking thing about &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot;, besides the lyrical prose, is the pervasive tones of forgiveness and love. Nowhere are these more evident than in the passages describing little Frankie McCourt having to hunt through all the pubs on his street to find his father, who is somewhere drinking away 5 pounds sent to the family in honor of a new baby. The reader is impressed by the lack of bitterness in the grown Frank McCourt; he simply tells what happened with warmth and humor and compassion.Whether the reader is laughing at the author's frank, hilarious descriptions of his own sexual awakening, or shaking his or her head over the passages describing the deaths of his two brothers and only sister, they will, as they close the book, wonder immediately when the sequel will be available."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"For the reader who is not Irish, Catholic, raised in poverty and abuse, or the child of an alcoholic parent, Angela's Ashes still provides flashes of recognition because it speaks eloquently about what it means to be a child -- to both accept and be confused about the behavior of adults, to misunderstand and feel misunderstood, to feel shame and embarrassment, to taunt or be taunted by peers, to experience deep disappointments or delight in simple pleasures, to stumble innocently into situations that are either immensely fortunate or comically tragic, to resist and succumb to temptation, to mourn loss, feel regrets and wonder if you are the only person in the world who feels the way you do. This is also a book about what it means to be a parent--to have pride in one's children, great hopes for them and miserable feelings of failure when things go terribly wrong.Angela's Ashes is an antithesis to the victim literature prominent during this decade, although it contains all the necessary ingredients: physical and mental abuse by family, friends, teachers and priests; alcoholism that robs the family of food, dignity and stability; children and adults who live and die without hope, in conditions of unspeakable misery. But while this book has victims, it is more densely populated with heroes who declare their aliveness in small, but triumphant ways. As the Irish cope with unbelievable living and working conditions, they laugh at the absurdity of life and infuse bits of meaning into the worst that happens to them. What creates this hardiness, this softening of experience with humor, this drive for survival in the midst of squalor? How does this child, for God's sake, continue with intelligence and sanity in situations that have destroyed the adults around him? These are the questions that are addressed in Angela's Ashes by a protagonist who refuses to be a victim and thereby saves himself from disabling pity and us from the crippling ennui that results from an endless recitation of unaddressable human grief. Few survive childhood unmarked by physical or emotional scars,intentionally or unintentionally inflicted. Frank McCourt has obviously spent his adulthood reflecting on his experience and remarked in an interview that he had to tell this story or burst. But he does not tell it to court pity. Perhaps, like accounts of the Holocaust, his story puts our own griefs into perspective and encourages us to heal our wounds by looking at the absurd nature of much of life. Pain is not funny, but our interpretation of it can lesson its influence as a driving force in our lives."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"From the minute I saw the cover of the book, I thought I wonder...what could this book be about.

His story begins in the time of the Depression when he was born to his poor recent immigrant parents, Angela and Malachy in Brooklyn. Frank is brought up in a home with siblings that he is forced to take care of and watch die. He must be his mother's strength as she waits for her drunken husband to come home every night with out food. Little Frank continues to have hope as he travels to his parent's homeland of Ireland. As his dreams of a rich life in his new home diminish due to his father's continual drunkenness he finds optimism in his new siblings who he believes are brought to him by an Angel to the Seventh Step in his run down home, and through his father's tales of Cuchulian, who saved Ireland. Every week Angela is forced to beg to a council for food and clothing. Because of the overwhelming poverty in their small town Frank learns to live with shoes repaired with tires, a pig's head for Christmas dinner, and having to take two jobs to provide for his family.This book is recommended because of the genius of Frank McCourt's writing. He is able to capture the essence of a poor Irishman's life with humor, satire, and strife, while at the same time telling a touching story. As he writes of his everyday life the accents and culture of the Irish can be felt. McCourt also brings out all emotions from laughing at his father who would make him and his brother wake up to tell his \\"Pride for Ireland\\" to crying as Malachy holds his dead daughter in his arms due to lack of medical attention. This book also opens eyes to the life of poverty, and the obstacles that are overcome. Before reading this account I was never aware of the struggles that people must go to if they do not have money. The fact that Angela was forced to get down on her hands and knees and had to beg for money to go to the doctor is preposterous. I was educated and my eyes were opened to a whole new world as I read the horrific details of having to live in solely the upstairs of the house because of flooding.At the same time that this book was entertaining and heartfelt, it is incredibly depressing. Learning about the grim realities of Frank McCourt's childhood was extremely difficult. I often would have to put the book down because of the immense details we would get into about his life. For example, when his father finally got a job in England and was supposed to send money home. The whole family would wait by the door for the postman to come baring money. Day after day there would be no money. Reading about the hunger they were forced to go to because of a father's addiction, really stings the heart.Angela's Ashes is the best portrayal of the difficult life uneducated poor people lead in order to survive, while at the same time providing insight into the Irish culture, and creating a moving, earnest story."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Angelas Ashes is not an easy book to read.

Told with a warmth and humor that only he can muster in the face of so much tragedy and personal hardship. This is the only book I've ever read where the the tough circumstances of the characters lives, as bitter a pill as they are, are offset by the warmth, faith and humor in the storytellers voice.

And so, the family, without any income except from what is gained through various charities poor-relief schemes, and occasional help from begrudging relatives, struggle to survive. A state not helped by Frank's alcoholic father, who can never hold a job, drinks the dole, and never sends any money back from England where he gets a full time job in a munitions factory during the war.Frank, himself, survives Typhoid and Conjunctivitis, and as soon as he can leaves school, in spite of his schoolmasters' advice, to earn enough money as a telegram boy and return to America, and maybe have his mother, Angela, and his remaining brothers join him in the future.And that's about it basically. Some readers will find the book to be a source of reminders of what life was like for them or their forebears in the Ireland of that time. Some will take it as a simple \`against all odds story'. For me though, there were elements, which were part of my own upbringing: the rebel songs like Roddy McCorly, Kevin Barry, etc., my dad ( who coincidentally comes from Antrim, and is a retired school teacher like Frank ) would play on a, BSR Monarch, record player at home. But unlike Frank, I haven't been asked to die for Ireland. But Frank has another message, which is - I think: Ireland, I owe you nothing.

To also be starving, cold, and dressed in rags yourself is a horrible life to have to live. Yet Angela's sense of duty and obligation to her children keeps her from giving up on herself and her children. When they were starving, she was desperate to feed them. When they had no shoes she would swallow what little pride she had and beg for them. Yet she wasn't a martyr she wasn't noble and selfless all the time. She smoked her woodbines, and laid in bed for days without doing a thing. Then she would feel guilt in the few &quot;luxeries&quot; that she took. Not only does this book make you completely thankful for everything and evryone in your life, it lets you see what love can sometimes be. In Angela's world, love is pain. It is the pain of knowing that everyone you love and who you want to be happy is suffering. She wants to help them and to bring in money to feed them, but the fact that if something happened to her at work no one would be left to care for them, beg for them, cook for them (when they had something to cook), shelter them, and love them. Though Angela could barely provide these things for them herself, she didnb't trust anyone else to do it for her either. In order to preserve her children, Angela must preserve herself. When she can't get a job, it hurts, when she can't control her husband it hurts, and when she eats it hurts because she knows her children are hungry and they need the food, but she can't give it all to them. SHe must keep herself alive in order to keep her children alive. Angela does not live for herself or her own happiness. She lives out of obligation to her children, so that they can escape the pain and suffering which has become her life. Frank says, &quot;My mother's troubles started the day she was born.&quot; With a life like hers, full or guilt and pain and suffering,death is her only escape."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"As soon as I read the first few pages of this riveting memoir I was intrigued. Frank McCourt made me feel the hunger, the humilation and even the laughter that he felt as he told his troublesome childhood. Even the writing style Frank McCourt used intrigued me, he used no quotations, no real sentence structure and threw in little Irish poems through out the book. The poems at first I skipped then I began to read them and they added a lot to my experince of the book. I began to enjoy his style as the book progressed and now quotes bother me and seem to be a waste. I really enjoyed his sentence structure it flowed very smoothly to me. After reading this book I will never say we have nothing to eat in the house unless we have absolutely have nothing to eat in the house. This was the struggle that little Frankie had every day growing up in the slums of Ireland. I loved his humour as well as the sadness he made me feel. Frank McCourt had me feeling that my life is quite good. One thing I loved about the book was that no matter how many times Frank's Dad spent the dole on the pint he still seemed to love him to this day and had no hatred. This book was one of the most interesting and inspirational books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a remarkable tale of the strength of the human spirit and character. As a teacher, I have seen first hand the strength of our nation's children. Some of the obstacles they face on a daily basis were not even a flicker in my eye as a child. Angela's Ashes shows this perseverance through the eyes of an Irish child. Run, run to the store for a copy."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is by far one of the best I've read. It has an honest value to it that almost makes you wonder about the things taken for granted in our culture today. I would recommend this book for anyone above the age of 16, it will truly change your perspective of poverty, and the humor around everyday family life."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In the beginning of the book it was absolutely amazing, lyrical, and heartfelt, I couldn't put it down. The wording of all the mishaps occurring in their lives took me into another world, and I felt as if I was in the time of the depression feeling what they are. This never happens. But as I got more into the book I realized that its very repetitious yes very meaningful but yet they have a tendency to repeat that they are poor, that the father Malachy is a drunk and steals the tole to buy a pint, and when he comes home singing Kevin Barry he makes the children say that they will die for Ireland. It's getting a little too old for me. I realize they are poor and that's sad but there is no improvement. Something that I was hoping to see as I went a long with the book. Too much tragedy for me.I chose to read this book as a school project. Just the cover intrigued me. I wanted to know more. Especially due to the fact that it's about a Roman Catholic Irish family, which I am myself, also because it is a true story and nothing excites me more then a book about a true story. I figured it could possible inform me of my ancestry's maybe, and pull me into a time of agony, resentfulness etc. I did learn a lot about the time period, but not exactly what I desired. Simply it felt like a chore to finish.Even though I don't exactly care for the book at this point, I would recommend this book to someone who loves tragedy and doesn't mind reading a meaningful, repetitious memoir. The fact that it is a true story could leave you in awe. In fact it did leave a good impression on me. But remember it is a very repetitious book and could bore, towards the end, but it does teach good lesson's about life. Such as never marrying a drunk!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The heart of this book is the character of McCourt's longsuffering mother, Angela. I love her response to her sons when they whine (often with good reason, given the extent of their poverty): \\"I'm sorry for your troubles,\\" Angela says. She teaches her sons to weather the storms of life, for she has certainly weathered a few of her own- an alcoholic husband who cannot pay the bills, the deaths of her young children, the humiliation of begging the Catholic Church for charity to sustain her family. Angela was a saint, and McCourt has written this loving story in honor of his mother.I had heard so many good things about this book that I was actually reluctant to read it. I thought that it could not measure up to the reviews- but it did. McCourt's prose reads like poetry. I encourage the reader to first listen to the CD of McCourt reading Angela's Ashes with his Irish tongue.

The author's prose is simply stunning. Any writer or student of writing cannot help but be awed by the manner in which Mr. McCourt is able to express his thoughts so beautifully. As most people know, the story is about his youth in Ireland. And yet, it has an appeal to everybody, regardless of culture or background.

Although I empathize with the characters, I did not feel that the writing in a literary sense was anything remarkable - I am surprised it won the Pulitzer! I felt sorry for the suffering of the author and the family but having grown up in a third-world country in Asia, I could not help but think of countless similar children and families who experience the same suffering but have not even a hope or dream of ever being able to go to America to improve their lot in life.

I know it sounds trite, but this book made me appreciate how lucky I really am. On literary style, I am an eclectic reader, but tend to judge biographies by how closely they approximate fiction in terms of plot and character development. Angela's Ashes definitely passed the test -- it read like a well-developed novel. Also, I sensed that McCourt tried to distance himself somewhat from his own feelings about his family members to present a less partial view, though he was not always successful in this regard.I am definitely looking forward to his next work."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Mr. McCourt (I can't think of him as Frank) was my English teacher at Stuyvesant High School in 1979-80, where I had two terms of creative writing with him. He told a number of the stories that ended up in Angela's Ashes (and will no doubt be in 'Tis) to our class, and we all urged him to write them down, to write a book. It sure took him long enough, but it was well worth the wait. That he survived a childhood he had no right surviving and then wrote about it without anger and animosity is a tribute to a great man, a great teacher, and a great book. It proves that the human spirit lives within us all, and triumphs over adversity. Mr. McCourt wrote my college recommendation, and I can honestly say that it is due to him that I am a successful Senior Editor at a major publishing house today. Viva McCourt! P.S. A little known fact is that one of Mr. McCourt's favorite authors is Mickey Spillane."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Found the book an all too accurate portrayal of a certain kind of all too prevalent type of craven, selfish Irishman....terribly depressing because of this.

The author is an incredible story teller who can create a sense of reality for the readers to grasp. I cried so much as his story reminded me of the stories my grandparents and parents used to tell me. His stories allow us to be thankful for all that we have and admire the strengths of those who lived during the hard times. I thank Mr. McCourt for sharing his memoir with us and patiently await his next work."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"If you listen to our daily podcasts, you heard us talk about the passing of Frank McCourt -- an event that was, shall we say, overshadowed by the deaths of people like Michael Jackson, Walter Cronkite and Ed McMahon. While he was not as well known as any of those three, McCourt was, in the world of book lovers, one of a kind. He spent most of his life as a school teacher before deciding one day to go ahead and write a memoir of his early life in the extreme poverty of Ireland. His was certainly not the first book on the subject, but it is, arguably, the most lyrical. You simply cannot read \\"Angela's Ashes\\" without hearing his voice. Literally. The Irish lilt comes through beautifully in the writing, making the book itself seem like a rambling reminiscence from a favorite uncle. (Unless your uncle happens to be from Estonia, in which case it probably doesn't.) Still, I defy anyone who claims to be literate and to enjoy reading good books to come away with anything but positive feelings for \\"Angela's Ashes.\\" It's the kind of book that reminds me why I love reading. And if you can read it without developing a bit of a lump in your throat and without laughing at the description of a kid \\"throwing up Jesus Christ,\\" there's probably something wrong with you."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"\\"My father and mother should have stayed in New York where they met and married and where I was born (1930) . . . . When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood. . . Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood. People everywhere brag and whimper about the woes of their early years, but nothing can compare with the Irish version: the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bullying schoolmasters; the English and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years. Above all - we were wet.\\"With a beginning like that, readers have no doubt that they are in for a story like never before. McCourt doesn't disappoint. Three of his six siblings die of malnutrition and disease, and his father never overcomes alcoholism - endlessly disappointing his family by failing to hold a job and drinking whatever money he had, even the welfare support. They live in a house infested with rats and bed bugs, and flooding in the winter. The home was also hindered by being adjacent to a outhouse shared with the neighborhood. Frank displays signs of aptitude noted by the library staff and one of his teachers, yet he's denied help from the Catholic church and alternates between relying on menial jobs (messenger, delivery-boy) and petty crime to feed his mother, himself, and family. Eventually they were evicted after Frank cut down some of the beams for firewood. Fortunately McCourt survived typhoid at age ten, managed to avoid following his father's drive to drink while yet acquiring his talent for storytelling, carried out his ambition to return to America, and didn't allow his childhood experiences to embitter himself or his writing.\\"Angela's Ashes\\" earned the Pulitzer Prize (1997) for McCourt, and sold over 4 million copies."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This audio book was very good....especially entertaining with the author, Frank McCourt, reading it with his Irish accent.

It made me wonder why this award-winning gem never entered my hands before now.Frank's story begins in New York and moves to Limerick, Ireland in a short time-span and ends on a positive note when Frank, now grown, moves back in search of a better life. The narrator makes everyday language appear as though the reader shares the pain, poverty, sadness, survival and death. The joyful moments are far and few between as the family suffers the consequences of their father's selfish ways in his alcoholic haze, drinking his pay check, week after week, causing their mother to seek and beg for a mere pittance of food for her hungry children. The power of love prevails all of life's heartbreaks as this family joins together in one crisis after another.It's unique because this one man's story in a fight for survival couldn't possibly be duplicated with as much humour as Frank McCourt weaved into it. He turned a life of heartbreak into a joy for the reader and I recommend it for centuries to come. It has inspired me to search for the sequel called 'Tis."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"My first experience with Frank McCourt.

Frank McCourt's book helped me understand Catholic absurdity and contradiction more so than James Joyce's book. I loved both books equally, but Angela's Ashes struck a cord with me. At an early age an Irish youngster has the priest preaching hellfire and eternal damnation for the slightest wayward thought. Then, when the child grows into a young man, on his knees, depressed to near mental anguish and mental illness about a feared sin, the priest says, \\"Oh--no, God forgives you\\", and \\"you need to forgive yourself\\". Suddenly, the friend who died isn't in hell, she's in heaven after all. Absurd Catholic contradiction.Membership in the Catholic church is dwindling. As long as Irish authors such as Frank McCourt and James Joyce use their writing to state their case, I predict more Catholics will exit in mass from the pews.What Ashes? Where were the Ashes? What did Ashes have to do with the book?The perverted little treats written into the story on the last 62 pages may sell books, but I've never seen teenage boys or men do the things McCourt and Joyce suggest."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read this book 12 years ago and reread it again this week after Frank McCourt passed.

I didn't want to let little Frankie McCout go, I guess.This memoir of poverty, alcoholism, disease and death would be compelling in the hands of any decent writer, but in the hands of the sublimely talented Mr. McCourt, it is a masterpiece. That he can write so touchingly, forgivingly, and hilariously of his miserable boyhood without a trace of self-pity is astonishing.What I liked most was how he was able to get into the head of the boy he was from ages 3-19 and relate exactly how it felt at each stage. It's almost as if he wrote this memoir right as he was living it -- the persepective was that seamless and true.I could talk about the book's lyricism and beauty and strength of spirit, but it comes down to this: he brought these characters alive for me. And I will never forget the one-word final chapter that brought me to tears. One word! How does he do it? Long live Mr. McCourt, a new shining star among many fine Irish writers. I hope we have not heard the last of him."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"It will be one of my all-time favorites! The characters were well developed---I truly felt like I knew them and wanted to help them. The story line progressed into the finale leaving my cheeks wet from tears."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I read review after review about \\"Angela's Ashes\\" saying that the book about Frank McCourt's life is not truth but mearly a well written, sad, fictional story. In fact even some people that grew up with Frank McCourt say it isn't true at all. I did some research on Frank McCourt. He grew up Irish and Catholic in Limerick Ireland. I did too but not in Ireland. I grew up in Ohio. However, I know there are things like abuse that are not talked about either in the church or in the community. I couldn't go to my priest or my teachers at school and tell them I was getting beat every other day. Well yes, I suppose I literally could have but I doubt they would do anything back then. Priests and nuns back in the day were really mean people. If you are not Catholic then you do not understand. It was 35 years ago for me and perhaps now things are different. Up until the 1990's people didn't care nor did the police or community leaders. My step-father had the police called on him many times but either my mother would lie or most of the time the police did nothing. As far as I remember charges were never filed against him even after my brothers told the police of his abuse. Is it possible that a family can live a different life than the appearance other people see? YES! I know. I lived it.The famous actor Richard Harris called Frank McCourt a liar. They grew up in the same neighborhood. I BELIEVE FRANK. Why? My wife and I grew up in the same neighborhood, had the same friends and graduated from the same high school of 92 people. Until we started dating 4 years ago she never knew anything that went on in my home. It is amazing what people can hide if they want to. You see it all the time on the news. This couple has a hidden sex slave for years, or bodies buried in the back yard, or this abuse happened right under the nose of everyone else. Is it that much of a stretch to believe Frank's story?In Frank's book \\"Angela's Ashes\\" he makes it a point to convey how embarrassing it was for his family to be the poorest of the poor. Perhaps Frank did not get every fact correct and perhaps the movie did not represent the book well but let me leave you with something. When children are ashamed of the worst most horrendous things in their life like abuse and poverty they are not going to step up on a soap box and tell you - especially if they are afraid of the consequences. I did not grow up very poor but I am catholic and Scottish/Irish and was abused and NO ONE knew except my close relatives. There is also an argument that if you were very poor everyone else would know. Sure today that might hold water but back then everyone had it bad. Not even my closest friends knew how bad I had it. So, Frank, wherever you are, I believe you....RIP."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is exactly the book I needed for my class! The price was decent and the book was a lot more interesting than I expected! Thank you very much!"},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is reccommended by Stephen King in &quot;On Writing&quot; - a book I highly reccommend.Frank McCourt's &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is a wonderful literary accomplishment. I was deeply touched by the story (as I have an alcoholic family-abandoning father, too).The prose is rythmic and soothing, and the stories are a wonderful tapestry of life. There are moments when the failings of the people around Frank make you wish you could reach back in time and slap them. There are moments of laughter and tears, and throughout the book you cannot help but root for Frank as he struggles to keep his family and himself sane during the hardscrabble life they lead.I reccommend this to all, however, if you have trouble with rambling sentences or dialogue with phonetic colloquialisms, you may be better off seeing the movie - which is a perfect compliment to the book.The ending leaves you dying for more, however, I found &quot;'Tis&quot; to lack the heart and the hope of &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; Also of interest, Malachy McCourt has also written two books on his related life.I delayed reading this because I dislike sad stories, but this one is really a story of how a family's love can light up the darkest corner of the world, and how that love never leaves you, no matter how imperfect it may be.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I chose a couple od different quote from this book that expresses what this family had to go through. &quot;People everywhere brag and whimper about the woes of their early years, but nothing can compare with the Irish version: the poverty; the shiftless loquacios alcholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bulling school masters; the English and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years...above all we were wet.&quot; This is one of the basic yet dredful things that the McCourt family had to deal with. Even though it is the time of the deppresion, the McCourt family is having a hard time having barely enough money to starve. With four small boys and one daughter dead it still wasn't enought for six people to live off of. &quot;There are seven masters in Leamy's National School and they all have leather straps, canes, black thron sticks...&quot; When the McCourts moved back to Ireland after living in NewYork for five years, they had two more tragic things happen to them. Also the two oldest boys got put in to a school. Where it was common to be hit with black thorn sticks, daily, it was ssaid to make boys into refined men. &quot;It's hard to sleep when you know the next day you're fourteen and staring your first job as a man.&quot; At this point Frankie has to get a job because his borther, Malachyis too young and his father is no help. This is the time where this book gets heavier and every page, every sentence, every word has you at the edge of your seat, not knowing what will come next. This is why I sugguest to anyone who needs someone else to feel sorry for or for something that will make them reailze how easy our lives now are. Well then I say read this book you will absoulty love it."},{"Title":"Angela's Ashes (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I like the way Frank McCourt depicted his poor Irish Catholic childhood.So vivid,heart-whole and sorrowful make me empathize with him. He showed the bitter-sweetness of his younger days in Limerick, Ireland.Frank McCourt shared his life story with compelling narration and a great sense of humour. All the reality and poverty his faced. As the eldest son,he beared extra responsibilities and was less happier as compared to his cute,cheerful brother Malachy and many other brothers. He had irresponsible but pathetic parent, poor living conditions but a great hunger for knowledge and a dream to go to America.His memoir filled with dramatic twists and intriguing events such as his days as a postman and his troubles with his sore eyes.... He made a great impression for a debut work. He wrote with sensibility and sincerity. This page turner shines in depicting the genuineness of humanity. It set a great example of the success of following your heart and to strike for your goal in life.
