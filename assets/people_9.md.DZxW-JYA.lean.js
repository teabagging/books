But Matthew Fox picks a subject and covers it from all angles, Jewish, Catholic, Islamic, Hindu, Buddist, Native American, African American, even the Celtic and the Goddess.

WCS"},{"Title":"One River Many Wells","review":"It's hard to tell where Matthew Fox is and where he is going. His books have been a trail of hit and, mostly miss, wanderings.He recognizes a common source for spiritual reality. And yet he pushes an ecumenical (and even New-Age) agenda to try and mold all existing beliefs into a vision that it cannot be. 'Only if the religions of the world would stand together...' These religions are organizations with their own agendas and systems. Perhaps Fox should listen to the Dali Lami who said that ultimately there is no reconciliation between the *religions* of Buddhism and Christianity. There may be one spirit, but not a single religion or even meaningful coordination of them. (Vivikenanda says that would be very boring.)Mysticism is the root of all real spiritual experience and Fox knows this. But each religion is an outgrowth (and hence not true development) of the founder who had the mystical experience. The goal of any true (spiritual) path is personal experience. Fox keeps attempting to join all religions (forms) into a great ecumenical mandala and this cannot be done. Personal experience is always unique. It is wisdom that we can see from other beliefs. But Fox keeps on pushing in yet another book.To be perfectly clear, his inclusion of various spiritual and mystical source in this book is commendable. Everyone else is realizing wisdom of many sources so why not M.Fox. However his approach is always one of 'Look how great what I am saying is'. He claims great visions and breakthroughs for humanity if we will just believe what he is saying. Check his past books. He always does this.The inclusion and recognition of various sources does not, in his writings, yield meaningful synthesis. This is because there is no coherent meaning to be achieved through shallow or 'deep' ecumenism (joining of outward forms). Neither by dancing, or having estatic sex, or by bringing in ethics or spirituality to work (all themes of his). Neither volumes of writing nor diversity of inputs has meaning on its own. There is no substantial vision presented in his works that rises above religion (form) and beyond his own (elevated) concepts of how things should be. His previous books have not resulted in major changes to society and it does not appear this one will have much effect either."},{"Title":"The most of John Held, Jr","review":"As an illustrator, I can't even begin to properly pay homage to one of my great heros, John Held, Jr. His was some of the most beautiful, harmonious work of a true golden age of illustration - the 1920's wouldn't have been quite so giddy were it not for him. He enhanced the age, and continues to celebrate it, years after his death.From sheiks, flappers, collegiates and flivvers to breathtaking watercolors of the Manhattan skyline, this wonderful volume has it all - full-page prints of Held, Jr.'s work, brilliantly loyal to the original colors and gradations, shine in full glory. From the 1890's through the early 1940's, a wide range of his styles and capabilities are documented. Woodcuts are in plentiful supply, as well - it's just all here, plain and simple.As well, Held, Jr.'s life story is briefly told, along with a charming introduction by Marc Connelly. The latter allows the reader some humorous insight to Held, Jr.'s character - the two, along with several other aspiring artists and writers, shared what amounted to a flophouse flat, and the tales of their efforts toward success are amusing to say the least.For the most part, this book is a visual journey, which makes it so wonderful. A great companion would be Shelley Armitage's biography - her book is far more informative, forgoing extensive illustration in favor of telling the artist's life story. But if you're looking to just sit back and be enthralled by Held, Jr.'s work, this book is the way to go. Now that I finally have a copy, you can bet that I'll never, ever part with it."},{"Title":"The most of John Held, Jr","review":"Hardback with dustjacket, cloth over boards with a sewn binding, dustjacket.

Scam artists are about to descend on you, and this book will help you avoid them. Also, it will direct you to the actions and the people that will help you run your life successfully from a financial perspective in the future.What happens to people after they declare bankruptcy is something that few know anything about. Ms. Ryan does a nice job of summarizing the law and the relevant credit practices. Unlike many books about personal financial planning, she shows and tells you just what to do. This book includes form letters, telephone numbers, telephone scripts, and places to get information on-line. In each case, she tells you who will try to rip you off, and who will give you the best deal. She speaks from experience, having both declared bankruptcy once and later found herself falling behind again.The reality is better than you think. People want to do business with you. They just don't want to take unnecessary risks. You can even get credit cards again (usually secured by a savings account in the beginning). After you show a history of repaying debts and making payments on time for about two years, most doors will be open to you for credit at reasonable rates. But you'll get less credit than before, so that lenders don't get burned by you.The sections in this book are outstanding on how to fix your credit history (and how to avoid getting scammed by people who will claim to do it for you in ways that are not sustainable), avoid bad credit card deals, get loans for the things you need (cars and homes), and improve your spending habits. They rank with the best personal finance books that I have read. Anyone will benefit from this advice!The subjects covered include taking the first steps towards reestablishing credit (which will help you rent property and get a new job, even if you don't plan to borrow), eliminating debts not discharged in bankruptcy, breaking the cycle of piling on debt, how to use secured credit cards intelligently (and where to get the best deal), buying a car (with or without credit), job issues, renting a house or apartment issues, traveling without credit cards, buying a house with credit, how to get out from under if you start having debt problems again (both with and without filing for bankruptcy again), and building financial security. On the last subject, you will need more than this book offers. I suggest John Bogle's excellent book, Common Sense on Mutual Funds.The book does a nice job of easing the pain and embarrassment of bankruptcy for those who are prepared to do what it takes to become more financially successful. The book is very good about letting you avoid harrassment and unpleasant situations while being totally candid and honest about your situation.The book's detail is very thorough and deals with all aspects of the situations that I could think of other than alimony and child support issues.My only complaint about the book is that it did not seem to be well proof read. Line breaks and paragraph breaks occur randomly, and there are more typos than you would normally expect. The quality of the content seems fine, though.If you want to learn a little more about Ms. Ryan, she has been the bankruptcy guru on AOL for a number of years, and you can find her now at theWhiz.I think this would also be a good book for young people to read before starting out. By understanding how people end up being bankrupt and having to deal with these issues, it may forearm them to not make unnecessary mistakes.Use the good examples of those who have gone before you to best advantage!"},{"Title":"Bounce Back From Bankruptcy: A Step-by-Step Guide to Getting Back on Your Financial Feet, Third Edition","review":"I filed bankruptcy a couple of years ago and by following the steps in this easy to understand, straight forward book, I now have $70,000.00 saved, an unsecured credit card, a fica score in the 700's and last week was aproved for a mortgage at 61/2%!!!this is all the information you will need for any issue you can think of after a bankruptcy.

Teece promises a theoretical framework for understanding intellectual property and practical advice about managing it. Theory ultimately prevails in this book, but valuable nuggets of managerial guidance await any entrepreneur willing to dig for them. As a professor and as the presenter of Oxford's Clarendon Lecture in Management Studies, from which this book is drawn, Teece naturally tends toward abstract thinking. Some of the territory has been traveled before (i.e. the message that bureaucratic, hierarchical organizations tend to stifle innovation) but Teece adds a lot of intriguing material. We [...] believe analytically minded academics, entrepreneurs and executives will find Teece's volume illuminating, most notably his educated perspective on antitrust activism in the high tech arena. He concludes that government regulators should probably stick to regulating industries they understand. Well, if they want to understand intellectual property, they should start here."},{"Title":"Managing Intellectual Capital: Organizational, Strategic, and Policy Dimensions (Clarendon Lectures in Management Studies)","review":"This is an excellent book on the knowledge-based view of the firm. Although Teece is unsure in his preface whoether is succesfully addresses both academic audiences and managers. From an academic perspective, I can surely claim that this book is theoretically interesting. I recognized two portions of this book that draw heavily on Teece's work published previously in California Management Review (parts of Chapter 1 and all of chapter 4). What is certainly most interesting out of the 300 pages of small type is Section 2. This section provides a compelling set of arguments on the impact of market structures and governance modes on intellectual capital. Notabily missing, however, is incorporation of the knowledge-integration perspective that Grant et. al have been building for the past half decade. The case study on Pilkinton Glass is also well worn, and Teece clearly acknowledges that. Information technologists should not hold thier breath because this work seems to take a rather passive stand on the role of IT in mobilizing intellectual assets. The references at the end provide an impressive array of literature in economics that Teece draws on. The readibility and plausibility of Teece's arguments should come as no surprise to anyone who has read Teece's earlier scholarly work. Overall, I'd say that this was worth the thirty five dollars."},{"Title":"Managing Intellectual Capital: Organizational, Strategic, and Policy Dimensions (Clarendon Lectures in Management Studies)","review":"You are about to realize a misconception between two related but different terms: intellectual capital and intellectual property. Browsing throughout the book you will hardly find any references to intellectual capital, including a brief definition! Thus you should not be surprised by not finding any reference to intellectual capital in the Index. One would expect some heated discussion over this controversial concept before being offered a framework to manage it. Forget it. Despite author's attempt to write about the promising field of IC all sections seem to converge around the intellectual property discussion. The management of intellectual capital is something else than the management of intellectual capital. The wrong audiences may than be easily caught in this trap."},{"Title":"Powerful Project Leadership","review":"I ordered this book right after it came out based on the recommendation of some colleagues I deeply respect. As I read thru it, the things in the book deeply resonated with me.

Instead, that project was the most miserable, infuriating, and betraying experience of my adult life. If only I had know all this back then [sigh]... I was utterly clueless about the communication dimension of project leadership until I read this book.I have since been able to apply the wisdom of \\"Powerful Project Leadership\\" to subsequent projects with much success.

There are so few books in our business which focus on dealing with people issues, and even those seldom mention anything about understanding yourself.

I started reading this book with high hopes, but the reality far exceeded them. I read it cover to cover in a couple of days.In any kind of consulting work, most of the problems are from people issues. The studies all state that, as does the folklore.

However, over the years as my focus shifted to wider software architecture I found it difficult to keep up with new releases, modules and so forth. From time to time I would visit CPAN but the sheer volume of modules and the limited time I had was preventing me from taking full advantage of modern perl.Jared and Andy's book neatly solved this problem. Within an hour of opening their book I had fully upgraded my perl and added heaps of fantastic utilities that I never even knew existed. Sometimes perl can be hard to install and configure but this book makes it a breeze.This book is indispensable if you are trying to get started with perl - and every DBA should! If you are already a perl user I'm sure you'll learn about new features or find utilities that will repay the cost of the book many times over."},{"Title":"Perl for Oracle Dbas","review":"\\"Perl for Oracle DBAs\\" is indeed a real pearl. This 600-plus paged volume was designed to be a reliable friend of any administrator, whose responsibilities include the oiling of Oracle database machinery.The book, which comes with a toolkit package that contains more than a hundred ready-to-use programs, bared all the mysteries that surround Oracle/Perl software: including Oracle Call Interface (OCI), Perl DataBase Interface (DBI), as well as all the other modules that commune with both software.This book runs as smoothly as any pearl could run."},{"Title":"Perl for Oracle Dbas","review":"Over time, as we develop systems, cut code, administer data bases and perform myriad other tasks, we tend to build up a 'kit bag' of useful tricks, code snippets and techniques.This book makes a welcome contribution with its numerous code examples and clear explanations.Although, as the title suggests, this is aimed primarily at Oracle administrators, there is much here for those with more than a passing interest in the rich text-processing language that is Perl.With library modules also available for Sysbase and MySQL, for example, connections across disparate databases are a simple matter of appropriate API calls.Indeed, in the excellent appendices, there is a code example showing simultaneous connections to both an Oracle and a MySQL database and how to extract and process data between themusing Perl code and embedded SQL. The ability to do this easily and efficiently without resorting to dump and re-loads using ASCII flat files was a small revelation.With their clear real-world approach, incisive and, often witty, explanations and observations, the enthusiasm of the authors for their subject is clear.This book is not only a boon to data base administrators but should also prove to be very useful to those who simply want to learn more about the power of Perl."},{"Title":"Perl for Oracle Dbas","review":"The book is clear, concise and to the point.

This book is ideal in that someone else has done all the hard work so there is now one definitve resource for Perl for DBA's and about time too. I've found all Oracle O'Reilly books exceptional and this one carries on the trend."},{"Title":"Perl for Oracle Dbas","review":"Perl is the ideal language for Oracle DBAs. Those who are already aware of its strengths will have implemented it to some degree on their servers. For DBAs who may have heard rumours of its magic, then Part I of Andy Duncan and Jared Still's &quot;Perl for Oracle DBAs&quot; will prove to be a substantial grounding in the synergy that can arise between Oracle and Perl's virtues of Laziness, Impatience and Hubris. This section provides information on Perl's background, its strengths and provides instructions for installing the language on UNIX, Win32 and Cygwin. (For those not in the know: Cygwin is a free UNIX emulation layer for Windows that includes a substantial collection of GNU tools). Perl is the ideal language for DBAs in a heterogeneous environment.Experienced Oracle DBAs with a Perl bent should feel free to skip straight to Part II, Extending Perl. Here the authors provide information on Perl GUI and Web extensions, plus some Open Source tools for Oracle that make use of these features. They also discuss a feature I really like: the ability to call Perl routines from PL/SQL, but as the authors point out, you should be aware of the security implications.To my mind, Part III: The PDBA Toolkit is the most valuable part of the book. The authors have kindly provided a set of superb Perl tools for the Oracle DBA. Everyone will have their favourites, but mine include the ability to monitor alert logs in real time and a password client/server combo for centralised, encrypted management over the network. Last but not least: the ability to monitor SQL and store explain plans for historical comparison over time.This book is a like a Tardis - its much bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside. The volume of information could have been overwhelming, but the authors have taken the time to patiently explain the topics from first principles without ever patronising the reader. That's a rare skill, and this is a fantastic book."},{"Title":"Perl for Oracle Dbas","review":"These authors have taken two somewhat diverse topics and combined them into an easy-to-read and cohesive book.The examples are especially helpful and the authors take great care to explain the issues in Plain English.Overall, a highly recommended book."},{"Title":"Perl for Oracle Dbas","review":"This is NOT a book for learning Perl if you're a DBA. The whole book is devoted to describe a lot of free DBA utilities written in this language, and it doesn't give you any roboust help to build your own Oracle-Perl scripts. There's a very little (about 40 pages) APPENDIX devoted to look at the language grammar and programming issues. The only chapter that deserve the only star I give for this book is CHP7 - OCI Calls with Oracle::OCI. But, is this a book written for DBA's or developers?If someone publish a book saying &quot;UNIX Korn shell scripts for Oracle DBA's&quot;, what do I expect? Simply! learn about UNIX Korn shell and how to write DBA scripts for my Oracle system. But if the book talks about utilities written for Oracle in Korn shell scripts, then, clearly it fails its purpose.Maybe those tools described can be useful for DBA tasks, specially because they're free... the bottom line is that this book doesn't teach you how to programm in Perl.

It doesn't sound like some boring UCLA professor droning on - it's filled with quotes and interesting stuff and exciting events. And the best thing about this is that there isn't very much bias in this. The authors just say what happened in Belgrade and all around.There's also several helpful aids in this book, like a list of characters, some maps. However, a timeline would have been indispensable. Moreover, identifying where Krajinia was on the map could have helped, too.But overall, this was a great book and I'm very glad I chose this book. The print is a bit small, but that's okay.

I enjoyed the book and recommend it."},{"Title":"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation","review":"This book of the disintegration of Jugoslavia is very detailed, nicely organized, and easy to read one. It covers the step-by-step death of Yugoslavia, and like many reviewers I found biases dragging all over the book as if the Muslims are saints and the Serbs devils. The blame on Milosevic is constant, but the blame of Tudjman does not exist. How good or bad Milosevic is/was, it was designed and decided by the USA and the Western Europe-same like in Irag, with once Western darling Saddam Hussein and suddenly the evil, the demon. The ethnic differences in Jugoslavia were created and provoked by the USA and the Western Europe ONLY by corrupting the Balkans governments in search for more markets for their collapsing empires and places for their oil tubes for their SUV's and polluted fat ways of living.NOTE: War came and none of the Balkan sides were angles; In Wars, all sides are guilty and do things, evil. And as Christian nationalism and Islamic fundamentalism rose due to the Western Help, the Balkans were turned into s***ty colonial provinces that since Yugoslavia is gone, have one of the lowest standards of living and depressing future. And that is a fact. The Land of Yugoslavia, once so strong, now is FOR SALE to the Western Powers, while Balkan people are getting poorer and poorer. Truth Hurts my dear friends, but I hope will wake one up;Damages"},{"Title":"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation","review":"Like most of the reviewers I am a veteran Balkanist, and am impressed by the quality of both research and writing in this , I found it even easier to use than Mischa Glenny's excellent study of War &amp; Nationalism.My caveat is the obvious one, it takes very much the 'Guardian report from embattled Sarejevo' approach to the Bosnian conflict. The Serbs are caricatured as villains and the Muslims as heroes/victims, and the Croats relegated to an overly minor role, rather than key players. It also takes this line (a bit)with the break-up of Yugoslavia, where extremist Serb statements are extensively quoted as if representative of Yugoslavia's Serb polity, while similar stuff from Croats or Albanians is carefully put in its correct context as not speaking for the majority. The lies and misdeeds of Serb politicans are likewise accurately deconstructed, while those of the other sides tend to be taken uncritically at their own word. My own experience of living in Bosnia during 1990 was of a community for whom no sides extremists actually spoke, but were polarised against their will by war and the fear of war. The trouble is that a a historian it is easy to be caught by self-fulfilling prophecies, extremists can both talk and ignite a war which engulfs whole communities, it should not be taken as proof they were somehow articulating a whole community's desire for war all along!Overall a useful contibution, especially in terms of chronology of who said what, and provided its bias is taken into account, well worth reading."},{"Title":"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation","review":"Being closely affected by the entire catastrophy of the last 12 years in Yugoslavia I have read almost everything avaliable on Amazon and in the bookstores pertaining to the subject. This is the Mother Goose of all the books on the last 12 years in the region. One realizes this because all other books quote this one quite often. They are usually recycled or paraphrazed parts of Laura Silber's book. The book is cold and unemotional the way a book about such an event should be. It didnt leave anything out and the sequence of events is perfect. Everything that came after this books publishing was either forshadowed or is just an effect of things in this book. On the other hand if one wants to read books by clowns who were responsible for everything allow me to recommend Slobodan Milosevics' &quot;Years of decisions&quot;, Holbrookes &quot;To end a War&quot; (sic. but only when my Q rating is really high), Zimmermanns &quot;Origins of a catastophe&quot;(sic. was blind but now can see). Read this book, understand what and how went on and hold your own against any expert on the subject."},{"Title":"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation","review":"As most other reviews stated, this book is easy to read, and it provides a detailed description of the events throughout the Croatian and Bosnian War (1990-1995) This book is supplemented by the highly popular BBC series - \\"Death of Yugoslavia,\\" which is perhaps the most-known documentary on the war. The documentary follows the book quiet closely, with an inherent strength of BBC reports having interviews to most of the major players - Milosevic, Tudjman, Stambolic, Izanbegovic, and others (most of which are in jail or dead now anyways).Nonetheless, this book has a strong anti-Serb thesis, which, I suppose, it needs in order to be conclusive. In other words, if there are no good guys and bad guys, the Laura Silber would create an incomplete work. But for someone who wants to get a good insight of the war in Balkans, it cannot be looked through the lenses of \\"black and white,\\" as this book tries to convey.It is important for readers to know that the accounts of the war are carefully selected and edited in the anti-Serb fashion. For example, the ethnic cleansing atrocities, when described in detail, are almost always pertaining to the Serbs. But when it comes to the Croats and the Muslims, the book overlooks their actions during the war. In addition, the book provides little evidence of the involvement of the bigger powers - EU and USA.For example, early chapters go into great depth talking about the pointless shelling of Dubrovnik, talking about Montenegrins peasants getting their \\"revenge\\" to fulfill their jealousies against the prominent Croatian population of Ragusa. But when it talks about Operation Storm - the single biggest even of ethnic cleansing during the entire war, undertaken by Croatian Forces will full military, logistical, and financial support from the US, it does not go into any depth at all. It is dismissed as \\"Krajina Serbs\\" got what they deserved. The Krajina Serbs did not \\"occupy\\" that part of Croatia - they lived there for hundreds of years.When dealing with international involvement, it goes to great length to disapprove Srebrenica, while Operation Storm is supported by the West. Perhaps US and EU had other motivations in this conflict? What about the arming of Croats and Bosnia throughout before the war in the old SFRJ (which was then illegal)In addition to a one-sided view, it fails to address other major issues, such as economic disparities. Invoking economics, it justifies Croatia's and Slovenia's promising economic position before the disintegration, nevertheless, it mentions to compare facts. Slovenia and Croatia assumed a high level of industry due to the fact they had cheap natural resources that mostly came from Serbia and Kosovo. In addition, the economic status of Serbia is taken under consideration with Kosovo - even though Kosovo, not Serbia, is the most impoverished region in former Yugoslavia. The fact that Kosovo Albanian's have been boycotting the federal institutions since early 1980s - not paying taxes, utilities, and other duties since the death of Tito had something to do with this idea.While I do not discourage people from reading this book, I only state that Laura Silber (et al) provides a narrow-minded, opinionated, and sensationally journalistic view of the breakup of former Yugoslavia.If anyone is interested in truly learning about this conflict, more resources are necessary."},{"Title":"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation","review":"I became involved in the Bosnian crisis in a professional capacity as an intelligence analyst and briefing officer at the headquarters, U.S. European command, and served in Sarajevo with the initial NATO Peace Implementation Force (IFOR). I have been studying and following the history of this area and events in Bosnia ever since. I am familiar with many of the events in the crisis and personalities involved, and found this to be an outstanding summary of the process of the disintegration of Yugoslavia. The portion of the book covering the rise of Milosevic and the departure from Yugoslavia of Slovenia is particularly well done. The coverage of the Bosnian war is a bit cursory, and takes the perspective of the conventional wisdom of the international journalistic community. I know from talking to UNPROFOR officers and others who were there that the Muslims were not totally innocent victims and the Serbs universally evil monsters. With that small caveat, I would strongly recommend this book to anyone trying to understand the entire Yugoslav crisis. It is meticulously researched and documented. Anyone trying to understand what is happening in Kosovo right now would be well advised to read this book."},{"Title":"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation","review":"If you read only one book on the tragedy that befell Yugoslavia in the 90s this book is the one. Deeply if subtly analytical to satisfy the social scientist, profoundly sensitive to empirical detail to please the historian, this account ranks as the best journalism of its day. It can and should be read by the widest audience: scholar, policy-maker, or generalist. I would go so far to say that not reading this book is an irresponsible act."},{"Title":"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation","review":"This book is an exhaustive account of the events that led to the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, one of the complex, multiethnic republics that had once comprised Yugoslavia. Laura Silber and Allan Little, drawing largely on interviews with the leading characters on all sides in the conflict, have written a book that will be consulted for generations to come, for diplomacy's sake.It is perhaps one of the longer books written about the Bosnian war (it does treat the wars in Slovenia and Croatia, respectively, as well as prime readers on the recent history of Yugoslavia in the late 1980s that shaped it for war). While it lacks in the intricate history to be found in Noel Malcolm's history of Bosnia, and the compressed highlights and historical transitions that are illustrated most vividly in Tim Judah's journalistic work about the Serbs, Silber and Little's work is most effective, in this reviewer's view, in meticulously chronicling every detail of the war in Bosnia. The front lines, the politicians, the paramilitary groups, the efforts and experiences of the few peacekeepers, the atrocities and experiences of civilians caught between exchanges of gunfire; Silber and Little have not overlooked anything surrounding Bosnia's demise. However, as the bulk of this book is devoted to Bosnia, the brief background and key events leading to Yugoslavia's demise provided in these pages could be inadequate for some first-time readers of this tragedy.The revised Penguin Books edition of this book (under review) appeared in 1996. Throughout the dense text are recurrent references to Kosovo, the province from which Slobodan Milosevic, now an indicted war criminal made it to power in Serbia, and later in the rump Yugoslavia. Silber and Little, at that early stage, predicted that worse was yet to come in Kosovo (see pp. 383-384), writing that the post-Dayton police-dominated province with its Albanian majority (and Serb minority) would be influenced by what happened to the rest of the former Yugoslavia. In Silber and Little's words: \\"A peace settlement based on the principle that statehood derives from ethnicity sent powerful signals to Serbia's minorities...that could lead to further conflict in the future\\" (p. 384). Once again, the age-old phenomenon of having writing on the wall; Kosovo was a disaster waiting to happen, with advance warning.Essential reading for anyone wishing to understand the faceted character and nature of a long, gruesome war."},{"Title":"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation","review":"PROS:- Cold, dispassionate summary of the causes of the Yugoslav Wars.- Highly detailed (sometimes too detailed).- Well-researched and documented.CONS:1. DETAILS VS. ANALYSIS: I wish I could trade off some of the incredible detail (which can be tedious to read after a while) for a bit more big-picture analysis, including some more about lessoned learned.2. A BIT TOO BIASED AGAINST THE SERBS: The book is not nearly as \\"one-sided\\" as some Amazon reviewers claim. The authors fault nearly all the players. Yes, they fault the Serbs the most, but certainly not exclusively. Indeed, they point out how near the end Milosevic was a more eager peacemaker than any of the other participants.3. OUT OF DATE: Written in 1996, it misses the Kosovo crisis. It could use a chapter with an update. Still, if you want to understand how the breakup happened, this book is fantastic.4. SLOVENIA-SERBIA COLLUSION ARGUMENT IS WEAK: The book implies that Slovenia and Serbia were in cahoots. The argument isn't convincing.CONCLUSION: Ex-Yugoslavs are often hysterically passionate about their region, making calm analysis difficult. I know, because I'm writing a book about Eastern Europe. Therefore, this book is valuable and useful despite the 4 flaws I listed."},{"Title":"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation","review":"Although, as the authors note, they largely leave the Serbian-Albanian conflict in Kosovo aside, this book clearly explains how the violent breakup of Yugoslavia in a sense began with Slobodan Milosevic's manipulation of that issue in the 1980s. What most people are only beginning to be aware of about Kosovo is in fact a late chapter in a story that's been going on for a very long time now, most of which this book tells better than any other."},{"Title":"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation","review":"This book gives a very clear-cut picture of the disintegration of Yugoslavia. The main protagonist was Slobodan Milosevic and the key ingredient was Serbian nationalism and expansionism. The Serbs wanted and obtained ethnic cleansing in Croatia and then Bosnia Herzegovina. All the pent-up hatred and nationalism that had been suppressed (at times violently) during the Tito years sprang to the surface like the bursting of a simmering volcano.The religious -ethnic divide of Serbs (Orthodox Christians) and Croats (Catholics) were the first to go.The violence first started outwardly in Slovenia (which was the most civil break-up) and moved inward, becoming with the violence, increasingly closer to Serbia proper.Milosevic manipulated and controlled the media - using it to play on Serb history and its' supposed martyrdom by the Turks six hundred long years ago. He played the Serb-Croat and Serb-Muslim antagonisms superbly. Unfortunately it all started to go wrong as the Croats also started to use their own nationalistic animosities to the Serbs. And unfortunately caught in the middle of all this hatred were the Muslims of Bosnia Herzegovina who were the least powerful and the least protected. The Croatians received more aid as the war and the killings mounted.Finally Milosevic - from increased international pressure - like economic isolation and NATO military escalation - was forced to back away from his Serb \`brothers' in both Croatia and Bosnia.But the cleansing had been done and the hatred remains. Sarajevo was a city that was integrated with mixed neighbourhoods of Serb, Croatian and Muslims, but now Sarajevo is bleak and segregated. All this reinforces the maxim that \`might is right'. Villages were destroyed which had existed for hundreds of years. Some were re-populated, others were abandoned and entire areas were re-settled (cleansed).In Bosnia Herzegovina half the population was killed or expelled.The U.N. has a long term commitment to Yugoslavia. The European community sat far too long on the sidelines while the killings were being done. You would think that from all the experiences of World War II, they would have been far more proactive in preventing another European war. Why were negotiations with Lord Oliver going on at the same time that the killings were well under way in Croatia? After a war is under way it is too late to simply talk."},{"Title":"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation","review":"Probably the best account of what exactly happened in Bosnia, and how the whole thing started (not just Bosnia, but Kosovo and Croatia as well). Authors go into extensive detail, providing the reader with a solid background to the war(s). While I was intimately familiar with the conflicts, or so I thought, this book shed some much needed light on some of the doubts I had, some confusing contradictions I picked up through the media, etc. The book, contrary to what some people are saying here, is not biased at all. That one side is portrayed in an \\"evil\\" tone is merely a result of what that \\"side\\" did during the conflicts, as documented by thousands of media outlets, historians, cameras and photographs. Of course, no one is an angel, but that should not diminish the fact that - there are demons and then there are DEMONS. Or whatever the daily word for evil, bad, ruthless people is.The book is thoroughly researched with a lot of important and verifiable information. It focuses on Croatia and Bosnia, mostly in Bosnia. It is the most accurate account that I've encountered yet; written in a clear and harmonious way. Did not get bored for one second, even though most of the information was not new to me. But what was new to me was certainly worth the wait."},{"Title":"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation","review":"I took a great interest in the Balkan war of the 1990's. At the time, i would have been listening to BBC reports & reading the Independent & Guardian.In the past 5 years i have made several trips to the region. However, this is my first serious book on the subject. I read the book in 3 days instead of my normal 1-2 weeks. I just couldn't put it down whenever i had a spare moment.It's a great starting point to learn the facts of the war rather than looking at the theories behind it. I would love to find a book which can bring me up to date with how things have evolved since 95/96.As it's my first book i have read on the subject i cannot comment on whether i think it's biased towards one side. I am planning to start reading as many books on the subject as possible & hope that they are as fascinating as this one.As a side-note, i am just planning my next trip to Bosnia. I looked at the arrival board on the Sarajevo aiport website. Most of the flights were from Belgrade, Zagreb, Ljubljana, Banja Luka & Skopje.

If you are not familiar with the conflict, this work may be a bit dense as an introduction. However, if you are familiar with the basic Serb-Croat, and Bosnia-Muslim differences, this book will spell out in very exact detail many of the key events that led to the conflict there. It may refresh your memory and give you new insights. Offering a rich blend of history and current events, Silber and Little have produced a work of lasting value to anyone interested in those terrible years. It also makes one reflect, in a way yet unanswered, as to how people can plunge to such terrible depth of barbarity, yet also hopeful that the \\"ethnic cleansing\\" was ultimately brought to a halt."},{"Title":"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation","review":"If ever there was a book published that covered nearly all the bases on what happened and who was in charge, the dynamics of the countries involved and all the political and military players, this is the book. I've read several books now on the history of the Balkans and the fall of Yugoslavia and this book is probably the least biased by authors who were there and watched it all unfold. The book leaves no doubt that atrocities did occur and that those responsible covered all the bases. There is plenty of blame to go around and plenty of denial by those involved and even those who ignored the plight of Croats, Serbs and Bosnians throughout this disastrous war of ethnic cleansing. Highly recommended if you know nothing or think you know it all."},{"Title":"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation","review":"Sure, the anectdotes are interesting, but events without an overview can be misleading. The authors simply describe but don't conclude. The events in Croatia are a good example. The Yugoslav army had every intention of invading. Provocations by the Croat Defense Minister, using a rocket launcher against the JNA, are interesting, but irrelevant to overall events. One has to be discriminating. Oh, and Yugoslavia was never a &quot;nation&quot;, it should be Death of State."},{"Title":"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation","review":"Whew! Dense, fast and furious and full of many perspectives, this book is well worth the read for those who want a comprehensive review of the demise of the Yugoslav state. There are parts of the book that read like a good spy mystery, and parts that are dreadfully dull. But, overall, I haven't seen a better source of background to the crisis in the Balkans. It is only a start and a whirlwind tour. Nonetheless, this is the best available overview of this complex situation. Just don't stop here. And, any good overview does exactly what this book does, makes you want to know more."},{"Title":"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation","review":"Silber and Little offer in this book irrefutably the most exhaustive and lucid account of the breakup of Yugoslavia and the war in Bosnia. Unilke other books on the same subject, this book sheds light on key events in a chronological order, facilitating comprehension and the retrieval of target facts. Readers with no or fairly little knowledge of the subject will probably find the structure of this book very appealing.Silber and Little argue that the key to understanding why Yugoslavia collapsed is Milosevic coming to power and the subsequent rise of the Serbian nationalism. Cunning and manipulative, Milosevic stabbed the then President of Serbia Stambolic in the back and took over as President of Serbia. Through sophisticated propaganda, Milosevic was able to manipulate and control the Serbian people. He had managed to convince his people that they were second-class citizens facing extermination unless they all united and pursued the sacred Serbian goal of creating a \\"Greater Serbia\\". Milosevic claimed that the Serbs in Kosovo were living under the Albanian rule. Of course nothing could be farther from the truth, if anything the situation was quite the opposite. The Albanians in Kosovo were oppressed but Milosevic aware that the Serbs had always considered Kosovo a part of Serbia knew the enormous importance of Kosovo for his people. Determined to \\"save\\" the Serbian people from \\"extermination\\", Milosevic asserted that the creation of a \\"Greater Serbia\\" would be his primary objective. This pursue of the greater Serbian ideology led to the disintegration of Yugoslavia; Serbia first attacked Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and ultimately Kosovo.Silber and Little completely shatter the myth that the war in Bosnia was a civil war. Instead they provide compelling and incontrovertible evidence that the war was a Serbian aggression. The presence of the JNA, the former federal Yugoslav army in Bosnia, which sided with Bosnian Serbs throughout the Bosnian war corroborates their assertion that the war in Bosnia was the Serbian aggression. Furthermore, Silber and Little give a thorough account of the atrocities that were committed in Bosnia. For instance, a detailed scrutiny of the unfathomable torture in detention camps at Omarska, Trnopolje, Keraterm and Omaca is offered. Silber and Little also brilliantly analyze the gruesome massacre in Srebrenica, the worst massacre in Europe since World War II.People seeking to understand the root causes of the breakup of Yugoslavia and the subsequent devestation of the country are strongly advised to read this masterpiece. In my opinion, it is undeniably one of the best written books on the subject. It is also without a doubt the most objective one. The fact that it is extremely well structured and well written make it a must. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation","review":"Somehow, great reporters become famous after servicing in some type of 'tiranny', like a South American, a Middle Eastern or even a Balkan country. What this BBC correspondents did in Yugoslavia is a true masterpiece.

Of course it is an important topic, and the author's know a good deal about it, but the book is VERY poorly organized and filled with inappropriate hyperbole. The authors find it difficult to develop a consistent timeline, and there is no historical overview of the Tito period, which for some of us is perhaps crucial to understanding the structure of the (1980-era) Yugoslav government! I could have used more background on the major players as well. Not a book I would recommend for anyone looking for an introduction to this complex area."},{"Title":"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation","review":"The authors may not have actually conducted hundreds of interviews, but it sure seems like it.

A great book if you are looking for a good review of events leading up to and past the break up of Yugoslavia."},{"Title":"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation","review":"Thorough and very readable. A good choice for the heretofore uninitiated. I would like to point out that the reader from Canada (below) misses the point of the title. It's a play on the word &quot;nation,&quot; which in American English can be 100% synonymous with &quot;state&quot; besides referring to a people. The &quot;nation&quot; in the title is not only the state of Yugoslavia, but also suggests Tito's abortive attempt to forge a new, distinct &quot;Yugoslav&quot; ethnic identity. In other words, the collapse of Yugoslavia destroyed both the &quot;nation&quot; (state) of Yugoslavia and all hope for creating a Yugoslav &quot;national&quot; identity. (Incidentally, the book was retitled for the American market; its original British title was simply &quot;The Death of Yugoslavia.&quot;)"},{"Title":"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation","review":"The book tries to be objective by giving straight facts without bias. But it is hard to compile a heap of facts about such a complex story as was yugoslavias into a book. And this book in my opinion lacks mentioning of some facts that could clarify some of the going-ons. One can still feel the typical western (particulary the former colonial imperial) view on these matters.I will mention only a couple of things that bothered me and they come from the same &quot;not understanding&quot;:When quoting Dobrica Cosic who said about the memorandum of the serbian Academy of Sciance and Art that it's not nationalist but on the contrary pro Yugoslav the authors observe Cosic's statement as unconvincing. This for me shows the typical lack of understanding of yugoslav problem. The core of this is that Cosic was in no way unconvincing - he told/repeated the same statement that everybody else was afraid of in yugoslavia which is that &quot;Serbian way is Yugoslavian way&quot;. Serbs considered Yugoslavia as an extension of Serbia, a war loot that they got after the first world war for being in the good books with imperialists like Britain and France and against (&quot;would-be&quot;) imperialists like Austria-Hungary and germany. That's why Serbs were practically taken by surprise with the '70 constitution changes which further decentralised yugoslavia and consequently felt threatend by it - it showed them that what they consider their realm/empire isn't so much theirs anymore. The same serbian imperialistic attitude brought Alabanians to rebell against the serbs.Furthermore &quot;slicing&quot; Serbia in 3 pieces had a reason. Vojvodina and Kosovo had (and have) large minority populations. Kosovo had albanians (at that point already angry because of the way they were treated by serbs up untill then - we all knew how they were treated when we were serving army duty in Yug. Peoples army) vojvodina had Romanians, Hungarians and others.No reason is mentioned for this reorganisation. It can be vaguely read between the lines that the reason was also decentralisation of govenrment in yug. in accordance with the in other ways silly self-anagement plan of the yugoslav communists which was a way of having a sort of crippled democracy within an undemocratic system. The practical goal of this &quot;democracy&quot; was creating confusion - you can't have monolith structure of communist state and democracy functioning at the same time - the result was that the problems and initiatives of the groups of people were being discussed at the lower levels and brought conclusions (by non-anonymous voting) and those conclusions were taken to a higher level to be voted again...etc. At the end the initial initiative got lost somewhere and none of the &quot;important&quot; higher level polititians got blamed for not implementing the will of the people. Also all kind of personal problems came up during the discussions at the lowest levels (at factory personell meetings, community meeetings etc.) so nothing was done and nothing could endanger the Party and status. But no one expected it would also cut hands to making fast decisions and would make the already inneficient communist system even more inneficient.Someone who knows this also can understand why Milosevic passed &quot;anti bureaurocratic&quot; acts when he was in power. &quot;self management&quot; in communist days was something that was creating &quot;red tape&quot; because it was meant to create it. That was its purpose - so people wouldn't have time or energy to deal with their authorities and wouldn't know who to blame for what - responsibilities were dispersed. It also had a mildening effect on serbian imperialism. It got lost inside &quot;red tape&quot;. But as it is usual in communist regimes - no one sticks to rules too hard so the imperialist nationalism was able to bubble to surface after all. Milosevics &quot;anti bureaurocratic acts&quot; fully opened the door to it at just the right time.And a comment to a reader that said that the book is one-sided. The unbeatable but very unfortunate fact remains that Serbia was the initiator of the horror and is therefore the quilty party in this matter. Serbias reactions/actions to problems that it faced were inaproriate - always agressive, so was the attitude that forced Serbia to react. By considering yugoslav republics as their own provinces instead of partner states inside a common state, by immediately agressively dealing with their albanian minority... There are countries that have strong minorities of nations that were agressive in history but despite problems they may have with these minorities they don't resovle them by striking back with double force and NEVER by taking away their acquired rights."},{"Title":"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation","review":"As a graduate student whose entire higher education experience has been centered around this subject, this book has been invaluable. For anyone who desires a comprehensive understanding of how and why events unfolded as they did in Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, this is required reading. It is one of a very few books that does not focus on the war from the perspective of Western politicians, armchair generals and academics, first-hand narratives, or thrill-seeking reporters (though a number of books written from those perspectives are exceptional and ought to be read alongside this one, including David Halberstam's \\"War in a Time of Peace\\" for its equally painstaking detail in describing the American political perspective ).Silber does not waste time waxing poetic on the moral failings of the West or the dark side of human nature, but lays out with painstaking detail the chronology of events - political, military, civilian, among others - that led to and sustained one of the darkest hours in recent history. Contrary to some reviews, I find Silber's treatment of Serbs, Croats, and Bosniaks absent of bias. Equal attention is not given to each of the three groups' transgressions, and there were transgressions on all sides, because the number and brutality of said transgressions are not equal. The cleansing of Krajina is not covered extensively, but it is covered well, and there is no glossing over the fact that Croatian troops under Gotovina and with the blessing of Tudjman committed terrible acts during Operation Storm. Nor is Bosniak leader Alija Izetbegovic let off the hook for his failings. Silber and Little write with the narrative objective of reporters who know the region and the people for more than war and with the clarity of individuals confident enough in their knowledge and selves that they do not rely on linguistic flourish and rhetoric to prove themselves. I cannot emphasize enough how critical this book is to the subject and to a better understanding of war itself."},{"Title":"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation","review":"I found this book to be informative regarding the events and cast of characters surrounding and causing the dilema of the present in the Balkans.

There are problems, of course. It needed more maps to help readers unfamiliar with the terrain have a better idea of distances, geography, and communities. It needed more clarity in order to know exactly who is saying what, especially in the long quotes that the authors select to single out in self-contained paragraphs. Readers will know who the speakers are, but it could have been done differently. I liked \\"Burn This House\\" so much, that I expected many end-notes to describe in detail this or that aspect of the conflict, just like the end-notes in \\"Burn This House\\" do so well. The end-notes in \\"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation\\" are good, but they should have been more and more detailed. Also, several typos could have been avoided.Still, this is a superb book. It takes a compassionate yet sober view of events. To those readers that may think it is too one-sided, think again. There are plenty of one-sided books on this subject that, although informative, must be taken with a grain of salt. This one, while far from perfect, gives us a devastating overview of the conflict that tore a country apart. Yes, the authors do state that there are guiltier parties and that guilt cannot be distributed equally. Yes, the guilt of the Serbs of Serbia, the Serbs of Bosnia, the Croats of Croatia and then the Croats of Bosnia, and, finally, the Muslims, in that descending order, is presented. Guilt in this crime that was the wars of Yugoslavia was not, and cannot be, spread equally. To do that would be tantamount to saying that a woman raped by one man and then a second one is as guilty as her attackers because she bit one and kicked the other in the groin. We can say that there was violence exerted by the victim against her assailants, but we cannot, in good conscience, state that all parties are equally guilty.I have reviewed plenty of books in which the Muslims of today, as well as those of the past, are not presented in a good light, and I have agreed with those books because I think that the imperialistic, triumphant Muslims of the past, and the not so-triumphant Muslims of today deserve to be exposed to the harsh light of rational inquiry. Therefore, readers that don't know my reviews may think that I approached \\"Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation\\" with a pro-Muslim bias. I did not. It's just that the Muslims of the former Yugoslavia were squeezed and pushed for a long time into extreme positions (extreme positions they did not have at the beginning) by their former neighbors, and even under the most pressing, harsh circumstances, only some Muslims resorted to pay back their tormentors with the same coin. If the Muslims of Bosnia are radicalized today (and I don't know whether they are or not), the Serbs, the Croats, and, yes, the West, are to blame for that.Read this book and reach your own conclusions. The BBC program, based on this book, is also illustrative. You won't find \\"neutrality\\" here because, when everything has been said and done, to be absolutely neutral would be to ignore one side's desperate plight in benefit of those who started and continued the crimes. Yes, those most responsible for the crimes and the violence also made their own peoples suffer, particularly Milosevic in Serbia proper and the duo Karadjic-Mladic in Srpska. And later the Serbs in both areas were bombed by NATO. None of those facts erases the previous fact that the Serbian leaders, with the almost total support of their peoples, waged war on their neighbors secure in the hardware of the Yugoslavian Army and knowing that those neighbors could not defend themselves adequately. When the neighbors eventually hit back, the Serbs cried foul.A good and necessary volume, to be read with others, like \\"Unholy Alliance,\\" and \\"Burn This House.\\" Also, Osprey has a slim, well-illustrated tome on the wars of Yugoslavia that makes a great complement to these titles."},{"Title":"Extreme Denial","review":"I loved the book because it had everything I love to read; the suspense to keep you changing each page; the mystery to keep you intrigued; and romance to keep you hopeful"},{"Title":"Extreme Denial","review":"I picked up this book without really knowing anything about the author, and without really reading the book jacket description.

He must clear his record and he must save Beth."},{"Title":"Extreme Denial","review":"This book moves along briskly with plenty of short (2-page) chapters for those of us readers suffering attention deficit. I think that's how Mr. Morrell views his reading public; give us a hit a minute before we lose our concentration. I lost mine trying to believe 85 impossible things before breakfast. Steve Decker is ultra one dimensional, but hey, he's in technicolor! Good for a read at the laundromat."},{"Title":"Extreme Denial","review":"Extreme Denial isn't at the top of the list of Morrell's great work but it is still a very good and very enjoyable read. Morrell has written a similar main character to what he does with most of his work with Extreme Denial's main character Stephen Decker. If you enjoyed Mitch Coltrane (Double Image), Cavanaugh (The Protector) Malone (Burnt Sienna) or any of Morrell's other ex CIA, ex Special Forces characters which drive most of his novels then you'll really enjoy this novel as well.In Extreme Denial CIA agent Stephen Decker has finally had enough when he is teamed up with Brian McKittrick, the incompetent bumbling son of former chairman of the National Security Council, for an antiterrorism assignment in Rome. Saving both the son's and father's lives they use extreme denial to blame everything on him. Seeing a story on a unique historic type of housing in Santa Fe New Mexico and with no other plans Decker decides he'll relocate there. When looking at a house Decker gets the idea his training in dealing with people will probably make him a decent real estate agent so convinces the women who wants to sell him an expensive house to throw in a trial job for himself to clench the deal. Soon he is highly successful, meets a new female client Beth who is very attractive and like he did has moved to Santa Fe to start a new life. With romance blossoming Decker finally believes he has reinvented his life for the better. When he starts to notice someone from his past life in the streets and his and Beth's bedroom enjoyment is interrupted by guys firing machine guns Decker knows someone or some people don't want him to move on with his life.A great read, also check out Morrell's great reads First Blood, Burnt Sienna, The Protector, Double Image and Creepers as well!"},{"Title":"Extreme Denial","review":"One of his best books. I have been a Morrell fan for years, and the suspense and action in this book reminded me why. This book combines al of the things that makes Morrell a great author; it has loads of suspense, and action. Plus it has the human side; of love, and compassion which I find in many of his books."},{"Title":"Extreme Denial","review":"Well written, fast paced, and a GREAT plot. If they make a movie out of it, look out...it'll be a classic"},{"Title":"Extreme Denial","review":"This was the first book I read by Morrell, and it compelled me to..order all his others!! The action is fast and the situations are realistic. Moreover, the main character is well portrayed and believable in his desire to leave his CIA operative lifestyle behind, and in his attempts to return to a &quot;normal&quot; life, only to be forced to revert to his much needed survival skills. I found the combination of fast paced thriller and romance very successful, since many novels don't blend the two well. I give this book five stars!"},{"Title":"Extreme Denial","review":"Morrell draws you into the book immediately and never lets you go. His dialogue flows. Situations, chance meetings and suspence all grab you with realizm. I'll drop a book in the trash after 10 pages. This author won't let me do that. Great page turner. He's right up there with the best. Now I've got to get all the rest of his books...with pleasure."},{"Title":"Extreme Denial","review":"I have always liked David Morrell books. I still believe his early writings are his best. Fraturnity of the Stone is my favorite."},{"Title":"Extreme Denial","review":"This book by David Morrell is a winner! It combines all of the best ingredients of a spy thriller, a mystery, a love story and a police procedural. Morrell successfully combines several disparate characters to create an interesting mix of people who all contribute valuable pieces to the story and all of these different personalities are a piece of the pie that makes this book so enjoyable.Fans of Morrell's other well wrought and devised plots and characters will like the \\"good folks\\" they meet within the pages of this novel. The author's usual adeptness and pacing and creating tension are well honed in this novel as well. This is one of those thrillers that grabs the reader from the beginning and holds his/her attention right through the final denouement. Hardly a page goes by that the tension is raised to an almost fever pitch and then, in the interest of keeping the story flowing, is released somewhat. The good guys may get off the hook for the moment, but the respite is only temporary. The evil they face may retreat, but rest assured, it will return.This is a really great book for the reader who is snow-bound or on the beach. A great rainy day, housebound read, DO NOT start it late at night unless you plan on taking the next day off. With \\"Extreme Denial,\\" Morrell proves once again that he is a master of this genre (really a combination of several) and at the top of his form. New readers of Morrell will also find this book a great introduction to this author and after reading this story, I am sure you'll want to hunt down and read all of the installments in his extensive backlist ...P> I recommend this book to all fans of thrillers and mysteries.

YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."},{"Title":"Extreme Denial","review":"David Morrell kept me glued to the pages as the action never stopped, although I began to wonder, as repeated explosions and gunshots assailed his eardrums (and the character kept mentioning the effect on his hearing), whether he wouldn't be totally stone deaf by the end of the book. Our hero survived everything from being thrown over a cliff tied up with a plastic bag over his head, disguised as a dead body, to demolishing whole rooms-full of bad guys with lethal use of fireplace tools that crunch bone and throats. Sylvester Stallone, this is your kinda book. Hey, it's my kinda book too."},{"Title":"Extreme Denial","review":"The author must have greased his palms before he churned out this pot-boiler.

Excitement from the beginning until the final page. David Morrell surely can write with the James Bondish lines and believable content. His research is extremely precise, from his geographical facts, through his combat and covert knowledge.

I have almost every novel he has written and Extreme Denial is my favorite novel by him so far. It is amazing how great Morrell writes this book. Steve Decker just wants to have a new life outside of the CIA but when an old friend starts stiring up trouble he has to revert back into the CIA mode to save the women he loves and himself.The way the characters develop is great.

Laying underneath all the action runs a very well written love story, adding some real emotion to the story, without which, I would have pictured Decker as an Arnie B-movie character in a book.The plot keeps you going right to the end, and keeps suprising the reader with interesting and shocking twists - I would recommend this book to anyone who loves suspense thrillers."},{"Title":"Extreme Denial","review":"My faith in Morrell is restored.Hands down he writes better than Tom Clancy who used to be a favorite for thrillers. I had just read Last Revielle and was downcast but this one put Morrell back as #1 for me.

He sells a beautiful woman a house right next door to his. It doesn't take long for the two of them to christen his new bed and only two hours later for explosive action to rock him back to his former on the edge life style.

The story was totally compelling. I loved it. David Morrell is one of the best authors out there when it comes to non-stop action. Especially with all his older books. The ones of today are lacking. Try this book, especially if you're in to action and a little romance. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Chest Radiology: The Essentials","review":"Very well written text which is easy to read. Many useful mnemonics. Images are very good.This is a must have for all radiology residents. It is also very useful for interns, medicine, and other residents. In our institution the pulmonary fellows are required to read this text. I personally recommend it to all medical students who rotate through radiology, even if they choose another specialty."},{"Title":"Chest Radiology: The Essentials","review":"This book was highly recommended by fellow residents, however I have been rather disappointed in it. It does have good tables with differentials and covers a broad range of topics. This is a rather short text that can easily be read in a month's rotation which I think is nice as an introduction. What I found most disappointing were the images provided. As a beginning resident I was looking for lots of good sample images of the given pathology. I felt that too many of the images were the atypical presentation of the given pathology. I guess this could be helpful, but I found it confusing when I didn't even know what the typical presentation was. Overall, the text and tables are pretty good, however I felt like the sample images often didn't adequately show common presentations of the pathology."},{"Title":"Chest Radiology: The Essentials","review":"Well written, well organized. The book is written in a way that just makes sense to a beginning radiologist in the first few years of training. It seems to anticipate the questions you have & lays out the answers in a logical, brief fashion with excellent examples. While the book has more information than necessary for a medical student, anyone looking to specialize in radiology will find it a well-used companion as they progress in their education.Anyone looking for more advanced information on chest radiology will be disappointed. However, they should have caught the clue from the title. Use this book to get you started on your education, as the authors intended, and you'll be quite satisfied with your purchase."},{"Title":"Chest Radiology: The Essentials","review":"I'm a 1st year rads resident and this book was perfect for me. I read Felson's book the weekend before the rotation started (much recommended) and then read through this book over the 4 weeks of the rotation. It's great!Nice pictures (and lots of them), very useful tables with DDx's and mnemonics for said DDx's (I love mnemonics, so this was right up my alley...I actually got called to take a case one day and I had to give a DDx for Upper/Middle lung zone opacities and SHRIMP jumped into my head, effectively making me look much smarter than I actually am).This probably won't be too useful after about second year (too brief about disease descriptions), but it is a fantastic intro book to Chest."},{"Title":"Chest Radiology: The Essentials","review":"The other prior reviews were for the older edition, which I have not seen. The new edition is great. Concise, easy to read, short book that gives you all the information needed for a radiology resident. Covers all the pertinent topics that are hard to grasp well including interstitial lung disease. The new cardiac chapters are great as well and cover all the new modalities. Highly recommend this book for your chest rotation and for studying."},{"Title":"Chest Radiology: The Essentials","review":"This was a very superficial review of chest radiology. The pictures are not optimal for upper level residents and basically this is a good textbook for medical students and allied health professionals. Does have a very nice background introduction, but too much emphasis on chest radiography &quot;signs.&quot; Would not recommend overall, especially to radiology residents or practing radiologists."},{"Title":"The two Dianas","review":"Written in two volumes totaling just over 800 pages, The two Dianas in this tome are Diana de Poitiers, the long-time mistress of Henry II of France and their daughter Diana. On his eighteenth birthday Gabriel de Montgommery is told the truth about his birth, that he is the son of Count Jacques de Montgommery who disappeared mysteriously after his mistress Diana de Poitiers caught the eye of Henry, then Dauphine of France. Gabriel's childhood playmate Diana suddenly finds herself revealed as the daughter of King Henry and de Poitiers and the King has arranged for her to be married to the Duke of Castro, although at twelve it's to be a marriage in name only.Several years pass as Gabriel strikes for fame and fortune under the guise of the Viscount d'Exmes (it being too dangerous to use the de Montgommery name), and a widowed Diana charms the French court as a most favored daughter of the King. When the two meet again, it's love at first sight (of course), but a deep secret emerges that if true could bar the two from becoming lovers - and if not true the hatred Henry bears Gabriel's father also threatens to keep them apart. The only person who can answer the puzzle is a mysterious prisoner who has been locked away in Chtelet prison and forgotten, forbidden to utter a word.\\"....and so, filled with wonder at the remarkable contrast between the two Dianas, he said to himself that God had no doubt filled the daughter with such excellent virtues in order to make good the crimes of the mother.\\"In Volume I Gabriel and Diana's story interweaves with that of Henry, his wife Catherine de Medici, the cold hearted Diana de Poitiers and the machinations of the French court as well as the siege of Saint Quentin and the recapture of Calais as Gabriel is willing to risk all to gain Henry's goodwill and hold him to his promise to release the prisoner in the Chtelet. In Volume II, fate and circumstances beyond his control compel Gabriel ever closer to The Last Tourney and his destiny as foretold by Nostradamus,The young lion shall overcome the older one,on the field of combat in single battle,He shall pierce his eyes in a golden cage,Two forces one, then he shall die a cruel death.The latter part of Volume II switches gears and concentrates less on the two lovers and more on the growing unrest between the Catholics and the Huguenots, the Amboise conspiracy, as well as the battle for power and control of the throne between the de Guises and Catherine de Medici, and might be a bit slow paced for some readers (especially if you're not familiar with the period), but I found it fascinating. I was fortunate enough to have read a couple of books recently that deals with the same period and characters, but don't be afraid to spend a bit of time researching them if you're feeling lost as to who's who. No lengthy author's notes or genealogy charts in these 100 year old volumes.This was a fabulous read packed with star-crossed lovers, mystery, treachery, intrigue and more - let alone the addition of Martin Guerre and his infamous look-alike as Gabriel's squire. ROFL at the predicaments poor Martin always found himself embroiled in at the hands of Arnold du Thull. What a joy to accidentally come across this long-forgotten Dumas, and I heartily recommend it to any Dumas fan or those interested in reading up on this period in France's history - although the real Diana de Castro's fate is different from what Dumas wrote.Side note: I do see that this has been published recently by two different publishing houses and without being able to compare the text online I would tread cautiously. Both claim to have 400 pages (a tad bit less than the 800 I read), let alone knowing who translated it - a bad Dumas translation can turn a great book into something quite mediocre. From looking at the online sellers there are plenty of the 1910 Collier editions available for sale - and don't forget to try for an interlibrary loan. You might get lucky, I did."},{"Title":"The two Dianas","review":"First, get yourself a copy of a PF Collier edition of this book, it comes in 2 volumes. Second, sit down and enjoy! I thought I had read all of Dumas' books, but I was wrong. THis is a great historical romance taking place during the reign of Henry II in France. The two Dianas are Diana de Portier (Henry's mistress) and Diana de Castro (Henry's illegitimate daughter). THe first volume concentrates on the love of Diana de Castro and Gabriel Montgommery and all the trials and tribulations involved. There is a nice retelling of the Martin Guerre story and a very exciting depiction of the capture of Calais by the French under the command of the duke de Guise (the Balafre') and Gabriel. The second book focuses more on the Catholic/Protestant problems during the reign of Francis (who is married to Mary future queen of Scots) which continue (bloodily) under Charles IX. Catherine de Medici of course is also an important character. Its Dumas at his best, evil characters, noble soldiers, and people swept around by events they cannot control. I am so glad I found it, its vintage Dumas! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The two Dianas","review":"The story of Diana de Poitiers (mistress of Henry II) and her daughter, Diana de Castro. In this first volume, the battles of Saint-Quentin and the first battle of Calais are reported. Dumas as an unique way to write tremendous dialogues. It is curious how this book is not so well known.At Dumas pere site ([...]...), we found the explanation this book was in fact written with four hands, Dumas and Paul Meurice. Both volumes are covered with plenty of historical facts, such as the French reconquest of Calais after more than 20 years under the English siege. Already, we start to know the true character of Catherine de Medicis and her role on history, especially after Henry II's death. The figure of Mary Stuart plays an important role on this drama. The figure of the famous Ambroise Pare, the famous French surgeon is also introduced as well as his audacious surgical techniques which were able to save the Duke de Guise's life during the battle of Calais.Gabriel's fate was presented by Nostradamus, as it follows:\\"En joute, en amour, cettuy toucheraLe front du roy,Et cornes ou bien trou sanglant mettraAu front du roy,Mais le veuille ou non, toujours blesseraLe front du roy ;Enfin, l'aimera, puis, las ! le tueraDame du roy.\\"The meetings between Gabriel and Henry II were terrifying one never knew which one will give the last word. The last sentence of this prophecy was only understood in the very end of this volume, it was in fact intriguing. However, the real facts occurred with Gabriel differed by the end provided by these authors. The sequel of The Two Dianas is Le Page du duc de Savoie."},{"Title":"Education in a Free Society","review":"This book attacks the public education system from multiple Libertarian angles. The first article is &quot;touchy-feely libertarianism,&quot; arguing that &quot;innate goodness&quot; can be relied upon to create a good education system. Another approach is historic, using the example of New York to show how public ed. wormed it's way into America through deceit and fraud, and how it is designed to promoted conformity. Another great article claims harm is done to children in school, and that public schools waste the majority of each student's day.I have recommended this book to several friends.In conclusion, EDUCATION IN A FREE SOCIETY is an interesting attack on the American &quot;tax school&quot; system of education that's worth your time and money."},{"Title":"Genital Cutting and Transnational Sisterhood: DISPUTING U.S. POLEMICS","review":"Technology has its benefits, and one of them is that university press books look fantastic these days. The somewhat ponderously titled \\"Genital Cutting and Transnational Sisterhood: Disputing U.S. Polemics,\\" edited by Stanlie M. James and Claire C. Robertson, is no exception. Handsomely presented as it is on high quality paper, with a stylized drawing on the dust jacket of a woman of apparently African origin holding a knife, it leaves the reader hoping only that the quality of the writing holds up to the production values.Unfortunately, with some exceptions, \\"Genital Cutting and Transnational Sisterhood\\" is a disappointment. In fairness to editors James and Robertson, they are following on the heels of the magisterial \\"Female \`Circumcision' in Africa: Culture, Controversy and Change,\\" edited by Bettina Shell-Duncan and Ylva Hernlund and a must-read for any serious follower of genital cutting issues, as well as the highly distinguished volume by Ellen Gruenbaum entitled \\"The Female Circumcision Controversy: An Anthropological Perspective.\\" (Both of these books are jointly reviewed on page __ of the current issue.) Once one has finished reading the Shell-Duncan/Hernlund masterwork, it is hard to imagine what can be left to say regarding the interrelation of female genital cutting (FGC) and culture and politics.Then again, one of the big problems with \\"Genital Cutting\\" is its failure to acknowledge its predecessors and contextualize its perspectives with those contained in these earlier efforts. No serious work evidently positioning itself for critical and scholarly attention can afford to entirely ignore major books appearing several years previously, and yet James and Robertson do exactly that. Are they hoping the readers won't know about the other publications? Do they consider themselves to have such original insights that the other volumes are irrelevant? If so, they are mistaken.Activists for genital integrity may find themselves irritated when in their introduction, on page 7, the editors trot out the old throwaway statement about male circumcision being \\"much more minor\\" than female genital cuttings. As is usual with such claims, no effort is made to justify this unreferenced assertion. More surprisingly, the authors also make the unforgivable mistake of assuming that FGC only occurs in Africa.Yet each of the slim volume's total of five essays does have genuinely novel and useful points to make. In her opening essay, Christine J. Walley asks why FGC tends to be viewed \\"in either/or terms, in other words, either in terms of cultural relativism or politically informed outrage\\"? [italics in original] She goes on to give us something I have never read from a first-world feminist author before, an overall positive description of female ritual initiation, explaining its undeniable cultural roles in non-inflammatory terms. Regarding young Sabaot women in Uganda whose ceremonies she observed, she provocatively notes that 1) excision is both in and against the women's interests [italics in original], and 2) at least some of the girls of both the circumcised Sabaot group and the Bukusu ethnic group, which does not practice FGC, envied those in the other group for their circumcision status! Regrettably, Walley makes an unforgivably misleading claim regarding male circumcision, when--immediately following a long discussion of different African ethnic groups' practices regarding FGC--she suggests that male circumcision \\"has historically been and at present remains a potent marker of group identity in European countries.\\" Uninformed North American readers could easily thereby be misled to understand that, say, Italians distinguish themselves from the French based on their circumcision status; an examination of Walley's references demonstrates that the \\"groups\\" that she is suggesting mark their identity by circumcision are the Jews, pure and simple.While Walley's critique of \\"one-size-fits-all\\" cultural assumptions is all well and good, she lacks self-awareness to see the similar limitations in her own perspective, e.g. regarding male circumcision. After a while one also tires of her endless critiques of others' work, which contain scanty concrete suggestions of their own.In her individual essay, co-editor Claire Robertson contributes some good thoughts regarding some of the miscues committed by overzealous, shortsighted North American feminist activists against FGC such as Alice Walker and Fran Hosken. Robertson's comment is well-taken that African women are all too often viewed primarily in regards to the FGC issue. Robertson also makes a thought-provoking point that in the West men often feel they must do something to prove their manhood, and in Africa FGC is sometimes similarly seen as a prerequisite to womanhood. Appreciation for and sensitivity to these cultural analogies will no doubt prove important to the movements for genital integrity in both Africa and North America. Later Robertson makes an interesting point about how \\"American assumptions of a superior U.S. Civilization and African barbarity\\" help explain US law that criminalizes FGC but not genital procedures done by North Americans even where similar results ensue.Walker and Hosken are perhaps easy targets and Robertson (who as a white woman focusing on Africa may perhaps feel somewhat vulnerable herself) does at times overextend her critique. She complains of misspellings of cited authors' names while herself failing to catch her co-editor's embarrassing citation of the Senegalese anti-FGC Tostan program as \\"Tolstan.\\" Robertson also makes some revealing errors, either misunderstanding or failing to correct government lawyers' reported claim that the only grounds for political asylum are a woman's need to avoid forced FGC, whereas actually African women have been granted political asylum for many other reasons. Two pages later Robertson erroneously suggests, again without a stated citation, that US courts often grant custody to a father if representations are made that the mother cannot support them. (In fact, American courts are sharply biased toward the mother in custody determinations.)Surprisingly, in her own essay, co-editor Stanlie James is unaccountably sympathetic to Fran Hosken and Hanny Lightfoot-Klein (both of whom her fellow editor Robertson lambastes) while echoing Robertson in again taking Alice Walker to task. Regrettably, James' analysis is flawed due to her ignorance of the hallowed human rights principle of customary law, which allows a human rights treaty to be considered legally binding even upon states that do not ratify it.The editors save the best for last. Isabelle Gunning scores some points I haven't seen before by pointing out the evidently complete lack of input by non-governmental organizations into the California anti-FGC law. Hearings were allegedly held but mysteriously no written or videotaped evidence of their contents is available. The official assumption that people do not need to know the content or specific language of a law, but rather should be told what they need to hear, is nicely described as \\"maternalistic.\\" In the body of her essay, while Gunning always avoids taking to the next level her analysis of parallels between FGC and male circumcision, she still provides some nice discussion. Thus it is a shame that her notes indicate an astonishingly complete lack of awareness of both the 1999 American Academy of Pediatrics position statement and the internal dynamics that led to the 1989 statement, despite the existence of a published law review article discussing in detail Edgar Schoen's 1989 machinations.Intersex activist Cheryl Chase's closing essay is the book's standout piece. Chase is a very down-to-earth, matter-of-fact writer, and yet the majesty and drama of her claims soar far above the relatively pedestrian contributions of the book's other authors. We learn that intersex activists who asked that the federal anti-FGC law be enforced in their favor met with a stony silence. Chase skillfully integrates her own story, including a mother who was drugged whenever she asked doctors what was wrong with her child, not to mention Chase's own self-transformation from repeat suicide attempter into intersex activist. A disturbing tale emerges of a medical world so determined to engineer reality that often intersex people undergo complex procedures free of charge and border crossings are quickly arranged to facilitate the allaying of society's anxiety over ambiguous genitalia. Intersex activists must struggle for feminist support, Chase suggests, \\"because intersexuality undermines the stability of the category \`woman' that undergirds much first-world feminist discourse... Cutting intersex genitals becomes yet another hidden mechanism for imposing normalcy upon unruly flesh, a means of containing the potential anarchy of desires and identifications within oppressive heteronormative structures.\\"\\"Genital Cutting and Transnational Sisterhood\\" is a bit too sloppy for an academic book and perhaps a tad too theoretical for anyone else. Cheryl Chase and Isabelle Gunning provide the standout essays of the book, which still amply repays the attention and time of anyone who cares about the worldwide struggle to protect genital integrity. But read \\"Female \`Circumcision' in Africa\\" first!"},{"Title":"The Young Widow (St. Martin's Minotaur Mysteries)","review":"What a wonderful, fun read. Escape to a world that is a cross between that of Peter Wimsey and Bridget Jones with a dash of Clue thrown in.I was torn between dashing through this to see who poisoned wealthy Geoffery Berowne in the study of estate and taking it in slow bites to relish each character and scene. I chose the latter and enjoyed my stay in the English countryside, despite the cloud of the clever murder hanging overhead. I felt as frustrated as aristocratic amateur sleuth Phillip Bethancourt and his friend Scotland yard detective Jack Gibbons as various family members and servants seemed likely suspects, and then they didn't.I look forward to more from this writer. (BTW, I see Hugh Grant as Bethancourt if it should ever hit the screen.)"},{"Title":"The Young Widow (St. Martin's Minotaur Mysteries)","review":"As an Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers fan I am delighted to have found another writer in the same genre. I do hope there will be many more from this author. So many modern crime writers seem to need to wallow in gory forensic details which make for very unpleasant reading. It is good to find writing that doesn't pander to the current obsession for the deeply nasty.As a Brit, I did notice that it was written by an American, but felt very flattered at her evident love of all things British."},{"Title":"The Young Widow (St. Martin's Minotaur Mysteries)","review":"\\"Annette Berowne had a sweet, heart-shaped face. She had honey-blond hair and wide brown eyes. She was not beautiful, and certainly not glamorous, but only Phillip Bethancourt noticed that.\\"So begins Cassandra Chan's debut novel, The Young Widow, in her debut mystery series of Phillip Bethancourt and Jack Gibbons mysteries (clearly this book is a CLW review because of the author and not the main characters). But before discussing Annette Berowne, it is important to know about Gibbons and Bethancourt.Bethancourt and Gibbons could not be more different. Everything comes easily to Phillip Bethancourt, a young and wealthy Englishman with a model girlfriend and posh apartment to match his high standard of living. Jack Gibbons, on the other hand, is more of an everyman--an ambitious detective sergeant at Scotland Yard, Gibbons has his eye on more important things than parties and women: he's watching for a career-making case. Despite their differences the two men strike an easy friendship, largely because of Bethancourt's interest in all things criminal and his knack for helping Gibbons with his more, shall we say, complex cases.Annette Berowne, meanwhile, is the not beautiful nor glamorous widow of the murder victim in Gibbons' latest case. From the start, Annette Berowne seems like the obvious suspect, a young woman married to a man who could be her father usually is. Especially when that woman has been married to two other older men. Men who also died under unique circumstances.However, as Jack and Phillip soon realize, Annette is not the only one who would benefit from Berowne's death. In fact, the small town near the family estate is ripe with suspects, as is the family itself. Still, the investigation seems to perpetually turn back to the enchanting Annette Berowne. No matter how desperately Gibbons tries to find a more likely suspect.As Bethancourt observes his friend's, indeed everyone's, growing infatuation with the young widow his initial detachment becomes worry as Bethancourt begins to wonder if his friend could be walking down a path that will shatter his ambitious career before it's really begun.The Young Widow is what I would call a quiet book. Chan's prose is witty and sharp, but it is also subtle. The book is rich with humor, but it is the restrained kind so usually associated with the English. The writing here cannot be devoured, rather it has to relished--readers have to linger. Both myself and my mother found the characters and the plot to be thoroughly enjoyable even with slight confusion at the beginning due to an influx of many characters' names over a short number of pages.One of the particular strong suits of the writing here is Chan's use of dialogue where she mixes humor, plot, and character interaction in perfect combination. One of my favorite excerpts will hopefully illustrate that point with a conversation between Bethancourt and his young nephew:\\"I've got to dress,\\" said Bethancourt, stubbing out his cigarette. \\"Then we'll go for a drive in the country.\\"\\"I just came in from the country,\\" said Denis.\\"I can't help that,\\" answered Bethancourt. \\"Anyway, this will be different country and you can ride in the back with Cerberus.\\"He fled to his bedroom.Although the story centers on the murder investigation, Chan's characters are fully-realized in her crystal clear representations of Gibbons and Bethancourt who seem ready to walk right off the page and into real life. This novel falls into the mystery genre without being formulaic (although I did guess the murderer, but since that rarely happens it was more enjoyable than annoying). Chan gives equal time to plot and characters to create not only a wonderful first book but strong footing for a series that already has three books to its credit.You can read more about Gibbon's and Bethancourt's investigations in Village Affairs (2006) and Trick of the Mind (2008)."},{"Title":"The Young Widow (St. Martin's Minotaur Mysteries)","review":"Smashing, fun read!

However, one thing that bothered me the most about it was that a medical reference in the book was inaccurate: Diabetic patients usually receive their insulin injections via subcutaneous injection; intravenous injections of insuliin is usually only given in emergency situations. However, in the book, a retired nurse mentioned how the suspect might have killed one of her late husbands by injecting air into his vein during his regular insulin treatment. I always expect writers to do their research thoroughly, especially when diabetes is such a well-known disease...That hiccup aside, not a bad read."},{"Title":"The Young Widow (St. Martin's Minotaur Mysteries)","review":"This is the introductory novel in the Jack Gibbons/Phillip Bethancourt series. For a later novel in the series seeA Spider on the Stairs. I have always liked British mysteries because they rely on an intellectual challenge rather than guns and violence. In this case we have a wealthy man who has been poisoned with lillies of the valley - the cut stems will poison the water in a vase. He had married a much younger woman, disliked by the family, as his second wife, and she is the prime suspect. All evidence is circumstantial, but the widow had previously been married to two other older men who died. There is speculation that she might be a blsck widow, preying on older men.The novel introduces Sergeant Jack Gibbons of Scotland Yard and his friend, the wealthy Phillip Bethancourt. Both are Oxford graduates. The novel spends some amount of plot filling in the backgrounds of the two men and the other characters. The plot becomes complex as the investigation reveals extra-marital affairs including a rake who preys on married women. Both Jack and Phillip become involved with women in the case. There are questions about who will benefit from the man's death, and in what way - there are other things involved besides money.The novel is a bit slow reading because of the details filling in various backgrounds, but you get drawn into the plot as it progresses. Scotland Yard discovers that you need to be sure of your facts, and the novel has a surprising conclusion."},{"Title":"The Young Widow (St. Martin's Minotaur Mysteries)","review":"I think Cassandra is very cool.

Most writers tend to focus on a part of SOF, either one unit (Robinson's MASTERS OF CHAOS), operation (Robin Moore's HUNTING DOWN SADDAM), team (Simons' THE COMPANY THEY KEEP), or operator (Durant's IN THE COMPANY OF HEROES or the generals who did books with Tom Clancy). This is understandable, as not only are there better stories and compelling characters for writers at this level, but few have the background to tell the whole story.LEAVE NO MAN BEHIND is a different way to take a slice of the SOF pie. It traces from 1945 the history of US raids to liberate good guys or grab bad guys. This provides a trip through some of the high and low points of US special operations up to the seizure of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. The narrative links the different raids together, showing the changes in SOF over the years, with the rise of SOCOM and the rejection of Clinton-era irrationality in SOF commitment polices getting high marks.LEAVE NO MAN BEHIND reminds me of another excellent SOF book that uses a series of historical case studies to make its point, McRaven's SPEC OPS (which it used as a source). LEAVE NO MAN BEHIND differs in that its case studies are limited to US examples since 1945 and after of one specific type of direct action (itself only a small part of what SOF does) rather than ranging through history and looking at other countries. It also differs in what the author brings to then history. While McRaven was a big-time SEAL, Isby is a Washington policy wonk (albeit with combat experience in Afghanistan that in wrote about in the old SOLDIER OF FORTUNE magazine).Overall LEAVE NO MAN BEHIND is an excellent book, both in its presentation of history and its use of that history as a basis for analysis. There are some minor errors and omissions, especially on the more recent stuff. There is no mention of the KESTREL PHOENIX CPX/FTX of 2000, despite its high profile, that exercised a then-current OPLAN. The treatment of the raid on Mullah Omar's house in Kandahar in October 2001 is little better than you get from Seymour Hersh. But, all in all, LEAVE NO MAN BEHIND is recommended reading for special operators and those that need to work with them, or are interested in how smart and brave guys committed to high risk missions worked (or failed) in the past."},{"Title":"Leave No Man Behind: US Special Forces Raids and Rescues From 1945 to the Gulf War","review":"Mr. Isby has created a great work on how the U.S. has attempted to rescue POWs and Hostages, and seize high-value enemy leaders, since 1945. He leads off with the last successful mission before the Iraq War, the Los Banos raid in the Philippines in 1945, before going on to Korea, the famous Son Tay raid in Vietnam, the seizure of the S.S. Myaguez, Iran in 1980, Grenada, Panama, Mogadishu in 1993, attempted seizure of both Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar in Afghanistan, and the three most famous raids of the Iraq War: the rescue of PFC Jessica Lynch, the killing of both Uday and Qusay Hussein, and the capture of their father.He gives praise when it is deserved, and issues proper criticism when needed. It was good to see someone from the U.K. praising instead of heaping scorn on the Lynch rescue, as he has given the most even-handed treatment of the raid outside the U.S. that I have seen so far. All in all, a good read about the missions that give those who go on them the pride that they went into harm's way and returned prisoners home to family and friends."},{"Title":"Leave No Man Behind: US Special Forces Raids and Rescues From 1945 to the Gulf War","review":"Elite fighting men launched on desperate missions makes for good reading. LEAVE NO MAN BEHIND is a look at the reality behind many novels, movies and even today's headlines. It is serious military history, covering 1945-2004, and will repay close reading. If you wonder why special forces have not been able to grab bin Ladin, Mullah Omar, and other evil men, then the 13 case studies in this book should give you a good idea of how difficult it is to reconcile the instant reaction and detailed planning that this would require. At the end, you will be wiser than one William Jefferson Clinton, who appears herein asking an unsympathetic general why a helicopter full of \\"black ninjas\\" cannot handle the bin Ladin problem for him. While Clinton was obviously more at home with the Hollywood fantasy; this book gives you the hard reality. The focus is on how these missions interacted with either national strategy or theater war-fighting and what led to their success or failure, rather than the view from the individual raider. Most of the case studies have at least one map, which is greatly appreciated. The author's style is clear, but tends to be technical. I was glad for the extensive glossary."},{"Title":"Leave No Man Behind: US Special Forces Raids and Rescues From 1945 to the Gulf War","review":"This book was pretty good, it covered the detailed role of the actual planning of one of the most risky types of operation that special operations forces must deal with. The one thing that curbed my satisfaction was that fact that the book was not about the U.S. Army Special Forces (Green Berets), it was about special oerations in general. Although all of the stories were good and exciting, I was expecting stories from Special Forces ODA's and such...I think that some people need to realize that the term Special Forces refers to the actual U.S. Army Special Forces, not just every special operations or spec op capable outfit. It should be titled US Special Operations Raids and rescues from 1945 to the Gulf War. Plus, anyone can tell that the grammer was poor, lots of the spelling was in British English, not American English...so there are some errors there but it is perfectly readable. If you like reading about spec ops in general, then this is a good read, but if you are more interested in U.S. Army Special Forces specifically, then this is not the right book for you, I would suggest Masters of Chaos, that is a very exciting and modern depiction of the Green Berets."},{"Title":"Leave No Man Behind: US Special Forces Raids and Rescues From 1945 to the Gulf War","review":"I bought this book primarily based on the customer reviews on Amazon.

Gary Gordon and Sfc. Randy Shughart. It is truly a disgrace to two of America's finest heroes. It says that when they were inserted, they had AH-6 littlebird support... really now? I dont think so! It says that both pulled crew members from the crash. Only Shughart did. It states that Shughart was first to die but Gordon was. It says that Shughart weilded and M4...

However, I must say that Prof. Slaatte's book turned out to be a disappointment. Despite the evidently good intentions of the author, he does not really get &quot;there&quot;. This is to be regretted all the more, because the Index of the book is promising and consists of very relevant Berdiaevian entries, and because Prof. Slaatte's reading approach involves a multitude of detailed references to pages in Berdiaev's books.For this or that reason, Prof. Slaatte's book does not really go into the thought of Berdiaev but somehow stays gliding in the surface. I see it as possible that Prof. Slaatte's own frame of reference is too different to allow ascent or descent into Berdiaev's sphere. The part of Berdiaev's ample production that Prof. Slaatte goes through is also limited. I find the best book on Berdiaev to be the one by Olivier Clement's, but it is only available in French, albeit in an edition that is not sold out by far."},{"Title":"Elements of Set Theory","review":"The only reason I won't say it's THE BEST introduction to set theory is that I haven't read ALL such introductions. I am (obviously) a student of logic and I worked my way through the whole book a few years ago. It is an insightful development of set theory, both as a foundation for mathematics and a distinctive mathematical discipline in its own right. Set theory can be developed from a &quot;naive&quot; or an &quot;axiomatic&quot; perspective. The naive approach simply asks the reader to accept arguments about sets on the basis of informed intuition, whereas the axiomatic approach relies on showing how mathematical proofs can be formalized as deductions from a precise axiom system. Enderton's book deftly combines both approaches ; axiomatic considerations are isolated from the rest of the text and identified by a stripe running down the side of the page. Those who are not interested in axioms can avoid dealing with them almost entirely, but enthusiasts of formal rigor (like me!) won't be disappointed either. The axioms, which comprise a system known as Zermelo Fraenkel set theory with Choice, are introduced as needed in the overall development (so Replacement Axioms aren't mentioned until page 179). The text develops relations and functions as well as natural and real number systems, and then goes on to cardinals, orderings, and ordinals. I particularly enjoyed Enderton's well-motivated exposition of ordinals, which clearly shows how these numbers measure the lengths of well-orderings. His treatment of cardinals, transfinite induction, and the Axiom of Choice, is enlightening as well. A final chapter, which includes cofinality and inaccessible cardinals, should whet the student's appetite for further study in set theory. I have a hard time thinking of anything negative to say about this book. Perhaps it would be better if its nicely annotated bibliography were a bit more extensive. If you wanna learn set theory, buy this book!"},{"Title":"Elements of Set Theory","review":"Perhaps because it is a Foundations book -- in my mathematics training it always seemed that the people who did the best job of motivating and explaining (or at least making you feel you understood) the material were Foundations people -- but this book has a presentation polished to the point where the closest genre of mathematics text in level of polish would be intro calculus books, where the problems theorems and proofs have been worked over for many many many years. Here, however, the material is in great part relatively recent - probably the closest to contemporary stuff you can see as an undergraduate -- in Real Analysis, by contrast, you may well just be coming out of the 19th century by graduate school. This polish, I have discovered in later years, facilitates use of this book for self-study and it is a wonderful text for providing rapid refreshment of important concepts. I have over the years referred back to it on a number of occassions and have always been pleasantly reminded what a wonderful book it is.This is a very nice book and the best introduction to the material I have seen (although, given the number of intro books I have seen on the topic, this may not be a strong statement)."},{"Title":"Elements of Set Theory","review":"The style is readable without being wordy. The book starts with a good, intuitive discussion of sets and the axiomatic method, but follows with a sketchy description of truth tables. The rest of the book is similarly uneven. It is best when introducing some topics with extensive motivation. Its main weaknesses are in the completeness of the explanations and the clarity of the proofs. Several of the proofs were the cause of much head-scratching. That shouldn't happen in an elementary text. There were several spots in the text where the train of thought is not clear. Sections that I particularly thought were sloppy and inadequate were the development of cardinals and the Axiom of Choice.As math textbooks go, I've read better, but for an undergraduate introduction to set theory, the competition is not very impressive. There are 23 errata listed on his web site. It is a simple matter to pencil in the corrections. One book you should consider as an alternative is Hrbacek & Jech. If the high price is an issue, the text by Stoll does a good job with the basics."},{"Title":"Elements of Set Theory","review":"I might sound biased, but who doesn't? Enderton's book is the BEST introduction out there if you want to learn. There are better books for conciseness or pendanticalness, what a word :(. But, he introduces the material in such a way that the novice can actual absorb most of it in one go through. It's deep enough that a return trip through a difficult chapter is worth your time. After reading this text you can easily segueway to Moschovakis's book, \\"Notes on Set Theory\\" or even attempt books like \\"Set Theory An Introduction To Independence Proofs (Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics)\\" by Kunen.This book covers all of the basics of set theory (greater in scope than Halmos's \\"Naive Set Theory\\" (which is a great book by the way))."},{"Title":"Elements of Set Theory","review":"This is a good book on Set Theory -- and it is axiomatic set theoy.

Anyone who has taken an introductory course in logic should be able to follow this text.The exercises cover a nice range of difficulties and really help solidify the reader's understanding of each topic. I highly suggest that anyone who wants to truly learn set theory at least attempt every problem.The only aspect of Enderton's writing I am not a fan of is his unfortunate habit of leaving out many of the underlying logical steps in his proofs. I would advise the reader to rework the more important proofs presented in the text, explicitly showing each step in the derivation."},{"Title":"Elements of Set Theory","review":"The book is nice and simple and well explained. The exercises problems are solvable and are not contest problems like in some books. Pretty much most of the other reviews have summed it up well. I can confidently say that among books written on Set Theory (like by Cohen, Halmos, Stoll, Hrbacek & Jech), that I bought and tried to read, this book is SIMPLY THE BEST introduction to Set Theory. Blindly read this book and no other book. It has enough set theory to get you going in pure mathematics.Addition to the review on 11/21/2012: I am close to being done with the arithmatic section and I must say that a book on set theory cannot possibly be better than this one. I have all the material I need to know in order to get a good start for Real Analysis. Those parts of the proof that he says \\"is left as an exercise\\" are truly trivial after following the material that is covered till that point. This book is SIMPLY THE BEST. Don't think twice. Just get this book and read it top to bottom. There is a good reason why Stanford and Berkeley prescribe this book as the text for their Set Theory courses every year. I know that Hrbacek and Jech is one contender but I am very biased towards Enderton's book as he makes this subject unbelievably simple where as other books (and definitely Halmos's book) makes it seem harder than what it is."},{"Title":"Elements of Set Theory","review":"For some reason I really liked the voice of this book.

Reading it feels like a real person is talking to me, a nice, fiendly person. It's hard to put down. However, my proffesor liked to stray away from the book, so I was forced to put this book down and instead focus on my proffesor's notes. Enderton is clear, nice to read, and simple.

It's something I like to look at when I'm looking for inspiration on vintge style, but there's not much context here. I'd love a bit of socio-history to give it some substance."},{"Title":"FAMILY AND FRIENDS","review":"If this novel were a person, one would find it hard to get to know, and harder to come to love. It has a peculiarly distant and reserved quality to it, as if it were shy and did not want anyone to approach too closely for observation. As is often the case with people, however, the timid and withdrawn character of this novel do not indicate shallowness, but rather a complex and interesting nature for some reason fearful of easy discovery. &quot;Family and Friends&quot;, unlike other Brookner stories, takes place in the somewhat remote past. Its author has chosen a decidedly abstracted narrative style, hard to catch hold of at first, perhaps, but one which gradually earns for itself a fascination uniquely its own. As is usual with Brookner, the story told is first rate, the characters nearly as memorable as one's first heartstopping brush with love. Her themes? The uphill ascent of an adult life; escape as a watermelon rind of light on a sometimes graspable horizon; the complexity of family life as puzzle within puzzle. Though the story imbedded in the pages of &quot;Family and Friends&quot; may at first seem as inaccessible as the images trapped inside an old sepia photograph, try persistence. There is a terrific tale here, ready, if you are, to leap into life."},{"Title":"FAMILY AND FRIENDS","review":"This is my first Anita Brookner book and I have complex feelings about this book. It is very depressing and written in such an arid style that I find myself flipping to the back to see how much further I have left to read. Normally, I love reading books about families and their \\"issues\\" but this family is so normal that I find myself wondering what their issues were. I ended this book with a dejected feeling ~~ is that all to this book? I will read another Brookner book before I give up on her.Sofka is the matritach of the family, with oldest irresponsible and shameless flirt, Frederick. Then there is Mimi, the perfect and docile daughter. Betty is the irrepressible youngest daughter who decides to run off to Paris to live flamboyantly. Then there is stern Alfred who was brought up to run the family's finances since Frederick couldn't be counted on to be responsible. And this book is about their lives ~~ how they attempt to leave behind their upbringing. Mimi and Alfred remain behind to devote themselves to their mother while Betty and Frederick took off for places unknown to do what they want to do. And in the end, they remain just as estranged from their family and mother just as they've always been. However, Sofka devotes her thoughts and energy to those two and labels them as her favorite. Even at the end ~~ she remained devoted to her eldest son and youngest daughter, though Mimi and Alfred spent their entire lives taking care of Sofka.This book is a disturbing look into familial relations and of expectations that didn't measure up. It is an interesting book ~~ but written with such a dry style that I find myself often putting it aside. It is not the worst book I've ever read ~~ but it's not the best. It's great for English literature enthusiasts ~~ but not for others.4-8-03"},{"Title":"FAMILY AND FRIENDS","review":"I've read most of Ms.Brookners books and found this one to be typical of her great writing skills.This may have been the best one I've read-just so poignant I couldn't put it down.I'm sure I'll read it again."},{"Title":"FAMILY AND FRIENDS","review":"What makes the writing of Anita Brookner so good?The first thing is the precise beauty of her language. The second, is her remarkable insight into human life and relationships. Here she traces a family history, a widowed matriarch and four children. This is the world of cultured Central European exiles who have made a new home in Great Britain. It is a family of the most assimilated kind of Jews imaginable, bound together not by religion but by family history and tradition.In tracing the family history Brookner reveals how much life involves the pursuit of dreams and illusions, contradicted time and again by unexpected realities.Reading a Brookner book is being in the company of a refined intelligence whose understanding of life continually enriches one's own."},{"Title":"FAMILY AND FRIENDS","review":"In this novel Mrs Brookner portrays the Dorn family. The head of the family, Mr Dorn, died sometime ago but there is Sofka the mother who is contemplating a photo album in which there are pictures of her children's weddings. She is a languid woman with few friends and deeply devoted to the members of her family. She constantly worries what will happen to the lives of her four children, how they will deal with the world and the world with them. There are two daughters, Mireille - Mimi - and Babette - Betty. The former is to marry Mr Lautner, the man who practically runs the family factory in London, quite late in life and the latter hurriedly marries Max Markus in Paris, the son of a film producer and they subsequently move to Beverly Hills. Sofka's elder son Frederick, a sympathetic but far from hard-working man finds his way into the hotel business on the Italian Riviera by marrying Evie. The younger son Alfred on the other hand is an austere man who is sternly devoted to the family business at the expense of his private life.The characters are well drawn although the plot does not offer much in terms of excitement or suspense. In this sense it is a true family and friends novel: people meeting, sons and daughters making their way into the world and a mother affectionately remembering her children's youth."},{"Title":"America: Republic, Religion, Revenge","review":"An insightful and objective look at the American Political environment in the 21st century, exposing not just the problems, but also the root causes of what motivates people to behave in a manner that is devastating to the future of American society.

It gets scary and frustrating, especially for a new parent. There are many thousands of reasons, but this book helped me to understand why my baby is the way she is and what she might need. I am fully behind Dr. and Mrs. Sears in their attachment parenting. Too often, we listen to and are even advised to listen to past generations of parenting skills. While this might be just what you need some times, there's a better view in these books. Past generations &quot;tell it the way it is&quot; as if there just is no other way, and I say &quot;THERE IS A BETTER WAY!&quot;While there are things that are recommended in this book that may not work for you, or fit in with your way of thinking, most will probably help considerably. Some of you may be put off by the idea of &quot;sharing the family bed&quot; for instance. While my husband and I didn't need to do this, I can see how it would be very beneficial for some poor mom (and/or dad) that needs to be feeding her baby every 2 hours! Society shouldn't frown on that!The Sears' teach bonding with and therefore understanding your child and their needs. Without this bond, as so many have missed out on unwillingly, parenting is much more difficult and stressful.This is a terrific book for you to read while you are in third term of pregnancy, a current parent, and a great gift for soon to be parent.If you try their techniques for an area you have a need in, you will see that it does &quot;feel right&quot;.

He depicted the characters feelings well, and there were unexpected twists in the story. I've had the privilege of having Jack Weyland as my LDS Bishop, and have come to know him. He is an awesome person with a lot of stories to tell, and he tells them well. This book is amazing...not the typical Jack Weyland book! I would reccomend it to anyone of any age..."},{"Title":"Cheyenne in New York: A Novel","review":"I say this as someone who read and loved Jack Weyland when I was a kid ... Cheyenne in New York was just not good. The characters - Cheyenne and BD - were flat and seemed to have no character traits other than Cheyenne is nice, friendly and family-focused, and BD is kind of a jerk, but he really likes Cheyenne (though it's not clear why). All in all, I didn't like either BD or Cheyenne. BD had no redeeming qualities to make him likeable (and as the main character, and someone to whom horrible things happen, you WANT to like him), and quite frankly, Cheyenne came off as incredibly naive and indifferent. It's great that she was so caring toward the two kids in the story, but she married a man who was obviously emotionally traumatized by losing half his family in 9/11, and then was annoyed that he couldn't get his act together within a few months.Jack Weyland's strong point is usually his light tone and his jokes. Here, the jokes were forced. (Dancing oat clusters? Isn't BD supposedly good at his job? Why did he ever think that would work? Wouldn't it have been more dramatic had BD been competent, and still learned something from Cheyenne?) The situations the characters found themselves in were contrived. I respect Weyland's attempt to write a book about 9/11, but he missed the mark big time. And throwing in Enron? Whoa. Way too much.The one redeeming quality of the book was when Cheyenne's father tries to mend BD and Cheyenne's relationship. I thought that part was almost touching, though I was a bit underwhelmed with the fact that BD's \\"rebellion\\" consisted of drinking coffee, skipping church, and being upset that his new wife admitted she really didn't love him that much."},{"Title":"Cheyenne in New York: A Novel","review":"Cheyenne is a energetic woman who steps into the life of a busy New York life style from a home town farming life style.

I'm sure this is a good book for the naive mormon girl who doesn't know the real world. The way the main character was depicted in the begining makes his transformation seem unfathomable. If Cheyenne's parents raised her so independent and confident, why would they question her &quot;boyfriend&quot; like she's not an adult and she's not smart enough to make her own choices. I didn't think the storyline was believeable and I believe this book should be kept in the mormon family. If you're not mormon, don't even bother picking it up, not an intelligent read."},{"Title":"Dizzy's Bird Watch (Bob the Builder (Simon & Schuster Paperback))","review":"This is a nice little book about Bob the Builder and his buddies. In this story -you might recognize the plot from television series-- Dizzy finds a nest and becomes involved with a little blue egg that sits in it. The whole crew is around from the hatching to when the little bird becomes big enough to fly on it's own. The story concludes with cheers for Dizzy who feels like she's an auntie to the baby bird.Plot aside, this book provides reading practice for the pre-reading set as it is one of those books that has icons that replace some of the words.The way that we have been using it is that dad or I reads the story, following the print with our finger, pausing at the icons for our son so that he can decipher the picture and join in the 'reading fun'.Our son is now four, but by doing this, even younger children can figure out that sentences are read from left to right, and top to bottom, from page to page: All valuable reading skills. For a child of three or four years of age you might even find that they will begin to site read whole words.Four Stars. Wall to wall color: the whole page is filled with colorful pictures. Nice story about Dizzy and an egg which hatches. Okay read-aloud. One downside is that the icon for the mama bird and the baby look overly similar. Still children like the story and can learn many pre-reading skills. Don't be surprised if they memorize the text.Note: Another reviewer noted that this book was a good beginning primer, but I'd have to disagree. There is considerable dialog in this book (which is a nice thing in general) and I don't think (having a reading 6 year old) that words such as the following are standard choices for beginning readers: found, chirp, place, machines, bounce, meow, cement mixer."},{"Title":"Dizzy's Bird Watch (Bob the Builder (Simon & Schuster Paperback))","review":"I picked this up while on vacation for my 4-year-old daughter.

And I can say, both times the book gave me a good, healthy amount of thrill and joy.Published in 1796, \\"The Italian\\" became an instant success, cementing the fame of Ann Radcliffe among the liteary circle. Her name has been already well-known with her previous work \\"The Mysteries of Udolpho\\" two years before, but in my book this follow-up is better than the other. Of course, it depends on your view which is superior, but it is commonly agreed that Ann Radcliffe's position in the history of English literature is secured by those two Gothic classics, which clearly gave inspiration to Jane Austen, who wrote the joyful \\"Northanger Abbey.\\"The story is rather simple in the beginning. It tells of a romantic love of young dashing nobleman Vivaldi in Naples, who falls in love with a girl Ellena. But his plan of marriage is soon interrupted by the vicious monk Schedoni. Then ensue abduction, murder (attempted or not), and the Inquisition. There are lot of suspense, terror, and thrill that come from the fluent narrative of Radcliffe, who knows how to engage the readers' attention. (And thankfully, \\"The Italian\\" is free from any lengthy poems that are found aplenty among \\"Udolpho.\\")To be sure, the third part of the book is damaged by its too complicated relations between characters, and too rapid pen of the author to wrap up the events with rational explanations about the mysterious things in the first part of the book, but the whole book manages to sustain our interest to the end. Radcliffe's effusive descriptions of landscapes (with a little sentimental touch) found in \\"Udolpho\\" are gone (but not completely), and the plot is tightly knit so that we can enjoy the fast-paced adventure of the hero and the heroine. The best part of the book is, probably, the middle section where the hero, with his comic relief side-kick, tries to escape from the sinister convent where the heroine is confined to be forced to take a veil. It's a real page-turner which would put many of today's bestselling author to deserved shame.One of the best Gothic novels ever written, \\"The Italian\\" is still a gripping tale. Most regrettabe thing is that the author Radcliffe stopped writing totally after this book for the rest of her life (she died in 1823). Considering the fact that she had never been to Italy (she travelled abroad only once, in Netherland and Germany), and that her sublime landscapes are proof of her amazingly imaginative power, her early retirement should be lamented by all of us. But we must be content with what is left. Enjoy this one.THE PENGUIN EDITION published in 2000 has 10 pages of excerpts from comtemporary reviews, which would help readers with academic purpose."},{"Title":"The Italian","review":"First published in 1797, this was the culmination of Ann Radcliffe's writing career. She was seen as the darling of the Gothic mode, which we would probably put into the genre of \\"thrillers\\" or \\"horror\\". All the appropriate dungeons are here, the hint of demonic influence, the seperation of star-struck lovers, revenge, the searching of dark ruins, and the diabolical and angelic facets of the Church. Radcliffe does go deeper than that though through her paced plotting and and the limited use of sentimentality that destroyed so much of writing back then. The gothic novel would run out its course eventually, but had a great effect on the talent of its day. Keats, Byron, and Shelley all owe at least some of their subject matter and modes of expression to Radcliffe.Well, back to the novel itself. The story opens in the year 1764 in Naples, Italy as a group of English tourists are visiting a church. They notice a diabolical looking man who they are informed can never leave the safety of the church walls because he is an assasin. The place is his last sanctuary from those who wish to kill him. Of course the group asks to hear the tale of the assasin and The Italian begins.The story opens as a young nobleman named Vincentio di Vivaldi spots the beautiful but common Ellena Rosalba during church service and falls in love with her. From this Dantesque beginning we are led into a Romeo and Juliet scenario in which Vivaldi begins to woo her without the approval of his parents. Then we have the apperance of a cowled priest who appears to warn Vivaldi of future events before they happen. Vivaldi chases him a couple of times but all he ever finds is thin air. As the book continues, Vivaldi's mother will stop at nothing to keep her son from marrying his one true love.I didn't have too much hope that I would like this book when I picked it up, having given up on reading a similar work called Melmoth the Wanderer by Charles Maturin. I was very impressed with Radcliffe though. She stayed away from sentimentality and none of the characters was a caricature. They all seemed like deeply drawn personalities. The book had a real modern feel to it, probably because she modeled her stuff on Shakespeare, the most advanced writer of any age. The \\"thriller\\" aspects were quite good too. I found myself desperately wanting to turn the page before I had even read it to know what would happen next. Ann is a writer I will go back to and read again."},{"Title":"The Italian","review":"I had never heard of Ann Radcliffe until I read Northanger Abbey by Jane Austin. Northanger Abbey is a paraody that \\"makes fun\\" of the gothic type novels that were popular at that time. Ann Radcliffe and some of her writings are mentioned by name in Northanger Abbey. So...off I went to find out more about Ann and get one her novels.Ann was really the first gothic writer and set the scene for the other gothic writers that followed her in the late 1700's and early 1800's. Another reviewer accuses her of copying the novel The Monk - but it is actually the opposite. The author of The Monk copied her!Anyhow...I loved this book! Vivaldi and Ellena fall in love but Vivaldi's mother is against the match because Ellena is not from a \\"proper\\" family. The mother and a monk initiate a plot to keep them from marrying each other. I don't want to say much more, because there are so many interesting plot twists that I don't want to give anything away. It is a great story line that keeps you guessing. There is romance, suspense, mystery, intrigue, evil villians, evil plots, creepy landscapes, and more!It is a long book that took me several weeks to read but was more than worth my time!"},{"Title":"The Italian","review":"I have just finished &quot;The Italian&quot; by Ann Radcliffe. I wish this woman were still alive to write about more memorable charcters, like Vivaldi, Ellena, Shedoni and Spalatro. A wonderfully wielded story with romance and edge of your seat adventure through the Italian hills and vales of Naples in the late 1700's. Plot twists and scary evil, deceitful goings on. You feel sorry for the couple torn assunder by the machinations of a haughty mother, and in the end you even feel sorry of the villians because they too realize (however late) that what they did was wrong. I only hope I can find another story like this soon."},{"Title":"The Italian","review":"The life of young nobleman Vicentio de Vivaldi isn't the same the moment he catches a glimpse of a woman in a black veil. Ellena is beautiful, graceful and, in spite of her status as an impoverished orphan under her aunt's care, she has class and poise. But that is not enough for Vivaldi's parents. The son of a marquis cannot possibly take such a girl for his wife. When putting Ellena's reputation in question isn't enough, the marchioness takes some drastic measures to ensure a permanent separation. So she gets the help of Schedoni, a well-respected but corrupt monk, to lock Ellena up at a monastery against her will. Before and during these occurrences, a mysterious apparition in a monk's habit often warns Vivaldi. Is it a ghost? Is it friend or foe? And, more to the point, is it Schedoni? Is he playing some sort of sick game with Vivaldi? Twists and turns and big revelations abound.Set in mid-eighteenth century Naples, this gothic story is about two star-crossed lovers who have to beat an unfair and corrupt system to be together. But this isn't just a romantic gothic tale. The Italian is also a demonstration of the political powers and corrupted religions of its time. It is social commentary, a very insightful and literary one at that. First published in 1796, The Italian is Ann Radcliffe's last and most accomplished novel. To think that she began her writing career because she was bored while her husband traveled for work-related reasons! Well, she did her research and devoted a great deal of time to developing some good stories. This novel is better than her previous two because it doesn't contain as many poems and sonnets as her previous efforts. It's more straight-to-the-point, more showing than telling, much more action-packed and suspenseful. The gothic elements are awesome. You'll love this novel if you're a fan of the genre, especially if you're a fan of classic gothic stories. Take the plunge and read Radcliffe. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Italian","review":"The Italian was Radcliffe's last novel. It is about a nobleman who falls in love with a woman whose identity is unknown to herself and the reader throughout her sufferings. She is oppressed by many people in whose hands she falls as she is snatched away from the nobleman Vivaldi to prevent their marriage. Like all of Radcliffe's heroines, her character is marked by an amazing fortitude despite the horrifying things to which she is frequently subjected. Vivaldi faces the powers of the Inquisition and Radcliffe gives the reader some idea of their dealings with offenders and their ways of making prisoners \\"confess.\\" There are many turns of events which are delightful until another perilous event disappoints and grieves the reader. This is certainly what most reviewers call a page-turner. The sentiments are by no means modern. For a reader who is looking for modern unrestrained \\"romance,\\" none of Radcliffe's novels is a good choice. Her stories are for true romantics."},{"Title":"The Italian","review":"This book is a sad copy of The Italian by Ann Radcliffe. I purchased this book for a Gothic Lit class, and upon opening the book to read it found myself greatly confused by what I saw. This book is a compilation of scanned text from an original version of the novel, reprinted with absolutely NO editing. Because there is NO editing, this edition is full of random symbols, gaps in pages, missing information, and is separated into \\"Sections\\", which has no particular meaning in regards to the flow of the novel.Chapter headings are located within the main body of text, and very hard to find. I have purchased a different version of this novel since discovering the sad state of this one. I repeat: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. It is absolutely terrible, and in my opinion shouldn't even be available for purchase on Amazon."},{"Title":"The Italian","review":"I have a particular love for Mysteries of Udolpho, but The Italian is another wonderful book. I read it in one day, and couldn't put it down. The only sad part about it, is there is so few books of hers to read!A must read for gothic literature!"},{"Title":"The Italian","review":"I discovered Ann Radcliffe's 'The Italian', like another reviewer, after having read 'The Monk'. And while I had hoped for another similarly twisting, winding, gothic thriller, this was not the case with 'The Italian'.The opening pages seem to purport the reveal of the tale of the Black Penitents, as the story opens with a group of travelers seeing a shadowy, diabolical figure lurking in the shadows of a church.But what follows is more of a tale of 'star-crossed lovers', leaning a bit more toward Romeo and Juliette. Vivaldi, the hero of this tale, pursues the affections of the orphaned Ellena Di Rosalba, much to the chagrin of his mother, the Marchesa Vivaldi. She employs the aide of her confessor, Father Schedoni, to separate the young lovers.Ellena is spirited away to a convent, which Vivaldi breaks her out of, and here the tale becomes at least a bit more complex, as Vivaldi is subsequently imprisoned for his actions; as Ellena is marked for death in her new surroundings; and the Marchesa struggles to keep them forever apart.In comparison to 'The Monk', which you find in Amazon's list of 'people who read this book also read' listing...this tale is in no way as dark, gothic, or 'thrilling' a read. Though enjoyable, the story doesn't fit the opening pages and the foreshadowing of the 'diabolical figure' seeking refuge in the church to avoid death, the mysterious 'Black Penitents' named...or any of the intrigue with which the book opens.Still, in comparison to modern 'thrillers'; this book is paced well, plotted nicely, and comes to a logical conclusion. While I did not find the story I anticipated, it is still worth a read."},{"Title":"The Italian","review":"Ann Radcliffe started gothic romance. It was thought that her death was caused from her ghosts' in her stories that made her mad.Other author's have praised her in their own stoties. Alexander Dumas quotes her work in his book - 'The Man in the Iron Mask' pg. 163. Jane Austen refers to her time and again in 'Northanger Abby' like Radcliffe was a goddess. Edgar E. Poe was said to have found her works inspiring.That said, this is my first (and so far only) book that I've read by Radcliffe. I found the writing to be haunting and spellbinding. It's a long story, but it was beautiful. The romance was shown perfectly. And the Gothic themes was just enough. No overkill horrors like zombies and other sci-fi gore.Radcliffe is so far my favorite all time Gothic Romance writer.I've recommended time and again."},{"Title":"The Italian","review":"I read this book while on vacation in Italy. I found myself staying awake far into the night, unable to put it down. It is very atmospheric and draws the reader into the time and place of the story.

Definite read."},{"Title":"The Italian","review":"Although not the first of her classic 'Gothic' novels, it was \\"The Italian\\" that brought Mrs. Radcliffe fame and cemented her reputation in London's literary circles. Soon her books were all the rage, and many a young woman would conjure up visions of dark, mysterious strangers, foreboding castles, and thrilling escapes...if only in her dreams.\\"The Italian\\" features all of these elements, and more. In the city of Naples we meet the dashing nobleman Vivaldi, who spies the beautiful but common Ellena and quickly succumbs to her charms. She, too, falls in love, and the couple plan to marry. However, onto the scene steps the nefarious monk Schedoni, who is determined to separate the pair. What follows are the hallmarks of the 'Gothic' novel--star-crossed love, mysterious events, abductions, chases, breathless reunions, and brushes with fear and terror. The plot is tightly-knit, the writing fast-paced; even modern readers will be held in suspense until the last page."},{"Title":"The Italian","review":"This is the first of Ann Radcliffes novels that I have read...and it wont be the last. I love the trials each character goes through whether they are paired together or seemingly seperated for eternity. The determination of Vivaldi to be with Ellena is amazing. I felt every angle of that from absolute glee to despair. There are a couple of twists that in a way I thought I should have expected (of course due to the type of books and the time period it was written in) but was still pleasantly surprised. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Italian","review":"This classic novel is similar to Charlotte Bronte's famous Gothic Romance Literature Jane Eyre.

Traveling to Wales to see his mother and settle family affairs, Oliver encounters his stepsister, Laura. Years ago, when she snuck into his room one summer night, he didn't fight the passion he felt for her. Seeing her again brings back many emotions; guilt for what happened, regret because Laura still hasn't forgiven him and, unease because she's only gotten lovelier in the years she's been away.Running away from home feeling betrayed by Oliver, Laura Neill is hesitant to return to England...only the news of her beloved father has her rushing back. Never a favorite with her stepmother, Stella, Laura wants to spend as little time there as she can before returning to the States. Finding Oliver at the door doesn't alter her decision...he's still as devastating to her emotions now as he was years ago.With hints and little remarks making Oliver and Laura question what really happened to her father, they will have to work together to unravel this puzzling story. As secrets unfold they know their feelings for each other haven't changed, and there's more to Laura's father's death than either know.Watching Oliver and Laura resolve to figure out what really happened, you can see both fighting their feelings for each other. With secrets still between them and Stella causing problems, it'll take a miracle for them to get back together. INNOCENT SINS is a forceful story of finding love when you've given up on it. A true heart-grabber. Anne Mather is a dynamic author...you can't go wrong reading one of her books."},{"Title":"Innocent Sins (Harlequin Presents, 2133)","review":"INNOCENT SINS started out really good and I was always in suspense, wanting to know what happened and how did Grif (Laura's father) really die but then towards the end, INNOCENT SINS just wasn't able to hold up, and then my interest just died off. And the ending wasn't smooth, Anne Mather didn't know how to tie up Laura and Oliver's story.Laura Neil is in Wales because her father died, Oliver (Laura's stepbrother) is also in Wales because his stepfather died. They had one passionate night before Oliver left Wales and went to Europe. And because of that there was always some sort of miscommunication. Laura's stepmother and Oliver's mother, Stella doesn't make it easy for them because she's trying to destroy their relationship and she lies a lot. Especially about her story, the night she found Griff dead. So Laura and Oliver tries to find out what happened that night and also if they have another chance with each other."},{"Title":"Innocent Sins (Harlequin Presents, 2133)","review":"I have read several books by Anne Mather, and this one was definately not one of her better efforts. I felt that both characters were too wishy washy over their feelings, and there never seemed to be any real communication between them. They would start to discuss their feelings or their relationship, then they would be interrupted, and that was it, conversation over. I felt that Ms Mather didn't really know how to get the 2 lovers back together and she was in a rush, so she just decided to forget all the previous issues they had spent the entire book worrying over, and had Oliver and Laura announce their love for each other right at the end, so we could have a happy ending. This book is definately not a keeper, and I was very disappointed because I know Anne Mather can do so much better."},{"Title":"Innocent Sins (Harlequin Presents, 2133)","review":"The book had a good concept, but the writer did not deliver, mainly because she tried to play it both ways. That is-neither the hero nor the heroine was responsible for the long separation.In choosing to do so, the writer made the hero appear weak and unsure.The hero may have been young when he and the heroin first got together, but there is no way he would not have known that the way he handled the earlier encounter was cowardly at best. Instead of the writer having the hero admit that he thought he was too young to get seriously involved, the writer took the easy way out and blamed the heorine's wicked step-mother.Even, for the sake of arguement, we will conceed that the hero was unduly influenced by his mother, you are telling me that it never occured to an adult man-even in later years- that he should have contacted and at least acknowledge a sexual encounter with the heorine-who was his step-sister whose virginity he took?

I've been smoking pot everyday for almost a decade. I'd be a liar as well as a moron to try to suggest that I don't have an addiction or problem with it. People don't believe that you can become physically addicted to pot because you don't get the shakes or have physical with drawls. They may be right. I'm not physically addicted, it's all mental. I think or used to think everything was better when I was stoned. Sex, movies, food, everything. I used to think that it didn't effect my life and that I could stop at any time. Then I tried to stop. I would think about being stoned all the time. No matter what I was doing, I would think it would be better to be doing it stoned.Addiction creeps up on you. Most people don't get addicted to pot just like most people don't get addicted to alcohol or sex or food. But some people do. To make a general statement that it's impossible to get addicted to pot is ignorant as well as idiotic. When you use drugs and it makes you happy, it sends dopamine to your brain and your body associates the drug with happiness and starts to depend on it whether it's alcohol, pot, vicoden, whatever.There is no community or support for people that abuse pot. marijuana anonymous is a joke. It's basically AA in disguise and if your not into god good luck with that.It was refreshing for me to read these peoples stories and relate exactly to what they were feeling and going through. I don't really relate to alcoholics and drug addicts. they tell these awful stories about hitting rock bottom and your like \\"I forgot my friends birthday or was going to do something and got lazy and didn't\\" and they just kind of roll your eyes at you like you don't really have an addiction because it's not as severe. Well- smoking pot is definitely screwing up my life. I used to be fun and social and go out all the time. Now I stay home most nights watching reruns or when I'm out I'm thinking about going home and smoking pot.And for all the people that left negative comments about this book stop saying that's it's impossible to get addicted to pot.

It is harder and harder to watch him \\"toke his life away.\\" Most of his money is spent on pot. He has become more and more listless and unwilling to join in on life. He has become more and more isolated because his buddies have long since grown up and stopped getting high. I was discouraged to see such a low rating for this book. But as I read the reviews, I found they were to be dismissed. They are not intelligent thought. They are written by people who feel the need to defend pot smoking.

It is certainly true that not everyone who smokes pot will become an addict any more than everyone who drinks will become an alcoholic. But for those that do, it is very devastating, every bit as much as other drugs and very insidious.I do have some basis for what I say from personal experience. My husband is an addict and was in active addiction for about 25 years. His primary drug of choice (and for many years of his addiction the ONLY drug he used) was pot. When I read this book, it helped explain to me what I saw happen in my husband, both during his years of active addiction and now that he is in recovery. His story definitely resembles that of the addicts who share their stories in this book. My son also became addicted, and went downhill rapidly over a 2 year period. Thank the Lord he is also now in recovery but is experiencing many of the symptoms this book talks about as he is recovering. My husband now has over 3 years clean and is a drug/alcohol counselor, devoted to helping still suffering addicts. My son has about 4 months clean after relapsing and going through treatment a second time.I would MOST HIGHLY reccommend this book to counselors, to addicts themselves, and to family members like me who want to understand more about the devastating effects of drug abuse(particularly pot)--or anyone who wants to learn more about the subject!

Yes, the THC content may be a little higher, but it is still the same drug, and users can certainly monitor their intake just like beer drinkers can.

It does not put one into an \\"alternate reality\\". It is nearly impossible to overdose on, and does not cause any physical damage to the body or the brain. Unlike alcohol, it is not an central nervous system depressant, and is not nearly as impairing as alcohol.Alcohol abuse on the other hand is proven to cause damage to the brain and other organs (liver, kidneys), has a far darker track record of damaging both physical and mental health, and plenty of deaths under its belt.

Sometimes, if you know something about the topic, you'll realize it is a one-sided presentation. But this applies to other shows on TV; or the radio.The author investigated the \\"60 Minutes\\" investigators to discover why it is so successful. The answer is: they tell good stories! They identify a problem, explain it, and provide a simple solution. They provide the facts, and let you decide. Do the facts presented lead to the conclusion desired by the producers? With the given time constraints, they can only do so much.The technique is to use a single camera, and record for many hours. After the answers, the newsperson is recorded asking questions (which may be phrased to fit the answers). Then the editing begins. With many hours of statements, they get to choose what they want. The end result is a story whose conclusion follows from the edited statements. They never show \\"out-takes\\"; page 186 explains \\"cutaways\\".Chapter 4 tells how they get the story. It should be read for its inherent practical advice. The producers flatter the subject to gain their confidence. \\"TV news is show business, but uses show business techniques to convey information rather than to distort it\\" (p.54). \\"Drama is but life with the dull bits cut out\\" (p.60). Page 129 gives an example of editing; a twenty-page interview became two-pages on -air. \\"60 Minutes\\" provides multiples of the old 15-minute news, a variety that fills up the hour, and attracts more viewers than with a single subject, and avoids boredom.Chapter 11 tells of the cases where they freed innocent people from jail. Pages 151-2 tell of a particularly corrupt case. A schoolteacher runs for city council, and is then arrested, tried, and convicted for a kidnapping that never happened! Paroled after eight months into a thirty-year sentence, as a convicted felon he could never again run for public office! Could this have happened in any other state?Chapter 13 discusses the editing that goes into creating the finished story.

Later, I needed to learn Java since I had to manage a software upgrade project that was going to involve Java. I wanted to be competent enough to be able to look at the code and know what the heck was going on. This book is aimed at people like me who are real beginners and like to have the code broken down and explained line by line. The author does a very good job of explaining the concepts in a way that beginners can understand (that's rare, and is the reason why I gave it five stars).Having said all of that, this book is a little out of date, but I'd still recommend it as a good first book that can be supplemented later with newer references to fill in the gaps.The author published another book in this same series (&quot;No Experience Req'd&quot;) on C++ that is also very good, with a similar title. I'd recommend that one as well if you need to learn C++."},{"Title":"Java 1.1: No Experience Required","review":"I will definately recommend this book to someone, who is new to programming and /or new to java. It will not get you too far, but will give you a good starting point, without nightmares. The hands on approach ensures tangible results.You cannot get a easier book than this. If I were the author I would name if 'First book on Java awt'. Probably the best book in the beginer catagory. I have gone a long way after reading this book. Good luck."},{"Title":"Java 1.1: No Experience Required","review":"I bought this book thinking I was going to learn Java. I haven't been able to get the java compiler to work. I followed the directions word for word and it does not compile from .java to a .class."},{"Title":"Java 1.1: No Experience Required","review":"I had only some experience with programming before, but feared that JAVA should be a bit tricky to get the hang on. But this book comes with great examples that gets you going creating rather useful (when put together) JAVA applets. I'm only curious about a bug in one of the examples(lame). A good buy if you never programmed JAVA or C++ before. T.Andersson (sweden)"},{"Title":"Java 1.1: No Experience Required","review":"This is a great book if you want to start learning Java 1.1 from scratch and it also gives information about how it differs from C/C++ and Java 1.0. It also lets you learn how to write simple HTML programs for running Java applets.The book starts off with an introduction to Java and the conventions it will use throughout the book (although the one for a complete source code file seems to have been left out). One nice thing here is that the CD that comes with the book is very useful as it contains the JDK 1.1.The book is arranged into 15 chapters called 'skills' which take you through building simple Java programs and topics like; applets, applications, multithreading, animation, simple HTML programming and many more. The learning curve isn't steep and the programs you encounter later on build nicely on the experience you gain earlier on in the book. The book explains the examples and what the lines on the example programs in Java and HTML do quite well indeed by gradually building up a program and explaining what's happening along the way with diagrams. At the end of most of the examples you get shown the source code all together which is useful as an online reference. The book also contains well laid out tables of certain methods in programming and how those methods can be used. However, there is at least one error in the book but the CD contains most of the programs mentioned in the book so it can be useful to look up the source code there while you are working on that program yourself.The CD with the book contains some products for Java programming although some or all are for a limited time period. The CD also comes with the JDK 1.1 which is very useful as you do not have to spend a lot of time (and possibly money) downloading it from the Internet. It also comes with the source code for most of the programs as mentioned earlier.This is generally a very good and welcoming book indeed for people with no experience in programming and to C/C++ programmers. The way in which it teaches you to write programs by using examples and explaining gradually what is happening is very educational indeed in my opinion. This book would have got 10 out of 10 had it not been for the error(s) and the fact that the diagrams weren't very clear."},{"Title":"Java 1.1: No Experience Required","review":"This book could be a 10, but since it doesn't bother covering version 1.1 like the name suggests(&quot;Java 1.1&quot;), it's a 2."},{"Title":"Java 1.1: No Experience Required","review":"I disliked the book very much as it only discusses AWt 1.1 - no more, no less. The underlying Java language is not paid attention to - the author doesn't say what interfaces are and how they should be implemented (it doesn't even explain ALL methods declared in listener interfaces must be implemented. Speaking of listeners, adapter classes aren't mentioned at all).The editing of the book is sloppy. The pictures are all edited by hand in ASCII - do you really think a pull-down menu is, at least, recognisable when drawn in ASCII?!?! Definitely not.The two other subjects the book discusses are threads and jar files. Both parts are very badly written (compared to Core Java or, regarding threads, Sams Net's Java 1.1 Unleashed Second edition - much as Java 1.1 Unleashed 2nd ed only discusses 1.0, the chapter on threads rocks).Of course, considering the chapters on AWT, they're really handy if you don't have a clue how to start with AWT 1.1. I can recommend this book if Core Java (the absolute killer) or even Teach Yourself Java 1.1 in 21 days is too complicated for you - you won't regret it. But be warned: this book doesn't tell you about most of the important things in the language.END"},{"Title":"Java 1.1: No Experience Required","review":"You have to buy this book I was so dumb I could't even make something good in Quick Basic but with this book I can make exelent looking programs and applets"},{"Title":"The science of life: Or, Self-preservation, a medical treatise on nervous and physical debility, spermatorrhoea, impotence, and sterility","review":"A great book that discusses all the major aspects of sexual disorders in today's society.

A BOOK THAT SHOULD BE A MUST READ FOR GIANT AND THE NOSTALGIC FOOTBALL FAN.VERY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"What Giants They Were","review":"\\"What Giants They Were\\" is a fond look back at the New York Giants. Those folks most likely to enjoy WGTW will remember when one specified \\"football Giants\\" when referring to that franchise! The tale recalls a very special time for this reviewer: He can well remember taking a short subway trip to Yankee Stadium and purchasing a bleacher ticket-the day of the game. Price: $2.00. He could buy a game program, a coke and 2 hot dogs and still have change from a Lincoln! For the 1963 season, this reviewer bought a season ticket in the bleachers. Price: $28.00! The actual games, it should be mentioned, were played on real GRASS! By November, the green grass was gone, changed to beautiful brown dirt! The Giants owned New York in the Fall. People paid attention to basketball and hockey-but not until Winter. The Manhattan-centric Giants WERE New York sports. The players became small gods, helped by the fact that rosters were stable in those pre-free agent days. The defense, anchored by #70, the great Sam Huff was virtually unchanged from 1956-1963. The team appeared in 6 NFL Championship Games in that span. That they lost the final 5 of those contests did not cost them a single fan. Those Giants were the pinnacle of franchises in a time that can never be recaptured. The memories of the old Giants are enhanced by the brutal fact that living in NYC was, to put it mildly, vastly simpler then. Author Whittingham has dutifully interviewed 20+ former players and coaches. \\"Someone\\" on high was cooperating with the author! The very names tell the story: Huff, Gifford, Rote, Webster, Conerly, Katcavage, Lynch, Mozelewski, Robustelli and Summerall. Those unable to instantly supply the relevant first names to those titans of the past will not fully enjoy WGTW. Homage in passing is paid to the Parcells/Simms era but they are blessedly outside the scope of Whittingham's tale. Those guys do not belong here! In fact, the author goes farther back than forward! Space is devoted to guys like Red Bagro, Benny Friedman, Mel Hein, Tuffy Leemans and Ken Strong! In addition to his strong research, the author has provided some of the sharpest and most personalizing photos this fan has experienced in any sports book. Many readers take typesetting for granted, or suffer silently with it, but in WGTW the work is excellent! The production values are very high indeed. Other attractions are sections on some of the men's college days and the trials they endured as rookies. Sam Huff was on his way back to West Virginia when assistant coach Vince Lombardi collared him at the airport! There is also a section on \\"life after football\\". Most of WGTW is positive. The only dirt spilled is Sam Huff's latter day rant about his trade to the Redskins after the '63 season. That was his due; his trade was the dumbest move in the life of the franchise. Sam was the heart of the team; the Giants took nearly 20 years to recover from his untimely departure. If there is a weakness to WGTW, it lies in what is NOT revealed. Some unaddressed issues might include: 1) How did the team let assistants Vince Lombradi and Tom Landry get away in favor of a guy named Allie Sherman? 2) What about the intra-Mara family squabbling? It had to be serious but never made the press. 3) What was behind Kyle Rote's sudden retirement after the '61 season? 4) Why didn't a Mara stop the Huff trade? And on a lighter note: 5) Why on earth did Allie Sherman allow backup quarterback Glynn Griffing to skip practice the entire week before the '63 championship game against the Bears? Couldn't his wedding in Mississippi have been postponed a week or two? And what ever happened to the heir apparent QB after his woefully brief performance in that game? This is first class sports reporting! We may term it pure nostalgia, but to so is to bestow a compliment. Looking backward is the crux of WGTW. This review won't deduct a star for the limited scope. The strengths vastly outweigh the \\"weaknesses\\" of a limited audience and the aforementioned unaddressed issues. We should treat WGTW like an old Hank Williams CD. Don't fret that they don't make them like they used to. Let's enjoy pleasant memories as they are handed to us."},{"Title":"What Giants They Were","review":"Great book about the older giants.lots of pictures and text about the giants in the 50's and 60's a good find."},{"Title":"Covered Bridge","review":"This is the first I've read by Brian Doyle. &quot;Covered Bridge&quot; is written as a series of lighthearted anecdotes and reflections of a teenage boy who is trying to come to terms with the several strange and delightful characters of a small town in Quebec's Gatineau Hills, while at the same time trying to solve a mystery.The book also serves to introduce covered bridges as architectural and historical treasures, and illustrates very well how covered bridges become focal points for community identity and goodwill.I like the book for teaching purposes, because it is not overwhelming to Grade Sevens. The chapters are very short, and the language is accessible to the mind of a twelve-year-old. Doyle includes a fair amount of humor and a tinge of romance, but leaves the latter as a tantalizing backdrop to the entire story. Examples of character sketches and humorous anecdotes abound within the unfolding story, keeping the reader wondering just how strange this little town really is!Also available in paperback: Scholastic Books."},{"Title":"Deer growing up in the wild (Books for young explorers)","review":"Deer Growing Up in the Wild is one of many volumes in the Books For Young Explorers series published by the National Geographic Society.

The last two pages of the book provide detailed descriptions of North American deer and their relatives. In this final section we learn about the ranges of North American deer and their relatives, their life spans, their diet and digestion, seasonal migrations, and the difference between horns and antlers.

But buyer beware. The publisher has excluded all 200 of the author's sketches and drawings that help the stories come alive for both younger and older readers. In addition, the design of the book is amateurish. Type is spread across the page, with extra spaces between paragraphs, nothing like the pleasing style of the original editions. This is a lifeless shadow of an American classic."},{"Title":"Wild animals I have known","review":"I first read this book as a very young reader, almost sixty years ago. Seton's ability to identify with the wildlife he studies,but with a minimum of anthropomorphism or sentimentality, and then write touching, exciting mini-dramas is enhanced by his role as an observer who does not inject himself as a foreign influence in their lives.I'm buying copies of the hardcover edition for my grandchildren, for this book will be read more than once, and kept for a lifetime.

I cried while reading about the pidgeon's fate, was happy when the rabbit was released, filled with respect for Lobo the wolf... It was one of the books that I'll always remember as being one of the greatest collection of stories. The language is simple yet exquisite, and the story flows so smoothly, you can read past midnight and not notice.Not only that, that book gave me a better understanding of animals - not as we humans tend to humanize animal emotions and actions, but as real animals think and feel. It definitely made me change my perspective on many subjects - my treatment of nature, of animals, even human relationships.All that when I was in my early teens. All that without any grownup having to &quot;have a talk&quot; with me or me even noticing that I got a &quot;better understanding&quot; of things.Now that my son is growing up here, I'm getting him his copy of the book, and I'm quite hopeful that it will bring him a lot of enjoyment as well as food for thought."},{"Title":"Wild animals I have known","review":"Ernest Thompson Seton, the author, is noted for his wildlife sketches illustrating his books, as well as for the books, themselves. \\"Wild Animals I have Known\\" should have a couple of hundred pen-and-ink sketches in the page margins, as well as half a dozen complete, full-page drawings. I wanted to buy a hardcover book with all the artwork, so contacted the supplier by e-mail to enquire. The supplier assured me this book was a hardcover, with the artwork. When it arrived (after some weeks, as it had to come from England), it was a hardcover entirely without illustrations. I contacted the supplier to ask about their returns procedure. I got no reply. I contacted Amazon, who credited my account, and no doubt are dealing with the supplier.My low rating refers to this edition and to the supplier's inaccurate information and non-response to my complaint.

They were more &quot;first&quot; in 1st and 2nd class than third, however, where entire families perished. Miss Geller has thoroughly researched a fair representative of the female passengers, from pregnant Madeleine Astor and the indomitable Molly Brown to the Swedish immigrant mothers many decks below.

The only fault I had with this book were the captions under the pictures of Titanic artifacts.

It is fairly standard romance wise - millionaire man, good with his hands, young gorgeous, confident - yet tender, and so on and so on. I just felt he had no real challenge in this - it was all plot device.The supernatural device was a bit freaky at times too - at one stage Declan starts channeling a childbirth - rather disconcerting all round for me.There were some great one liners in this and some genuine humour, so I will give some other Nora Robert's books a try, but it normally wouldn't bother me to try an author again after reading one book like this.

In fact, I enjoyed this book very much until the last 20 pages and in the end I felt like throwing the book away! What a poor conclusion!!! It seemed to me that Nora had wrote this book carefully until page 365 and then realized that she had only 30 minutes to go before the deadline so she had to finish the story within the next 20 pages. That's why every thing she wrote toward the end seemed like they're just thrown together and none of them made any sense!! I like Declan and Angelina for almost of the book just to hate them both in the end!This book left me a hundred questions without any explaination. The author built up a dozen events and characters that related to the mystery just to keep me reading and waiting for a grand final and then managed to finished it in the lamest way.To Nora, I can tell from my experience of reading a lot of ghost stories, those torture ghosts in your book, after haunting in the house for more than a century, shouldn't give in and gone that easy by just a silly conversation between two people. Can't believe you're the same author who wrote one of my favorite book of all time \\"Honest illustion\\".I won't recommend this book to anyone unless you don't care much about the clear, complete ending. It's entertaining anyway."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"When Declan Fitzgerald saw Manet Hall as a student, he was enchanted with the old house even though it was in a state of total disrepair. When he saw it again as a mature, wealthy lawyer, he was determined to own it and restore it to its former glory.During the restoration process, he becomes uneasily aware of other presences in the house and even the sound of voices but is determined not to be frightened off by them. His old college friend introduces him to his cousin Angelina Simone, an attractive bar owner who not only helps him to unravel the mysteries of Manet Hall but also to find out her connection with the house and its history.I found this to be an intriguing story which holds you to the last pages."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"My only regret in reading this book is that I've never picked up a Nora Roberts before this one. That is going to change! This is not an earth shattering, life altering book by any measure.But if you are looking for a quick, escapist type read that encompasses great characters, the backdrop of mysterious New Orleans, a love story that parallels a love story of over 100 years ago, and a ghost story, then this is your book.I could not put this one down. The main character, Declan, and his love interest Lena were two of the greatest, most intelligent characters I've read in this type of book for a while. Their relationship is great to watch as it develops, and both of them have a sense of humor that will give you some laughs along the way.If you want a fun, quick, easy but compelling read pick this one up. It will not disappoint. I will be getting some more of Ms. Roberts books ASAP! I was sorry to see this one end, but all the same, it was a satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Again, Nora Roberts has done it--written a story that makes me read the whole thing in one night. This is another present day/past history tale centered around Manet Hall. Declan &amp; Lena are the main charactors but there is also a very good supporting cast which make the book so delightful to read. The Hall is haunted, we know why from the beginning, but to end the spell you must read and find out along the way how things will be put right. Can't wait for the next one and this one is definitely a hard bound book keeper."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Nora Roberts is one of my favorite writers. She's written such wonderful &amp; suspenseful stories thru the years that everytime any of her copies hit the shelves, I'm among those who get a copy immediately. My main problem w/ this book is that it's anti-climatic. The story is pretty good, but the ending was so horrible. I don't understand how such a good book could end so disastrously. I expected more from this book I guess."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Having lived in the South and spent time in and around the New Orleans area I loved the &quot;feel&quot; of this book! What a dream it would be to find a plantation house like that and restore it! I loved Declan! He wasn't arrogant or self-centered but instead a caring man and a true gentleman! In spite of his wealth he was down to earth, sexy, with a core of steel and a great sense of humour! Lena was tough and independent on the outside but inside vulnerable and afraid to trust. Odette was a hoot, as was Remy. This was a different plot for Nora but she handled it well. My only complaint was the ending was somewhat abrupt and without the drama I expected."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I've been a Nora Roberts fan for decades, and I've realized over time that I don't hold her to the same standard I do most other authors. I judge Nora's books by how they stack up against my favorite Nora classics, not how they stack up against anyone else's work. And perhaps logically, as time has worn on, I'll admit that while I enjoy every one of her books, it has become harder for Nora to thrill and surprise me as much as she used to.This all contributes to my delighted surprise with Midnight Bayou, which has rocketed itself to the top of my &quot;Favorite All Time Nora&quot; shelf. I was riveted to the pages and couldn't get to sleep afterward because I kept wondering if I maybe felt a &quot;presence&quot; in my own house...!! hint- don't start reading this book late at night thinking you can read a little, then put it down and pick it up again in the morning. It doesn't lend itself to that - you're more likely to stumble into work the next morning with an all-night-reading hangover!As other reviewers have noted, I really enjoyed the hero providing the main character perspective and pivotal role. This is something Nora does fairly often in her category romances, and it worked well in Midnight Bayou. Of course it helps that Declan Fitzgerald is such a great character. Yes, he has some of the classic &quot;formulaic&quot; romance hero traits (rich, good-looking, etc) I've seen some negative comments about in reviews, but what makes Declan work for me are his layers. This is not a one-dimensional character the way the bad romance heros are. He's not perfect/alpha or saving the day (except for himself). Like so many of us, he's conflicted in some ways, and bullheadedly sure of himself in others. He has come to Manet Hall to start a new life, but first he has to deal with the tragic remnants of many lives before him, and their possible connections to his own present relationships. This is big stuff for anyone, and he handles it with appealing boyishness, dedication, humor and nerve. What I want to know is where I find a guy like him for myself?! I don't even care about the looks and the money! Give me the kindness and the humor and the dreamy determination. This is a man worth having.Nora gives Declan a woman to love in Angelina (Lena) Simone and I liked her. Again, I've seen some reviews talk about Lena as a selfish b--ch, but I didn't get that feeling from her at all. She's been badly hurt in the past by relationships, and not by a man, but by her mother (a greater betrayal and more scarring as presented here). She doesn't trust and she depends on herself almost to the exclusion of others. She sees Declan as simply too good to be true, and therefore not worth the risk. Her struggle to accept his feelings for her and hers for him was believable to me, and endearing. She's not a typical romance heroine (if there is such a thing anymore), and I liked that too.I thoroughly enjoyed the plot itself, with its woven storylines of past and present, and elements of paranormal activity, which I thought was very well done. I cared about both levels of story, and wanted justice/forgiveness in the present for the tragic victims of the past, even as I couldn't quite figure out how that would happen.I agree with some of the reviews I've seen that mentioned the ending not quite living up to the rest of the book. I was surprised by its brevity, given the wonderful depth and narrative lushness of the story itself. I was a little disappointed, and would've liked an epilogue or something to flesh out the HEA more. But it's kind of like eating a big ice cream sundae and then saying just as you finish, but wait, it didn't have enough nuts on top...it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the whole. It speaks to the success of the characters and the story that we all wanted to see more of them, doesn't it?If you've been a fan of Nora's who has been wishing she would try something a little different, then I think you'll like Midnight Bayou a lot. If you like her books just the way they are, you will like it, but may be surprised because she does some different things. If you've never read Nora before, oh boy, do you have lots of great stuff ahead of you! ENJOY!! I sure did and expect to again many times in the future."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I really didn't like Lena, the lead female character at all. I thought her cajun was cheesy and she just came across as being totally unworthy of Declan the main character who I really liked. I thought the book was slow, repetitive and came to a very unsatisfying finish. Not one of NR's best! Wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"this is my absolute favorit nora book so far..i love everyting about Declan!.. we need more men like that.. I did not want this book to end."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Declan Fitzgerald may have been drunk and reckless when he broke into Manet Hall with his best friend Remy Payne during a trip to New Orleans when he was in college eleven years ago, but he was sober enough to know he wanted that broken down and aging old plantation home as soon as he saw it. He was serious enough about that want - that need - to leave his profession of law and his town of Boston and his family and his ex-fiance to head down to the bayou after buying the house sight unseen in the ensuing eleven years. Compelled in a way he doesn't understand but satisfied to his soul about it, he buys it and intends to fix it, to renovate, modernize a little, but mostly restore it to its once statuesque and stately self. With his own two hands and a lot of sweat. He knows the rumors that Manet Hall is haunted, but he can live with a few ghosts. They're his ghosts now. As Manet Hall is his.One hundred years ago, however, a vicious, unspeakable crime was committed in that house. A life ended. A love and a family torn asunder. A young woman destroyed. Betrayal compounded by jealousy and callous elitism stirred the sultry, steaming heat of evil and stripped the life from a gentle soul.Manet Hall remembers.Declan is left wondering if he's got ghosts or memories or both as he slowly restores the old plantation house. All he knows is he has no intention of giving up his home...even if that means avoiding a room or two that give him a major case of the willies. He expects it'll all work out eventually. What he didn't expect was to stumble across an utterly delightful female creature one night when he ambled into a bar in the Quarter to meet up with Remy. He also didn't expect the unwavering, instantaneous certainty that he had been waiting for that very woman - and had been looking for her for a very, very long time. That woman, Lena Simone, bar owner and feisty spirit, is just as much his as is Manet Hall.Convincing her of that, however, may be harder than dealing with petulant ghosts and a centuries-old mystery. No...wait...no 'maybe' about it.Roberts has dipped deep into the south and flavored Midnight Bayou with the decadent, weighty atmosphere of the sultry Crescent City, doing a particularly excellent job on the cadence in the dialogue of the characters who were raised there. The entire book had such a tremendous depth of culture with a pinch of Cajun spice that it added a gilded patina to a dark, tragic mystery and slightly creepy haunting, elevating the tension and adding desperate hope to the burgeoning relationship between Declan and Lena.I admit, I'm a total sucker for haunted house stories, so that aspect of the plot in no way disappointed, but I was a little uncertain about the large dichotomy in the tone of the narrative between the century-old atrocity and the lighter, more humorous discourse of the romantic development between the steady and stalwart Declan and his love-hardened Lena. That dichotomy seemed to lessen in some way the significance of the crime and dulled a little of its impact. I thought that was a shame, and by the end of the book I was hoping for a bit more closure and a heck of a lot more justice than I feel was offered.The characters, though, truly spotlight the book. I loved Declan. I thought he was very well written and fully developed, and even though my personal preference tends towards male leads who have at least one or two flaws to round them out, I found Declan's lack of same to be charming and refreshing. There was just something very solid, dependable, and true about him that I enjoyed...and some dry humor and his ability to laugh at himself sealed the deal for me. I wasn't quite as enamored with Lena, and thought she was a bit too self contained with matters of the heart, too jaded throughout, and a bit too interested in maneuvering Declan and her relationship with him because of it. I wish Roberts had given her more room for the mother/daughter issues that were so vital to her definition. I thoroughly admired her strength, however, and her independence and poise in the face of the paranormal activities. She was a woman who knew her own mind and acted true to it, regardless of the consequences, and that gave her a steel edge wrapped in magnolia-scented appeal.Roberts' writing style is so fluid and she's got a superb ability to bend the narratives in her books to reflect the locale and the culture of the characters inhabiting them. It lends a feeling of authenticity to each book, and none more so than here in Midnight Bayou. I can't say it was my absolute favorite of her books, but the combination of the horror of the past tragedy and the creepy haunting, along with the strength of the lead character and the mastery of the tone and pace of the bayou country really appealed to me. I was pleased with this very solid read and reminded yet again of why Nora Roberts' career continues to thrive.Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I enjoyed reading this book so much that I have suggested it to my boyfriend, who is now reading it. I would definately recommend this book. The story truly captures New Orleans and the deep south."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Before reading the book, I first saw the made for TV movie. I enjoy books about old houses with secrets and ghosts and the people who want to bring them back to their former beauty.Set in the Bayou on the swamp, the residents of the area are still talking about a mystery that had happened many years ago. A mystery involving two brothers, Lucian and Julian, their mother Josephine, the mysterious disappearance of Lucian's wife Abby and an abandoned baby.The answer to the mystery remains hidden until Declan Fitzgerald arrives in Louisiana to restore Manet Hall.

He begins to sleep walk and to become someone else, someone he recognizes as his former self.Does he believe in re-incarnation? There is a bigger twist involving him and Lena.I throughly enjoyed this book and the movie. Nora Roberts has a special way of writing that never disappoints. Her way of describing the Bayou makes you feel like you're right there swatting mosquitoes. Good job! It's a keeper!"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I think one of the things I like most about Nora Roberts is the way she portrays men. Somehow, though she makes them romantic, they are still... guys.This is the story of Declan, a guy who was a lawyer, in Boston, of \\"the\\" Boston Fitzgeralds, engaged to be married. Then he decides that he does not love his fiancee, pretty much hates his job, and needs a BIG change.He comes to see that he had been making decisions based on what his family wanted for him.He buys an old run-down mansion in the deep south. It's complete with ghosts and cool neighbors. He remodels the house through the book, solves a 100 year old mystery, and wins the girl (no spoiler there, I'm sure).And though he loves the heroine long before she loves him, though he questions his own sanity with the whole haunting thing, he is never less than a very strong, male man.Great summer read!!!(*)>"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Gorgeous Bostonian Declan Fitzgerald has had it--with his life, his love, his career.

Wonderful, wonderful read.DYB"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This is all classic Nora; great, compelling, alive characters. Life-like settings, detailed story line. But weird in that she takes this, reincarnation twist that I didn't care for. So why did I give it a four star rating? Because I read it anyway, and have over and over, but I skip the chpts with the reincarnated bit. It just wasn't my thing and I didn't care for it.But in a literal sense, Nora's hot and on with this one, just like she is with her other perfect works. ( Older works ) Overall, I'd say, read it for the darling male character - Declan - you can't miss him. And the female is quintensential New Orleans hot.I actually went to New Orleans for a trip because of this book and her other book, my fav, Honest Illusions."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"What Declan doesn't know when he buys the house he's always wanted is that he won't be living there alone. Although previous occupants of the house are long dead, they have not gone far. Through Declan's relationship with Lena and other supporting characters, the stories of past and present are imaginatively worked out. The &quot;good guys&quot; in &quot;Midnight Bayou&quot; are engaging and very charming. The villians are all properly detestable. Although the paranormal theme got a little confusing once or twice and the ending would have been better if Roberts had described what happened more fully, I enjoyed reading the book and intend to read it again in the future."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I bought this book as soon as it came out in paperback. I eagerly sat down and began reading. I was stunned when I found myself brought into a world filled with romance, mystery, intrigue and murder, not to mention a beautiful southern plantation.I loved the main characters, the plot, the descriptions, everything was perfect. Nora has not written a book that so captured my attention.The story was amazing, one story takes place in the past, the other, modern times. Both stories revolve around the same beautiful house.I don't know what else to say about this glorious book, other than it fulfilled all my expectations and quite a bit more. Haunted houses, plantation mansions and New Orleans? What could be better?"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I loved this book! I waited impatiently for the paperback to come out and was not at all disappointed. Midnight Bayou is a dark, romantic suspense and an example of Nora Roberts at her very best. The paranormal elements are intricately woven into the plot. The setting was great, from the excesses of Bourbon Street to the haunted, gothic mansion in the bayou. Declan Fitzgerald was an enchanting romantic hero and Lena a strong, but vulnerable heroine. Midnight Bayou is now among my top 5 Nora Roberts' books, along with Montana Sky, Homeport, Sanctuary, and Carolina Moon."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Nora Roberts just keep 'em coming. MIDNIGHT BAYOU is no exception of her fine storytelling.MIDNIGHT BAYOU is not her usual standards. In this book there are ghosts, a really big and pretty house, and of course, love. This story tells of Declan Fitzgerald and Lena Simone and how they come to love each other and why they're related to the big and spooky house.*Looks around* What was that?"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Ghost stories can be fun and exciting. This was boring and weird. I admitt I don't understand re-encarnation at all and find stories where the hero and heroine are \\"reborn\\" or take over other people's bodies rather creepy. But I thought if anyone could sale me on the story it would be Nora Roberts. Unfortunately, she wasn't able to. First off the good/twin bad twin seemed like too low of a cliche for Nora Roberts to stoop too. All thrown together maded for a very boring and weird story."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Nora Roberts is a great romance writer, but this is not one of her great works. She enters the realm of the pre-Katrina New Orleans with this romance/mystery novel but as an outsider to that society she is unable to capture its actual nature (believe me, as an insider to the pre-Katrina New Orleans, I know about that lifestyle). She makes horrible mistakes in her New Orleans geography and lifestyle then compounds those errors with the fact that in this novel at least she seems to forget about the basic differences between men and women! Considering her fame as a romance writer I find some her writing not only bad, but actually bizarre! I realize that a ghost story is somewhat bizarre by nature but she takes it to an absurd point! As you can tell I found this novel disappointing and do not recommend this book. Nora Roberts should leave this sort of writing alone and let Anne Rice write about the haunted houses in New Orleans."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Another great book by Nora Roberts!!!! When I first started reading the book and got to the ghost part...I though oh no! But, it was written so well and so intriguing, I couldn't put it down. What a different story line!!!

Just a great book, sweet storyline, and very beautiful descriptions of the land, the house, and the people. Very good read."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I picked up this book because the plot seemed intriguing, just my type of story, New Orleans and ghosts. I didn't find Lena too appealing, and the ending was definitely too abrupt. What was that all about? Ms. Roberts, please read these negative reviews! I was disappointed because it could have been better. My question: I thought Lucien and Julian killed each other with a knife, then later they said that Lucian drowned himself. Did I miss something?"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"It was a exiting but very scary book. I like the suspence because when you started reading you couldn't put it down. When he heres voices and wakes up in differnt places in the house."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"As a native of New Orleans I was very anxious to read this book set in my hometown. I was very disappointed to discover that Miss Roberts did not research typical New Orleanians. The constant reference to friends as &quot;cher&quot; is very rare in New Orleans, particularly between two young Harvard Law grads! Also,buying beignets and bagels together is unheard of.I read all Nora Roberts books and am usually sad when they come to an end. Not this time! Not only was the book a slow read but I almost had to force myself to finish it. Give me the MacGregors!"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This book was disappointing but I guess that's redundant once you look at the star rating. Perhaps it was the worn out story line, good twin/bad twin evil mother or the patronizing and cliche' lines spouted by Declan regarding child birth and rape,(these scenes were almost offensive as he \\"comes back\\" and can now instantly identify with the pain and degradation). Declan's angst is annoying. Or maybe it was the lack of plot or sizzle between the main characters. Whatever it was this book certainly wasn't even in the ball park to Ms Robert's usual level of writing."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Another great story from Nora Roberts. She never fails to give a good book. I have been a fan of hers for a very long time. Keep them coming!"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I liked the two storylines of the couple from 100 years ago and their counterparts today.I felt the tension built well I liked the fact that Declan told Lena (Angelina) that you have live with some problems (her mother) but it doesn't reduce your own value.The end I found a little weaker than the rest of the book, which is the only reason I am not giving five stars.Definitely a book I will keep and read again."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This was a perfect combination of romance and mystery.

And will the rumors of ghosts and unexplained phenomena scare Declan away from his dream home?When he meets his beautiful neighbor, Angelina Simone, Declan once again feels an inexplicable pull. But as Declan begins to settle into his new life, and starts to fall in love with the mysterious Angelina, secrets from the past threaten to destroy his newfound happiness.This was my first book by Nora Roberts, and wow - I'm thrilled! Now I finally understand what it is that pulls millions of women to the bookstore every time one of Nora's books is released. MIDNIGHT BAYOU is fabulously written, in a flowing style that's neither overly descriptive, nor over-the-top, but manages to balance beautiful descriptions with realistic dialogue.But the true charm of the book lies in its paranormal aspects. The ghosts that haunt Manet Hall aren't your typical otherworldly creatures, and as the storyline unravels, Declan and Angelina get more and more caught up in the mysteries of the past. Beautifully blending theories of reincarnation with pure paranormal fun, Nora Roberts manages to create a captivating novel that is sure to delight old fans and new."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This book has been summarized by other readers so I won't add my own. Although I have many of NR's romances and usually enjoy them, my favorite is the Death series by J. D. Robb, Nora's alter ego. Having said that, if possible, I would have given Midnight Bayou a 10. What saved this from being the typical romance between the rich, gorgeous man and hard working beautiful woman, were the flashbacks to the lives of Abigail and Lucien, the addition of and attention to other characters and the fresh dialogue. I also liked the fact that so much of the story was told from Declan's viewpoint, not Lena's. It seemed to be a more involved storyline than some of the other NR books. The ending did seem to be a bit rushed, but I didn't feel it detracted from the story as a whole. Needless to say, I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I finished this book in a day! It kept my attention so well, I couldn't put it down. The characters are great, as always, and the detail put into the story was amazing. I started reading it again this morning - there's always something that I seem to miss in my excitement over a great story. The depth of feelings that Dec and Lena showed, along with the descriptions of the ghosts are amazing. The little twists and turns in the plot, the reincarnation theory, and who is the reincarntated body of which ghost is fascinating. Nora has a great hit with this one!"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This is one of many books by Nora Roberts that I've read, Genuine Lies and The Villa among others, but I especially liked this one. I loved how most of the story was from a male point of view and I've always wanted to visit New Orleans. I recommend this to anyone who likes a little intrigue, a little past life experience and a moderate dose of romance."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This is one of the most interesting books Nora Roberts has put out in a while. I started this book on a Wednesday afternoon, and I finished it on Thursday. I couldn't put it down. The plot twists are exceptional, and the characters are believable. Remy steals the show with his &quot;Southern&quot; style, and the way she wrote Lena's Grandmother made me think of my childhood. The reincarnation angle was a surprise, but in the end the book tells two stories that merge smoothly into one. I could see this turning into a sequal. There is a great story waiting to be written about &quot;after&quot;. I will read this book over and over."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I think this is the best book I have read from Robert's. I was not expecting all the ghosts stuff when I picked it up. But I am so glad I bought it. I do agree that I was a little disappointed with the ending. But the way it ended....there could be another book written. I mean things didn't get wrapped up. And there was some information that came out in the book regarding Effie that was never fully explained. I would be very happy to see a sequil to this one."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"The premise of the book was great, typical Nora Roberts. I found the ending to be disappointing.

THIS IS ONE OF THE RARE BOOKS THAT I COULD READ AGAIN AND AGAIN."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"As my title says I have to say I did enjoy this book and would recommend it. It had Ms Roberts usually wonderfully drawn characters and attention to detail. The Hero and Heroine are delightful and the supporting characters were as interesting as the main characters. The pace and suspense of the story made a terrific page-turner, but what a let down at the end! It was as if the story just rang out of steam, I remember looking at the dwindling pages at the end of the book and thinking the story will never be resolved satisfactorily in the few pages left and I was right. If ever a book suffered for the lack of another chapter its this one, what happened the mother-in-law from hell and her evil son? Did Lucian redeem himself? Sequel perhaps....?"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Nora Roberts is a great author whether she is writing Science Fiction, mysteries or romances. Midnight Bayou has to be on the list of one of her top ten. She draws these characters with exquisite detail; both Declan and Angelina are strong and yet with that core of stubborness. Who wouldn't love to meet Declan? The setting Ms. Roberts draws of New Orleans teases your senses. I was anxious to get to the end of the book and yet I did not want it to end.Wow! Great book, I thoroughly enjoyed this one-it's a keeper.By the way the book jacket description doesn't do the story justice."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I read this book in one sitting.

I think the book was an insult to her normal writing; usually her suspence is excellent and when you start to read a book, you don't want to put it down. The ending was rediculous; men having babies; don't think so. Would like to see a revision, with a new ending. Wrote a short note on this book in January; forgot to rate; deninitely didn't want any misunderstanding. It isn't worth even a l."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I have read a ton of Nora Roberts' books, and I had high hopes that this one would be as great as some of her previous works. While I do find her books a bit formulaic, they are still entertaining. However, this one was just not as good as her previous books in the same romance/suspense genre, such as Sanctuary and River's End. Her female character was rather flat and undeveloped throughout the novel. The entire book seemed like a remix of various stock characters from earlier novels, mixed and matched to provide a new story. The ending lacked her usual unexpected twist, and if you have seen the movie &quot;Dead Again&quot; you will guess it long before it occurs. I really expected a little more originality from Nora on this one, but that was expecting too much."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I have spent a small fortune on Nora Roberts books, but if this is a sample of what I have to look forward to after all the years of loyalty I have shown her, I will say good-bye now. I have never been so disappointed in one book as I have been in this one. The storyline is so unbelievable, even for a supernatural tale, that it was extremely difficult for me to continue reading this rediculously written novel. &quot;Ick&quot; is all I can say. I think about all the time I spent on this book, and it truly makes me angry. What a silly concept - as I said before, &quot;Nora, what were you thinking?&quot; If anyone out there wants to read a real romance, pick up The Color of Revenge by Millicent Hart. Don't waste you time with Midnight Bayou. Spend it doing something you like - not reading this trivial junk!"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This story had a lot of promise but somewhere in the last quarter of the book it took a sharp wrong turn. If you read a lot of Nora Roberts you know that usually she has an interesting twist at the end, however this time this was a very convoluted twist. That twist made it impossible for me to relate to the characters anymore and made the book really the worst I have ever read from her collection. I highly recommend skipping it."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I'm an avid book reader. I came upon Nora Roberts several months ago. I enjoy all of her books, but this tops the cake. It was just an awesome, can't put down, book."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This book was too similar to the \\"In the Garden\\" trilogy in which the house is being haunted and the people that live in the houses are trying to figure out the pasts of the ghosts that are in the houses, blah,blah,blah"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I have read the majority of Nora Roberts books and looked forward to this one because I had a weeks vacation and could take the time to enjoy it. I did find the premise interesting but it got a little weird toward the middle and relly strange at the end. I still don't understand what happened to Lena's mother and kind of thought that she would have been the troublemaker at the wedding. It just seems to have fizzled out. I couldn't believe it when all of a sudden the hero became the heroine. If Lena was the hero, and I was Declan or whoever he was supposed to be, I would have wished her/him/it a fond farewell without a backward glance. I hope Ms. Roberts slows down with the next book and writes out a COMPLETE rough draft. I felt like I needed cliff notes for this one."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This is the first Nora Roberts I've read in a long time that I really just didn't like. The ending was just a really big letdown; there's all this suspense and mystery that leads up to...nothing. Nothing actually seriously happened with the \\"haunted\\" house; nobody was ever in any actual real danger or threatened by anything. Furthermore, I thought the romance was just messed up; first, they sleep together after their first date, and secondly, it's like the \\"past\\" relationship/people got mixed up with the present, which just didn't seem romantic. I didn't like the whole reincarnation thing, that was just weird, and I didn't much care for Lena, who was just abrasive and kind of slutty, although I absolutely loved Declan and Miss Odette, who were really the redeeming characters of the story. Honestly, from the suspense *where nothing happens* to the romance *which just didn't feel romantic*, I just really didn't like this one. Probably the first Nora Roberts book I actively disliked; not worth buying or reading."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I always wonder why I dislike this one when so many people absolutely love it, so I tried to analyze my feelings during this re-read.First off, I deliberately ignored the fact that I didn't like it when I read it before. But no such luck. I just never really connected with this book.This is what I came up with:* It starts with the story of Lucian and Abigail, who are not the main characters. In fact, they're long dead, and tragically.* There is zero conflict until about two-thirds of the way through the book, but that turns out to be pretty much a non-issue.* We get told a lot that Declan fell in love with Lena at first sight, and even get a list of things he finds admirable about her, which is nice, but I didn't see any chemistry between them, despite the sex scenes.* Lena does that tiresome I'm-afraid-of-relationships thing that is the absolute lamest excuse for conflict in a romance novel and makes me want to chuck it against the wall.* We don't find out until over halfway through the book that the whole point of it is for Declan to figure out what happened to Lucian and Abigail, which is kind of pointless, since we readers have known since the beginning, and there are no consequences if he doesn't--the ghosts are annoying, but not threatening.* The reincarnation stuff again didn't have a lot of point to it, and made an already lackluster romance between Declan and Lena worse because it seems they had no choice in the matter anyway.* I'm not a POV purist, by any means, but since one of my biggest problems with Midnight Bayou is that I didn't connect with the characters, and since that's one of the consequences of headhopping, the fact that there is a lot of headhopping might have something to do with it.So. I feel better because I think I've given this book a fair shot, and now I can identify reasons why I didn't like it. Even what happened to Declan near the end of the book didn't endear him to me as it did so many readers.Why three stars? That last third of the book moved pretty well, and the characters were engaging by that point."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"The minute I got to the ghost part, I was freaked out.

I laugh, smile, and feel for the characters each time I read it. Dec and Lena were made for each other. The way the past and present melded together was just fantastic. The story of Dec and Lena's past life was so moving and strong. My favorite part was when Lena told Dec that he had their roles--reincarnation of themselves--all wrong. I laughed so hard at Dec's reaction! This book is simply a must-read..over and over.."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I totally enjoyed this story of ghosts from the past paralleled to the characters from the present. Declan Fitzgerald (Boston lawyer turned house-restorer) has been drawn to the big house in New Orleans - Manet Hall, filled with mystery and intrigue from the past, in particular, a young woman, Abigail Manet, who had been raped and murdered by her brother-in-law and left in the bayou for burial by her mother-in-law. One hundred years later, Declan is drawn to the Hall to discover himself being the reincarnation of that time and the one person who can make things right for Abigail. Enter Angelina (Lena) and her grandmamma who will help Declan discover some answers to the mystery of Abby's death and her daughter (Lena's great great grandmother-Marie Rose's heritage). Declan is completely mesmerized by Lena from the start and is determined to make her his wife in a very short time. A great story, as usual, even though it was a ghost story and not the usual Nora Roberts that I am used to."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Everytime I read a Nora Roberts book, I say, \\"that was the best book of hers I've read.\\" She just keeps getting better. This book takes you to the Bayou with tales of romance, and ghosts. The story is weaved so wonderfully from the past to the present explaining the past. Midnight Bayou has it all, it is impossible to put down."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"The Midnight Bayou is a wonderful mix of ghost, romance and humor. This book reminds the reader how we all connect in this life or in our past. It was haunting in so many ways I couldn't wait to get back to the book to find out what the next turn would be. This book needs one more chapter to satisfy all the reader - but still a great book. If you enjoy mystical storylines and romance you will also enjoy Heaven and Earth, Face the Fire, Dance upon the Air (Three Sisters Island Trilogy)."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Team it up with Nora Roberts and you have my favorite book. This is a book that blends the haunting, yet beautiful past with the present time. Ghosts, plantation homes, the bayous, the passion. I absolutely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This book keeps you interested to the very last word on the very last page. It's a romance and a thriller rolled up into one. Nora Roberts is a very unique author and knows how to keep her readers interested until the very last drop.Something very shocking and mind-bending happened in Manet Hall that no one knows about today.Declan Fitzgerald is a wealthy, ex-lawyer looking to restore old Manet Hall to its original days. He of course meets a woman, Lena. It is eventually revealed along the way that she has relations with the Hall, and so does her grandmother. Through the time they are rebuilding the house, mysterious and thrilling things happen that no one around has any explanation for. Things are revealed to Declan and Lena that slowly show what had previously happened in the Hall that now haunts it. Their bond together grows bigger and bigger by the day, and more confusing and edgy. \\"What's wrong with these two?\\" is what you'll probably eventually think to yourself. But no worries, keep on reading. Through the good times and bad times that Declan and Lena have together, they get closer and closer to finding out what's going on in that place.I really enjoyed this book. I found myself making time that I usually wouldn't be using productively to reading. The interest that keeps you reading and reading until you get to the very end is exciting to have.If you like to read thrillers and romances, I highly recommend this book to you. It's very exciting to read and just to picture it inside your own head. It's like a movie playing in front of your own eyes. It's not too long, not too short. The first chapter of this book is guaranteed to get you hooked on reading the rest. There's no telling what could possibly happen, and that's just half the excitement."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This was the most unique romance I've ever read.What do you get when you combine a ghost story with a romance?You get Nora Roberts' Midnight Bayou.Declan is a burned out lawyer from Boston who invests in, and begins to restore a Louisianan house.Lena is the owner and bartender of a local pub.

The moment I've started to read it, though, I couldn't let it go. The characters are amazing - living or dead! This is one of my favorites, no doubt about it. Highly recommended!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"once again Nora Roberts writes a book to exceed my expectations.i expect a good storyline with interesting characters from her as a matter of fact,but this time she presents the readers with characters so vibrant and colorful that they seem to take on a life of their own.add in humor and the paranormal elements and you get a start to finish delight of a novel."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I was pleased as usual with her book! Her writing is wonderful. A great story, I felt like I was there in the house with them, very exciting and could not put it down. I think this was one of her best books yet!

Declan [with his wicked sense of humor and steadfast determination] is by far the most remarkable hero I have read to date and Lena [a role model for any woman who wants love and independence] made me want to nurture my own. The story line was well thought out and implemented and the secondary characters added the extra dimensions necessary to make it an outstanding read! While I have recommended this book to each of my customers and a few strangers, I do wish the ending had been a bit more developed and detailed. Even with this, I would still suggest everyone read this book. I hope to see more stories along this line from Ms. Roberts. Thank you for a delightful read!"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"What I liked best about this book was the crackling dialogue between the characters, much of which brought a smile to my lips. The characters are well drawn and the paranormal aspects of the plot are intriguing. The romantic scenes are handled adeptly, and the plot moves along quickly. Interactions with the secondary characters are well done. However, I think that the conclusion was too abrupt; instead of a dramatic climax, the end just dwindles, and you are left with a sense of letdown instead of the sigh of satisfaction you get when a novel ends perfectly. That said, the other 95% of the book is amusing and well written, and I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"After &quot;The Villa&quot; and &quot;Carolina Moon,&quot; Midnight Bayou was a breath of fresh air. I really liked how Roberts focused primarily on the two main characters, Declan and Lena while the supplementary characters stayed as just that, not taking more of the spotlight than necessary from the other them, such as by making Remy and Effie an already established couple than taking the reader through their relationship as she did with Pilar and David in the Villa. I really liked how the ghosts of the past played into the story with some twists that honestly came out of left field but made perfect sense in light of the preceding events. The book was anything but predictable in multiple respects and I really missed that. Initially, as I got into the novel I saw shades of Sophia from &quot;The Villa&quot; in Lena but as the novel progressed, Lena came off as a different, if not improved, version of that character. I do also think that Declan is just a tad too perfect &lt;why can't guys in real life be that smooth and not come of as corny?&gt;, but then again, this is a romance novel, not real life :). The supporting characters were wonderful and I really enjoyed the interplay between Remy and Declan. Another character who seemed a little too perfect was perhaps Miss Odette, but it looked so good on her it's hard to complain. The ending felt a little rushed ... would have loved an epilogue. But all in all, a wonderful book and a great reminder as to why this woman is an excellent storyteller."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Nora, you've redeemed yourself after &quot;The Villa&quot;. If I could have given this 41/2 stars, I would have. I didn't give it a perfect 5 only because Declan was a little too good to be true. I really enjoyed this book. I thought the reincarnation twist was very clever. I really liked the characters, not like in &quot;The Villa&quot; where they were so shallow."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Books that feature ghosts, the Old South, and old houses as a character are three of my favorite things topics. Roberts put all three in this new novel. Good point: Interesting twists on the ghosts....I kept saying no, no...but it was true. Bad point: Not enough about the ghosts and their lives in the early 1900s. Still, a quick and fun read; you won't need to keep the lights on for this one."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"The story starts out by telling of the tragedy that happened at Manet Hall in 1899, then skips to the present day. This happens throughout the book, which I liked.Declan and Lena (Angelina) are the main characters in this story. They are brought together to set the tragic events of the past straight and lay some spirits to rest. Declan is a very likable character. He was humorous, fun, loving, and determined. Lena was a very strong female in this book, and at first I admired that about her, but after a while it seemed a bit much. At times she just plain got on my nerves. However, the story was well put together and I enjoyed it.Although I enjoyed Declan and Lena's story, I would've loved to have seen Nora Roberts write a book about the backstory before she wrote Midnight Bayou. Why? The backstory of Lucian and Abigail was interesting and I believe it would've made a wonderful book even with the tragic ending.All in all, I did enjoy this book and would recommend it.Book Hollow[...]"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I was excited to read this book. I was hoping it would be spooky. The book was easy to predict and was not that exciting. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"While there were the wonderfully-drawn characters, the ending a very lame and unfulfilling. It was abrupt and I didn't get the feeling of completion. Still love Roberts, just not as good as usual."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"If you want to enjoy this book better, skip over the past events at the beginning of the book and start reading at the present-day events. That being said, I really loved the male hero in this story. In fact, I would say, if you want to be romanced properly, forget all about the storyline and pretend he is romancing you. James Daniels's reading voice was perfect for this character. I enjoyed Declan and his best friend when the two of them were leaving his friend's bachelor party. They were hilarious. I gave the story four stars because of this leading man.The female lead, Lena, was likeable, but a little difficult to warm up to. The problem I saw was that the author's reasons for Lena's not wanting to get serious with Declan never fit in with the rest of the story, and Lena never acted like the person she had been in the past had had any impact on the person she was in the present. She was too emotionally detached.But I did like the time-changing back and forward, and Sandra Burr's reading of the past events was oustanding. I always enjoy reincarnation stories if they are done right, and I could easily accept the idea of the different characters being brought together again in another lifetime. I thought it was bold and daring on the author's part and I liked it. I had to adjust to Declan's previous lifetime, but once I did, I just liked that the author did it that way. She had to know that it was radical.I enjoyed the relationship between Declan and Lena. They had a strange kind of tension between them and their own special way of adjusting and interacting with each other.The brothers in the story didn't have to be twins, and I almost stopped listening when I heard that they were, but I'm glad that I didn't. I'm not too sure about the ghost-angle. It seemed to vacillate between scary and then not. And the manner in which the ghosts finally left the house definitely needed improvement. Also, the ending was anticlimactic because the events at the beginning of the story should have been dished out little by little throughout the story with the full explanation of what happened, revealed at the end. Either that or something way different should have happened at the end. The ending was good for the hero and heroine, though not for the omniscience readers. But I don't regret listening to this story. It had a great courtship, lots of genuine humor, some really entertaining characters, and that sweetheart of a leading man."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I really like novels written from a male point of view (mine is!); I like to see how the man changes through the story/conflict, and this book did not disappoint where that is concerned. Lena was a little too stereotypical for me, and the romance felt a little...stilted.I don't usually get into paranormal stuff or reincarnation but this wasn't too far out and the relationship issues were good enough that I was willing to overlook any residual hesitation I had about the multiple (and extremely coincidental) reincarnations.The history of Lucian and Abigail was so good it almost overtook the rest of the story (and probably would have been a good story on its own). I really liked the twist (and didn't see it coming) that Declan's former incarnation was of the opposite sex - nice touch!My biggest complaint is that there are so many points of view in the story - it can sometimes be confusing and also got in the way of me getting to know the characters, which is what really hooks me as a reader."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This book is a must read, one of Nora's best in my opinion because it deals with the past and the present with some ghosts thrown in for good measure."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"As most of Nora Roberts books this one is outstanding.

Midnight Bayou, however, was a huge disappointment. I loved the book up until about the last 20 pages.

Midnight Bayou is just one of them. This novel tells a story about ghosts and reincarnation among Declan and Angelina. It reminds you of watching a Japanese horror flick such as the Grudge.

With the help of Julian's mother, Josephine, Abigail's body is dumped into the bayou. When Julian returns from being away, he is told his wife has run off with another man and that she has left her \\"bastard\\" child behind. Marie Rose is sent to live with Abigail's people.More than 100 years later, Declan Fitzgerald leaves his life in Boston and moves to Louisiana, buying and fixing up the old Manet mansion. The house is haunted with the ghosts of the Manets, and Declan, together with Lena - the Louisiana woman he has fallen in love who also happens to be a descendent of Marie Rose - unravels the mystery of the house and its former inhabitants.This is a good beach or airplane book. The characters are fun and quirky and Declan is appropriately romantic and persistent in his affections towards Lena. The reincarnation aspect (Declan and Lena are supposedly Lucian and Abigal reincarnated) was a little far-fetched, though."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I did enjoy this book up to a point but when I reached the end I was very disappointed!"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"My first peeve with this book was on the Paperback copy it does not have much of a plot description on the book, so I had to come here (Amazon) to even find out what it was about. My next peeve was I think Nora was doing a Interracial Romance on the \\"DL\\" (down low)(which will probably not bother anyone who is NOT a minority) she never clearly acknowledges that Lena is African American.... but there are other things throughout the book that leads me (who happens to be African American)to believe that she is. I guess it isn't much of a big deal as it doesn't take away from the storyline nor the plot, but their are other instances where she clearly writes in her book that someone was black yet when it comes to the leading heroine character she doesn't............ almost as if she doesn't want to acknowledge it??? I always wondered why no one had ever wrote a Romance Novel about a Slave owner and a Servant that come together in another time when their love (and subsequent Marriage) wouldn't be forbidden. Don't get me wrong Lucien was NOT a Slave owner the story that is thread to the present day one, takes place after the abolishment of slavery so Abigail is a servant NOT a Slave. WHATEVER on to my review.LOVED THE STORY. If you enjoy a good Ghost story you will run through the pages fairly quickly. I don't want to give any spoilers in this review but Nora threads the glimpses from the Past into this book periodically for the reader to understand what was going on between Lucian and Abigail. I do agree with another reviewer that stated that there are some loose ends that aren't wrapped up to my satisfaction, but I leave that for the individual reader to find and decide on his or her own.Overall the book has some Humor which had me laughing out loud (towards the end), a fair amount of Suspense and the characters are ok (though no of them will stand out in my memory) Anyone that likes Nora probably will not be dissapointed in this book. I do however recommend if the reader likes books about reincarnation to try {Susanna Kearsley's} \\"Mariana\\" excellent story of two people finding one another in a different lifetime, or if you like Contemporary Romance with a Interracial Love from the past woven in try {Ruth Wind} \\"In the Midnight Rain\\" or \\"Stone Flower Garden\\" by Deborah Smith all of the books that I have recommended have a unsuspected twist at the end as with Midnight Bayou.Respectfully Reviewed"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Although this story was very captivating and held my attention quite well, it is, in my opinion, not one of Nora's best books. And let me tell you, I'm a huge fan of hers. She is a brilliant romance novelist.This story revolves around Declan Fitzgerald and Angelina Simone - two beautiful people who develop a strong attraction for each other, and then later find out it has a lot to do with their reincarnation.The whole book centers around Manet Hall and Declan's restoration of it. It made me want to go to my local hardware store and at least redo my living room. But unfortunately, I don't have Declan's abyssal bank account.I always do this when I read books - especially ones like this. I think of celebrities as the characters. Like Declan was the guy from &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot; because his name was Declan, too. Angelina (or Lena) was Fran Drescher. I don't know why, but she was. Effie was Phoebe from &quot;Friends&quot; and Remy was a little unclear, but I pictured him as short and chubby even though Nora didn't say that at all.I would have given this book 5 stars, but the ending of the book got very confusing with all the reincarnation stuff - I didn't know who was talking to who and it just lost me. Nevertheless, it was a good read."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I'm a BIG fan of JD Robb, Nora Roberts' alter ego. And I also love books set in the South.

This is a good book, but there are too many repeat \\"scares\\"--going in \\"the haunted room\\", passing out there, going to bed and waking up in \\"the haunted room\\". Ms. Roberts takes her time setting up the hauntings and throws in a little hot sex to keep us turning the pages. But I wanted Declan to actually MEET one of the tortured ghosts. Or call a \\"housecleaner\\" to chase them out once and for all. Do SOMETHING besides pant over Lena and sand and stain kitchen cabinets. She also fleshes out her characters very well. I liked the idea that Declan has the moral backbone that Roarke lacks. But I got the feeling that everyone in the book knew what was going on in the house and were waiting for Declan to catch up.When he finally does \\"catch up\\" the premise of who he was in a past life is so silly I would have stopped reading then and there if it wasn't so close to the end of the book. Declan did seem rather over-emotional throughout the book, but let's just say he really gets in touch with his feminine side toward the end of the book.

At 31 with great family connections in Boston, all the money he needs to give up a law practice that he didn't really want and an ex-fiancee that he didn't marry he could hops in his car and drives to New Orleans to rennovate a 100 year old mansion that he bought complete with ghosts capable of banging doors as music plays, a baby cries, and old hatreds cause a true chill in the air even in the heat of a New Orleans springtime.A trip into a bar in the French Quarter shakes up his life and expectations as he meets Remy who is everything a romance novel could demand. She is tough, sexy and independent and a product of the Bayou. Actually she is a direct descendent of the family who lived and died so violently in the old mansion that Declan is rennovating. Declan sees visions of things that went on in the house before him which left Rose Marie an orphan. Rose Marie is the great great great gandmother of Remy of couse. It's an imaginative story about the supernatural and the here and now coming together. At the end Remy and Declan solve all the mysteries but the reader is left wondering just how it is that the ghosts are laid to rest. Even with a weak ending, it was a fun read."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I love Nora Roberts and have read every book she has ever written. The good news is that she writes stacks of books every year, so her fans keep satisfied. The bad news is that there only so many stories to go around before they start sounding the same. This book is entertaining and it does have some new elements, but it could just use some more spice, some more developed characters. If you love Nora Roberts, you MUST read this, but don't expect anything significantly different or new."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Page turning entertainment that is hard to put down. A typical Nora Roberts book - wonderful reading."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Nora does it again! She is one of my favorite authors and yet she still cease to amaze me. If you are truely a Nora Roberts fan you will read this book just because. The inserts are amazing and the preveiw speaks for itself."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"After reading some of the reviews, I hesitated to buy this book. Usually, I start reading a Nora Roberts book the day it hits the stands. I was not sure if I really wanted to read a book that focuses mostly on the hero and his thoughts and feelings. After reading a few chapters, I realized that reading more of the male perspective wasn't all bad, I just really didn't know too many, actually not any, males that act and think like Declan. He was just a little too in touch with his feminine side for my taste. And as the chapters progressed, he was fast becoming a doormat. I could not find anything exciting about him. He was, well, boring.Still, this was not a bad book; it's just that I was expecting more of a mystery/suspense/romance. I kept waiting for the plot twist. And by the time I got to the end, I was still waiting for it. Maybe if I had not been looking for that, I would have enjoyed it more. So, if you are expecting a traditional Nora Roberts &quot;whodunit&quot; book, you might be somewhat disappointed.For me, this book was a solid &quot;3 stars&quot; but I gave it 4, because it IS a Nora Roberts."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I enjoyed it immensley.

The charactors were not interesting, only her attention to detail made the book acceptable.I say wait until paperback or it hits the used list."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I usually love her books. But this one, it fell short of her usually high standerds. I could swallow the gender switching ghosts, but for Abby &amp; Julian to just &quot;rest in peace&quot; after all that.

As for the relationship between Dec &amp; Lena, well it seemed that they go through this &quot;spiritual cleansing&quot; toward the end, then everything is just peachy?!?! What was that all about???I will still read her books, as I think she is a gifted story teller. But I am sorry to say that this one just did not do it for me."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This was my first Nora Roberts. I gave it a try because the \\"haunted New Orleans\\" aspect sounded fascinating. Here are some reasons I'm sorry I picked it up:1. Rape scene: The story begins with a rape scene. I don't want rape scenes in romance novels, even when they aren't committed by the hero. With romance like this, who needs real life??2. Language. Bad language doesn't phase me, but I'm not looking for it in a romance novel.3. Strip club. The hero and his buddy spend an evening hitting the strip clubs. Major turn off. Give me a man who is too mature, and has too much integrity, to treat women like sex toys. (Yes, there are plenty of men like that.) And give me a woman with too much backbone to take it.I won't even get into the \\"Prince Charming marries the maid\\" aspect of the 1900 romance.On the plus side, there is a brave attempt at gender bending in the reincarnation aspect. However, for me it interfered with the romantic mood.It's back to British Chick Lit for me."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I was as always waiting for the new Nora Roberts book withgreat anticipation. I was disappointed. What's with all theinterest in spirits and the occult? Let's get back to some serious writing Nora."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"For years now, long before she was famous, Nora Roberts has been my favorite author. I read all her books and never has a reprint been a new story for me. I also read J.D. Robb and enjoy that series. I am very unhappy and disappointed with the direction she is now taking. In a very recent book, she wrote of magic, and as a Christian, I found it offensive. In Midnight Bayou, she has turned to reincarnation and the occult, which for those who study the Bible is offensive again. What's with this? I have always purchased Nora Roberts' books, sight unseen as soon as they are released. I won't be doing that anymore. It appears that I must check her books out now before purchasing them to determine content. I fear this has happened because she has made it big and is just spitting them out as fast as possible. Come on Nora, be true to yourself, and your loyal fans. This rating of 1 is a gift; I would have given it a zero."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I've always enjoyed this book and found it hard to put down.

I read it in two days, which is extremely fast since I work and go to college. I loved the characters and the plot. She kept throwing twists that I wasn't expecting. I had a little issue with the end. I felt like it didn't come together as cleanly as the rest of the book but this book is still one of my favorites of hers. Even though it's really far fetch, I loved it. I've recommended it to two friends already."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This is my first 2 star review. I always go higher, usually way higher. I am an enthusiastic and voracious reader. I can read almost anything. Or so I thought. I have recently developed a taste for romance and have enjoyed discovering new and gifted writers in this genre. In my zest, I thought, why not read the big names...like Nora Roberts. I mean, if the lesser known writers have impressed and entertained me so well, Nora Roberts will send me over the top. Right?Wrong. The first chapter was intriguing. It is about star-crossed love that defies class structure and results in a murder in an old mansion in the bayou. But it is a short chapter and the story is all downhill from there.As soon as I met the supposed modern-day hero, Declan, I got queasy. Ugh. He's just a dork, plain and simple. And his infatuation, Lena, is a stereotypical bad girl/siren that is unbelievable too...and horribly cringe-evoking. I limped along with these lame characters in order to get back to the historic gothic part. But in the end, I didn't have the stomach for it. I gave up half way through, and honestly, I've never done that before. I've at least skimmed the rest of a book. Are all of Nora Roberts heroes this goofy?"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This was a great read. Fun and suspenseful. Romance and adventurous spirit. Loved it!! Will not disappoint.Ordered from Amazon- well priced and delivery was prompt"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Nora Roberts does it again! This book was great and hard to put down. The beginning really pulled me in and left me shocked so I had to keep reading in order to find out what happened. This story and the characters are lovely and you can clearly empathize with the protaganist. Great read and I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves this author or who's looking for something new."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Midnight Bayou is a wonderful mixture of two stories that connect in a beautiful and at times spooky way. I have read this books many times since it came out originally. I usually take a while between readings, so it is like reading it for the first time every time and I have to say it kinda freaks me out a bit every time...lol.. BUT I am a self-admitted chicken.Declan Fitzgerald has always felt a strong pull towards the old Manet Hall, and now he has finally changed his life by buying it and moving from Boston to New Orleans to renovate it himself. From his first night in the house he begins to see he isn't alone in the Hall, and some of the ghosts aren't too happy that he has moved in. He keeps having episodes where he sleepwalks to certain parts of the house including the old nursery on the third floor which he can't bring himself to enter. On top of that he keeps having dreams of things that happened in the house which he figures out when he sees pictures of the original family.Angelina \\"Lena\\" Simone grew up just down the bayou from Manet Hall, and she has a family connection to the dark past of the hall. From the moment Declan sees her in her French Quarter bar, he feels an instant connection in his heart to her. He just has to get past all her walls and past pain to win her love, and not only do they have those hurdles the ghosts of his house don't want them together either.This book is so much more than a good ghost story. The weaving of this tale is one that is both shocking and beautiful. Nora Roberts's books always grab me, but this is one of those that hold a special place in my heart. I have recommended this book to more peeps over the years than I can count. Some peeps have watched the Lifetime movie, but I have to say I treat it as one of those movies that just so happens to have a similar story line because this book is sooo beyond what that movie was. When you get to the parts where the past and the present come together, and Declan and Lena \\"go through\\" all that happened in the past. I can't even begin to say how shockingly wonderful that is. My only complaint and it isn't even a big one is that when Nora did her research for this one she used mostly \\"real French\\" instead of getting someone to help her with the Cajun French. As a Cajun that is just a small pet peeve, but I look past that in this one. I can't recommend this one to you guys enough!4.75 Stars"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I love Nora Roberts so I am a big fan of anything she writes - this one was good but not one of my all time favorites.....ending was just a little strange for me.."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Being a big Nora Roberts fan, I wouldn't expect to read anything I didn't like, but this has to be one of my favorites. Roberts' mysteries blow me away. Turning, twisting, suspenseful plots kept me reading for hours and hours. Yes, my children had to go without clean clothes or a hot meal for a week, but it was worth it. JK Anyway, Roberts developed these characters so well that I felt like I really could see them and feel what they felt even without the physical descriptions. How she resolves the mystery is creative and wonderfully interesting and yet surprising. This is definitely in my top 20 favorite books."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Short and sweet... I really liked the story of this book until the reincarnation part. I wouldn't have minded reincarnation if the same gender was reincarnated to that gender.

Am I glad I did!!! Nora Roberts writing about New Orleans and the bayous?? The mystery and the romance written by my favorite author??? A match made in heaven for sure. I started this book just before I went to sleep last night. Knocked off the first chapter and went to sleep with a smile on my face.... Today, the book didn't leave my side until I had finished it!! So what if dinner was late getting to the table? So what if my son barely got a nod from me when he got home from school? This was Nora writing about bayous and Louisiana and reincarnation and Lena and Declan and Lucian and Abby...he, that fabulous teenager, understands when I've got &quot;a Nora&quot; in front of me!!I was hooked from the get go with this tale of love and redemption, murder and sadness.

I enjoyed that it was told from mostly the male's perspective and I really liked the lead characters. Declan feels compelled to leave his job as a lawyer and buy a house--Manet Hall--that has fascinated him for 11 years. It is in disprepair and he puts his all into bringing it back to its former grandeur. However, strange things happen while he is there, including flashbacks (memories?) of a murder that took place a long time ago. While doing this, he meets Lena, who plays an integral part in his memories. Declan has a sense of humor and makes you want to believe that people like him really exist. I would have to say my only complaint is that I wish the ending scene was longer--I would have liked to see Lena's reaction to the ring. This is defintitely one of my favorite Nora Robert's books, and I'm usually not into past lives, etc. Buy this book--you won't be sorry. Nora never disappoints!!"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This story takes place in the present, but also in the past.

He gets strange vibes from the house, and when he meets Angelina, they intensify. Together they go on the 100 year old journey to find the answers to the strange happenings within Manet Hall.While I generally like ghost stories with the paranormal added to the mix, this went beyond the scope of what I can take. The rebirth and reincarnation of characters was just too far out in left field for me. I normally like Nora Roberts books, but this is one I couldn't get into."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Some little while ago, I went searching far and wide for an atmospheric read - had been thirsting (veritably parched, indeed!), for something mysterious and ethereal- ideally set, naturally, somewhere as beloved to me as New Orleans...I inevitably found this novel on the discount shelves at my favorite, old hat, bricks & mortar bookstore- then took it home to savour overnight. -And now I must say - (and say it here, for truly it's an admission that doesn't normally go down so easily on one such as me, but...) Yes, I liked it: I liked it very well indeed, actually!This lush & lively story intertwines the distant past and the ever present for a love story that is a force all its own. There's an old tale: set at the turn of the century on a magnificent mansion on the bayous in the outskirts of New Orleans, between the estate's heir and the Cajun servant girl he'd married -- a tale that had turned tragic, and then poignantly tenacious with the passing of about a hundred years....Weaved through is the main, present-day love story- that being between Declan: a wealthy up & rising lawyer from Boston who chucks his job, his engagement, and all the ties that bind, to fix up that same old bayou mansion, which he had once felt strongly connected to in his youth -- and Angelina, a native of the New Orleans Bayou, whose blood happens to be intimately connected with the bayou's history, whether she likes it or not.I must say, though, that the setting had just about all to do with my enjoyment of this book - anyone who can capture the true, bare essence of New Orleans in their writing can likely conjure glorious \\"Atmosphere\\" without any effort. -And for someone like Nora Roberts, who has had the privilege of having been published of well over a hundred books, this really was no problem.In the end, it was the poignancy of place that overcame even the all-too-predictable, formulaic modern-day love story. And really, even its classification as a \\"Romance\\", its author being widely acclaimed as an unabashed mainstream assembly-line storyteller, could not hurt it either, I don't believe.MIDNIGHT BAYOU is nothing if not a sinful, superfluous pleasure. Ever since reading it, I've been able to find in myself a weird, albeit endearingly decadent quality, which deigns to seek, and often finds (in about a dozen more NR books since, no less!) a vast amount of pleasure in reading these light, entertaining romances by a renown romance writer who can just as adeptly punch out a very good yarn as fill it through and through with the most excellently written sex (such glorious smut!) -& all by rote!Because of its setting and atmosphere, I'll always consider MIDNIGHT BAYOU my far & away favorite Nora Roberts book. Yet since it shall be the one and only title of hers that I'll ever review (a Vampire must at least make some attempt, however feeble, to maintain its reputation) - I'll then sum this up with my rating of all her amusingly scandalous reads together: ~4 Stars~"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Midnight BayouNora RobertsDeclan Fitzgerald leaves his job as a Boston lawyer to buy a house--Manet Hall--that he first discovered in New Orleans 11 years ago.

Lena and Declan are both linked to the history of Manet Hall as well as to each other. Lena's grandmother lives behind Manet Hall and Declan befriends her. She is a wonderful character. Declan has a terrific personality and sense of humor. This is definitely one of my favorite Nora Robert's books. Being interested in reincarnation and past lives added to the flavor. I must admit I was surprised when I discovered what the subject of the book was but I think Ms. Roberts handled it in a believable manner. Definitely a keeper."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I have read almost everything Nora Roberts has written. I buy her books as soon as they hit the bookshelves, and Midnight Bayou was no exception. Sometimes I am less than thrilled by her work, but for the most part, I think an &quot;inferior&quot; Nora Roberts book is better than most romance books out there. I thoroughly enjoyed this book! The male lead was, for me, the most lovable and enjoyable of all her male characters to date. He was intelligent, sensitive, but macho, thoughtful, incredibly witty and, of course, rich and handsome. Once of the reasons I read romance novels is to escape to a fantasy world for a little while, and what a great time I had reading about this &quot;too good to be true&quot; guy! The female lead was not so likable, at times, but I really enjoyed their interactions. The dialogue was funny, and the supporting characters were almost as enjoyable as the leads. The flashbacks to the past, although dark, were absorbing. I've always liked ghost stories. And, since I did not grow up in Louisianna, and didn't know that her descriptions weren't accurate, I thought they were fun and charming. The only complaint I have is that I did think the ending was a little anticlimactic. I was expecting more at the end--what that was, I don't know, but something...Despite this, I give this book 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This book is like the Nora Roberts everyone can't wait to buy and read. I must admit I was somewhat disappointed in the last book, THE VILLA. MIDNIGHT BAYOU has everything, suspense, romance and lots of laughs. I enjoy how Roberts brings the legends of the region her books are taking place in.Lena and Declan are both very likeable characters. Although the rich guy and poor girl routine has been played to the death, this story was both believeable and caring. The fact that everyone's lives were not &quot;fixed&quot; by the end of the book was good. Lena's mother was like some mother's or father's I have known from friends. I like the way Nora Roberts handled Declan's relatives also.Anyone who reads Nora Roberts will love this book. CAROLINA MOON, SANCTURAY, and HOMEPORT are just a few books like this one."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"There isn't a bad Nora Roberts novel, but some are better than others, and this one is right up there in the top ten! It is set in New Orleans, and you can't have a really good story about New Orleans without a haunted house, and eccentric characters, now can you? This is a good modern love story with a feisty adversary for the hero of the story, but the most interesting part of the story is the reincarnation twist that the story presents, different from what you expect it to be. An old crime and &quot;thwarted love&quot; story must be resolved before the present day lovers can get on with their lives. But how can it be resolved when all the involved characters are long dead? Justice can't touch the dead, can it? Well, that is where the mystery comes in. You must read the book to find out if justice is done and if it is, how. It would be unfair of me to tell the ending, or even the crime that becomes the crux of the story. There are a lot of subplots floating around but Ms. Roberts does a wonderful job of tying them together. A thoroughly good read, and hard for me to put down. I read it in record time, because you can't wait to see how it is going to end!"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"will be very short; Nora Roberts is one of my favorite writers;have never been as disappointed as i was with Midnight Bayou.The ending was not believable and left you unsatisfied; hopefully this is a fluke because i buy a lot of her hardcover books. prior to the ending, the plot and story were enjoyable; but with a bad ending, it leaves a bad taste."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I am constantly amazed by reviews from readers who try to place harsh literary restrictions on the romance genre. While I certainly have no time for stupid romance books aimed at women with an IQ of 10, even Nora Roberts at her least inspired is better than most. I may not find her choice of a story my personal favorite, but I always come away feeling like the price and my time was worth it. And so it is with &quot;Midnight Bayou&quot;. As is the case with all her books, her characters are interesting and her stories creatively unique. Her character's perfections and story situations are intensified for a reason--and that reason is why we all enjoy the genre. &quot;Midnight Bayou&quot; was a fun read and I recommend it highly to all readers who enjoy quality romance writing."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"once again, nora roberts creates a world i would very much like to be a part of. although she's focused on haunted mansions before, most notably in the calhoun series, you will not be able to pace yourself and read this book slowly. although i am tempted to write the entire plot out, i won't as it is essential to the book that you read for yourselves and discover the true identity of the ghosts...you will not be disappointed. for this novel, there is no mystery like in carolina moon or hidden treasure as in the calhoun books, but nonetheless, i can guarantee that you will be very well satisfied with the search for love that goes on with Declan and Lena."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"In the beginning I didn't think I was going to like this book. It starts off as an historical romance but takes a very viscious and tragic turn. Not something I find entertaining. Once it jumped to the present time, I was hooked.Declan is my idea of Prince Charming! He is a rich lawyer from Boston who gives up his unsatisfying practice and moves to the New Orleans area to restore a (haunted) rundown mansion with his bare hands. He is not stuffy or pretentious. He is kind, considerate, fun-loving and a boy at heart; the kind of person other people like to be around.Once he sees Angelina, it is love at first sight for him. She, however, has other ideas. For some reason she has made up her mind never to love anyone. Declan is the perfect gentleman, so patient and romantic, the romance of dreams or fairy tales. Angelina doesn't know what to make of him. He is just so nice to everyone. He can defuse a tense situation with just a few words and humor. Declan is an out-going fun-loving guy who flirts playfully with Angelina's grandmother and his best friend's girlfriend. He has them eating out of his hand but that is not his intention. He genuinely likes people and likes to make them happy.Some situations and dialogue were just laugh out loud funny but I do agree with the reviewer who said the ending was a let down. There was a twist near the end but then the story just seemed to fade away instead of coming to a satisfying conclusion. Near the end, the young woman who married Declan's best friend felt she was somehow involved with the haunting but her connection was not developed. It seemd like a chapter was omitted.Still, I loved that guy!"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Midnight Bayou is a cross between a romantic novel and a story revolving around the supernatural. Nora Roberts does well to keep things moving along without overloading us on the hauntings, thus creating an enjoyable story.Roberts lays the groundwork for this novel beginning with a scene from 1899. Abigail is awaiting the arrival of her husband, Lucien, in their home, Manet Hall. Abigail was a lowly servant who fell madly in love with one of the sons of the owner. Lucien reciprocates her love much to his mother's chagrin. Instead of this being a fairy tale romance, his evil twin, Julian, intercedes. He brutally rapes and kills Abigail. Since his mother never liked Abigail, she assists Julian in cleaning up the murder scene and helps him dump her body into the bayou so as not to be found. They concoct a story of her running off with a lover, which breaks Lucien's heart.Switch back to current times and we find Declan Fitzgerald buying Manet Hall, which has fallen into disrepair. He begins restoring the old mansion and encounters the bizarre. Things like a room on the third floor that he cannot enter because fear overwhelms him. Or his watch which always stops at midnight, while the chimes of a non-existent grandfather clock sound. Or a crying baby who sounds like he's on the third floor, which is vacant.Enter Angelina Simone (Lena), the granddaughter of Miss Odette who lives next door to Manet Hall. Lena has always been drawn to Manet Hall ever since she was a little girl. Of course this being a romance, Lena and Declan fall madly in love while they try to unravel the strange happenings surrounding them.Character development is excellent and Roberts delves into Declan and Lena with her usual style, leaving little to the imagination. Also, we are given insight into Abigail and Lucien and we're led to believe that they could be Declan and Lena in previous lives. Ok, so it's a bit weird, but nothing is out of reach when Nora Roberts is at the helm. A support cast rounds is also well developed and intriguing in their own rights.Roberts doesn't overdo the hauntings or supernatural stuff to the point that it deters from the story line or characters. If anything it enhances the reader's enjoyment. She uses the right mix of romance and supernatural to attract a greater reading audience.Midnight Bayou is very different than Roberts other works, but still achieves the excellent standards we've come to expect. It's a great book and should be added to your Must Read list."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"While ghost stories aren't my preferred reading material, I usually read anything written by Nora Roberts. Nora has a way of writing male characters that makes them believeable and yet fit the romance archetype. Declan Fitzgerald is no exception! Although I was dubious at first, Nora writes a great reincarnation story. (I won't go into detail, as I don't want to spoil readers with the surprise, but suffice to say it is quite a plot twist, Grin). My favorite character in the book was Remy who steals the show with his 'southern charm.' If I could suggest improvement, I wish Declan wasn't another 'rich unmarried bachelor.' I'd like to see Nora write more about handsome dynamic men of average means... And leave the trustfund babies for authors who can't write...

Lena is fighting her attraction to Declan for all she's worth because they are replaying the events that happened a hundred years ago to the original owners of Manet Hall, hopefully with happier results.Nora Roberts has written a beautiful romance centering on a couple who have been reincarnated to fix what went wrong in their previous life together. A haunted house, complete with ghosts, seems genuine when placed in Ms. Roberts' story line. The fast paced, action oriented plot is heading for the best sellers lists as MIDNIGHT BAYOU looks to be an award winner.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Loved this book!!!

I could have done with a little more convincing on his part. just to make it more realistic. I mean I can understand how the cajuns would easily believe.

His voice kept putting me off and kept me at a distance from the story or maybe I should face the fact that the romance just wasn't that great?The prologue details some nasty business featuring rape, murder and madness that went down in the 1800's. Just when it had my full attention it leaps forward to 2002 and loses me a bit.Declan Fitzgerald is 31 and a successful attorney but his heart isn't in it and he decides to trek across country and purchase a Louisiana mansion with the intent of fixing it up even though he's no carpenter. Yes folks, this is the mansion where the nasty stuff happened. It is soon revealed that Declan had basically left a fiancee at the altar a few months earlier and the thought occurs to me that he's running away from life which doesn't exactly win me over. Almost immediately he starts seeing visions and hearing a baby crying and this intrigues instead of frightens him because, as we're told over and over again, he feels like he is finally exactly where he belongs.His love interest is local bar owner Angelina (call me Lina because I'm no Angel) whose grandmother lives near Declan's property. Lina is independent but soon swoons when Declan is near and begins to help him unravel the secrets of the mansion. She's gorgeous and a good business woman but she was just a bit too distant for me for a large portion of the book. The reasons why were revealed way too late because at that point I had nearly tuned her out.I found the ghostly aspects of this story much more compelling than the modern day romance. It was all rather by the numbers and \\"meh\\" without much emotional connection and the love scenes were a snore. The flashbacks to the past were much more interesting to me and I found myself wishing on more than one occasion that the entire book was set in the past. As the story continues events are revealed to tie in the current day couple to past but it all seemed a little off to me. Not my favorite by Robert's but not the worst book I've ever read either."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I read most of Nora Roberts books but this one is definitely a keeper.

It carried you back to the 1800's.The story of love that is transported through time everlasting.I really enjoyed this book. If you are a Nora Roberts fanthis is the book for you."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This novel scared the stuffing out of me. It was an excellent read which evoked memories of other such houses that I've been in. In terms of plot and characterization, Midnight Bayou has lots of wonderful tension. The significant thing about this novel, IMO, is the amount one empathizes with the fictional situation and characters. One feels the hatred, the horror, the sadness, the revulsion, the longing for a parent/daughter to be better and different, and the disappointment that that person will never be. It's an ineffably sad feeling that that last evokes. The ending of Midnight Bayou didn't appeal to me cuz I'm not a believer in reincarnation (no, I'm not selling out the ending). That I don't believe in reincarnation doesn't affect the credibility of seemingly-reincarnative events which occurred in the novel. Strange things happen in life, especially with the supernatural, and what NR described is a distinct possibility. Midnight Bayou is a great read."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I am a huge fan of Nora Roberts. I was just a little disappointed in this book. There was no real plot to the story.

This is not one of her trilogy books, which I don't read. I chose the book due to it's subject matter, New Oreleans, a southern mansion and the bayou. It contained all the elements of a great book, great characters, romance and mystery!

I strongly recommend it to any Roberts reader!"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I know some felt that this book was not all that great. However, I must strongly disagreee. I picked it up and could not put it down. I finished it in three nights and for a working mom of two with lots of pets to care for that is pretty close to a miracle. Also, I felt her discription of Louisiana was not all that bad. I just finished Interview with a Vampire and her discription was pretty close to Anne Rice's. Great book, great story! I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I've always found Nora Roberts' books to be fun, enjoyable, and great reads, and she doesn't disappoint with this one. The characters are so well written you can hear their speech and accents in your head, and find yourself sympathizing and truly caring about them. Miss Odette and Remy really steal the show with their southern charm and interesting personalities. And the twist that Roberts works into the ghost story this purports to be makes for a great time, and a lot of fun.

The story is simple enough: a guy begins to rehab an old mansion, and he has to deal with the ghosts/ memories that are in the house. This story was well written and intersting with some clever twists, but, never the less, it just doesn't hit right. It isn't a book that stays in your mind, or one that the reader can't put down, but rather an lovely book, that I don't care whether or not I pick it up again.

Having recently broken it off with his fianc&eacute;, he decides to ditch his law career and purchase Manet Hall, an old plantation home near New Orleans. He first visited there when he and his college buddy, Remy, entered the dilapidated mansion years ago. Employing his woodworking skills, Declan starts renovation of the mansion.Not long after he moves in, strange things begin to happen. Doors slam, clocks chime, and a baby cries. With the help of Miss Odette, a neighbor in the bayou, and research in history books, Declan is able to discover that the house has a dark history. Near the turn of the century, Abigail, a young Cajun servant, married Lucian Manet, heir to the estate. Their life together is cut short, when, shortly after the birth of their child, Abigail is discovered missing, and matriarch Josephine implements the rumor that Abigail ran off with a man who later killed her. Brokenhearted, Lucian \\"accidentally\\" drowns, and his twin, Julian, also dies young.When Declan meets Lena, descendant of Abby's daughter Marie Rose, and granddaughter of Odette, he is completely mesmerized. She is the owner of a New Orleans bar and everything he ever wanted in a woman-she's smart, tough, and beautiful. Although the attraction is mutual, Lena guards her heart, as she senses that her feelings for Declan could lead to heartache.Even as the reader is treated to glimpses of the 1899 Manet Hall, Declan begins dreaming of it. Cleverly interspersed with present day events is Declan's ability to feel and sense Abby's distress as he dreams of long-forgotten times. Lena, too, has eerie dreams and encounters of the past, and in an unusual twist, she senses Lucian's thoughts of old. As Declan and Lena face their desire for one another, will fate intervene a second time, and separate the lovers forever?Ms. Roberts' latest is a sure-fire winner. The mysteries of the bayou abound as the ghosts tell the tales of forgotten times. Hauntings seem to increase as the renovations progress, and emotions between Declan and Lena hit an all-time high. Some readers may have trouble with the idea of reincarnation, especially with Abby living in Declan, and Lucian in Lena. However, the wonderful flow of the narrative, rich with fascinating characters, definitely outweighs any aversion to a twist on the paranormal."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"First of all although I really liked the book I had some hang ups My first was that I think Nora was doing a Interracial Romance on the \\"DL\\" (down low)(which will probably not bother anyone who is NOT a minority) she never clearly acknowledges that Lena is African American.... but there are other things throughout the book that leads me (who happens to be African American)to believe that she is. I guess it isn't much of a big deal as it doesn't take away from the storyline nor the plot, but their are other instances where she clearly writes in her book that someone was black yet when it comes to the leading heroine character she doesn't............ almost as if she doesn't want to acknowledge it??? I always wondered why no one had ever wrote a Romance Novel about a Slave owner and a Servant that come together in another time when their love (and subsequent Marriage) wouldn't be forbidden. Don't get me wrong Lucien was NOT a Slave owner the story that is thread to the present day one, takes place after the abolishment of slavery so Abigail is a servant NOT a Slave. My second \\"hang-up\\" was that on the Paperback copy it does not have much of a plot description on the book, so I had to come here (Amazon) to even find out what it was about.WHATEVER on to my review.LOVED THE STORY. If you enjoy a good Ghost story you will run through the pages fairly quickly. I don't want to give any spoilers in this review but Nora threads the glimpses from the Past into this book periodically for the reader to understand what was going on between Lucian and Abigail. I do agree with another reviewer that stated that there are some loose ends that aren't wrapped up to my satisfaction, but I leave that for the individual reader to find and decide on his or her own.Overall the book has some Humor which had me laughing out loud (towards the end), a fair amount of Suspense and the characters are ok (though no of them will stand out in my memory) Anyone that likes Nora probably will not be dissapointed in this book. I do however recommend if the reader likes books about reincarnation to try {Susanna Kearsley's} \\"Mariana\\" excellent story of two people finding one another in a different lifetime, or if you like Contemporary Romance with a Interracial Love from the past woven in try {Ruth Wind} \\"In the Midnight Rain\\" or \\"Stone Flower Garden\\" by Deborah Smith all of the books that I have recommended have a unsuspected twist at the end as with Midnight Bayou.Respectfully Reviewed"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I almost always give a book a three star rating even when I think it is really bad. I guess I just think that all books deserve at least that. So, when I gave this one a one star rating (and I would have given it a zero if possible) you know I really disliked it. I don't mind the reincarnation aspect but the gender change just totally ruined the entire book for me and badly enough to give it a one star. I love all of this author's other books and have most of them. The last few have been on a downhill slide. I just hope this trend doesn't continue for her. Like the others that were disappointed in this book, I know I will be checking her book jackets for the scoop before I buy another one of her books."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I am a huge Nora Roberts fan. I think I own practically every book she has written and have loved almost all of them. However, I found this book to be a HUGE disappointment.

This follows her rather annoying second in a series paperback book about the 3 witches. I do hope this isn't a trend for her, because one more of this vein and I won't be buying her books again."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"My first question is... How on earth did this woman get published? This book started out great and I was excited to see the story unfold. As I kept reading, I got more and more frustrated. My friend was reading one of her series and told me that the men in those books were all pizza eating, beer drinking card board cut outs too. Declan got on my nerves.Then the big twist, which I won't spoil if someone is desperate enough to read this, made me shake my head and scoff. Its hard for me to leave books unfinished, so I kept with this one until the very last page... Then I wondered why I had just wasted so much of my life, when I could have been reading something worth my time. Maybe because I hate romance novels, I can't stand Nora Roberts.

After years of my sibling telling me I should check her out, I finally wore down and picked up this book.I must admit, after all the apprehension and hee hawing I begrudgily admit she is a very good author.&quot;Midnight Bayou&quot; is a great read. The beginning itself can reel one in like a fish on a line. (This reader was enraged right then.) Nora Roberts paints her characters colorfully, and artfully. Making them more than just paper creations, which has them sliding into the realms of reality.The twists involved, albeit a slight tad predictable doesn't take much away from this novel at all.An excellent book reincarnation, action, steamy romance, a wonderful setting. How can one go wrong?!"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Nora Roberts brings her characters to life in this romantic and haunting tale of the sizzling South. Declan Fitzgerald leaves his fiance, family and law practice in Boston to fulfill his dream of refurbishing Manet Hall in New Orleans. Upon moving in, Declan discovers he's not the only inhabitant in his beloved and mysterious Southern mansion. A dedicated and determined man ready to confront anyone or anything to keep his dream alive, Declan finds his biggest challenge in Angelina Simone who holds the key to his future."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Suspend your disbelief in ghostly magic and relax into this warm and funny exploration of relationships. NR cuts back to 1899 and forward to the present to weave a story of love, jealousy, revenge, hope and, well, remodeling.Declan Fitzgerald, Boston blueblood, was always drawn to the Manet house, a post-Bellum mansion with a dark history now fallen into decline. He leaves his law practice, buys the house and moves to New Orleans, planning to refurbish the house. Declan broke his engagement to the perfect society wife just days before the wedding, much to the dismay of his family. He's leaving town to decide what he wants to do for the rest of his life; it's certainly not to practice law and be married to the perfect woman. Declan's old friend Remy, a New Orleans attorney, provides a delightful side story with his own engagement and approaching marriage. The scene at the bachelor party is a scream!Lena is descended from a daughter born 100 years ago on the wrong side of the blanket to a Manet relative. (Or was she legitimate?) Lena is a fiercely independent, feisty young woman who owns a bar in the French Quarter. Her grandmama, Miss Odette, still lives in a house not far from the Manet mansion, making Lena's meeting Declan inevitable, even if Lena weren't cousin to Remy. Declan's meeting with Lena in her bar is a funny, funny scene. And they just get better.Declan pursues Lena with cheerful relentlessness, while Lena edges warily around the growing bond between them. How she can resist Declan the reader can't figure because NR has created such a charming, funny and intelligent man in Declan that no woman in her right mind could resist him for long. He is completely endearing, knows just the thing to say in any situation, and sweeps Miss Odette right off her feet. Lena, of course, eventually falls in line. It's Nora Roberts, after all.Did we mention ghosts? Declan and Lena, and we're pretty sure, Lena's nasty mother and Remy's sweet fiancee, might be reincarnations of the people who now haunt the house: people who should have been exposed for their evil deeds 100 years ago; people whose stories need to be told; people who need to forgive each other. NR could have spent more time resolving the past with the present in the last couple of chapters, it would have made the book more satisfying, but it's such a fun story it's well worth reading for this tiny criticism. Enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"While there is nothing particularly new about the basics of the story here, this is an interesting mystery/ghost story with likeable characters. I sometimes get tired of wealthy heros who don't have to worry about money and have the money and time to court prickly women who have a lot of baggage, but this may be a personal thing. I liked a lot of the supporting, minor characters in this novel a lot.(This has a kind of neat reincanation theme, for those who are interested in that!)"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This is not the type of book I would ordinarily read but I like Nora Roberts so thought I would give it a try.

Lena just got to be annoying. Declan was just pathetic. I couldn't get into the last half of the book and found myself flipping through the pages just to finish it.

I was a big fan of Declan, one of the two main characters in the book. However, I was not a fan of Lena, which was his love interest in the book. He proved his love for her through the book over and over again. She on the other hand proved just the opposite. She played so hard to get to the point where I was hoping he would just let her go and move on to someone else that would return his love. Even by then end of the book I did not feel that Lena had any real feelings towards him and definitely not love. The story was good and believable but there was compassion and real love missing from Lena which made the ending lack. He once again gave into her and asked her to stay when she was more than ready to walk out and give up."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I've been reading Nora for years now, and I always like her books, this one is no exception. I liked it a lot and I would recommend it, it just wasn't great. However, it just seemed like she wasn't fully engaged while she was writing this one. I could fully connect with Declan, but I had a hard time feeling like I really knew Lena. I found myslef drawn more to Remy and his fiance than to Lena. Also, the thing with Lena's key was just lame. Overall, a good read, fast paced and interesting."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"A very different book from Nora Roberts. If you're expecting something along the lines of Caronlina Moon or Sanctuary, be prepared. Midnight Bayou fits much better in the &quot;Romance&quot; genre than the &quot;Romantic Suspense&quot; genre. Roberts also delves much deeper into the paranormal in this book than before.But if you want a good romance with entertaining, catchy dialogue, this book is for you. And if you like a few ghosts pitched in for good measure, this is a must read. While very different from her other books, it has the heart, heat and laughter that make Roberts' books great."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Midnight Bayou is a better book than The Villa. The characters are more believable and easier to empathize with. Even the minor characters are great -- I'd like to see a story about Remy and Effie. But as Nora Roberts did in The Villa, she cheats at the ending. Throughout the book, she has indicated the presence of malevolent ghosts, even to the point of having a minor character assume the features of the evil mother-in-law ghost. But the mother-in-law ghost and the murderer are never resolved -- the resolution of the two main characters' ghosts had to suffice."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I am a faithful fan of Nora Roberts, but found this novel severely lacking in depth and believability. Paranormal elements seem to run through many of her novels, as do men and women with Irish backgrounds, but it's getting old already. Simple things in the story (like the ruby/diamond ring) were left unfinished, and the ending was completely rushed and phony. Plus, are we really supposed to believe that an Ivy-league lawyer doesn't speak in complete sentences? The characters' thoughts were fragmented, as was the writing, and it's disappointing to watch Nora Roberts sacrifice quality for quantity these days. Midnight Bayou is still enjoyable, but is not Roberts at her creative best."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Do you believe in fate? Anyone who reads romance has to believe in fate. This has to be some of the best work from Nora Roberts. Any fan of hers knows she just gets better and better. This story is as timeless and stirring as any great love should be. Full of classic, unparralled Nora Roberts humor, snappy wit and mule-headed stubburness, I was rolling with laughter, even when my belly clenched and my heart wept with empathy for the stark suffering, sorrow and injustice that ties the whole tale togeather in a cicle of life and love that never dies, never ends.Set outside sultry New Orleans, the story begins on New Year's eve in !899. A moment of whimsey, pure innocence and the fickle, inexplainable and sometimes cruel hand of destiny.Fast forward a hundred years and enter the hero, Declan Fitzgerld. He takes destiny by the short hairs, as any self respecting hero must, and takes the steps to sieze life in his own two hands rather than settle for anything less. From Boston, our Irish hero buys an old estate in the bayou's of Louisiana, and swiftly comes to realize he found something alot more than he bargined for.His house is haunted, sitting in wait for him, with much more than unsettled ghosts and mystery to be discovered. There's fate, destiny, all those inexplainable things that somehow shape and manipulate life. A man who wants to discover his true self, to be that self, a house that is very much a part of him, and, of course, the one woman in the world who can make him whole.Don't wait for the paperback or the library copy. Get this book, take it home, curl up with it and let it take you away on a wonderful story of timing, destiny and a love that can never die. This is definant keeper, a timless lovestory and something for any romantic to savor. Humor, mystery, passion, love. Don't miss out."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I'm a huge Nora Roberts fan and buy her books just because she wrote then and this was no exception but after reading it in one sitting I was dissapointed in the ending. The book had you hanging on and turning the pages as fast as you could but she ended it with a prectable ending and too quickly. Not enough meat to the ending. If your a Nora Roberts fan you'll enjoy it but she has written better books than this one. If you've never read Nora Roberts, don't start with this book, read &quot;The Villa&quot; instead. It is a much better read."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Bored, burned out, yuppie lawyer Declan Fitzgerald quits his cushy life in Boston and purchases a decrepit mansion outside New Orleans. He saw the place while in college and has dreamt of restoring it for years. Of course, the house is not just fashioned of wood and plaster...it has many stories to tell...and ghosts to tell them.Declan hooks up with a mysterious local woman with stories of her own. Together they try to unravel the mysteries of Manet Hall and finally put the ghosts to rest.I liked the characters and the way the stories from the past ran concurrently with the present, but I figured out the 'twist' too early.I'm not sure where Ms. Roberts grew up, but I can almost bet it was not Louisiana. Writers find the bayous and their surroundings full of possible plot lines, but unless they've lived there (or have a research assistant who did), their work usually leaves me a little disappointed. However, I continue to buy their books hoping &quot;This one will have gotten it right&quot;. I'm almost always disappointed.Leave Louisiana stories to the natives who have grown up with Spanish moss, bayous, rich roux, wonderful oral traditions, and just a touch of magic.

I also am a long time reader (mid 1980's)and have been uncomfortable with the turn her novels have taken lately, Fairie Tales, Ghosts, Reincarnation etc. I thought the beginning of this story held great promise, I would have liked more on the earlier couple. I also felt the ending was very unresolved. Even though I enjoyed the dialogue (Nora's best talent)between Declan and Rena, I felt he was a bit too good to be true. After reading The Villa which I felt to be Nora's worst novel in years, I had high hopes for this one. After all that complaining, I still think it was an enjoyable read, just not up to the high standards she has set for herself."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Declan Fitzgerald his given up his life as a lawyer to rebuild a dilapidated mansion in New Orleans, but what he doesn't know is that this house has a life of it's own, and a story to tell.Once he moves in and begins his repairs, Declan will start to hear voices, feel a strange presence in the rooms, doors and windows will open and shut, and a baby's cries will be heard in the nursery. Can the long hours put in while doing the renovation be taking it's toll on him, or is there some truth to the local rumors of the house being haunted?The further the renovations come along, the stronger the strange occurrences are, and soon Declan begins to feel terror and grief for a crime committed a century ago.With no one else to turn to, Declan opens up to his beautiful neighbor Lena Simone, for she is the one person he can trust, as she too has a strange connection to the house.As the couple become deeper involved they are faced with the battle of uncovering a dark secret, before either of them can think about a future together.\`Midnight Bayou' is a well told story, and the haunted mansion is a great setting, but the plot abandons it's suspenseful roots to become an overly dramatic romance. Where the ghost theme could have been a nice touch, it's actually a gimmick in a sappy romantic plot twist. Fans of Nora Roberts's thrillers will be disappointed, as it appears she is heading back to writing romance novels, and while she remains a good storyteller, she hasn't written a straight ahead THRILLER since \`River's End'.Even though it's not a bad novel, \`Midnight Bayou' is not one I would recommend to many people, unless they were looking for a paranormal romance.Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"You need to shake it well, it can be too runny if you don't then itthickens up.

Than I could not put it down. I would read when ever I could. I just had to get to the ending...than poof. It fizzled. It seemed Mrs.Roberts was tired of writting the book than just ended it abruptly. It was like reading the end of a Harlequin Romance. The obligated chapters were set in place. Time to emd it and send it in.I did indeed love the story. But the ending was rather abrupt. I felt it left loose ends."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Bored, burned out, yuppie lawyer Declan Fitzgerald quits his cushy life in Boston and purchases a decrepit mansion outside New Orleans. He saw the place while in college and has dreamt of restoring it for years. Of course, the house is not just fashioned of wood and plaster...it has many stories to tell...and ghosts to tell them.Declan hooks up with a mysterious local woman with stories of her own. Together they try to unravel the mysteries of Manet Hall and finally put the ghosts to rest.I liked the characters and the way the stories from the past ran concurrently with the present, but I figured out the 'twist' too early.I'm not sure where Ms. Roberts grew up, but I can almost bet it was not Louisiana. Writers find the bayous and their surroundings full of possible plot lines, but unless they've lived there (or have a research assistant who did), their work usually leaves me a little disappointed. I continue to buy their books hoping THIS ONE will have gotten it right. I'm almost always disappointed.Leave Louisiana stories to the natives who have grown up with Spanish moss, bayous, rich oral traditions, and just a touch of magic. They're the ones who can weave a spell just by saying: &quot;Cherie, have you heard the story about that crazy Yankee lawyer who finally solved the mystery of Manet Hall? No? Well, just sit yourself down and let me tell you .....&quot;"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This book was great. I didn't think I was going to like it after reading the prologue. Once you begin this book clear your day and be ready to get sucked in. This book takes place in the bayou outside of New Orleans in a haunted mansion. The leading man, Declan, has given up a successful law practice in Boston and has re-located to the bayou to re-construct a mansion that he felt a pull from during his early college years. Then he is met by the sexy Angelina. You feel their fire for eachother as soon as the pages introduce their two characters. He is living in a haunted mansion and refuses to leave. This novel had romance, suspense, and drama. I really enjoyed this book, if your'e a Nora Roberts fan, you will not be let down. After reading this I know that it is a book that I will re-read in the future."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I thought &quot;Midnight Bayou&quot; was fantastic. I could not put it down and finished it in less than a day. Honestly, I can't understand how the people who gave mediocre or negative reviews of this book can have been reading the same book. This book has shot straight to the top of my list of Nora Roberts favorites - it is SO good.I found the story completely and utterly captivating. Declan Fitzgerald has been obsessed with Manet Hall in New Orleans for 11 years. When he hears it has come up for sale, he buys it right away and leaves his job, fianc&eacute;, and family behind in Boston to move in and restore the hall to its former grandeur. Declan soon discovers that he is not alone in Manet Hall, as several ghostly presences make themselves known. Declan has strange visions and feelings of complete terror associated with certain rooms. Declan also meets Lena Simone, a stunningly beautiful, and fiercely independent bar owner. The attraction is instant and mutual. But there's something more than that, a kind of recognition deep inside. The relationship that develops betweeen these two was wonderfully written and very real.The flashbacks to the past, and the story of the doomed love of Abigail and Lucian, are a wonderful and heartbreaking addition to this story. The history adds to the main storyline, rather than confusing it or detracting from it. Some of these sections had me in tears.The supporting characters are all wonderfully written. For example, Miss Odette, Lena's grandmother is a lovable and colourful character. And Lilibeth, Lena's mother, is so vile and amoral she makes your skin crawl.But it's the story of Lena and Declan that kept me turning pages. In order for these two to find happiness with each other, they must uncover the horrible events that took place a hundred years ago and come to terms with them. Until they do that there is no chance for Declan and Lena, but what they uncover may tear them apart!I could go on forever about how much I love this book, but instead of doing that I'll simply suggest that you read it yourself, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Midnight Bayou is one of Nora's best yet. As usual in this book there is a wonderful mix of love and mystery. It is full of little hidden surprises. Not to mention the love scenes! She describes everything so clearly that you can actually picture Manet Hall and all the people who are or once were in it. Reading this book made me want to run to New Orleans to see if a place such as this truly existed. Some might say it is unbelievable. This book will truly test your imagination. Just when you think you have it figured out, something that was once unknown makes itself known. I highly reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Midnight Bayou is one of Nora's best yet. As usual in this book there is a wonderful mix of love and mystery.

I just didn't like the how the reincarnation part included a gender change. This book did have good dialogue and some good scenes, so I gave it three stars."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I wish I could sound as enthusiastic about Midnight Bayou as the editorial reviews, but this book let me down. I've been one of NR's greatest fans to enjoy the first novels she wrote in the 80s. I've always admired the woman's talent. However, this book just simply left me feeling drugged out. Declan Fitzgerald is the rich Boston lawyer who cancels his wedding three weeks before it is to occur, quits his legal profession and heads to New Orleans to renovate the Manet Hall he has purchased. The story moves from renovating description, to flashbacks for the ghosts of Manet Hall, to Declan going to the bar where he's trying to make time with his neighbor's granddaughter, Angelina Simone. He falls in love with Angelina, chases her until she can't resist him any longer and then they have great sex. Even the sex scenes which Roberts can usually shine at describing doesn't sound like her at all. I think the fact Declan is supposed to be the reincarnation of Abigail from 100 years before just ruined his masculinity and turned me off. There was no excitement in this story whatsoever. I personally thought the author lost sense of her Catholic upbringing when she had Angelina going to have dinner with Declan on Ash Wednesday to indulge in a steak dinner. Eating steak on Ash Wednesday is a no-no. IF Roberts wrote this book, she should have gotten it right. Three characters, Declan, Angelina and Remy showed wit and humor. I liked their dialogue in the book and that's why I gave it three stars. I think this book makes about 164 novels published in about 20 years for Roberts and I'm beginning to have my thoughts about this too."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"This was one of THE WORST books that I have read all year. It had got my attention because of my love of New Orleans and period piece books, but this was just awful. The first seven pages had me in disbelief that a well known author could write something soawful. It was like she woke up and decided to write about southern plantation life and reincarnation-without doing any research. Everything was so obvious in the first chapter, she included the typical idea of people of the south are usually portrayed; with balls and slaves! I wouldn't recommend this book, if you want to read a romace stick to Daniel Steel!"},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"I love all the Nora Roberts books, and this story is excellent, it has romance intertwined with rejuvenating an old mansion, while an old murder mystery comes to life to be solved.

I'd highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Loved this book. Fast read. You will fall in live with the characters. Nora writes with wit and makes it impossible to put her books down."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"REVIEWER'S OPINION (WITH MILD SPOILERS):I purchased this book because it had been made into a TV movie. I was disappointed. I was expecting more. I've liked some of her other books much better. Another reviewer stated \\"The rebirth and reincarnation of characters was just too far out in left field for me.\\" That didn't bother me, reincarnation stories can be good. My problem was the modern day characters were not interesting. Declan sees a run down mansion. He falls in love with it, buys it and begins to restore it even though he is aware of ghosts' activities. Declan sees Lena and immediately falls in love with her and tells her so repeatedly throughout the rest of the book. Lena doesn't want to fall in love and tries to keep her heart safe from Declan. Lena's grandmother and mother were interesting side characters, but most of the book was watching Declan spend his money and energies on the house and Lena. It didn't do much for me. Although, at the end of the book we learn some interesting twists and connections with ghosts from 100 years earlier.STORY BRIEF (excerpted from Publishers Weekly review):Declan is a Harvard-educated Boston lawyer from a wealthy family. On the eve of his wedding, Declan leaves Boston, the law and his fiance, buys a dilapidated New Orleans mansion (Manet Hall) and embarks on a mission to restore it with his own sweat, blood and money. But Manet Hall comes with a dark history, and restoring it means uncovering its past, which includes rape, murder and betrayal. He often hears a baby crying and voices, particularly that of Abigail Manet, the baby's mother, who lived in the hall 100 years earlier.DATA:Story length: 338 pages. Swearing language: strong. Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: 4 (includes a rape scene). Total number of sex scene pages: 11. Setting New Orleans area 1899, 1900 and 2002. Genre: contemporary fantasy romance.OTHER BOOKS:For a listing of my reviews of other Nora Roberts and J.D. Robb books, see my 4.5 star review of \\"Angels Fall\\" posted on 6-30-08."},{"Title":"Midnight Bayou","review":"Not my favorite, but the house was intriguing as well as the relationships made. Not my typical mystery read but Nora has a way to keep you involved and you always want to flip the page!"},{"Title":"The Laws of Indo-European (Current Issues in Linguistic Theory)","review":"N.E. Collinge's THE LAWS OF INDO-EUROPEAN sets out all the important rules of sound change that any student of comparative Indo-European linguistics should acquaint themselves with. Grimm's law, Grassman's law, the law of the palatals, they're all here. Besides the general laws affecting the major Indo-European languages (Germanic, Sanskrit, and Greek), Collinge also addresses the laws of the Baltic and Slavonic accents. This field is a mess, and it seems that most of the laws covered in the book somehow relate to the accent. An appendix covers minor laws (although some, such as Watkin's Law, have become major in their ramifications) and major tendencies.One major downside to Collinge's presentation is that he fails to give a simple algebraic form of each law suitable for making flashcards. Another complaint, somewhat frequent in the academy, is that Collinge is so attentive in presenting seeming exceptions that he makes certain well-fixed laws appear as if they are undependable when in fact few would dispute them."},{"Title":"Full Circle","review":"Very well written. Fast informative read. Gives great insight into a wonderful person and her world of music."},{"Title":"Sewing Shut My Eyes (Black Ice Books.)","review":"This is a fun and fantastic romp through the recent short fiction by Olsen. Much more adventurous than his novels, these short works really seem to examine the ideas and techniques he pushes in his various criticisms and writing guide books.The stories cover both character focused and idea focused stories, and all have a tighly wound wit and fun sense of language play. All reside in the realm of the fantastic in one form or another, but those familiar with his other works won't be surprised by this. What is surprising is the haunting, thoughtful quality that the stories seem imbued with. No matter how bizarre the situations or characters, they all sit deftly within their own logic and have much to say about how and why we live.The collages created with his wife are fun and contain some interesting ideas, but in many ways seem to be a hipped up, hyped up derivation of Barthelme's own collage work from the '60's with a sense of almost trying too hard to be purposefully clever."},{"Title":"Sewing Shut My Eyes (Black Ice Books.)","review":"Olsen's stories are hilarious, frightening and a challenge to read. He constructs his sentences the same way 5000 sweating serfs and artisans constructed Notre Dame, slowly and painfully. He never loses control of his prose though, and his characters are both entirely alienated but still very warm. Pop culture mavens, freakish dwarven millionaires, trailer park trash and supermodels all have a role to play in these shorts. There are several collages of photos, clip arts and words as well, and these pieces by Olsen and Andi Olsen (his wife?)are, if anything, more disturbing and more heartwarming (yes, at the same time!) than the short stories. Unlike the postmodernists, Olsen knows that merely being human doesn't necessarily lead to alienation, despair and ignorance. Even the lowest of us have something to offer ourselves and the world."},{"Title":"A treatise on the cavalry and saddle horse: With remarks on racing and leaping, observations on breeding, &c.; &c.; &c;","review":"While the subject matter of this book is interesting and, to some degree, useful, the fomatting of this text is so bad as to be barely readable.

Well worth the read.The concept is exceptional--tour players describing their own greatest shots and the greatest shots they have seen in their own words--and the cooperation of some of golf's greatest appears to be remarkable.Those descriptions that were written by hand on personal note cards or stationary were especially interesting. Frankly, even the logos of some of the typed responses were interesting. (All responses are presented exactly as sent or presented to the editors which adds much to the book.)All in all, a good book, a good read.

The novel utilizes Kazantzakis'graceful style to add even more magic to this fantastic myth. In the beginning, a young traveler is found surveying the grounds of the Palace of Knossos, raising suspicions with security guards and catching the eye of the young princess Ariadne. The young traveller turns out to be Theseus, a prince who desires to free his people from the tyranical King. Included is the infamous minotaur and many greek gods. This novel remains interesting and exciting all throughout the story, and can be recommended to any age group. END"},{"Title":"At the Palaces of Knossos: A Novel","review":"How do you write a &quot;children's&quot; book that will hold readers' interest 50, 100 years from now? James Barrie, Francis Hodgson Burnett, and Terry Pratchett have. So has Nikos Kazantzakis.This book is a gem, and deserves much wider recognition.Mythology is usually presented, even in the much-lauded D'Aulaire series, as little more than a plot line. Here, the familiar story of Theseus and the Minotaur is enriched with well-developed characters. My favorite is Princess Ariadne: as imperious, sensitive, and curious as Elizabeth Tudor in her youth. Kazantzakis describes the splendors of the Minoan city-palace as lushly as one can infer from the historical artifacts that have been unearthed, then he enriches the picture with details of folkways that still exist today in Greece.What raises this book from the merely entertaining to the classic is the author's dedication to his real mission: to impart the great truths of the world to his young readers. In the Palaces of Knossos, we learn a little about the nature of despotism, and how to test the long-term viability of a civilization beyond the veneer of its present power and wealth.Teachers and parents, read this wonderful book, and be awed and entertained yourself before you read it to your kids. While you're at it, bring out a book like BBC's Civilizations by Jane McIntosh and Clint Twist so your charges can see the strange and beautiful paintings from the palace of Knossos of bull-leaping youths, the bronze dagger that Theseus himself might have carried, and one of the odd little iconic statues of the Great Goddess worshipped throughout ancient Crete."},{"Title":"At the Palaces of Knossos: A Novel","review":"See comment to review of \\"camisdad\\" above -as someone who first read this book as a child, and a passionate lover of Greek mythology, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"At the Palaces of Knossos: A Novel","review":"\\"At the palaces of Knossos\\" is a far cry from Nikos Kazantzakis' rich and exuberant style, which is unrecognizable in this book.The prose is poor and stilted, to the degree that you have to wonder if a ghost writer was used for this story. The message is truly simple-minded, opposing the \\"decadent\\" Minoans and the \\"youthful\\" Athenians in such a black-and-white manner that you feel ashamed for the writer. As for the atmosphere, it feels like a modern story, and does nothing to try and describe what the Minoan civilization must have been.The research is atrocious, full of anachronisms and errors. A couple of examples:- in the book, Phaedra is Ariadne's older sister. Phaedra really is the younger sister;- in the book, young Theseus gives a gift of a cup engraved with an image of Odysseus. In actuality (if he really did exist), Odysseus came in a generation later than Theseus and would not have been born then.I could go on for a long time. I bought this book to give my pre-teenage son good reading material before visiting Crete. After reading it, I am tossing it and giving my son \\"The king must die\\", by Mary Renault, an infinitely better book on the topic.In conclusion: avoid this book at all costs. It would be a disservice to give this book to a young reader, as it will foster wrong information and impressions about the times."},{"Title":"Basic 35mm Photo Guide: For Beginning Photographers","review":"This book was originally released awhile ago and I just flipped through it again recently to check out their &quot;5th Edition.&quot; The content's been updated in the book, even if the pictures haven't, and it still gives you all you need to know to start taking pictures with the average manual camera.It looks like all of the pictures dealing with equipment have been updated, even if the demonstration ones haven't. So, all of the equipment is current and the information is still valid. There's nothing on digital in there, but I think that would dilute the idea of the book.The whole point is to have a very stripped down book on taking pictures with 35mm film.

The book is quick and to the point, not mincing any words or going into much detail in any of the topics. It covers the basics of camera operation, illustrating the concepts of depth of field and shutter speed (and it's balance with aperture) quickly but clearly, using photographs to demonstrate them all. You can probably sit down and read the book in a half hour or so, but you'll walk away understanding what you need to in order to start experimenting and learning through experience.If you've done any 35mm photography before, this isn't the book for you, it will be much too basic and there aren't any great insights to be learned from it. It is aimed squarely at beginners and shines as a quick tutorial.I once read that photography is more about getting out and doing it than having 'talent' or even 'technical skills', I'd agree, and would recommend this book as the shortest route to get shooting."},{"Title":"Basic 35mm Photo Guide: For Beginning Photographers","review":"I teach basic and color photography.

This book does that, as well as having photos that address loading the film, types of lenses, light, and use of flash. Yes, there are people out there that don't know how to load film. Although modern cameras may have electronic gizmos to deal with aperture and shutter speed, this book helps the understanding of how everything works, as all cameras do the same thing."},{"Title":"Basic 35mm Photo Guide: For Beginning Photographers","review":"This book is an excellent resource for anyone wanting to know more about taking pictures with their 35mm camera. I disagree with the other reviewer -- this book takes you way past the owner's manual and gives clear, concise, step by step instructions. It gives great pointers on lighting, composition, focusing -- every facet of shooting a picture is covered and wonderfully illustrated.I recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Basic 35mm Photo Guide: For Beginning Photographers","review":"I started here and couldn't be more thankful. First, I must concede that to find any value in this book, you pretty much have to be totally ignorant about 35mm photography. However, if you are (like I was), it is EXACTLY what you need. To me, an absolute novice photographer is someone who has never shot a photograph using a camera other than a simple &quot;point and shoot&quot; model. You know you're this type of person if someone has ever asked you to take a photo for them with a non-point &amp; shoot (e.g. a 35mm SLR) and you panicked because you didn't know how or didn't think you could. If this example doesn't suffice, then ask yourself this question: Do you know what &quot;SLR&quot; stands for and what it means? If not, then you need this book.All told, this book is something like 112 pages long. However, I was able to read it in about 30 minutes. The reason is because the author gives you only the absolute basics you need in three or four sentences per page, with one or two visually explanatory accompanying photos. As such, it's PERFECT for explaining (and demonstrating) the nuts and bolts that you absolutely must know if you want to step up into a camera in which you have some control over the camera functions.Beyond that, you will admittedly learn little. However, what little you learn is absolutely essential. I recommend buying it too (rather than just reading it in a library, for example) because I still refer back to this book every now and then to make sure I'm correctly understanding the more advanced techniques I'm trying to learn in other books. I can't say enough about this book. If you want a small compact easy-to-read introduction to the bare basics of 35mm cameras and photography, this is the one and only book you will need. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Basic 35mm Photo Guide: For Beginning Photographers","review":"First- the Positive: The book has very good pictures that helped to illustrate the points the author was trying to make. It is very basic. If you have never done anything with photography, this is a good book. It helps explain some concepts in very easy to understand terms.Next- The Negative: This book is VERY BASIC. If you read your owners manual that comes with the camera, much of what is in this book is covered in the owners manual.I bought this book after I read my owners manual and took a simple photography course at the local college (non-credit for fun course!) This book was much more basic than I wanted. I found that I learned very little from this book because I had read the owners manual of my camera. However, I can see how this book might be helpful to a very beginner."},{"Title":"Basic 35mm Photo Guide: For Beginning Photographers","review":"Although the book was revised and updated in 1997, the pictures and cameras used in the book are 1970's style. They have added just a couple of updates with new camera technology. You'd be better off just sticking with your camera's manual. For example, 10% of book talks about loading and unloading film. Most beginners even know how to do that!"},{"Title":"Basic 35mm Photo Guide: For Beginning Photographers","review":"If you know nothing about 35mm photography; if you have never held a 35mm SLR in your hands; if you need the low down on &quot;how to&quot; in the simplest form, then this may be the book for you. Otherwise, skip it--&quot;basic&quot; is an understatement. I gave my copy to a needier friend. Nat'l Geographic's &quot;how-to&quot; and the Kodak guide to 35mm photography (although both on the heavy side) are better choices and are both packed full of more advanced information (and exciting color photos)for down the road."},{"Title":"Basic 35mm Photo Guide: For Beginning Photographers","review":"This book is easy to understand and gets to the point. I have read other books on the subject that are lengthy and boring."},{"Title":"Basic 35mm Photo Guide: For Beginning Photographers","review":"I purchased this book on based on the numerous favorable reviews on how useful folks had found it, even those who had some photography experience, albiet minor. I thought I was in that same class, being someone who's had his 35mm SLR for a couple of years but only just did quick point and shoot stuff with it, never really using it to its capacity. If you are one of those people, avoid this book. I already know how to load and unload my film, I've figured out what film works best in my camera and for what situation and I've definately learned how to hold my camera. Unless you went out and bought your first camera just before reading this review I wouldn't bother with this book. Even then I'd be wary, you could probably pick up most of the techniques discuss just by using your camera, and I'm a firm believer in on the job training, though it can get expensive on the film. To sum up, use your camera, become familiar with it and then to refine your technique pick check out something other than this book."},{"Title":"Seduction (Arabesque)","review":"Ms Mason, brought so many different possibliites into Seduction, I was clueless about who the witness was, the only person I figured out was Margaret. I didn't understand why CJ was so secretive about her identify. It wasn't like she was hiding, she just needed to get away from her lifestyle, and I wondered why Wes didn't give CJ the benefit of the doubt, especially knowing all of her addictions, and hear her explanation. All in all I enjoyed this book immensely. Nice way to pass a quite afternoon. I'm definitely going to read more by Felicia M."},{"Title":"Seduction (Arabesque)","review":"Felicia Mason does it again!! This book kept your interest all the way to the end.

Very enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Seduction (Arabesque)","review":"Ok , this book is named after what it exactly is, true seduction, on both CJ and Wes 's part! Wes was there to do a job, by any means necessary, and a seduction seemed perfect. CJ on the other hand, had other things on her mind as well. CJ herself has had many a men. Trying to to make a change in her life, but one look and she just had to have Wes. Even though it only started out just a seduction for both Wes and CJ, but love crept in somewhere and surpriased the both of them.

Imaginative and vivid descriptions. I particularly liked the humour and the unexpected nature of travelling in such an area. Many interesting books come out of India, and they are not that well known to us in the western countries."},{"Title":"The Grand Trunk Road: From the front seat","review":"I purchased this book because of its eye catching title but was disappointed after reading a few pages. I was also under the impression that the writer will describe in detail the famous GT road and his experiences while traveling on it. Instead there is more about famous cities of the sub continent and that too written weakly. There are numerous other books written very well. Don't get confused with the title."},{"Title":"The Grand Trunk Road: From the front seat","review":"If one prefers good travel writing, skip this book.One of the most boring travelogues I have ever had the misfortune to read. Mr. Bach starts with good intentions, but then loses the whole plot. Is travel writng only about ones travelling or should it carry a bit of history of the place, of one's thoughts. Mr Bach could do well to read Paul Theroux, Alexander Frater and all before he writes another book. Its good to be a India lover, but thats all that there is to Mr Bach."},{"Title":"The life of one pioneer family","review":"First, I must admit, I am related to the author of this book so I will leave the objective sincerity up to the reader. She is my first cousin once-removed. However, I loved the book and, in reading it, I learned an appreciation for the people who worked so hard and just accepted that hard work was necessary for survival. I, especially, enjoyed it because it took place in locations I have personally visited and knew the main character who was my great aunt. I would recommend it for anyone who would like to know the truth about the difficulties they faced."},{"Title":"Louisa May Alcott: Her life, letters, and journals","review":"Louisa May Alcott, when speaking of herself, writes with humility and grace. Her words are always wise and quietly moving. Her story is rich and engaging. This is an awesome inside view to an amazing woman and author."},{"Title":"Louisa May Alcott: Her life, letters, and journals","review":"Compiled and edited in 1889 by Ednah Cheney, this book offers an interesting look into the life of Louisa May Alcott. Cheney intersperses the letters and journal entries with some biographical information. The Alcotts were very poor and lived off the money Louisa made from her writing; Alcott keeps track of how much money she gets for each story, even after the success of \\"Little Women\\". Unfortunately, the amount of time she spent writing (up to 14 hours a day), plus the illness she caught after nursing civil war soldiers took a toll on her and many of her letters, plus many of the journal entries mention her various illnesses and describe how she had to take morphine to help her sleep.Fans of \\"Little Women\\" will be most interested in the segments regarding that book and may be surprised to find out that Alcott thought the book was boring. It's hard to believe she really meant that because it's clear from her letters and journal entries how very biographical \\"Little Women\\" is. In fact, Alcott's journal description of Beth's death in real life is used almost word for word in the book. Other elements in \\"Little Women\\" are fiction (there was, alas, no real life Professor Bhaer and Alcott included him against her better judgement - she would have preferred Jo remain single, as Alcott herself did) and Teddy was based on a Polish acquaintance, not a next door neighbor. However, the four sisters are based on Louisa and her sisters and the journal entries and letters make you realize how perfectly she caught them on paper.This is an interesting book about not only a fascinating woman but also a fascinating family. The Alcotts' friends included the Emersons, the Thoreaus and the Hawthornes, all whose influences helped shape Louisa May Alcott's writings. Despite her success, her life was not an easy one and was often filled with sorrow. Yet, despite her sorrow and illnesses, Louise May Alcott's works enchanted children then and now."},{"Title":"Fools Gold","review":"Description from the book back cover:Fool's Gold is a grittily authentic adventure set deep in the Canadian woods. In his fourth outing, Vietnam Veteran Reid Bennett, one-man police force in Murphy's Harbour, Ontario, is sent to investigate the killing of Jim Prudhomme, a mining company geologist apparently mauled by a bear. It should have been an open and shut case, but the clues just don't add up - there are no bear tracks, and a lady of the night swears she saw Prudhomme a few nights after his murder.

With OO concepts well in hand, the nuts and bolts of programming will go much easier. The downside to the book is that the author spends a lot of time on a soapbox (or in a pulpit) preaching the gospel of how OO design will change the world as we know it. He even predicts that Oracle will soon go out of business because it is not object -oriented at it's core. If you can overlook the author's philosophy (religion?), the book is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Technology: A Manager's Guide [Paperback]","review":"If you are new to OO and want to learn, this isn't a bad place to start. It is an exceptionally well laid-out book, very useful for reference, and covers the basics of OO in clear language. It is a very useful aid to demystifying OO jargon. But it does make it all sound too easy and ignores or understates the practical difficulties of OO development.A major theme of this book is that OO, used correctly, will create adaptable systems. (Interestingly, Dr Taylor admits that OO hasn't fulfilled its early promises of more rapid system development.) Some superficial analogies of Objects with cellular organisms are made to this point, but Dr Taylor offers no hard real-world evidence for his claims. This is a major fault with the book as a whole. I was surprised by someone with a PhD would make so many assertions with so little hard evidence.One such assertion is &quot;legacy integration is easy&quot;, proposing the solution of &quot;wrapping&quot; to deal with legacy systems. Anyone with practical experience will know this is hopelessly simplistic. If you have a million lines of ancient COBOL and you need to change the internal logic of the newly wrapped &quot;object&quot;, you've still got the same problem as before.The section on Object Databases is another case in point. Again, the basics were well communicated but the with little consideration of their downside, or how successful RDMS's (and more recently hybrid DBs) have been in recent years. IT departments will be very reluctant to scrap RDMS's and replace them with object DBs after spending years getting RDMSs to work well, and give users query tools they can use effectively. I'd need a lot of convincing, with hard, objective evidence, before using an Object DB rather than tried and tested RDMS on an industrial-strength project. (The author was employed by Gemstone - is his view completely objective?)The problems, limits and costs of OO development are barely touched upon. For a balanced view, I would strongly recommend reading Alistair Cockburn's excellent &quot;Surviving Object-Oriented Projects&quot; as an antidote to the more fanciful claims made in this book. Or as an alternative introduction to OO, plus a lot more, I would recommend Mielir Page-Jones's &quot;Fundamentals of OO Design Using UML&quot; ahead of Dr. Taylor's book."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Technology: A Manager's Guide [Paperback]","review":"Very good account of where we've been and where we are going. I would have liked the author to have given his ideas on artificial intelligence. The emphasis throughout the book is on 'adaptive technology' which is an idea akin to basic survival instinct. I enjoyed the book very much."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Technology: A Manager's Guide [Paperback]","review":"The author presents and illustrates his points rather well in this book. However, he is over-selling certain concepts and philosophies as the be-all-solve-all; in particular, trees and nesting of application nouns (objects). Although trees and nesting are intuitive, they don't always map to the real world very well.A relational expert will point out that trees and nesting are only one of many possible simultaneous views of any given thing. Taylor presents an absolute viewpoint, suggesting that trees and nesting ALONE are a sufficient view of any given object. OOP (object oriented programming) tends to get rather complicated and competes with relational turf when it tries to give each object (record) multiple, relative, or ad-hoc views and relationships. A relational proponent may suggest that it is best not to manage all these relationships via programming code, since databases are better geared toward bulk cross-link management of &quot;things&quot;.Further, Taylor's prediction that OO databases would trample relational databases has proven incorrect so far. OO databases have suffered huge commercial set-backs, and he offers insufficient information on how to handle OO in a relational world. Some OO proponents, such as Bertrand Meyer, have even suggested that the philosophy of OOP and &quot;databases&quot; in general is in conflict.Overall, this book may serve as a decent conceptual introduction, but it leaves out some important and tough philosophical rough spots that OO faces. I would suggest that one also read up on relational modeling to balance out the weak points of this book."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Technology: A Manager's Guide [Paperback]","review":"For good and bad, this is a fairly high level, introductory back. It talks more about the concepts of OOP much more than the implementation."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Technology: A Manager's Guide [Paperback]","review":"This book helped me understand object technology and how adaptive systems can provide an edge to companies facing ever-changing scenarios.

A quick and easy read for a total novice who wants to get a grip on the essentials without an in depth knowledge of exactly how to model for the object oriented world.The latter part of the book (Chapter 8 &amp; 9 in particular) is unfortunately an insult to any manager's intelligence. In particular the plug for evolution is beyond bizarre and self defeating after the repeated urging for intelligent design of systems in the earlier chapters. In our age of scientific enlightenment the over simplified scientific assumptions, from the mid 1800's and at the root of evolution theory, is coming in for serious scrutiny. Not the least of which is the structured retention and processing of information (ala DNA), - the latter somewhat similar to information technology solutions in business. Am I to believe that perfectly designed object-oriented applications and databases will evolve without any intelligent (in this case human) involvement? Give me a break!! - if that is the case why write this book...?"},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Technology: A Manager's Guide [Paperback]","review":"I found this book to be very helpful in understanding the concepts of object oriented programming. As I work in an industry that is related to technology, but not directly involved on a personal level with it (IT recruiting), I had an understanding of systems and languages, but nothing in depth. I have never been able to have someone explain the basics so clearly as Dr. Taylor does. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about OO, so long as they have a basic understanding of how computer systems and languages work and interact. He explains the concepts in an intelligent way that most non-technical people cannot, yet speaks in clear enough terms for laypeople that programmers often have difficulty with."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Technology: A Manager's Guide [Paperback]","review":"Note that, although the subtitle for this text implies Taylor's audience is solely managers, this book is suitable for anyone looking for a concise introduction to object-oriented software technology. Simply ignore some of the negative comments in other reviews regarding this book's viability in relation to early 21st-century software development - like almost every text written for an information technology audience, parts of this book, especially some of the predictions Taylor makes in the last chapters (at least in the first edition of the text), have been outmoded by lessons learned or shifts of focus in the past decade. Simply purchase the latest edition of texts such as this, especially if you are new to the topic - just remember that the new edition will undoubtedly be outmoded again in the future, but by that time you will probably have a handle on the topic and not need to refer back (at least very often) to an introductory text. What I like best about this text are the following: its conciseness (less than 150 pages) and compactness, its readability (very simple language - it is not written to impress by use of an extensive vocabulary), and its diagrams. As an individual who enjoys proper use of effective visual communication when technical topics are addressed, the simple diagrams are excellent - his use of the living cell as a model in understanding object basics like data and methods is ingenious, in my opinion. No code in this text, you say? If one is looking for an introductory OO text, why would he/she need code? Use of code would not only defeat the purpose of this text, but outmode it as soon as the next language of the day/week/month/year comes into fashion."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Technology: A Manager's Guide [Paperback]","review":"This book gives a great introduction to object technology. It puts the technology in easy to understand terms and applies real-world business problems to objects.However, it does oversimplify how object technology is implemented and the real-world actual and realistic value that object technology may afford an organization."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Technology: A Manager's Guide [Paperback]","review":"I was frustrated with most of the material I came across on the subject of object technology when I first began to learn about it. I had a fair amount of programming experience in so-called structured techniques. When I wanted to learn about objects, everything I got hold of assumed I already knew the fundamental concepts and so either omitted any discussion entirely, or glossed over the basics and moved you right in to teaching some language. I was getting nowhere until I happened across this book.Regardless of why you want to get a grip on object technology this book does a good job of introducing the fundamental concepts. It is not trying not to teach you a programming or modeling language, which was just the angle I needed. I'm pretty visually oriented and I found the illustrations quite helpful. The foundation I got from this this book enabled me to finally move on to more meaty things.You don't have to be technical to deal with this book. Some of the later chapters may be more than what some people need, and the author's choice of evolution as an example of an object-oriented system may aggravate some readers.I would recommend this book to mangers, technical writers, educators, and students as a good first book on the subject."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Technology: A Manager's Guide [Paperback]","review":"Managers of software projects need to understand the fundamentals of object-oriented programming before they can effectively communicate with the developers they are managing.

I have taught object-oriented programming to experienced programmers for many years. When I first read this book in 1998, I was so impressed with some of the explanations that I have used modifications of them in my classes.

Biblical scholars often ask the question regarding who the audience was for a particular N.T. writings, and how the audience (specifically Jewish) would have naturally understood what was written. In this book, Dunn reviews the chief \\"Pillar\\" teachings of Jewish thought in the Second Temple period (including Torah, Temple, Monotheism), and asks whether Jesus's or the early Christian teaching would have been beyond the bounds of their acceptable thinking. In particular, would they have considered the Christological teaching as a bifuracation of monotheism? Basically, he says it would have been acceptable--though, of course, Jews would not accept that Jesus was, in fact, the Messiah.Chapters 9--11 basically deal with Christology and Monotheism, and I consider this to be the heart of the book. Dunn explores key Christological texts that present a high view of Christ. He notes that in these treatments, while they express very innovative statements about Christ, the authors are careful to distinguish between God the father and Christ. Moreover, he claims their descriptions and treatments have parallels in other Second Temple Judaism writings. He concludes that there is basically nothing that would necessitate a parting of the ways between Christianity and Judaism, in spite of the unique claims for Christ.He has an excellent discussion of how early Christological thinking was developed in patristics as new issues arose. He contends that as the earlier thinking was forgotten or overlooked, and words, concepts or new definitions were used, Christology did result in views that compromised both Christian and Jewish monotheism (theo--logy). Specifically, in early Christological thinking the Word or Wisdom of God was manifested in and through Jesus. But, as the concept of Jesus as the \\"Son of God\\" began to replace the concept of Jesus as the \\"Word,\\" and the focus switched from the continuity between Jesus and God to the relationship between them,and the Word became a person (in our modern sense of the term), Christianity's original monotheistic belief became bi-theistic. Dunn comments in this section were invaluable as a contribution to the discussion of Christology, and in helping to pave the way to proper understanding of what Orthodox Christology was and how orthodox Christology should be understood.Dunn believes the reason for the final parting of the ways between Chistianity and Judaism was because, as speculation and expressions grew after 70AD and statements began to challenge basic monotheistic thinking, Christian thinking continued expanding its thinking about Christ while Jewish thinking was becoming rabbinic and narrowing its thinking about God. I am sure the disagreement over Jesus being the Messiah was also a key factor.The main point I like about Dunn's writings is that he continues to try to express the fact that when we read the various types of N.T. Christologies (Lord, Son of Man, Second Adam, Wisdom, etc.), these should be interpreted in terms of ancient Jewish thought, which was not mythological but poetical and theological (indicative of the significance of a person or event). It is amazing how often theologians take notice of this but then proceed to take such claims as historical factual descriptions. I do think more attention needs to be paid to explaining how the specific Christological statements actually function in the texts."},{"Title":"The Parting of the Ways: Between Christianity and Judaism and Their Significance for the Character of Christianity","review":"I've read a number of books by Dunn, who is now retired, and can attest to the fact that he is an excellent scholar; this book is no exception.Note: I read a copy from 1991, so the page numbering may be a little off.Dunn begins with a brief background on the history of biblical scholarship over the last few centuries. Which, by the way, means a stride through all the various discarded theories. Bultmann, who famously was influenced by existentialism, has had his theories \\"broken down in a confused welter of unanswered methodological questions (particularly the failure to achieve an agreed set of criteria for recognizing 'authentic' words of Jesus)...part of a much larger crisis affecting the whole historical critical method\\" (p 9).Much has hinged on new archaeological and textual information. Greek is now known to have been \\"widely known and used in Palestine\\" (p 10) since the inscriptions in public were in Greek, and about one out of three ossuary inscriptions were as well.Scholars today widely acknowledge that \\"talk of Hellenizing in the sense of de-judaizing, or as implying a gulf between a Jewish Jesus and a Greek-speaking Christianity\\" (p 10) has been severely refuted.So, indeed, has talk of any Gnostic systems emerging earlier than the second century.Most important has been acknowledging Judaism's \\"fierce antipathy to syncretism and virulent hostility to anything which smacked of idolatry\\" (p 20), an attitude completely at variance with the Hellenistic pagan religions which surrounded the Jews. And, significantly, Jesus never visited any of the Hellenistic cities in Galilee such as Sepphoris.Second Temple Judaism was covenental and temple based--the temple was regarded as the 'navel' of the world, and was a \\"religion of repentance and atonement\\" (p 45). One of the many charges against Jesus was that he forgave sins apart from the temple sacrifice and Levitical priesthood.In both Luke and Paul it is clear that a covenant sacrifice would be needed to introduce \\"the new covenant...at the last supper\\" (p 55).Paul uses the word \\"latreia: which is usually one used in the bible when mentioning Jewish temple I worship. \\"Paul saw this commitment of daily life as the Christians' equivalent to the priestly service of the Jerusalem cult\\" (p 79).I was most interested in Dunn's discussion of Jewish Halakah--the oral law. This oral law was considered the equal to scripture by Josephus, and would later become the Mishnah. \\"The Pharisees in particular would not have regarded the 'oral law' as something distinct from the written law, since 'oral law' was simply the exposition and application of the ...Torah\\" (p 99).Various scholars have argued that Jesus abrogated, or relativized the oral law. Christians claimed they were the new \\"heirs of the promise and covenant as having been grafted into the olive tree of Israel--not into a different tree, but into the same tree\\" (p 148).N T Wright has argued forcibly that throughout the Old Testament God promises to unite all the tribes of Israel, including the lost tribes. Since these people intermarried with Gentiles, only a covenant which now included all the Gentiles could fulfill these covenantal promises of God."},{"Title":"The Parting of the Ways: Between Christianity and Judaism and Their Significance for the Character of Christianity","review":"J.D.G. Dunn's book, The Parting of the Ways, attempts to answer the question of how Christianity became a separate entity over and against Judaism. Dunn investigates the split between Judaism and Christianity in light of its significance for the progress of Christianity. He traces the history of the problem from Baur to Sanders, examining \\"four pillars\\" of second temple Judaism: (1) monotheism; (2) election; (3) Torah; and (4) temple. None of these pillars, he concludes, were brought down by Jesus or the writers of the New Testament, for nothing in the Christian Scriptures went outside the bounds of allowable speculation or debate within the Judaism of the times. Thus, early Christianity was very much within Judaism. It was not until much later that the breach occurred (between 70 and 135 CE, with preference given toward the latter). This breach was no single great split, but rather a protracted process that occurred in many stages with varying levels of intensity. The issue of so-called \\"anti-semitism in the New Testament\\" is interpreted as prophetic critiques of Judaism on the part of the NT writers. The book concludes by suggesting that the split between Christianity and Judaism may be reversed.This book has received just praise from reviewers as a clear yet detailed work. On one hand, a reviewer could mention Dunn's \\"ease of movement over a wide area,\\" while another could praise him for exhaustive citation of current literature, a full bibliography, and an index extremely well done. Everyone seemed to agree that it provided a good a feel for the \\"jewishness\\" of Christian origins, suggesting that it would be ideal for introducing students to the \\"wide sweep of early Christian history and thought.\\" Much of Dunn's earlier writings are encapsulated and brought to bear on the topic, challenging several widely accepted views and offering new insights and suggestions for further research. This is an important book for gaining an understanding of Christian origins, and a model for handling a complex subject with precision, yet without sacrificing clarity or readability.Despite the otherwise rave reviews, the book has invited some criticism. The two most significant areas deal with the radical nature of Jesus within second temple Judaism and with the christology of early Christianity. Regarding the former, Dunn asserts that Jesus attacked not the law but a factional view of it. One reviewer (rightly in my view) wondered to what degree Jesus' attacks against the Pharisees and Sadducees, who were the main interpreters of the law, would make Jesus appear to be less Jewish than Dunn asserts. Regarding the latter, Dunn thinks that it was not until the Gospel of John (written late in the first century) that Jesus is first referred to as God; neither the early disciples nor Paul thought of him that way. Marshall pointed out in his review that Dunn's use of the term \\"divinity\\" is an anachronism and seems to suggest that the early Christians had to choose between monotheism and either bi- or tri-theism. This ignores the extent to which Jesus' earliest followers referred to him as the Lord, and downplays much of New Testament christology. Lastly, I question Dunn's unqualified suggestion that Jews and Christians reunite; I agree in one sense, but not in a way that would cause me to abandon a high christology.Despite these criticisms, this is an important book for the origins of the Christian movement as distinct from Judaism. It will also be interesting reading for anyone interested in Jewish-Christian relations."},{"Title":"The Parting of the Ways: Between Christianity and Judaism and Their Significance for the Character of Christianity","review":"This book is a veritable treasure trove of information about the earliest days of Christianity. Unfortunately in most churches I have attended, Church history is either completely ignored, or presented in a one dimensional and lopsided manner, not necessarily with the purpose of being accurate or even true, but with the purpose of supporting the denomination's statement of faith. Consequently, aside from scholarly circles, early Church history has largely been reduced to a myth based upon a straightforward reading of the scriptures (apart from historical context of both the scriptures themselves, as well as the history of the era) heavily seasoned by each denomination's particular doctrine. That being said, this particular book will be greatly appreciated and enjoyed by those who wish to look deeper than the myth we've created, in order to attain a better idea of what the true state of affairs was in the days of the early Church.Dunn begins this book with a brief historical overview of this particular vein of study. Having brought the reader up to speed, Dunn presents what he calls \\"The Four Pillars of Second temple Judaism\\" (monotheism, election, covenant focused Torah, land focused temple). Dunn's premise is that it was in these four areas that Judaism and Christianity clashed and eventually split from each other. However, it must be said that very early on (beginning with the title of the book) Dunn points out that it is incorrect to speak of a single \\"parting\\" of ways, rather it was indeed \\"partings\\" of the ways--partings between different groups of believers in different geographic areas, at different times, and over different issues. What's more, even after such a parting can be identified, the paths of Judaism and Christianity still continued on in very close proximity to each other for hundreds of years.As each of the four pillars is examined Dunn begins by considering the relation of the historical Jesus and his teachings to the pillar at hand, followed by the history of developing theologies in the emerging Christian sects, and their relation to the pillar in question. After the evidence is examined, Dunn attempts to pin down a precise point (or points) of departure between the ways of Judaism and Christianity.The reading is a bit laborious (especially if you intend to check all the scriptures and texts Dunn refers to) but well worth the reward! The picture of both Judaism and Christianity in this point of history is not the bland monolithic portrait systematic theology has produced. Instead, Dunn uses not only the familiar Old and New Testament texts, but well over a hundred other texts from the late second Temple period (including selections from the Apocrypha, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo, Josephus, Rabbinic texts, etc.), as well as copious references to more contemporary works in order to produce a masterful panorama of the heterodoxy of both Judaism and Christianity of the time--literally the Judaisms and Christianities of the late second Temple period. I highly recommend this book for not only those who wish to understand the \\"hows\\" and \\"whys\\" of the split between Judaism and Christianity, but also for those who desire a more accurate and realistic portrayal of the developing Church than the one usually presented by various Christian denominations."},{"Title":"A New Century Chinese-English Dictionary (Smaller Print Edition) (Chinese and English Edition)","review":"I've been using this dictionary for the past 6 years, and it is not only perfect for modern Chinese texts but also very useful when you extensively read in literature of Yuan and Ming classics. The book is actually of a portable size suitable for travel and coffee shops. My only objection is the price though. The one I am just looking at on the back cover of my edition is 99.90 yuan. How come the price here in US is almost 120 US dollars, which amounts to around 800 yuan?!My suggestion : if you want it, and I can assure you that if you have reached upper intermediate or advanced level in Mandarin Chinese that is the reference work you want to have, buy it from a Chinese bookstore (in China),like www.amazon.cn.

This is fiction from an era we will not see again. This is the stuff little boys dream of! Read it, savor it and enjoy it! I cannot recommend this one high enough."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"I just finished rereading this remarkable adventure story, and must say, some of the capsule summaries above leave a bit to be desired.Yes, John Carter returns to Mars after 10 years absence, and finds himself in a paradise. But ironically, it's a paradise that soon turns into a kind of violent warring hell. The plant men are only the beginning. The bitterest enemies are a race of almost diabolical priests, the Tharns, who set loose white apes and plant men to slaughter thousands of religious pilgrims. I'm not spoiling the plot at all, since this becomes clear in the first two or three chapters.Again, there's a deep bond between the hero, John Carter, and a brave and stunning young woman named Thuvia. John Carter, a warlord, is not content to merely escape. He must somehow end this evil empire of hypocritical priests and mass slaughter.One fine element is the reintroduction of the green warrior chieftan, John's dear friend from the first novel in the series.There are strains of deeper thought woven throughout. For example, the biting satire against mindless &quot;fanatic&quot; religions.Heck of a book. Burroughs writes in a style that would seem a bit heavy today. But after a chapter or two, the reader usually can get in the stride. These books read fast-- you can't put them down. The heroines are GORGEOUS-- but the language is &quot;clean&quot; and the books can be recommended for teens. The description-- often in battle scenes-- is up to anything written in adventure science fiction today. This book was written-- amazingly-- in about 1917."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"This book, #2 of 11 in Burroughs' John Carter series, is a direct sequel to the classic \\"A Princess of Mars,\\" and a reading of that earlier volume is fairly essential before going into this one. \\"Gods...\\" was first published in serial form in \\"All-Story Magazine\\" in 1913, and comprises one of Burroughs' earliest works. It is amazing how much action the author manages to cram into the book's 190 pages; on just about EVERY page there is some kind of incredible happening or colorful bit. The book really is hard to put down, and yet, at the same time, the end of just about every paragraph could serve as a cliffhanger! The pace of the book is brisk and relentless, and really carries the reader along to another great cliffhanger at the conclusion. In this volume, our hero, John Carter, returns to Barsoom after a decade's absence, and goes to that planet's \\"heaven.\\" But heaven turns out to be anything but, and our man gets caught up in battles with plant men and white apes, lost civilizations, religious taboos, the plots of an evil \\"goddess,\\" duels in the arena and on and on. There are two action set pieces that Burroughs really puts over well. One is the slave revolt that takes place halfway through the tale; the other, a bravura, four-way air battle between the forces of the black, white, red and green men of Barsoom. Both of these sections are thrilling in the extreme; better than anything in the first Barsoom novel. It's also nice that Carter, an Earthman on Mars, fights alongside men and women of varied races, colors, and religious beliefs in a common cause; there's some kind of message there--one for tolerance and brotherhood--that we could all avail ourselves of today.Having said all this, however, I must admit that there are problems in this novel that prevent me from giving it a top grade. These problems mainly take the form of fuzzy writing and internal inconsistencies. Burroughs, in this novel, does not do well in describing geography; his depictions of the Valley of the Therns, for example, are almost impossible to visualize (for me, anyway). A map of this planet (such as the one provided in LeGuin's Earthsea books) would have greatly helped, given Burroughs' inability to clearly set out his world. As for the inconsistencies: Burroughs, the \\"editor\\" of the novel, says he first read Carter's manuscript (for Book #1) 12 years previously; but if he had really obeyed Carter's will (that the manuscript not be opened for 11 years), then he would have only first seen the text of \\"A Princess of Mars\\" ONE year before! Tars Tarkas is said to be grieving over his kidnapped daughter in one section of this book; then, a few scenes later, he learns of this kidnapping for the first time. Huh?!?! The scene with Carter on the black-pirate cruiser contains many inconsistencies. Carter is said to be fighting five of these men; he kills three of them, and then three are left. Huh?!?! Six pirates are killed, all told, but later in the book, the number is said to be seven. Carter is said to have killed all these men single-handed, although the Thern princess, Phaidor, had helped him. These pirates are all asleep in the cruiser when Carter comes upon them, although they had been sacking the Thern temple scant minutes before. Does this seem likely? Inconsistencies such as this can drive an alert reader crazy. And don't even get me started on the redundant expressions such as \\"haven of refuge\\" and \\"craven cowards\\" that pop up all the time. Burroughs improved with age, but these early books are rife with problems that a good copyediting should have weeded out. Still, these minor problems are easily overlooked when one is caught up in the sweep of the story, and this story is as exciting as they come. It really is a tremendous feat of imagination, and one that any lover of swashbuckling fantasy should hugely enjoy."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"Having introduced the characters in 'A Princess of Mars,' the author gets down to the action, in this the second Martian adventure of John Carter, with, as I recall, a new opponent, ready to fight, on almost every page.The author subtly pokes fun at religion, race and our conventions and rituals regarding them, while writing an exciting adventure story that certainly gripped my imagination in the early sixties.John Carter remains the perfect Virginian gentleman, respecting women, seeking no unfair advantage, while fighting plants, animals and multiple races of Martians. He must struggle to overcome them all, if he is to set free his beloved Dejah Thoris from a nested series of &quot;Heavens within Heavens.&quot;If he wins, will he kill the &quot;Gods of Mars&quot; in the title? What will happen to religion on Mars if he does? If he loses...........An ideal introduction to science fiction and fantasy for boys reaching puberty.

Originally published in 1913 as a serial in &quot;All-Story Magazine,&quot; this story finds John Carter returning to Mars and setting off to find his woman.

But in reality it's a far cry from heaven and Carter turns a world upside with his challenging revelations.The real hero of the story, however, is Dator Xodar, a prince of the black-skinned First Born of Barsoom, the highest race on the planet. The First Born prey upon the white-skinned Therns, who in turn prey upon the nations of the Red and Yellow men of Barsoom.

Together they fight their way through the Martian &quot;heaven&quot; (which turns out to be a living hell) past giant apes, plant men and false gods. Along the way they meet new people, discover hidden races of &quot;gods,&quot; and find new quests.However, this book fails to reunite John Carter with his wife Dejah Thoris until late in the book (very late in the book). Their relationship was always my favorite part of the original, A Princess of Mars. Naturally, I am a bit disappointed in this. However, I feel that The Gods of Mars holds up better than most sequels--it is fun and exciting, and returns the reader to one of the most interesting worlds ever conceived in all of fiction.

Carter's supposed to be this brilliant guy, a master strategist, a think-on-his-feet kind of fella who can puzzle his way out of any dilemma, no matter how difficult. So why is it that when he is presented with something so simple as the &quot;mystery&quot; of the identity of one of the major characters, said identity being so glaringly obvious that the reader has it figured out within a paragraph of the character's introduction, it takes Carter SEVERAL CHAPTERS to figure out who this guy is?This inconsistency (not the only one, I'm afraid), isn't really all that bothersome in and of itself, but it's problematic in that it (sin of sins!) takes the reader out of the story. In a novel like The Gods Of Mars, all you've GOT is story. Anything that takes you out of it is therefore a major flaw.I still enjoyed a lot of The Gods Of Mars, and will probably read The Warlord Of Mars (the next book in the series) if for no other reason than to see how TGOM's cliffhanger ending is resolved (yes, I admit it, I wanna find out).

He is almost immediately forced to fight for his life defending himself and a Green Martian who turns out to be his old friend Tars Tarkas. He soon finds that he has arrived in the Valley Dor, where the River Iss empties into the Lost Sea of Korus, or in other words, heaven. But it is no heaven, it is a place where those who come are slaughtered by the plant men, eaten by the white apes, or by the Therns, who fancy themselves divine, but have their own version of \\"heaven\\" which is much the same as that of the Red and Green Martians, and as much of a lie.Once again, John Carter makes friends and enemies along the way, from Thuvia, a Red Martian prisoner that he frees from the clutches of the Therns; Phaidor, the Thern female who falls for John Carter after he rescues her from the black pirates; Xodar, the black pirate who John Carter captures and who turns the tables on Carter. And, of course, the Goddess Issus, of the first-born. There is also a young Red-Martian warrior (Cathoris) who displays superior fighting skills, and Burroughs teases the reader by hinting at who his father might be, but always interrupting before it is revealed. Other old friends and foes appear as well, such as Kantos Kan, and Zat Arras.The story is entertaining enough for the reader to forgive the amazing coincidences within. One can certainly ignore John Carter arriving where Tars Tarkas is, even though he had never been there before, because the mysterious travel between worlds is not explained. On the other hand, the escape from Shador and the underground world of the first-born leading the escapees right to where Tars Tarkas and Thuvia are would certainly qualify as an amazing coincidence. Additional coincidences would include the Helium fleet appearing in the nick of time and of course on the opposite side, the re-abduction of Thuvia under their very noses.Almost the entire book is spent in John Carter's pursuit of returning to Dejah Thoris, and time and again he is thwarted until the very end when he finds her, and then as the reader knows, foolishly leaves her to help his allies, only to find that she has been taken once again. The book ending in a much more obvious cliff-hanger than the first one, which some readers may find unfair.Overall, this book is not quite as good as the first in the series, but Burroughs does a good job of keeping it fresh and entertaining, building suspense for the next in the series, and of laying the groundwork for future stories as well. As a result, I give this book the same rating as the first in the series, as it doesn't let up very much from the quality of entertainment of the first work."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"The cover to the Del Rey edition of _The Gods of Mars_ that I have at hand is a Michael Whelan painting of John Carter and Tars Tarkus fending off a mob of blue-skinned aliens with flat tails and medusalike hair. A giant boulder is behind them, two pale moons are in the sky, and a six-limbed white ape is on the edge of the action. There is a ring of mountains and cliffs in the background.This prompts me to muse a bit on Burroughs illustrators. The main illustrator of Burroughs first editions from 1916 on was J. Allen St. John. His sketches were somewhat rough, and his more detailed illustrations were muted paintings or washes. He was not, perhaps, a great artist, but he was a great Edgar Rice Burroughs artist. His style was Victorian, which matched the style and plot of Burroughs's romances.St. John directly influenced the art of two younger artists, Roy Krenkel, Jr. and Frank Frazetta, who did many covers and interior illustrations of Burroughs for Ace Books. Both Krenkel and Frazetta are, I think, technically superior to St. John. A measure of this is the fact that Krenkel won a 1963 Hugo for his Burroughs illustrations. Boris Vellajo is stylistically similar to St. John, Krenkle, and Frazetta. He is as erotic as St. John was Victorian, but he holds that eroticism a bit in check on all his Burroughs illustrations that I have seen.Whelan is a bit in this tradition in that his paintings are realistic. But Whelan's art is more \\"solid,\\" whereas the other illustrators used more sketches and washes. His style is more like that of Kelly Freas.In the early 1960s, Ballantine employed a series of artists-- including Robert Abbett, Neal Adams, and Richard Powers-- to give Burroughs's books a more modern, impressionistic look. The artists, especially Powers, were competent enough. But the attempt was abortive. Burroughs was not a modern writer, and a modern look simply did not go well with his stories.I do not pretend to have an encyclopedic knowledge of Burroughs illustrators, but I believe that a few generalizations can be made. Since Burroughs's heroes and heroines tend to be unclothed, handsome, and beautiful the illustrator should be good with human anatomy. (Frank R. Paul's stiff, jodhpurred people will not do.)There are lots of beasts, imaginary and real, in a Burroughs romance. The artist must be good with nonhuman anatomy as well. An old-fashioned, realistic style is more appropriate than a modern, impressionistic style. And lots of detail in the illustrations is preferable to artwork that is \\"sketchy.\\" The artist should make the setting \\"come alive\\" for the reader.But we seem to have drifted a bit from the novel itself. _The Gods of Mars_ was first published as a five-part serial in _All-Story Magazine_ in 1913 and was a sequel to _A Princess of Mars_ (1912), the first Barsoomian novel. At the close of _Princess_, John Carter is whisked back to Earth, with Barsoom possibly about to lose its atmosphere. In _Gods_, he finally manages to return and launch himself off in a series of new adventures. Some reviewers have correctly noted that Burroughs is careless about many details in this novel. But it seems to me that he is nevertheless quite good with his descriptive passages. Here is a sampling of some passages that seem to me to have a kind of dreamlike sparkle:As far aloft as I could see the stems and branches and twigs [of the giant trees] were as smooth and as highly polished as the newest of American-made pianos. The wood of some of the trees was as black as ebony, while their nearest neighbours might perhaps gleam in the forest as clear and white as the finest china, or, again, they were azure, scarlet, or deepest purple. (13)To my left the sea extended as far as the eye could reach, before me only a vague, dim line indicated its farther shore, while at my right a mighty river, broad, placid, and majestic, flowed between scarlet banks to empty into the quiet sea before me. (13)The face of the entire cliff was, as later inspection conclusively proved, so shot with veins and patches of solid gold as to quite present the appearance of a solid wall of that precious metal except where it was broken by outcroppings of ruby, emerald, and diamond boulders-- a faint and alluring indication at the unguessable riches which lay deeply buried beneath the magnificent surface. (21-22)For quite half an hour we descended [down a black chasm in a giant mountain] and then the shaft terminated abrubtly in the dome of a mighty subterranean world. Below us rose and fell the billows of a buried sea. A phosphorescent radiance illuminated the scene. Thousands of ships dotted the bosom of the ocean. Little islands rose here and there to support the strange and colourless vegetation of this strange world. (77)It was still dark when we passed the northern boundary of the ice cap and the area of clouds. Below us lay a typical Martian landscape. Rolling ochre sea bottom of long dead seas, low surrounding hills, with here and there the grim silent cities of the dead past; great piles of mighty architecture tenanted only by age-old memories of a once powerful race and by the great white apes of Barsoom. (121)Now _this_, by the double moons of Barsoom, is why you read Edgar Rice Burroughs! Not because he was a great writer (he wasn't), or even because he was the best of the American scientific romance writers (he wasn't). But when he was cooking with gas, he sometimes made a connection with the little exotic story teller sitting cross-legged with his hookah in your subconscious. Burroughs's imagination, admittedly undisciplined, brought a fantasy to life."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"The story , of course , is fabulous but this is the worst binding I have ever seen in 30+ years of reading paperbacks.

What I find truely amazing about this story is that deals with things such as aerial warfare but was written in 1913 when people were still debating if airplanes could ever have military value.Although the author was looking to the future with life on Mars and flying battleships, his values are anchored in the Victorian era. John Carter looks to fight the good fight, rescue the damsels in distress and still stay true to his princess. He's a think man's Conan and a monogumous James Bond all rolled into one. The plot line takes several unexpected turns and your pulse will be pounding as the story builds towards its climax.The story is written in the flowery prose that were typical of the Victorian era and it takes a little getting used to. As another reviewer mentioned, you just need to slow down, sit back and enjoy this one. It's definately worth it.The copy I had was about a few years old and the binding completely came apart and as I tried to keep the pages in order while reading I felt like I had uncovered a first addition from 1913. Normally, I would not have been to happy about that, but given the situation it just added charachter to the experience.If you pick this book up, make sure you also get a copy of the next book in the series &quot;Warlord of Mars&quot;. Once you finish &quot;Gods of Mars&quot; you'll want to jump right into the next book."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"This continuation of the Barsoom series adds two more races of people to Martian life: blacks and whites. Despite being written prior to the civil rights movement in America, I felt E.R. Burroughs handled his depiction of black people remarkably well. He admits that black people are strong and beautiful, though they must ultimately be defeated and subdued by John Carter (like the other races).The hero's emergence as the undisputed ruler of all races through military prowess is still troubling. It is hypocritical for a man to condemn the Martians for their 'might makes right' mentality and call them heartless, and then conquer and pillage their cities.The pacing of action kept me interested throughout the novel, despite E.R. Burroughs' tendency toward verbosity. I rolled my eyes as each Martian declared their undying loyalty for John Carter and every woman swooned at his feet. John Carter was built up to be such a model of perfection that he seemed unreal. He was a super hero and not a real person despite the challenges he faced.Of course I am looking at this novel through modern eyes. Contemporary heroes have been transformed into average people that react in very human ways. It is perhaps unfair to judge this early fantasy character based on modern tastes, but I can't help thinking that John Carter would have been a more complete hero if he had shown some human weakness."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"\\"The Gods of Mars\\" is, to me, that rare sequel that is as good as, if not better than, the original story in a series. \\"The Gods of Mars\\" starts with the second death of John Carter on Earth and his subsequent arrival in the Barsoomian \\"paradise\\", the Valley Dor. It chronicles his escape from the Valley Dor and the White Barsoomians, the Therns, and his subsequent capture by the Black Barsoomians, the First Born, and his escape from the Lost Sea of Omean, the home of the First Born. As usual in the John Carter stories, he has to fight his way across Mars to find his \\"incomparable Princess\\" Dejah Thoris.

Well, obviously in a novel named \\"The Gods of Mars,\\" he isn't going to stay on his home planet. But Edgar Rice Burroughs' second Barsoom novel introduces a whole new dilemma for our hero -- how to get back to the world of the living.John Carter returns to Mars, but is shocked to find that he's in a completely unfamiliar part of it, populated by grotesque Plant Men and white apes. After encountering his old friend Tars Tarkas, Carter learns that they are in the Barsoomian afterlife. The problem is, nobody can return from the pilgrimage to the River Iss -- and if anyone tries, they will be killed.But the greatest threat comes from two breeds of Martian that Carter has never seen before -- the Black Martian pirates and the White Martian Therns, both of whom consider themselves to be gods.Anyone who survives the valley is turned into a slave, and Carter soon makes new allies among his fellow captives. But even if he can escape the grasp of the \\"goddess\\" Issus, he may not be able to survive in a world where escaping from \\"death\\" is blasphemy -- especially when he finds that Dejah Thoris may be doomed as well.\\"The Gods of Mars\\" is a much faster-moving story than the first Barsoom book, even though we're introduced to a whole new part of Mars and two new Martian species. Burroughs just plunges right into the main story right away, and it's a long time before he stops to contemplate the flora/fauna/customs of the Martians.Burroughs' prose is also more polished in this story, with longer action scenes and a faster pace -- as well as some moments that are absolutely horrifying (the plant men, with their corpselike skin, ragged noses and wormy hair). And while he still has the slight stuffiness of early 20th-century pulp, he injects a lot of vivid descriptions and action into the story.John Carter is still a bit on the Stuey side -- multiple women are in love with him by the story's end, for instance. But he's still a very strong character, with lots of guts and courage. Burroughs throws a rather unexpected twist into the story when Carter discovers that one of his fellow captives is actually related to him; and he also introduces some other interesting characters, such as the malignant Issus and the strong, proud Thuvia.\\"The Gods of Mars\\" is one of the few sequels that is actually markedly better than the original book. But be warned: it leaves you dangling on a cliffhanger that will leave you scrabbling for the third book."},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars","review":"The Gods of Mars+++++++++ caution contains what some might construe as spoilers++++++++++The Gods of Mars is the second book of the John Carter series followingA Princess of MarsThe Warlord Of Mars.In this book after John Carter's arrival, a boat of Green Martians arrive on the River Iss and are ambushed by the previously unknown Plant Men. The lone survivor is his friend Tars Tarkas, the Jeddak of Thark, who has taken the pilgrimage to the Valley Dor to find Carter.Carter and Tars Tarkas discover that the Therns, rulers of Valley Dor, a white-skinned race of self-proclaimed gods, have for eons deceived the Barsoomians of the outer world by disseminating the myth that the pilgrimage to the Valley Dor is a journey to paradise. Most arrivals are killed by the beasts of Valley, the survivors enslaved by Therns.Carter and Tars Tarkas rescue Thuvia, a slave girl, and attempt to escape, capitalizing on the confusion caused by an attack by the Black Pirates of Barsoom upon the Therns. They are separated during the attack: Tars Tarkas and Thuvia hijack a Black Pirate flier, while Carter fights his way aboard another, killing all but one of the Pirates, and rescuing a captive Thern princess.Carter, talking with the captured Pirate Xodar, discovers that the Black Pirates, called the \\"First Born\\", also think of themselves as gods, and prey upon the Therns as the Therns prey upon others. He, also, discovers that the captive Thern is Phaidor, daughter of the \\"Holy Hekkador\\" (high priest) of the Therns. When their flier is recaptured by the First Born, they are taken to their land, built around the underground sea of Omean, below the lost sea of Korus and the Valley Dor. Both are located at the South Pole of Barsoom.Once there, Carter is taken before Issus, the goddess of Barsoom; an ancient, evil woman who has manipulated her own people and the rest of Barsoom into maintaining a hierarchy with the First Born on top. Issus dictates the policies of the Therns through secret communications with them. The Therns, thinking they are receiving divine communications, do not realize that they are duped by their enemies.Issus takes Phaidor into her service as a handmaiden for one Martian year. Carter is imprisoned, with Xodar as his slave as punishment for being defeated by Carter. Thereafter Carter treats him with honor, and thus gains in him a friend. In prison, they meet a young Red Martian captive from Carter's home country of Helium. Soon thereafter, Carter and the youth are taken to the monthly games of Issus.In the games, the handmaidens of a year before are sacrificed, and their bodies will be eaten by Issus and her nobles. Carter leads a revolt of the prisoners, killing many of the First Born. Carter and the youth almost kill Issus before the First Born suppress the revolt. Carter and the youth escape via underground tunnels, and give themselves up to guards unacquainted with the revolt to be returned to their prison island. Upon hearing the story of the revolt, Xodar rejects the notion of Issus' divinity.Carter, Xodar and the youth hijack a flier and escape. Soon after, Carter discovers that the youth is his son, Carthoris. The flier is damaged and must be abandoned in unknown territory. They encounter Thuvia, who describes the capture of Tars Tarkas by the green warriors of Warhoon (a clan rival to his own). Carter goes alone to rescue Tars Tarkas, but is discovered. After a chase, Thuvia is sent on alone mounted while the men attempt a last stand against the Warhoons. They are rescued by the Heliumetic navy; but do not find Thuvia.Commanding one of the warships is Carter's friend Kantos Kan; but the fleet is commanded by Zat Arras, a Jed (chieftain) of the hostile client state of Zodanga, and Carter is suspected of returning from Valley Dor, which is punishable by death. Tardos Mors, the Jeddak of Helium, and Mors Kajak, the Jed of Hastor (the grandfather and father, respectively, of Dejah Thoris, and thus Carter's in-laws) are absent from Helium, having led fleets in search of Carter. Later, Carter discovers that Dejah Thoris is missing, believed to have taken the pilgrimage to the Valley Dor to find him.Upon returning to Helium, Carter is tried for heresy by the Zodangans; but the people of Helium do not tolerate this. To avoid civil war, Carter's judgment is deferred for a year. Sola, the daughter of Tars Tarkas, arrives, having escaped the First Born.Carter realizes that Dejah Thoris will be selected as a handmaiden of Issus, and thus will have only a year to live; wherefore he and his comrades go to rescue her. They uncover evidence that Thern spies are monitoring them, and Carter is kidnapped by the Zodangans. Carter refuses Zat Arras' offer of freedom in exchange for endorsing Zat Arras as Jeddak of Helium, and is imprisoned. After half a year in a dungeon, Carter wins his freedom through a ruse, and the mission to the land of the First Born is launched, with secretly raised troop levies, ships, and many troops lent by Tars Tarkas.Upon approaching the South Pole, a Thern fleet challenges Carter's fleet, and behind Carter's fleet arrive another fleet led Zat Arras. Finally, a fleet of First Born arrives, leaving the rescue mission for Dejah Thoris in jeopardy. Carter encourages the Therns and First Born to fight one another, and the Heliumetic crews of the Zodangan fleet mutiny in support of Carter. Carter then takes his remaining fleet with Tharkian troops to invade the underground sea of Omean.The combined Heliumites and Tharks defeat the First Born, and Issus herself is killed; but Dejah Thoris, Thuvia, and Phaidor, each of whom loves John Carter, are imprisoned in a room of the Temple of the Sun, of whose rooms each opens only once per yearThe Gods of Mars was serialized in five parts in All-Story magazine, the first part published in January 1913 and the final part published in May 1913.

John Carter the Earth born Virginian blood filled man returns back to Mars to claim what is his. None which means more to him than his beautiful Martian Wife. Not all goes well though as Carter returns to Mars, he finds himself in a part of the planet never seen by his own eyes. As a matter of fact the part of Mars he returns to is in fact what many Martians believe to be Paradise. Their own version of Heaven. All who make the journey to this great beyond do it freely, and are never seen again. Should they return from this paradise they find death waiting to be delt out to them by their own friends and family.John Carter finds this Paradise this Heaven to be a lie. A lie that has seeped into the very fabric of every species of Mars culture, belief, and ideas of life and death. So John Carter does what he does best.

Its been a long time since I read the first few Tarzan books, but I don't remember his supporting cast being as well drawn as the characters in this book. Tars Tarkas for example--John Carter's four armed, green skinned war chief of a best friend is just amazing. In some ways he is an even more interesting character than John Carter (his backstory in the first book is wonderful).This book picks up about where the first left off, ten years later, again introduced by John Carter's distant cousin--Edgar Rice Burroughs, pretending to be a Virginian. John Carter claims to have figured out how he travels between Earth and Mars and has prepared his young nephew for the upcoming excursion. (To a degree it reminds me of the Perelandra tales of C.S. Lewis, except MUCH better.)John Carter goes back to Mars, hoping to be reunited with his princess, Dejah Thorris, only to find himself having transported to the worse place on Mars to be. He has transported into the Dor Valley--essentially he is on his way to the land of the dead. In this book he discovers the 'truth' of the Martian spiritual beliefs, which up unto this time he had been content to respect.He encounters races that in his time on Mars before, had been unknow to him at all. There are white martians, the holy Therns--essentially a priest class, and black martians, the First Born, who are essentially an over pampered high class.

How many stories, particularly as found in &quot;Analog&quot;, have you read where humanity or an intrepid human explorer tricks superior (intellectually speaking) aliens by some sort of street smarts or idiosyncratic human trait ? Don't go looking for that smugness here. Fifty years ago John W Campbell challenged his writers to &quot;show him a creature that thinks as well as a man only differently&quot;, but Benford has demolished the idea of mere equality in intellectual power between humans and aliens. The mechs and cyborg intelligences in this series are drawn as well as non-human aliens can be, their motivations and capabilities (as well as thought processes) are described without lapsing into merely &quot;jazzing up&quot; human characteristics. Benford's aliens are aliens in mind as well as physique and no reader can fathom their true nature. Benford's humans are hunter-gathers, appropriating technologies and materials they can not create themselves. William Tenn's description of humans as &quot; rats in the walls&quot; is carried to an extreme in &quot;Tides of Light&quot;. Family Bishop merely dodges incomprehensible aliens and forces before fortune steers them to the next instalment. Benford has made an elegiac vision of the future, incorporating grandeur like Arthur C Clarke in &quot;The City and The Stars&quot; with a mysterious plot. The aliens are ALIEN and the humans are so different in physical nature amd cultural millieu as to be almost unbelievable. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"TIDES OF LIGHT.","review":"Author Benford is a professional physicist, and it shows perhaps the most in this fourth novel of the galactic center series. The others: \\"In the Ocean of Night\\" (1977), \\"Across the Sea of Suns\\" (1984), \\"Great Sky River\\" (1987), \\"Furious Gulf\\" (1994), and \\"Sailing Bright Eternity\\" (1995) also rely on his scientific background and poetic language, but \\"Tides of Light\\" is the one where he manages to put his hero on a classic free-fall trajectory through the center of a planet, a situation imagined in richer detail than you've ever seen it before.The novels are grouped in two's - the third, \\"Great Sky River\\", introduces us to Killeen Bishop and his clan, human scavengers in the dominant central galactic machine civilization some 30,000 years in the future. \\"Tides of Light\\" continues the story of Killeen, now captain of the Bishop clan, landing on a new planet with fascinating new alien life-forms imagined in realistic physical and mental detail. These mechanically augmented myriapodia, large many-legged burrowing insect-like creatures, skilfully manipulate the most exotic physical element in the series: a planet-sized cosmic string. The myriapodia use their cosmic string to burrow through entire planets, extracting the metal-rich cores to weave artificial structures on the scale of entire solar systems.Part of the fascination of the story is the state of the humans here - good at surviving, but fearfully low in skills and abilities, and filled with knowledge of decline from a much more prosperous state. Fighting not just the myriapodia and the machines, but fellow humans led by a despotic leader, Benford manages to couple exciting action with insights into human nature, singly and in groups. Sometimes the physics seems stretched a bit - how exactly would a planetary surface and atmosphere remain livable while alien beings repeatedly removed large chunks of the core? But the breadth of Benford's scientifically plausible imagination in these novels is amazing in itself; read these novels to gain a perspective on life in the universe and what a sufficiently advanced civilization might do with a galaxy such as our own."},{"Title":"TIDES OF LIGHT.","review":"Gregory Benford is one of the few authors who don't betray science in their science-fiction.

And this, even as they are routinely described as using technologies far beyond any cyberpunk gizmo ; in fact, Benford's complex and consistent characters face mind-staggering challenges, their own cultural inheritance being one amongst many. Even the classical galactic-scale plots found in Dune or the Foundation series are utterly reduced to naught compared with the (very) long-term projects of the past and present intelligences competing in Benford's universe.

It combines the realistic plight of the humans with the sureal background of New Bishop. Mr. Benford avoids the traditional view of humans being masters of stars and space, and instead has them a small faction fleeing for their lives. His descriptive nature adds to this, so it is possible to see Quath as more than words. He brings this book to life, off of the written page and into the mind of readers. His style does not make one fall asleeep from tired cliches and already been done plots, but keeps them involved with his story of our future in space."},{"Title":"TIDES OF LIGHT.","review":"this series started off so good. and I've loved other novels of benford's.

Along the way, they encounter an insect-like race that has much more in common with mankind than meets the eye.This book is full of scientific detail that I followed more or less. As other reviewers note, it contains a cosmic string that has been harnessed by the insectoids to harvest the resources of entire planets. Their common enemy is the machine intelligences, which have a vast web of outposts throughout the galaxy, tolerating organics at best, hunting them brutally at worst.There is no doubt that this is fun, but unfortunately I couldn't leave behind my sense that someone was making this up - I couldn't suspend my disbelief, which I most definitely could in the previous volumes. In spite of many interesting character developments, there is a rushed feeling to this book, as if the concepts are beginning to be more important than the plot.

I was barely able to finish this and the subsequent 2 novels, where it is all supposed to come together, were only skim books from which I wanted to find what happened without any particular magic or felling that belonged exclusively to this as, for want of a better term, a work of art.REcommended, but only for those invested in the series."},{"Title":"TIDES OF LIGHT.","review":"Robot centipedes aren't good.Or, this book follows on from Great Sky River, with Killeen in charge of his particular group of chess piece clan human strugglers.

I'd enjoyed more recent Lehman poems and been recommended this as his best book; I liked it, but not as much as I'd expected to. It irritated me that he wrote poems in perfect syntax and yet I couldn't always connect the sentences. In poems like \\"The Square Root of Minus One\\", \\"Heaven\\" and \\"The Right Number\\" he isn't working the same surrealist landscape as Mark Strand, but making intuitive leaps between different landscapes that I can't always follow. Then I got into his thirty sonnet sequence \\"Mythologies\\" which comprises Part Two of the book, and things began to click: it's necessary to think yourself into Lehman's head, almost. I was particularly taken by sonnet XVIII, where the end words take the form of a word puzzle. My favorite poems were probably those in Part Three, which comprises his wittiest poems: games with cinematography like \\"Perfidia\\" and \\"Henry James: the Movie\\" and satires like \\"Rejection Slip\\", \\"With Tenure\\" and \\"One Size Fits All.\\" I liked the first few poems in Part Four, but all these are first person memoir type poems with a profusion of self-conscious character names and after a while the appeal dissipated. I wonder if I might prefer his more recent books."},{"Title":"Operation Memory (Princeton Series of Contemporary Poets)","review":"This book can be the most commercially successful book of poetry to be ever published if it were used as a cure for insomniacs.

Any attempt to teach oneself such a complex language as Hungarian is going to require several textbooks, as a variety of approaches to aspects of the language help avoid confusion. COLLOQUIAL HUNGARIAN certainly deserves a place among one's materials. Whether or not it will be your primary textbook depends on your experience with foreign languages.COLLOQUIAL HUNGARIAN moves along very quickly, a single one of its lessons offers enough information for three units in other textbooks. It's just the sort of book that the linguistics geek, with a few other languages under his belt, might find ideal. Grammatical concepts are presented in a straightforward, no-nonsense manner. Too bad this rigorous method was lost in Routledge's subsequent edition of the course (written that time by Carol Rounds).If, however, you are just a normal guy compelled by some twist of fate to learn Hungarian, I recommend TEACH YOURSELF HUNGARIAN."},{"Title":"Colloquial Hungarian (Cinema and Society)","review":"I think this book is great. However, the complexity of Hungarian requires a LOT of study, and hence, I recommend you get the cassette with it, and play it over and over and over and over again until the pronunciation exercises and first two dialogues make you sick. Once you have done this, the material in the book is much clearer, and like the other reviewer said, allows you to learn and get into Hungarian very quickly. Stuff I learnt in chapters 1 and 2 of this book I use regularly in Hungary and it seems to work! Be prepared for two months of vowel sound learning though - not a fault of the book, but the fact that Hungarian is very hard to pronounce, learn and understand - but nothing ventured...I do it for fun and I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to start - the dialogues are also funny, though I don't think anyone says &quot;elvtars&quot; in Hungary anymore - making this slightly outdated, but very enjoyable!!"},{"Title":"Karma 101: What Goes Around Comes Around...and What You Can Do About It","review":"Mr. Mack has written a short, very funny look at karma-lite and it should not take you more than a few hours to get through this book. Although entertaining, I wish the book had more substance to it. Mr. Mack presents the Buddhist teaching of karma and gives pretty short shrift to the Hindu perception, even though, in my own opinion, the Hindu view makes more sense when it comes to explaining the world and why things happen.One of the shortest chapters is Why Bad Things Happen to Good People and this surprised me. With AIDS and Holocausts, child molestation and monsoons that kill thousands, one would think that Mr. Mack would have spent a little more time with why this stuff gets dumped on innocent people all the time. Another chapter might have been Why Good Things Happen to Bad People, since we all know liars, thieves, adulterers, etc., who never pay for their crimes or transgressions. According to traditional Buddhism these people will 'pay' in a next life, making it balance out, but Mr. Mack appears to have no belief in reincarnation (or if he does, he hides it well), leaving one to wonder how karma works things out in the end.There are a few contradictions in the book, when anecdotes are presented to show karma in action. A shy, country-music-hating man finds himself at a country music festival with his wife. He hums classical music, does not tap his toes and for this negative karmic action he pays when the porta potty he is in tips over on him and covers him in poo. Yet karma is supposed to be objective and not punishment. Would the porta potty not have turned over if a Shania Twain fan had been in it? A fish-hating woman puts a goldfish into a restaurants outdoor faux pond after deciding she does not want it in the house anymore, and the next day the family sees that the pond has been drained, therefore killing the fish. If she had not taken the goldfish there would the pond not have been drained? How are the 2 karmically connected at all?For those who have little knowledge of the very basics of karma this book can answer a few questions, but if you're really interested, I would suggest books written by either Hindu teachers or Buddhist teachers, as they have more information, depth and answer the questions about Life that most of us have regarding pain, illness, suffering, death, etc."},{"Title":"Karma 101: What Goes Around Comes Around...and What You Can Do About It","review":"I just loved this little book!

This concise commentary contains several charts, maps, and visual representations of the many literary devices employed in Revelation. The bibliography and endnotes are nice to have for further reading. The book is written for Bible students, whether formal or laymen, but it is still an easy read. The commentary is fast-paced, and Hindson often compares Revelation to a drama. The language is straightforward - no need for a dictionary - and it is even humorous at times, which may take some getting used to for the scholarly-types. It seems rather light for college level reading, but the reader is left with a solid grasp of the Pretribulational view of Revelation. The book is very well organized. It outlines Revelation into 7 major sections, and the book is divided into 22 chapters (as is Revelation). Each chapter begins with a Twitter-esque preview, followed by the exposition and wrapped up with study questions. The Scriptural text is not included, and there is relatively little exegesis. The author explains some Greek words, but knowledge of Greek is not necessary. The commentary moves along rapidly, as does Revelation, and one of its greatest qualities is that it delivers a lot in a few, plain words. It's like a bigger commentary with all the extra words wrung out of it. Hindson sticks to his view while still being respectful of others, even quoting them favorably at times. This volume is not in any way an attack on other eschatological views, which is refreshing, since others devote countless pages to debate rather than the actual biblical text. The downside is that Hindson interacts very little with other views, so the reader will not get a wide variety of ideas to ponder in this book. However, Hindson's goal is to focus on the key issues in each chapter, and he is focused throughout. I used this commentary in a 400 level Bible course. I got the book secondhand, and it is holding up well. It cleared up a lot of my misconceptions about Pretribulationalism. I would recommend it to any adult with even the slightest desire to have a better understanding of Revelation. It delivers."},{"Title":"The Book of Revelation: Unlocking the Future (21st Century Biblical Commentary Series)","review":"i really enjoyed this book. i wasnt going to get it, seeing i have many study bibles and a couple of revelation commentaries already. but i got it because i think ed hindson really can teach, even the most difficult passages he helps you understand. as of feb 5th 2010 on tbn, ed hindsons program the king is coming is at part 3 of a 12 week study of the book of revelation. check his website out also, the king is coming. if you missed the series you can buy the audio or video of it. i have learned so much just in 3 weeks. i bought this book to have an in depth explanation so i could highlight important parts. not sure what the other reviewer wanted from a commentary giving it only 1 star. but to each is his own. ed hindson talks a great deal about numbers and their significance in revelation. there are 22 chapters matching the 22 chapters of revelation. he also gives you plenty of old and new testament examples of how they relate and even prophecy of the coming events of revelation. he also has 9-12 questions at the end of every chapter to review. the 1st question of each chapter takes you to another book in the bible and ask you how it relates to revelation. get this book for a once and for all study on the book of revelation. it is 228 pages of commentary, that he pulls from hundreds of other books, that he has researched. i believe ed hindson to be right up there with, jack van impe, grant jeffrey, and tim layhaye as far as bible prophecy is concerned. i also bought his commentary on matthew from the same 21st century series. i intend to get all 13 volumes of the new testament in that series, so stay tuned for other reviews from me. check out other products i have reviewed. these sources have helped me learn more in the last 3 years than my entire life. i try to listen to one half and hour sermon a day. go to one place. com, grace to you. tomorrows world. jack van impe presents. the king is coming. grant jeffrey. and check out tbn.

Much of what the book of Revelation means is actually unclear, but people are prone to pretending they know what it means. This book does not do that. Hindson clearly portrays what may be portrayed and steers away from conjecture.I was extremely impressed by his treatment of the Church at Laodicea, as he did not fall into the \\"God would rather have you be on fire for God or so far from him than to be a moderate Christian\\" modern reading of the passage.

Very readable and compelling, the author unwittingliy tells the tale of his adventures around the world on a small boat that he built with his own two hands in New England near the turn of the century. The book is without pretense, at times is hard to imagine, yet the language is so simple and straightforward how can we do anything but believe his stories written in a down home style. This is a book that's easy to get lost in and holds your attention until the very last page. I read it while on the beach. I recommend that you do the same. The sound of the lapping waves makes the book that much more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"That seems to be Slocum's approach to solo circumnavigation -- the narrative tone is so matter-of-fact, he could be describing a walk in a large and unfamiliar park.The audio CD is a bit curious. The reader's sing-song is maddening at times, seeming to directly contradict the author's clear, no-nonsense intention. I found I had to listen and re-deliver silently, so it was a bit more work than it probably should have been, but still worth it. Ultimately, Slocum's is the story of a true adventurer."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"This is every bit as good a book as the other reviewers have stated. This book has only one problem for me. I'm 58 yrs. old and the print in this small book is to fine for my eyes. I'd suggest if your around that age where your eyes are starting to give you problems that you get a larger book with bigger print. This book has the illustrations from the other editions.

Small as a child's book, it was easily kept in my purse for reading at odd available moments. Second, I had to read every paragraph several times to visualize the winds, waves, sail set, and plans of the solo captain. I passed this book on to a friend who was as intriqued as I was. I would recommend to any sailor as an addition to his permanent library."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"As interesting today as it was at the turn of the century, Slocum's account is witty and compelling."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"Slocum eases the reader on an adventure around the world, baiting us along with peaceful respect for the sea, and a love of sloitude. No hollywood storms or disasters. He is as good at story telling as he is at sailing. I would recommend his work to non-sailors and non-adventurers alike. This is a slice of history as he visits the South Pacific and South America in the 1800's, quietly cruising past a world just comming to grips with expansion into unknown cultures and countries.

It is a 19th century tale of courage, determination and adventure in a world much simpler and more mysterious than our own. Captain Slocum also has a great knack for spinning a great yarn and his other books are also well worth reading. This is THE classic solo sailing book by which all others are measured."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"I have to say I was absolutely shocked to see ANY reviews that were less than 5 stars. That is how much I enjoyed this book. I've have actually read this book about once every 2 months for a couple of years now, and I never get tired of my &quot;evening conversations with the Captain&quot;, sharing his sail around the world.The Captain will take you to Yankee whaling towns, pirate shoals off the coast of Spain, South Sea paradise islands, among Fuegian natives round the horn, throughout distant Australia, then far beyond and back again. The book is absolutely full of adventures, and if you love the sea or reading about sailing, this is a must read classic.Merry Chistmas to all,Mike"},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"I have read any number of books by small boat sailors, but never have I enjoyed one more than this. Why? I love success stories, and Capt. Slocum was the sort who assured his success before he set out. He anticipated, and prepared for every contingency, and he succeeded in spite of doubters. But, what really sets the book apart is its language and the scope of knowledge of this third-grader. I gave most my other 'sea' books away, but will keep this one forever."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"I've been on somewhat of an adventure mode lately with all the Shackleton books, modern sailing travels and rescues, Everest, etc...., but this one is worth reading because Slocum was one of the &quot;original&quot; adventurers. He took a very small boat and made it seaworthy -- it's interesting to note that he felt so comfortable on the boat that he never shows fear, not even as he rounds the Horn or passes through major storms. He downplays his skill, but with little more than dead reckoning, he manages to find little islands in the middle of the Pacific and never fears getting lost. After his first wife died, he didn't feel happy on land, so he set off to sail around the globe which takes him 3 years. Particularly interesting are all the ports of call and how he is treated in each one. In the late 19th century, there was great interest in his trip and usually he was greated with fanfare. In this well-written and adventure filled travelogue, he recounts his travels and the details of his trip around the world with many interesting stops along the way. A great read."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"The story of the first solo circumnavigation of the world, is very intriguing. An epic adventure when many people still believed the world to be flat, Joshua Slocum writes of his experiences with pirates, dignitaries, and people from all over the world along his amazing journey. Despite the era that it is written in, the language remains somewhat timeless (and easily understandable), as is the challenge that Slocum undertook. You will enjoy reading about the nefarious storms of the southern ocean, and the calm, hospitable people of the islands in the south pacific, among other things. A great book."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"I first read this book when I was nine years old. I have re-read this book many times since then during various stages of adulthood. It is a good book, well written, and a joy to make part of one's life.Slocum's clarity of thought and vivid descriptions are wonderful to study and consider. Today, world travellers must equip themselves lavishly with things. Slocum equiped himself with little materially. He was lavishly equiped with intelligence, the ability to take action on knowledge.He colorfully demonstrates the ability to solve problems through forethought. Could that be good guidance?"},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"My three stars are in no way a disrespectful gesture towards Joshua Slocum and his magnificent voyage. His bravery will go unmatched by many. However, rating his story on a literary scale, I can't give it more than a three. If you're not a sailor, and I'm not, then you may find yourself bogged down by many sea/boat terms. On the other hand, if you have worked on a boat, or enjoy sailing, then you will love this story. I might also note that at times the story becomes repetitive, but it is not without its witty and suspenseful moments. This account of Slocum's courageous voyage around the world would probably only appeal to those that already have some knowledge of the sea. I guess its all relative."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"Tis book is well written in a unique style. It was a grat piece of escapism. I couldn't wait to get to the next chapter in the adventure as the author proceeded around he world.

His solo circumnavigation of the globe was the first and he decribes his adventures in a way that draws you into his world, as if he takes you along. we are fortunate that a man with his sea experience also could write with such insight - much like Ricard Henry Dana's \\"Two Years Before the Mast\\""},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"This is a classic. Slocum is a man of great depth and at the same time simplicity. He's a genuine nice guy who does what needs to be done, but as a man who is comfortable with who he is and his place in the world and on the sea. He writes for the reader. He has humility and humor and yet a bold sense of adventure; a man's man. I was just chatting with a friend online in Buenos Aires, where Slocum briefly visited in this tale. I wondered how many men like Slocum there are these days when his polar opposite W, is at the helm.

ForSlocum's contemporaries, the question was not 'how couldyou do that?' but 'why would you want to?'Slocum never provides us with much of an answer and that ispart of the charm of this book. It is almost devoid ofintrospection or any internal reporting. He presets us witha plain-spoken version of a story that ought to be heroicand therein lies the thrill of this charming book.I was tickled when I saw that the poet Billy Collins, whois no outdoorsman title a collection of his poems SailingAlone Around the Room.

Joshua Slocum's solo circumnavigation is one of my favorites. The journey itself is amazing. I also believe that he is without a doubt one of the greatest sailor's the world has ever known.On the downside there was something about his writing style that just didn't have me feeling fully engrossed in his journey. I would read this book to be amazed at the accomplishment of the first solo-circumnavigation and how determined he was to accomplish this. Of all the author's I have read he would be one of the people I would most like to meet in person I just thought the writing style was a little dated."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"I have a sailboat and I loved the book, buy it read it and you will not be sorry.It reminds me of...Oh my goodness I feel giddy!Abandon all hope ye who enters these paragraphs. I have a tale from the sea so terrible that upon first reading you would beg to have your most personal uncharted parts dry shaven daily with the splintered skull cap of Blackbeard himself for all eternity, rather than reading the tale again!The story, based on fact but rendered inaccurate ,hobbled by my memory, I think it happened a long time ago. I may remember it as a tale of my courage and grace under fire, that is how my memory best serves me.Memory I have found is not a servant called upon to dutifully reply to my every need but a jester that makes me look silly and the fool without effort, without fail and without thanks.Around 1975 myself ( a man of uncommon courage) Roscoe , Roscoes twin brother Joe, my brother known as Chuckles and Roscoes big brother known as big John. Ventured fourth on the devils waters of Eagle Creek Reservoir on a small 14 ft. pontoon boat, an experience that would change us all, even my memory. We borrowed the boat from my dad and it was not in the best of shape, powered by a10 horse unreliable aka \\"Johnson\\" motor. In today's dollars I would guess he paid around $2.00 large for the entire vessel.We somehow launched the boat and went to Crappie cove as I will call it because we were going to catch some Crappie. I was sitting at the head of the boat, the front part not fenced in, sitting in a aluminum chair cushioned with nylon straps next to \\"Joe\\" he sat proud and ready to pitch in and help with the lines if need be, an able seaman if ever one lived. We were jointly in charge of watching for stumps and such and I also had the highly esteemed job of anchor boy. Not a small responsibility when you consider that an anchor can keep a boat from falling off the edge of the earth and such. Never mind that it was a small mushroom shaped anchor which even in my young mind I considered to be of little prestige but I was still in charge of something, my peeps trusted me!Again I sat at the head of the boat, huge tackle box at my side saddled with duties and responsibilities, I was proud and maybe a little cocky. My brother \\"Chuckles\\" was at the helm, or holding onto the outboards tired and trembling arm. \\"Roscoe\\" was in his chair and \\"Big John\\" was sitting beside him in his chair I have to think it was not made of aluminum and nylon because even at 16/17 the boy was not suited for a mere mortals chairs, hence the name \\"Big John\\".We anchored off a likely spot for crappies, bass, krakens god knows what else but there was structure and anyone worth their salt knows that where lie structure there lies fish. I tried every lure in my arsenal and nothing, not a soul on the boat got a byte so I was given the order , pull anchor and lets \\"move on up away\\". I did so with much theatrics , a determined look in my eye, a certainty of purpose , feigned muscle strain and finally laid the anchor beside my chair calm on the exterior but barely able to contain my excitement about the coming order to drop anchor.Brother Chuckles had the old Johnson wound out and we had to be doing nearly 7 knots when all the world became confusing. The boat began to dive nose first into the water, my legs were wet all the way to me bum, I looked behind me and first saw the Johnson's propeller spinning in dead air, I could count the spin of the blades , my brother looked very confused trying to shut down the power, \\"Roscoe\\" was holding tight to his pith helmet with both hands and his brother \\"Big\\" was holding on to Roscoe with one hand and the side rail with the other.Funny thing about big brothers they can treat you like hell your whole life and all at once in time of need they are protecting you from plunging into the depths of the devils waters...God this is a long story! GAW!Here is what happened . Ole Anchor boy set the anchor to close to the edge of the boat and it fell off while we were speeding down the cove, the wimpy mushroom anchor gained a tight purchase on something and almost made us end over end the 14' pontoon boat. My tackle box was swamped with water, I lost a hula popper out of my tackle box, the boys would not help me fetch it as it drifted into the stumplands, and to this day I curse their names. I lost some other priceless items but will refuse to hold a grudge, I think the boys where just frightened , an emotion I am unfamiliar with. However I did recognize the look in my friends eyes.We figured out what happened, I was chastised for no good reason and then we went back to the ramp and loaded the boat, most of the crew a little shaken, as I remember I was calming them with cheerful words and distractions. Since Chuckles and Big John were around 16/17 we went to Shakeys Pizza afterwards. The elders ordered a couple of their famous pizza pies, with black olives and a couple of pitchers of beers, the youngin's (13/14) snuck sips of the beer when the help was not looking. We may have even sang along to the \\"If you knew Suzy\\" follow the bouncing ball prompter on big projection screen. All of us changed one way or another, all of us trying to forget or make light of our brush with death, all the while I tried to distract my friends and sibling so as not leave their psyche's damaged for life, I needed them to grow up normal and responsible, hell one of them might need to bail me out of jail sometime, keep em sane was my thinking, no need to molly coddle the poor bastards just keep them sane.Consider this tale of the sea and tell me it does not rival, if I may be so bold the \\"Flying Dutchman\\" ? Dare ye counter? I thought not.It is said even to this day that if you venture onto Crappies cove late in the afternoon, you can hear a ghostly popping sound, said to be my lost hula popper searching for a safe purchase in my beloved tackle box.

The book will have you 'googling' for pictures of the Spray - Sloacum's boat.

Slocum was the first person to sail alone around the world in the late 1800's. His boat, equipment, methods, prejudices, language and writing style reflect that era. The book left me with a mental image of Slocum as an undoubtedly skilled seaman, but a dour and humourless sod.

Still, not a bad read."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"Slocum has managed to tell his tale in an upbeat manner with a keen wit.

Joshua Slocum is so far out and such an indomitable human being that it is difficult to fathom without reading the story. This book is truly an exercise in understatement.A large society of Slocum afficianados exists now, largely in response to this one book. I just this past friday saw a replica of the Spray, the vessel on which he made this unprecedented voyage, owned by an old sailor. The replica is named Joshua, and sails from Alameda California.

What a great story of adventure as Slocum sets out in the Spray to sail solo around the world. He seems to have such a wonderful attitude about the whole thing, never really taking anything too seriously, but just enjoying the whole epic. It is incredible that this was done way back in 1895, long before the sophisticated navigational aides sailors and yachtsmen have available today. Yet, he seems to almost casually find his way around the world, meeting interesting people, avoiding mishaps and just generally having a great time. His writing is simple and a joy to read. It's a wonderful story for all ages and certainly not surprising that it has been so popular over the years."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"Although renowned at the time, Slocum has become a little-known American hero. The narrative in his book is direct, a working sailor's plain narrative of events, difficulties and dangers encountered. The book is also a fascinating glimpse into a world that has passed, since it's a single person's view of the whole world as he encountered it directly at the turn of the last century. Slocum met a number of prominent historical figures on his voyage: his assessment of President Kruger, who truly believed the world to be flat, is a gem."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"In 1956, my Mother took my brother and I on a tour of the USA by Greyhound bus.

With the receipt of this book, our Greyhound trip, that began as a simple navigation of our country quickly became a 10 year old's imaginary circumnavigation of the world, in addition to an education to the variety of our world's cultures through the work of this wonderfully humble man.

He writes about the practical and technical challenges of long distance sailing in the 19th century and about his encounters with the peoples and tribes on his route.

I highly recommend this book. it's a great read!"},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"Joshua Slocum was the first person to sail single-handed around the world. Unlike today's solo around the world sailors Slocum was not a yachtsman, but had been variously skipper and owner-skipper of large sailing trading ships that plied the oceans of the world. His voyages included many across the Atlantic Ocean and several to the Pacific, including trading ventures to China, Japan and the Pacific Islands. Slocum was also different to modern day around the world sailors in that he made his around the world voyage near the end of his sailing career, at the age of fifty five. Slocum was declared dead on 14 November 1909 at the age of 65. This was the date he set sail on his final voyage. His course was into an Atlantic gale, and neither he nor his boat Spray was seen or heard of later.Slocum's father was a farmer in the maritime province of Nova Scotia which was one of the leading sailing and ship-building centres of the world in the latter part of the nineteenth century. Slocum was one of eleven children, was born on the Bay of Fundy, spent only two years in school and gained all his sailing and boat building skills on the job. When he was twenty-five Slocum was offered command of an American coasting schooner. His next command took him the to Australia where he met and married Virginia Walker of Strawberry Hill, Sydney. Later, Slocum would spend considerable time cruising the coast of Australia from Tasmania to the Torres Strait during his around the world voyage.As the nineteenth century drew to a close steam ships began to eat into the fishing and coastal and international trading business previously the sole dominion of sailing ships. In 1887 Slocum's ship the Aquidneck was stranded on a sand bar off the coast of Brazil and was raked by heavy seas for three days which wrecked the ship. Slocum managed to save his ship-building tools and some material from the wreck. In eighteen months, using timber felled by him and sails sewn by his (second) wife Hettie, Slocum built a 35-foot sailing canoe which he named the Liberdade, as the boat was launched on the day Brazilian slaves were freed. He sailed the Liberdade 5,500 miles in fifty-three days back to Washington DC.Slocum's boat the Spray, which he used for his around the world voyage had previously been an oysterman on Chesapeake Bay, and was completely rebuilt by Slocum. Although in keeping with tradition the name of the boat was preserved, the boat was deliberately rebuilt with different characteristics by Slocum. For example, he increased the freeboard particularly at the bow and stern in preparation for his ocean-going venture. The Spray was thirty-six feet nine inches long, had a beam of fourteen feet and a draft of four feet two inches, and weighed nine tons. She had a full-length wooden keel which was about one foot deep at the bow and about three feet deep at the stern. Slocum tells of the Spray's ability to sail a constant course with the wheel lashed when about two points off the wind for days on end.During his around the world voyage he was introduced to many dignitaries in many countries. In South Africa Slocum made the mistake of telling the President of the Transvaal Paul Kruger that he was sailing \\"around\\" the world. Kruger corrected him saying that he meant sailing \\"on\\" the world, because Kruger believed the world was flat.The book is fascinating to read and has appeal for anyone interested in the history of sailing and of life at the turn on the nineteenth century."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"Unless you're bringing this book on your own around the world race, and are going to great pains to reduce weight and size of everything, like cutting your toothbrush in half, I suggest you not get this small edition. The book is identical to the 'normal' size book except shrunk. Tiny print, very thin paper etc. Turns out it's the 'travel edition'. Amazon doesnt tell you this. I found out the hard way. Despite the eyestrain and headaches I still couldn't put the book down. A great read."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"My feeling, upon finishing this book, was that I wish I'd had the opportunity to meet this remarkable man. What a great story of adventure as Slocum sets out in the Spray to sail solo around the world. He seems to have such a wonderful attitude about the whole thing, never really taking anything too seriously, but just enjoying the whole epic. It is incredible that this was done way back in 1895, long before the sophisticated navigational aides sailors and yachtsmen have available today. Yet, he seems to almost casually find his way around the world, meeting interesting people, avoiding mishaps and just generally having a great time. His writing is simple and a joy to read. It's a wonderful story for all ages and certainly not surprising that it has been so popular over the years."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"Order carefully. I purchased this book to replace the 1978 edition that I lost. I didn't see the fine print on the web page and was shocked and amused when I received my new miniature edition...

I've never even been on the ocean. But I found this book quite interesting and entertaining.

His kind heart and happy disposition make me wish I could have met him.A great read!"},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"Slocom's feat set the standard as the ultimate sailing adventure - a solo around the world voyage. Even though the book is over a century old, it's still an engaging tale. Some of the prose is beginning to show it's age, and if you're not a sailor, you'll need to get past some of the seafaring jargon. But once you get past all that, you'll quickly find yourself absorbed by Slocom's yarn. From the Spray's humble beginnings as the hulking remains of a sloop \\"built in the year 1\\" to Spanish ghosts at the helm to fending off \\"savages\\" with tacks in Tierra del Fuego to Pacific island royalty and colonial governors and finally to the end of his journey, Slocum never fails to entertain, and to impress. Sailing Alone Around the World is a great read, and the adventure it describes is an amazing testament to courage, perseverance, and the human spirit of exploration."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"Joshua Slocum was a very complex man-and not a plaster saint by any account; but he wrote a book as sublime and as soul-satisfying as anyone could wish for. This is a book for a warm fire and a glass of rum, or a cabin on a sailboat. The places he sees and the people he meets are extraordinary; and vividly painted. But they pale when he describes Spray and the sea. You can hear the love and longing in his voice when he describes them. This is the last of a breed, trying to keep his heart alive after wrenching losses, at the end of his rope, and finding a way to continue on and be fulfilled. Excellent reading, it will stick with you for years."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"Quite simply, a perfect recounting of one man's sailing journey around the world in a time when you could do that sort of thing without a corporate sponsor. Men like Joshua Slocum -- who can perform great feats of daring and courage with complete humility -- don't exist anymore. No writer, Slocum's simple, straight-forward prose is a relief to anyone looking for a break from self-important fiction, wordy biographies and over-complicated takes on our over-complicated world."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"I first read Slocum's account ... while riding ... on a ferryboat. My experience with boating is basically limited to... that ferry ride,... I certainly cannot review \\"Alone\\" on any sort of technical level. I just know that it's the ideal escape fantasy. Here Slocum travels the world on his own terms, emphasizing all the pleasures of reading on an empty sea by day, while making the difficult parts (the storms, the pirates) seem like amusing diversions.The leaden 19th century prose is probably the biggest obstacle to enjoying the book. A narrative of the same journey written today would be far more action-oriented. However, the reader can fill in the parts that Slocum makes seem harmless -- the illnesses, the fear of sudden death, the near madness after 70 days alone on the Pacific -- for a truer taste of just how harrowing the voyage must really have been. And then there's always the pleasure of dining with island governors, and the hobnobbing with celebrity (Mrs. Robert Louis Stevenson has a large role), and unintentional amusement as Slocum describes, and bypasses, the island where a recent series of \\"Survivor\\" was filmed.When the nautical urge strikes me, this is the book I read."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"this edition has no illustrations, a cheap edition, very frustrating because the book is very good.

The first time this has happened to me at Amazon."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"It was an interesting experience reading all the reviews of this book: What is wrong, as one reviewer who got his throat cut by you guys, with saying that it's not Literature with a capital &quot;L&quot;??? It's not Moby Dick. It's not Conrad Aiken's Blue Voyage. It's not Richard Dana's Two Years Before The Mast.-What it is is a simple man's account of his daring trek around the world through many a life-threatening situation. What makes this short little book a good read is its to-the-point account of what he's up to. The only work of literature it reminds me of at points, oddly enough, is Thoreau's Walden, with that particularity in regards to detail: to times of day, expenses etc. But, of course, there are none of Thoreau's deep reflections of time and man's relation to Nature etc-But I don't think the lovers of this book are into that kind of thing anyway-What they want is sort of non-fiction Robert Louis Stevenson stuff-Oh well, I've never understood why Moby Dick is considered so great anyway: more of an encyclopedia on cetology than a novel as far as I can tell.-So, if you're into a non-sophisticated tale of one man's sea adventure, follow Slocum and hurry back to the sloop to forget yourself again in the voyage."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"Joshua Slocum found himself out of a job and depressed when he was given a boat-the Spray, which he restored and used to set off around the world alone. It is fitting that a life long seaman such as he was the first man to do it, and that he did it for himself and not for the glory of it. A first class read, and at this price how, can you afford not to buy it.

I really wanted to have that additional information as I read this book."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"The sea and inland waters have given us some great writers. Joseph Conrad was a sea captain, James Fenimore Cooper a naval lieutenant, Mark Twain a Mississippi River pilot, Herman Melville was an able-bodied seaman on whalers and a Naval frigate, Frederick Marryat a midshipman at Trafalgar and a captain when he wrote his first book. Joshua Slocum belongs among them for his writing ability, though he produced only two books, and only one is famous.In 1895 sailing for pleasure on long ocean passages was almost unknown. Such passages were the province of fully-crewed ships. When the owners of the schooner America wanted to race her in England, they crossed by steamer and left to professionals the task of sailing the vessel across the Atlantic. When the owners of the 54-foot sloop Alice, built in New Hampshire in 1866, wanted to cruise her in Europe, they hired Capt. Arthur Clark to sail the boat across, with a crew of three professionals, a steward, and two young amateur yachtsmen. Merchant ships invariably hailed her as a vessel in distress, assuming such a small yacht could only be so far at sea through misadventure.Slocum sailed out of Boston, Mass., April 24, 1895, alone on a 37-foot oyster sloop he had rebuilt from a hulk, with the intention of sailing alone around the world. The enterprise seemed foolish. But Slocum was a life-long mariner, had once owned his own ship, and had been tried for murder after shooting two mutineers who came at him with knives. He'd been shipwrecked on the coast of Brazil with his family, built a sampan with a junk rig, and sailed it back to the U.S. His boat, the Spray, was not ideal for the journey. An oyster boat has to be shallow, and such boats can be capsized. Most mariners prefer a boat that can be knocked down on their beam ends and still recover, but this was the boat Slocum had, so it's the one used. He'd tried to find a ship to command, but he was a sailing-ship skipper, and steam was taking over. He'd rebuilt the Spray and tried to make her pay fishing for cod, but found he'd lost the touch for jigging. So he did what he knew, and set out to sea again.His first wife had died, his second did not care for life at sea, so he sailed alone. He lacked a good chronometer, so celestial navigation was nearly impossible, though at one point he shot a lunar distance sight to confirm his longitude, a feat few modern mariners can do. He had two old alarm clocks he used for dead reckoning (if you reckon wrong, you're dead.)At every port, he was wined and dined, invited to tell the tale of his voyage so far. Sometimes those dinners became tales themselves, as when a head of state corrected him, saying you do not mean you are sailing around the world, you are sailing around in the world, because he thought the world was flat.There was no one with him to confirm his sea stories. He said that in the Mediterranean he was chased by a pirate felucca, which was rapidly overtaking him when a squall hit. He stopped to reef, but the felucca did not, and when the squall had passed the felucca was nowhere to be seen.The tale seems fanciful, but that is largely because of peoples' misconceptions about piracy. Piracy is armed robbery at sea. Most acts of piracy are not committed by career pirates in special pirate vessels. The poet Shelley was killed by pirates, who were in fact fishermen who had decided to kill him and rob him. One of them confessed on his death bed. In 1895, feluccas would have been in common use as commercial and fishing vessels. Slocum would have known something was up when a vessel made all sail to catch him in dangerous conditions.Or maybe he made it up. We don't know, and at some level, we don't care. He was a charming raconteur, and we accept his story on that basis rather than interrogating the work for its factual truth. He tells of becoming ill from eating bad plums, then hallucinating that Magellan's pilot sailed the vessel for him through the straits named after that explorer. Hey, it could have happened, and it's tales like that that got him wined and dined at every port.When he finished his voyage in 1898, the country was at war with Spain, and few paid attention to his arrival. He wrote his book, which was serialized in The Century magazine. The war was over by the time the book was finished, and the country was ready to give him his due. His book was an instant best seller, and is still in print today. His imitators in making long offshore passages in small boats are legion. There is a Joshua Slocum Society devoted to chronicling such voyages, though many people prefer to just go, and not tell the society. People have even raced around the world singlehanded without stopping, which I think misses the point of Slocum's voyage. He wasn't testing himself against the sea. He had a lifetime of sailing behind him. Of course, part of the adventure was the voyage, but a big part was the arrivals in new ports, meeting new people, and being part of each new port in a way no mere passenger on a steamship ever could be.Few people ventured offshore in small boats before Slocum. He showed it could be done, and his account of his adventures made others yearn for the romance of such adventures.At age 65, Slocum set out for one more solo voyage, this time to South America. He was never seen again."},{"Title":"Sailing Alone Around the World: A Travel Classic: The First Solo Voyage Around the World (Great Voyagers)","review":"I first read this book about 30 years ago, I think. I vaguely remember thinking it was dry, and now I'm amazed at myself. It is anything else but that, from today's perspective! First published in 1900, Slocum's prose reads fresh and crisp; and his sense of humor pleases me with its dryness. No wonder it's still around, over a century later.Slocum, who worked his way up to shipmaster and owner after starting before the mast in the days when sailing ships still ruled international commerce, reached middle age in a different era. With his family grown, he accepted a friend's gift of a sloop that lay decaying in a field. Slocum rebuilt the SPRAY completely. Then he set out in her alone, to circumnavigate the globe.He spent nearly three years in that successful effort. Newspapers followed his progress, and in port after port he made new friends and learned new things. Seasoned world traveler though he was, I got the feeling as I read that he hadn't had time for much of that learning on earlier voyages. He'd been busy looking after his ship, its cargo, and his family (who sailed with him). Now, off on his own with a freedom he hadn't known before, he savored each new experience and then recorded it for eventual publication.\\"The author made me feel that I was there, too,\\" is a cliche. But cliches come into being because they're true enough to invite over-use, and in this book's case the words fit perfectly.

I'm fairly new to T. Jefferson Parker, but to my mind he's better than John Sandford, Jonathan Kellerman, and James Patterson, much better than Robin Cook and Patricia Cornwell, and nearly the equal of Michael Connelly. Obviously he needs some better representation. Laguna Heat is a well plotted mystery with plausible twists and ironies. The characters, especially Tom Shepard, are authentic and finely nuanced, full of human frailties and intriguing historical baggage that unfolds along with the murder investigation. This book never overwhelmed me with its power, but consistently impressed me with its competence. Not a sentence rang false. I will eagerly seek out other Parker titles, and recommend this to any fans of the mystery/detective genre."},{"Title":"Laguna Heat","review":"Having read all T. Jefferson Parker's current novels and loving them, I decided to check out his earlier stuff. Laguna Heat arrived and I started it late one afternoon. Immediately, I was drawn into the storyline; but, even more importantly, I was drawn into the mind and character of Tom Shephard. What a well-developed character Parker has given us here. So much is going on in the life of the former-LA cop...trying to live with a righteous shooting from his early-cop days and coping with a new position and murder spree in his hometown, quiet Laguna Beach. And all his father's old friends are involved someway. Too, he is dealing with the heartbreak of divorce, hanging on for dear life. This was just a great read and one I'm so glad I found.

After I started reading it I couldn't stop. Mr. Parker's writing style let the whole story portray in my mind. I could picture the characters and even smell the salt air. Sometimes I would stop and read an entire paragraph over because it was so beautifully poised. The plot has some twists and turns and about three quarters of the way through I had a hunch on solving the mystery and I had to keep reading to see if I was right, but there was a surprise at the end. The only flaw that I saw was from a legal standpoint. In real life it would not have ended this way because of the way our justice system works. I won't give it away but it has to do with correct police interrogation procedure. Of course I'm probably just being picky because of having a law background. After I finished this book I went out and purchased &quot;Little Saigon&quot; and &quot;Pacific Beat&quot;. I think that this book would make a heck of a good movie. Keep on pumping out the books Mr. Parker and I'll keep reading them."},{"Title":"Laguna Heat","review":"T. Jefferson Parker is one of today's very best crime writers. Plotting, character, dialogue, all play out in a balanced and believable fashion in any given novel. &quot;Blue Hour,&quot; &quot;Silent Joe,&quot; take your pick. Parker is the kind of writer that makes other &quot;name&quot; writers jealous, simply because he's better. It's a shame his work has not found its way to the screen. But even fine writers have their beginnings, and for Parker &quot;Laguna Heat,&quot; is his.&quot;Laguna Heat,&quot; is not a bad novel. In some ways it's a good one, but it is a first novel. Tom Shephard, the police detective hero of the novel is in an incomplete man. He has his demons - perhaps too many, since it seems like some sort of noir checklist. One demon in particular, his anguish over shooting a teenager, seems way overblown, given that same teenager had just opened up another cop with a knife. Then there's the divorce, the drinking, the dominating father, the missing mother, the murderer of the missing mother, and a whole can of Laguna worms, etc. Despite all of this, or because of all of them, Shephard's damaged state never really translates into a character one could care much about. In constast, look at &quot;Joe,&quot; from &quot;Silent Joe,&quot; another damaged figure of good, who is complex and cared for by the reader. More interesting are the various secondary characters, though even they have, by novel's end, a &quot;stock&quot; feel to them.But &quot;Laguna Heat&quot; does have its moments. The best is perhaps Shepherd's night time swim in the ocean with his lover, Jane Algernon. This is a gorgeous passage, and alone make &quot;Laguna Heat&quot; worth a read. It also reveals perfectly the dark romanticism of noir:&quot;He kicked hard and pulled deeply to keep up with her, careful to leave a few meters between them.. Past the waves he felt the bottom falling away and knew that even a few yards from shore the ocean was much the same as it was many miles out: strong, unfathomable, unforgiving of all that is not part of it. And just as the first lappings of the waves had seemed to draw little parts of him away with them, he could now feel larger portions leaving too. He recalled that he had been married once but wasn't sure to whom. He believed that he rented an apartment somewhere in the town behind them but couldn't quote an address. He knew he was a cop on a murder case but couldn't remember the specifics. He wondered why he had ever quit surfing. But the regret soon vanished. He didn't know why and didn't want to know. Was it possible to continue this way to Hawaii, or perhaps to an uninhabited tropical island where he and Jane could live on fish and fruit, procreate, wildly, found a race? It seemed a possibility.Then ahead of him, Jane Algernon's face collected in the darkness and it was smiling.&quot;Are you scared? The rocks are under us, not far,&quot; she said. Shephard could feel the churning of her legs as she kicked to stay afloat. Her hair was slicked back and the bones in her face caught the moonlight.&quot;The above is just a portion from an extended passage. And it's such moments as these in &quot;Laguna Heat,&quot; that signal, like lightning flashes, the writer Parker is to become."},{"Title":"Laguna Heat","review":"This is a very good mystery. Tom Shephard has come back home to be the lead detective in Laguna Beach. People keep getting killed and no one knows why. Tom figures out what the person looks like but still no why. The mystery goes back to events of many years ago. He keeps digging and comes up with the answers. The ending is very surprising. Can't say much more without giving away who the killer is.

He's divorced and struggling to make it as a private investigator. His first case has him reassessing his life.This story has semi-transparent story-lines with a few twists and turns along the way. Character development is very good, almost to the point of over doing it. Some twists and turns seem like detours that are unnecessary and only served to fill up blank pages. All are typical errors from a 1st time writer, but Parker does so without leaving a bad taste in the reader's mouth.If the strong character development wasn't as excellent as indicated, this would be the only book many would read. Having Tom Shepard as a normal guy-next-door type has the reader anticipating his next escapades.I'd recommend reading it quickly and moving on to the next book in this series."},{"Title":"Laguna Heat","review":"Well written, hard-boiled fiction for the noir fan. At times, it seemed a bit of a period piece, but it has aged well."},{"Title":"Laguna Heat","review":"I read \\"Laguna Heat\\" when it was released 25 years ago in hardback. I've been a huge fan of TJP ever since. Parker is definitely a master at his craft!"},{"Title":"Laguna Heat","review":"Laguna Heat is Parker's first novel, which is my favorite read--first novels. I did this backwards, becoming a fan of Parker, then searching out his first work. Yep, maybe his best. Fitzgerald said of Hemingway: Something happened to him when he was twenty, he wrote about it, and then just wrote the same story over and over. Well, that's true of most fiction writers and it's true of Parker. (That's why I like First novels - they usually represent what it is an author has to offer. Many people (most?) find an author they like and keep reading him or her - essentially reading the same thing over and over. That says much more about the reader and the publishing world, than it does about the content of the work. Okay, I'll get off my high horse.) Before reading Laguna Heat, I read Hardball by Paretsky. Funny, both are novel's about crimes that took place forty years ago. Heat takes place in SoCal, HB in Chi-town. Heat was Parker's first novel and written in 1985. HB is Paretsky's latest. Parker was the same age as the protagonist, Laguna PD detective Tom Shephard, when he wrote the book and grew up in the locale. Paretsky is close to her protagonist's age, V.I. Warshawski, and grew up in Chicago. Parker's writing captivated me. He describes the beach towns, the scenery, and the characters accurately and poetically. (I was there often.) It's 1985 and everyone smokes and drinks a lot.Parker's plot line is so interesting, however, that I often struggled to read the descriptive narration because I wanted to turn the page and find out what happened. That's some good writing. To Fitzgerald's point: Yes, the themes in Parker's novels are the same as are the characters. Protagonist Shephard is Silent Joe is Charles Hood. The women (love objects) are all similar. The family histories are similar. Yes, it is the same story told over and over. \\"Manly Man\\" (L.A.

The use of the Levis and Clark expedition in the story works wonderfully. The conspiracy and cover up by the Jefferson and the continuing cover up make it a real thriller. The narrative by different characters is done with great skill. A must read. Well maybe not if you plan to take it with you when you go camping in the Northwest especially in the Olympics. May not be a great idea if you plan to get any sleep. The blending of old and new is superb. After you have read the story, just remember it is only Fiction."},{"Title":"Cryptid: The Lost Legacy of Lewis & Clark","review":"An entertaining read. The descriptive style is cinematic, and the whole time I was reading it, I was seeing it as if it were already on the big screen. It rolls along smoothly, and Penz handles switching narratives deftly... but be prepared, when I hit the half-way point I couldn't put it down. I stayed up until 4am to finish it!The concept of the story is so brilliant that it isn't hard to think that perhaps it is more than a theory, and that perhaps there is some truth in this fiction. The writing gets little repetitive in spots, and the narrative falls apart around the climax, a visceral mechanic of making the reader's world go through a similar chaos to the characters.Overall a solidly entertaining and thought provoking first novel from Eric Penz."},{"Title":"Cryptid: The Lost Legacy of Lewis & Clark","review":"From the beginning of the book you are captured in a suspenseful hunt for the truth about Big Foot.

The action ranges from China to Washington, D.C. to the Olympic rain forest and points in between, and the story is told in several voices which are as distinct and characteristic as they are engaging. The characterization is strong, the pace is brisk without being rushed, the surprises are neither telegraphed or short-changed, and the whole thing is an absolute hoot from start to finish (in the sense of being great fun). Penz resists the temptation to tie everything up in too tidy a bundle at the end of the novel, so that the intrigue lives on when the last page is turned -- in other words, it delivers (grin). I particularly enjoyed the integration of long-dead voices into the living narrative, phonetic spelling and all. Recommended for a fun read, but maybe not to take camping with you if you're going to the woods!"},{"Title":"Cryptid: The Lost Legacy of Lewis & Clark","review":"Cryptid is much better than I expected, and much better than most novels with similar themes.There's a lot to like in this thriller, beginning with the fact that Penz has clearly done his historical and scientific homework.I am no scholar of the Lewis and Clark period, but Penz' descriptions of this era and the re-created correspondence of the explorers and President Jefferson are convincing.Concerning the structure of the novel, it's pretty sound - the search for gigantopithecus remains and the search for sasquatch are neatly brought together in a well-plotted tale that involves a few coincidences, but nothing that feels too unlikely.Penz' sasquatch (nine feet eight inches tall for a subadult male) is larger than sighting reports and footprints seem to indicate, and maybe too large for a workable bipedal primate, though the rest of the ape description works very well. Penz has tried hard to create a believable, scientifically founded tale of Giganto's evolution and migration, and he's done it well. He does make an odd error when he describes most known ape species as nocturnal, which they are not.What is really outstanding in Penz' writing is his gift for description. Very few authors can completely immerse the reader in an environment, and I don't think it's reaching to compare Penz with naturalist Diane Ackerman or even novelist Barbara Kingsolver on this point. As the reader, you see, hear, and smell everything along with the characters.The characters are good, from the dedicated scientist Dr. Ostman (a nice nod to sasquatch history in that name) to the lovers separated by professional ambitions. The Indian hunter feels a bit sterotypical, although he's very well-drawn.I would have given this novel five stars, but it relies too much on the idea that a giant conspiracy stretching back 200 years could go undiscovered, that it has no problem finding ex-American soldiers willing to kill innocent Americans with no conscience, and that it's so powerful its agents can follow Cabinet officials around openly. While I understand the dramatic purpose, Penz could have written more limited villians and delivered a more believable novel.Penz' writing style is sure-footed: he knows what's important, and he doesn't waste words. He puts in the scientific and historical background without slowing the story. Some strained metaphors and cliches creep in toward the end of the novel, but overall it's very well-written.I greatly enjoyed this book, and I hope Penz has many more novels in him.Matt BilleScience writer[...]"},{"Title":"Cryptid: The Lost Legacy of Lewis & Clark","review":"Everyone loves a good conspiracy, and Eric Penz presents an intriguing one in his debut novel regarding a cover-up of the Bigfoot legend led by--who else?--those two great, faceless evils: big business and the U.S. government. A bit of a stretch, at first glance, to imagine that one or both have found it in the best interests of the American people to hide the existence of Sasquatch from the common man. But with copious research and meticulous attention to historical detail, Penz raises some convincing arguments. As any conspiricist knows, it's not about proving your theory IS true, only raising the possibility that it COULD be.But this story is not merely about telling us how evil Big Brother can be. It's an adventure, filled with all of the requisite chills, horrors, and romances one might expect. Think JURASSIC PARK rather than HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS. How would an eight-foot primate trained to hate man really react when encountered by him? The answer, very believably, is with a unique blend of animal savagery and human cunning, with the hunters quickly becoming the hunted.The juxtaposition carries nicely throughout, as the story balances between scientific theory and heart-stopping thriller. There are some anticipated moments, and some jaw-dropping ones. Most importantly, the characters come across as real people with believable motives. If certain matters seem somewhat unresolved in the end, keep in mind, that's how life usually works. Besides, the moment a conspiracy theory is forced fully into the light, it ceases to become conspiracy.If you're a fan of early American exploration, a Sasquatch aficionado, or if you simply enjoy modern-day adventure and edge-of-your-seat thrills, Eric Penz's \\"Cryptid\\" offers plenty for you to enjoy."},{"Title":"Cryptid: The Lost Legacy of Lewis & Clark","review":"Cryptid: n. subject of Cryptozoological scrutiny; animals of unexplained form or size, or unexpected occurrence in time or space.Opening with the alleged suicide of Meriwether Lewis, Cryptid takes the reader two hundred years into the past in order to set the stage for a page-turning, conspiracy theory thriller. The circumstances around Lewis' death, and the missing journals from the Lewis and Clark expedition, have enough unanswered questions to keep the speculation flying, and author Penz uses this to great advantage.It doesn't take long for Penz to move his story into the present time and almost immediately after that he introduces the key player, Gigantopithecus. Long known to be extinct, fossilized remnants of this Giant Ape are concentrated mainly in China, where the natives grind them up to use in various health-giving potions.Paleontologist Samantha Russell has spent her career seeking the truth about Gigantopithecus, excavating tiny fossilized bits and pieces out of the ground. When a packing crate arrives at her dig site only moments before Chinese government officials escort her out of the country, she barely has time to register that the specimens inside the box are bone, not stone. This discovery prompts her to seek out the sender, cryptozoologist Dr. Jon Ostman, a man virtually excommunicated from the scientific community for his interest in subjects such as the American Sasquatch.A specimen so recently deceased would be a gold mine and a feather in the cap of whomever published the proof. It would also be an environmental nightmare for the forestry industry, as logging would have to be stopped in the fertile Olympic forests of Washington while an impact study is done. Herein lies the controversy: Big Business and the US Government are teaming up to stop the scientists while other private industries attempt to push forth the exact same discovery.The story brilliantly balances between scientific theory and heart-pounding thrill. Cryptid mingles science fact with history into a story that equals the best historical mysteries. Some of the best and most plausible information is entirely fictitious, but is handed out in such a manner that the reader will ingest it just as easily as the real thing."},{"Title":"Cryptid: The Lost Legacy of Lewis & Clark","review":"You have got to love a novel that blends history, science, para-science, and pure fiction so smoothly that it sometimes sends you back to your encyclopedias to see if information it has fed you is true. As it turns out, some of the best things in this novel were entirely untrue and presented so skillfully that you swallow them just as easily as the real stuff.Cryptid begins with the suicide/murder o Meriwether Lewis. Like the assassination of President Kennedy, the Lewis suicide has enough unanswered questions to keep conspiracy theorists spinning, and Penz takes full advantage of the situation. But the book does not meander in the past for long-that suicide is just the James Bond opener that thrusts you into modern-day researchers uncovering a mystery that would send Robert Langdon asking for hints.Pretty soon you are dealing with Sasquatch, government cover ups, and more.

The story was not what I had expected it to be. It was difficult for me to get into the plot because the time span jumped back and forth. The characterization was well done, but I did feel it was a slow process in connecting the characters. Samantha was the character who caught my attention the most, probably because we are both women. She had a very interesting background and a great thirst for more knowledge of the Gigantopithecus americanus. She also had a struggle as to whom she should place her trust in. The fact that her father was dying of cancer at this time added drama. I was glad she was able to reach his bedside before he passed away.The author gave us a picture of greed and the total disregard for human life with the events that played out in the Olympic National Park. While it is no news to most that big business use many soiled tactics to grow and make more millions, it still was a shock at the lengths the logging industry went to, to keep the scientists from discovering the Gigantopithecus. Added to that was the greed of Dr. Prescott to find a cancer cure and gain international attention and the riches it would bring.I found myself drawn in to the plight of the Gigantopithecus to remain alive and the cold calculations of those who wanted him dead. It was a surprise to learn that there were two of them.When Secretary Mason discovered the lost journals of Lewis and though dying himself, took some steps to publicize them, it added a new twist to the story. I found the many murders conducted by those wanting to covers the discovery and line their pockets to be sickening. The story ending left it to the reader to decide what they want to happen. Perhaps that is a good thing because the legend of the Sasquatch is not done.My feeling about the story in \\"Cryptid: The Lost Legacy of Lewis & Clark\\" is that the plot moved much too slowly and took too long to connect the characters. I would have preferred to have had this written in regular story form rather than as journals (by several people). Being a woman I was happiest that Ian did not die and he and Samantha came together again with some mystery still remaining.Received book free of charge."},{"Title":"DVD Studio Pro 2 Solutions","review":"A great reference tool that's much more informative and instructional than the documentation in Apple's DVDSP manual.

A veces, la brevedad en el tratamiento de ciertos temas podr&iacute;a dar lugar a malos entendidos; por ejemplo, &iquest;qu&eacute; quiso decir el autor con la expresi&oacute;n \\"romper el sello del Esp&iacute;ritu Santo\\" (p&aacute;gina 213)?Tal vez, para muchos la mayor&iacute;a de los problemas surja en la parte dedicada a la doctrina del Esp&iacute;ritu Santo, en donde el autor sostiene la doctrina pentecostal del bautismo del Esp&iacute;ritu Santo con la evidencia de hablar en lenguas como investidura para el servicio. En este caso, el autor solo expone la postura de quienes defienden este punto de vista, pero omite la de quienes piensan lo contrario.Sin embargo, creo que este libro tiene muchas cosas positivas si se lee con una mente abierta y un criterio acad&eacute;mico.

Hawkes deftely succeeds in providing a review of the history of the term and in the process the evolution of modern philosophy and thought. I recommend to my students all the time especially those still grappling with the intricate concept of ideology."},{"Title":"Ideology (The New Critical Idiom)","review":"I have to concur with the other two reviewers, though ten stars seems a bit exaggerated. Only a bit. In this brilliant work, Hawkes looks at ideology and its discontents starting with the Old Testament and going right up to the Post-Modernists: Foucault, Baudrillard, Negri and Hardt. Hawkes takes a dialectical approach to his subject, maintaining that ideology is the result of the denial of the binary between materialism and idealism, object and subject, respectively, that goes back to the early Greek philosophers. Nevertheless, in the introduction, Hawkes leads us to believe that the \\"main argument of the book is that the postmodern sign, whether financial or linguistic, is epistemologically false and ethically degenerate,\\" and while he provides a convincing case, it doesn't seem to me to be the \\"main argument\\" of the book, but one conclusion drawn from what seems to me to be the real argument: that dialectical logic is a preferred tool for understanding and ordering reality as well as a necessary corrective for philosophical systems (ideologies) that rest on half-truths or denied binaries. In a related theme, Hawkes traces back to Aristotle the problem of use versus exchange value, showing the latter to be the basis for \\"false consciousness\\" and this leads him to his conclusions about \\"false and ethically degenerate\\" postmodernism. He must have really taken a hit for those views in academia, but he makes a great, respectfully executed -- and I would say, also, convincing-- case for his view.My only real criticism of the book is the ending. I recognize that he's dealing with ideology here, and he needs to end on that note, but after defining \\"ideology\\" as the denial of one element of a binary, and then reading his ending where he says that the \\"real site of political struggle is the human mind\\" and that the \\"external struggle between social classes has, in our time, reverted to an ideological conflict manifested internally,\\" I'm quite annoyed and perplexed. While I'm delighted he's affirmed the subjective and ideal, on the other hand, after two hundred pages, here we are again affirming only one side of the binary and repressing the other, in this case, the \\"external objective material\\" in favor of the internal, subjective ideal. One would hope that a writer who has made such a strong argument in favor of contending with binary oppositions, contradictions and dialectics, would in the end demonstrate that argument with a closing statement that was dialectical. After all, couldn't the \\"real site of political struggle\\" also be in the external objective, material reality of the streets and the struggle between social classes? Like say, between the bankers and the people?Still, that being said, this is a fabulous work and well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Ninth Man (Collier Spymasters Series)","review":"Lots of fun.

I reached a point where I was ready to move from applied texts to the more cryptic world of math texts written for graduate mathematicians. Unfortunately, I was not properly trained to decypher their special language and way of doing things, particularly that of the formal proof. I found reading introductory texts in analysis to be like trying to learn Japanese from books which were themselves written in Japanese. Then I found this wonderful little text.

The case studies are particularly valuable in that they provide real-world applications of creating interactive and adaptive audio for the top games.As a music composer for games, I highly recommend this book to both those who are currently developing audio content and to those aspiring to create audio for games."},{"Title":"DirectX 9 Audio Exposed: Interactive Audio Development","review":"T IS THE BESTSD BOOK . ***** I RECCOMENDS IT I CAN USE DMP FINALLY!"},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"It is true. Clancy strays from his normal hero storyline. I am reading it right now and I just read the part where they attempted to catch the hacker, which kept me reading past 11:00 PM. This book has alot of settings with different characters in each one, I am not finished, but I think all the people meet near the end. My Conclusion, If you like Net Force, You need this!"},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"Night Moves was definitely different from Clancy's previous books. The first element that was missing was the presence of a central hero. There were too many quasi good guys and as it was pointed out earlier, the evil computer genus was killed by a bad guy thug. And yes, a lot of the story touched the borders of reality.That being said, and the fact that I am not a computer programmer, I happened to enjoy Night moves. Even with the absence of a hero, the minor heroes (Jay Gridly)were very entertaining. While not being realistic, I did find the hunt for the hacker in VR to be a good special effect so to speak.Clancy shifted gears with the Net Force series, and if you liked the first books, you will like this one.I also must agree with a fellow reviewer with respect to the boomerang side story. I kept thinking that the kids were going to become hostages or somehow partake in the action. I was wrong. Nothing of the sort happened. They were just page fillers.All in all I would recommend this story. I must warn you though that it is not the typical Clancy book."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"I've read many of Tom Clancy's books, and enjoyed many of them.But not this one! This is simply the worst Tom Clancy book I have read. The highly technical descriptions that I count on from Clancy are missing from this book. Most glaringly, the virtual reality descriptions in this book are simply not believable."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"Having read one of Clancy's previous novels as well as seeing the Net Force movie despite a friend's advice, I found some of this novel really good reading. The side plot of Jay Gridley was great. And the Rushkyo guy was fun to read too.However, the very ending of the book, about Alex and Toni and Alex's ex-wife left me perplexed... where is Clancy going with this! Other than &quot;humanizing&quot; some of the characters as one other reviewer mentioned, I'm not sure that it's entirely relevant. Same with the boomerang kids. Unless they're going to jack into VR and help their parents solve some crime, it's not really needed in the storyline.All in all, not a bad book, but not a great one either."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"I've always been a huge Clancy fan, and admired the way he could take a multitude of complex plot sequences and tie them into a coherent and exciting tale. His Net Force (this book included) hasn't let me down. If you are looking for the grinding detail and intricate plot that is Classic Clancy though, this might not be for you. It you want something fun and easy to read this was great...I enjoyed getting to know the characters better. Only drawback to this book was that it didn't quite have the bite of the first &amp; second in the series."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"This book is devoid of Clancy. There is no hero. The villian is vanquished by another villian, who is vanquished by ANOTHER villian. The depiction of cyberspace patrol, even in a VR world is totally unrealistic. The Net Force team gets absolutely nowhere with their case.The reading is slow, the action boring, and the supposed good guy loses out in the end.There's even a totally unrelated side plot consisting of a petty teen relationship.Definately NOT Clancy's team's best. Clancy is know for being realistic and having done his homework. This book is not worthy of that name.If there were a zero star rating, this book would get it."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"A great listen to CD in a car.

Great entertainment"},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"Annotation:A super genius computer hacker tries to take over the world by takeing over major computers across the globe. The Net Force opperatives must track him down and stop him before it is to late.Autor Bio:The book Net Force Night Moves was written by Tom Clancy. Tom Clancy is the number one on New York Times best selling authors. Tom has created many books that envolve a form of law enforcement that has to take down the terriost threat. He is a great author.Evaluation:The book Net Force Night Moves was an all around good book. It took a little bit of time before the book got started before i got interested in it. Also I would get confused when the charcters would jump in and out of the virtual reality when trying to catch the hacker. The characters in the story were decent, they all worked well with the way the book was put together. I like Tom Clancy and the way his stories are very intersting.I would recommend this book to a person who likes a twisted computer hacker story."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"Some may call Night Moves the less-than-expected sequel to Clancy's Op Center series. For those who enjoy Clancy's precison detail to technical issues, this book glazed over some action that could have been better elaborated on. Night Moves was more black and white when it came to &quot;good vs. bad,&quot; without the strata of conflict his characters often face. The only exception was the personal conflict characters like Toni and Alex face, which may make this an excellent read for those who felt a little intimidated by Clancy's previous works."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"As other reviews have already noted this book is a decent read but definitely not up to Clancy's usual caliber. I would venture to say that this is due to the fact that although Clancy's name graces the front cover... it's not written by Tom Clancy. The Netforce series, whether general fiction or young adult, look to me to be written mostly by ghost writers. Steve Perry is in charge of the current &quot;Netforce&quot; general fiction, while a whole host of others handle the young adult &quot;Netforce Explorers&quot; series. It seems a little underhanded but that's marketing for you... Tom Clancy sells, Joe Nobody sits on bookstore shelves and gathers dust.As for my review of this particular novel, I enjoyed it for the most part. It was a definite improvement over the second book in the series and I particularly enjoyed the reappearance of the Russian assassin from the first novel. Over all, not a bad book, but if your looking for a true Clancy novel, don't let the name fool you.As a side note, if you're looking for a good cyber-thriller I'd recommend Virtually Eliminated by Jefferson Scott."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"OK I'm a CS Graduate so a lot of the technical stuff in this book made sense(The &quot;Quantum Computer&quot; is as of now just a theory).The book though seemed to bog down with personal details, how did John Howard's son's social life fit into the plot of the story? Also the little &quot;Love Traingle&quot; didn't add antything to the plot either.Also the &quot;Captains Log&quot; format got a bit weary.The action though was typical Clancy, tight and fast. There just was too much unnecessary development in my opinion."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"The idea of the computer-world being brought to it's knees is an intriguing one. This novel, however, doesn't begin do it justice.I didn't find the characters as well-rounded as other characters that have shown up in Clancy novels, but it could have happened if the writing team had devoted more pages to the book allowing the necessary details that weren't there. Does every female have to be drop-dead gorgeous and every male fantastic in the use of guns?Unfortunately the plot suffers a lack of detail as well.I rated it two stars because I did finish the book in just a few days, but it was not nearly the riveting read that Executive Orders and others were."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"This book keep lagging on about stories that did not even include the main plot of the story. Many of them about some pretty dumb relationships. The ending was not as exciting as other Clancy books so to get to my point..Don't waste your time on this book."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"Most of these other reviewers are right; it's not the greatest book ever written. On the other hand, it kept me up pretty late. You kind of have to read the earlier books to find out what's going on. There is a young boy that had his first heartbreak, A Russian man that they still have to catch from book one. I think what I enjoyed best about the book was that these are starting to become old friends. I wouldn't want to read all the books at once, because then it would become monotonous, but like this is great."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"After reading the first two books in the NetForce series, I was looking forward to this book. I was rather disappointed for two main reasons.First, the entire book deals with a genius hacker who is wreaking havoc all over the world. The problem is that Clancy never tells the reader exactly why the hacker is doing this. We are presented with an extremely wealthy and obnoxious Englishman who is presented as being nostalgic for the good ol' days of the British Empire. He is financing a genius computer whiz who is taking out communications satellites, airline and train computers, etc. causing hundreds, if not thousands of deaths, but that's it. We're told what they are doing, but never told why they are trying to destroy the world's computer infrastructure. A man doesn't spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build a super computer that can break any encrypted code and cause such trouble just for the heck of it. He has to have a reason. Not being given a reason was aggravating.Second, I understand the need for the personal relationship struggles between Alex and Toni. Real people wrestle with personal relationships even if they are battling mad hackers in virtual reality Wonderland. On the other hand, this type of novel does not need to turn into a Harlequin Romance Series, and by the end of the book, it was getting close.If Clancy can get back to the point of the series, and have the NetForce fighting computer terrorists with an actual motive for what they are doing, it will be a great relief.I usually save my books for later reading. I read this one on a cruise and just donated it to the ship's library. It isn't good for much unless you are interested in following the ups and downs of Alex and Toni's love life."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"THIS BOOK WAS MUCH LIKE THE SOAP OPERAS THAT CLOG UP OUR AIRWAVES. IT HOPPED AROUND AND HAD POOR CHARACTER GENERATION. IT WAS ALSO REMINISCENT OF THE FANTASY SERIES &quot;SHADOWRUN&quot; W/O THE MAGIC. NOT WHAT I HAVE COME TO EXPECT OF THIS AUTHOR'S WRITINGS, BUT WE ALL HAVE A BAD DAY. UNFORTUNATELY MINE WAS CAUSED BY READING THIS BOOK. ON THE PLUS SIDE IT WAS STILL BETTER THAN MOST AUTHORS' GOOD BOOKS."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"Tom Clancy should fire his ghostwriter before he puts him out of business. I found this book almost impossible to read. The characters were bad and the plot was terrible. I hope he starts taking his writing career a little more serious. I pray that Bear and the Dragon were written by the old Tom Clancy."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"The book makes for light entertainment, but does not compare with previous works. The virtual reality sceneario of catching a computer hacker is an interesting way to depict a very complex and technical operation.To me, factual correctness is important in a novel. In London, patrons do not spill out of a pub after midnight, as described in the book. The pubs close at 11:00 pm, and most Londoners make it home before midnight because the Underground stops running at midnight. Only a few nightclubs have licenses to remain open till 3:00 or 4:00 am."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"Having experience in reading other Tom Clancy works, I can safely say that this is not one of his better works. The overall plot and idea of the novel is one that would work, if it had been thought out better, have been a bestseller in itself. However, because of this being a part of a series all based on the same group encountering different entanglements, it is easily seen that this novel was written on the fly, without a lot a regard to classic writing. There are many parts of this novel that could have been left out and the book either remain the same caliber or have gotten better. A couple of these items included the sexual-enticements by co-workers and the placement of the commander's son in a boomerang competition and being in a new school. For a novel that is placed in a time when sexual harassment in the workplace, what is it saying when a member of a government department engages in more than that while on the job. Also, what is the point in placing the commander's son in this novel? Other than showing how John Howard does have a son and how little he is around him, it does nothing for the essential plot of capturing a criminal. This plot has the beginnings of something great; however, it falls a little short of being a work that could be noticed in the world of literature."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"As a MAJOR Clancy fan, I found this disappointing. I felt the &quot;Romance&quot; between Alex and Toni, flat and boring, the tenison ie:jealousy too contrived. Now the &quot;love&quot; interest with the teens had more substance and validity. I found the Cyber RW vs VR entertaining and some of the most interesting chapters of this book. I was also very beguiled by the Russian assassin, felt his pain and sadness. Intrigued by his abilities, what does it take to make a human into this kind of killing machine? None of which was clearly answered in this book."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"There are two primary reasons for not reading this book. The first is that it is totally missing the primary element of the most successful Tom Clancy novels, the fascinating technical detail of the main story line. All you will get in this book of that sort is more information than you ever wanted to know about sights on hand guns. The second is that the main story line is not developed enough to be interesting. A super hacker is disrupting the world's ability to function. Other than describing some of the consequences of that: Airlines aren't flying, you can't transfer money, etc. that's all you get.The computer aspects of this book are atrocious. There is supposed to be a quantum computer involved, but you get no decent development of that point. The search for the hacker is conducted primarily in cyber-space through virtual reality metaphors for big game hunting. To me, that takes something interesting (the hunt for the hacker) and makes it ordinary. This was a terrible plot device.If you are interested in the computer aspects of future crime, this book is a poor representative of what can be done. The book is clearly written for people who have never used a computer. That's a shame.The primary story lines in this book that are worth reading relate to a master assassin who the Net Force wants to interrogate. Some of the scenes here rival The Day of the Jackal. If this had been the whole novel, Clancy and Pieczenik would have had a winner.If you want to read every Clancy novel, go ahead and read this one. If you are not so compelled, go ahead and skip it. This book is resistible."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"Cardinal of the Kremlin, Hunt For Red October, Patriot Games, et al. this is not. The central plot -- one of cyber espionage, those who conduct it and those who investigate it -- is enticing but somehow runs afoul of meaningless, and in some cases crass side stories. Instead of focusing on catching a computer genius bent on upsetting world order, protagonist Alex Michaels is locked in a seedy triangle: gain custody of his daughter from his former wife following an acrimonious divorce, maintain &quot;relations&quot; with Toni his martial arts lover, and dodge the tempting sexual advances of a British agent. It becomes quickly obvious that Michaels isn't bright enough to solve a computer crime and, indeed, Clancy depends on a cast of others to do the heavy lifting in this dime novel. Col. Howard, an African American leader of the Net Force tactical team is perhaps the best character in the book; certainly the most human. But his son's boomerang fetish and own love interests are hardly relevant except to humanize the Colonel. Between the Zen, Guru, martial arts philosophy and tracking down virtual reality tigers and dinosaurs to counteract the terrorists, I kept hoping for a solid finish. Sadly, the reader is given the standard, brut force SWAT raid on the bad guy's mansion instead of a cleaver computer based bust.In short, Night Moves moves afield of Clancy's other tight, gripping novels. His Net Force and Ops books clearly take him away from the quality, well reasoned novels of the past and move him into the mass production trash that litters the bookshelves."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"This is the very first Clancy novel I've tried and I wasn't much impressed. Basically a Sidney Sheldon melodrama with some science fiction tacked on. Also there were some unnecessary subplots that were weak and irrelevant (the colonel's son, the agent's love triangle, the female monk...). These took the edge away from what I thought was going to be a to-the-point, intense SciFi-thriller. Not a complete waste of time, but not time well spent."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"This can't be a Tom Clancy book - it's simply appalling! Frankly I was more than dissappointed - I feel ripped off having wasted my time reading this. Until this book I was a Tom Clancy fan - now I doubt I'll read another of his books (certainly none of the Net Force series).The plot (if you can call it that) is hopeless, characters are 1 dimensional, and the purile sub-plot about inane high school kids romance is irrelevent.Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"Reading this book was a complete waste of time. I am a fan of REAL Tom Clancy writings. Unfortunately, his major success and the book company's greed (and perhaps his own) to capitalize on his name every which way possible has yielded &quot;Clancy Seconds&quot; such as this book. If you have ever read real Clancy writings, you will know that he clearly had nothing to do with this book other than lending his name to it. I believe he created the concept for NetForce (which started off very well) but now they farm these books out to ghost writers. This book had poor character development and weak story lines. Stick to reading Clancy's major titles which are written only by him."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"I read the first book in the net force series, and I thought that it was ok but that it just wasn't up to par. I haven't bothered to even read the next two in the series, but from what I have heard, they are worse than the first one. I think, just like a lot of other Tom Clancy fans that Mr. Clancy needs to stick to writing his own books rather than stamping his name on someone else's book. My advice is that if it says Created by Tom Clancy and... don't read it-yor are just wasting your time. All of Tom's other books that he didn't co-write, such as Clear and Present Danager, are much much better and I would recommend them any day."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"Net Force 3 was the best net force yet. I like the way he makes the characters more real than he does in his other novels. The plot to set the world into conflict was brilliant and also different because istead of the usual Russian, Chinese, or Arab villian you have an Englishman."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed Net Force: Night Moves other that one thing. The primarial focus on Toni Fiorella and Alex Michaels. Come on. Please. Toni won't let Alex explain? She quits her career? That was the bad highlight of the story, the whole Fiorella/Michaels angle. It took up most of the story and stunk the whole place up. However, the central action was exemplary, and We saw Mikhal Ruzhyo return in this thriller. I enjoyed this book based on action. I also liked the part about Tyrone and Nadine. A little high-school never hurt anyone. I do not like Net Force Explorers, because the constant changing of authors and views just ruin it. So far, it's apparent that Tom Clancy is losing his edge on thrillers. I suggest you try 'Tansfer of Power' by Vince Flynn. He is the next coming of Tom Clancy, and only has the tiniest bit of relationships in, not full-blown."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"Have you ever listen to a dishonest politician speak. That's the feeling I got from this audio book. It's like you asked a legitimate question, and he is going round and round with you and giving you stuff that is hardly relevant to the subject matter. If there is a rating for minus stars, I will give it the -5 stars. One audio tape would have been more than enough for it. Tom Clancy is getting greedy."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"There was once a time when I was an avid Tom Clancy reader and even put up with the Op Center series which was far below what I saw as the Clancy standard. Net Force is another case entirely. This series, and this book in particular, is terrible. The plots are ridiculous, the characters are shallow and unsympathetic, the writing is formulaic and overall it appears that the authors &quot;phoned it in&quot;. No more for me!"},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"I've read some of his other books that have been better. The story was a little disjointed. He had some characters like Mikhaly Ruzhyo, and a few others that had great potential, but he got too many things going at the same time and too little time for each of them to develop properly. I did like the way he portrayed Lord Coswell, the English billionaire. He figured he was a law unto himself and seems to have gotten away with murder (kinda like what's happening here in the United States). I enjoyed the book but it wasn't his best."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"Not up to Clancy standards. The main premise is compelling- What might happen if a technological advancement were developed which could quickly break large prime number encryption, upon which the security of the world depends? A real theoretical possibility... This premise kept me reading right to the anti-climactic end. Some of the characters are interesting, like the Russian fellow who had a great subplot going, but even his ending is a letdown. The 2 main love stories are tiresome, detract from the main plot, and take up way too much ink. The virtual reality subplot is a leap of faith.Not worth reading.Currently reading Without Remorse, which is much better so far."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"Net force Night moves was a very well written descriptive book, but I have to say it is not one of his best, compared to his other books I have read, this one was not as action packed and thrilling as his others, Though I did enjoy reading it very much, I think it could of used some more action in it. Net Force: Night s about a futuristic agency created by the FBI, which patrols the Internet. The main story is about a deranged Englishman who wishes to restore England to the world power it once was. The Englishman hires a scientist who creates a supercomputer, which is capable of throwing cyberspace into chaos and cracking anything thrown in its direction. Net Force's main computer man suffers a stroke in the VR (or virtual reality world) while hunting down the Englishman's scientist. I think Clancy is like the master of these kinds of plots or story's. He has the unusual ability to mix in the love problems of Net Force's boss and second-in-command with the main storyline. Clancy is the top gun when it comes to the military thriller and his sidekick Steve Pieczenik is the master of the geo-political chess game. Net Force: Night Moves will keep you on the edge of your seat, if you are really into Clancy's book's and also things about the future, you most likely won't be able to put this book down until you reach the end. Clancy shows puts overshadowing of what the world is going to become, and it is almost scary because it is some what right in that in the future computers will technically run the world, and every thing will be controlled by computers. Although this seems like almost some kind of nerd book it is not, there all lots of cool new inventions in weapons and things like that Clancy throw in there, and there are some really descriptive scenes, just like any other Clancy book .I did really like it and there were lots of cool things in it and some action scenes but I think it could of used more action, for a reader like me, I am really into those books previously written by Clancy like Patriot games or Clear and Present Danger. But if you enjoy Clancy's Net Force series, then you need to read this one. And when you read if you do enjoy it, here are some other Clancy novels you'll enjoy: Net Force: Hidden Agendas; Op-Center: Balance of Power; Op-Center: Games of State; Power Plays: Shadow Watch; and any other of the Op-Center, Power Plays, or Net Force novels."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"Now don't get me wrong. I love Clancy's work dearly.

This book could have been doon in 100 hundred pages. And what the heck is Howard's kid doing taking up page space to dote on &quot;Who is the girl of my dreams?&quot; Nobody cares. Also it had a few too many &quot;Hot&quot; scenes. Come on. These people are profesianals. They don't try to lure co-workers to having sex with them on massage tables. And the perfect Spetznatz agent who can shoot the barreles of five CIA agents before they can blink is an annoying character who lacks deph. The only thing this book is good for is kindling.

Moksha actually means &quot;release from the cycle of life and death&quot;."},{"Title":"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, Book 3)","review":"Diction, different ways of speaking a language, and dialect, the author's word choice, all affect this novel extremely. Because of the fact that it has a dual setting in both England, and Quantico, Virginia, make the author's word choice one of the only ways that the reader can discern between the two settings.In this passage, the diction used implies that we are in the U.S. \\"You're in the Neuro Ward at the base hospital. You had a CVA, a cerebrovascular accident. A stroke.\\" Compare that to a different passage a little bit farther along. \\"Not much, my boy. I was ringing you up to see about that, ah . . .small matter we discussed recently over supper.\\" What a difference! Just by reading the two quotes, one can immediately distinguish that the first was set in an Army Base, in America. The second set in a castle in England. The use of the words my boy, ringing, and supper insinuate that the reader is now in a different place, where people speak with different drawl.The dialect used in this novel also helps us distinguish from the settings, but it also allows the reader to discern between the upper and lower classes. For example: \\"Oh, and Applewhite? Se if you can't drum up major Peel. If you should happen across him, tell him his lord wishes to dine with him.\\" Compare that to this quote. \\"Come on ya blimey old codger! Give us your money afore we beat your bloody coat red!\\" This almost automatically allows the reader to tell that the first was the higher class, and the second, the lower.Diction and dialect were two dreadfully important literary devices in this novel. Had the author not used these devices, the readers mind would be a jumble of places, and people."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"I know this sounds like all the rest but this woman writes a terrific book!The tension, mystery and problem solving skills are exceptional. 5 Stars to you and keep them coming!!"},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"Yes, I read two of this author's newest books in a row; that won't happen too often.On a cold, snowy January night, Supreme Court Associate Justice Stewart Califano is garroted in the Supreme Court Building (so much for tight security).

Her imaginative stories and interesting fully developed characters were intriguing with only the slightest hint of political bias. Now the depth of character and plot have dimenished drastically and the political self-righteousness has taken over. If I could give it less than one star I would."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"I love the Sherlock/Savich series, but I had problems with this one. First of all, I felt that a psychic experience was out of place. Sherlock and Savich are professionals; the ghost story line didn't fit in. Secondly, there were a lot of contradictions in the book. For example, I didn't buy that the judge married Callie's mother to get to her. It didn't jive. Callie respected the judge and was intuitive enough to know if he was interested in her or not. There was no evidence that he was.I, especially, disliked the way things were tied up at the end. The last quarter of the book didn't fit with the first three.So many of my favorite authors are cranking books out due to publisher induced deadlines. They suffer as a result."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"This is advertised as an FBI thriller, but I was not thrilled. I like most books that I read, so it is a rare experience to find one that seems to have no redeeming value. What will you find if you read this story? First, you will not find a plot. Someone murders an Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court, but nothing much happens until the author gives us a dull, improbable ending. Second, the dialog is unbelievable. Listen to people in conversation around you. Each person's speech has a distinctive voice. Most writers spend huge amounts of time learning to write exciting dialog. Not so with this book. The characters all sound the same. Finally, the author throws in an extra story, a sappy tale about ghosts that appears to have no connection to the main story. This is the first of Coulter's books that I have read. Perhaps her other books are wonderful, but until someone persuades me that they are, this will be the last one that I read. There are far too many fascinating authors out there."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"THROUGH THE YEARS I'VE READ, RE READ AND KEPT SEVERAL OF C.C.

The haunted part of the book is so pathetic that you can skip it just when you start reading it. It doesn't have any sense and it was written just to fill more pages in the book.When you read a spies' book and the FBI doesn't had any lead to the killer and the killer just give up because he thinks that he doesn't have to live anymore is pathetic, and more if this killer is an expert sniper and turned down the FBI twice before.The plot is interesting and will keep you reading until the end, but at the end you'll be so disappointed that you'd have thought that you'd never have read this book.

If your house was shot up by a gun-toting maniac, would you rush to the kitchen for paper towels to mop up a coffee spill? The characters' dialogue is stilted, inappropriate at times, and totally inane. FBI agents sobbing in each others' arms? I think not--agents have nails and gunpowder for breakfast. It seemed as if Coulter did little or no research in order to bring credibility to her characters. While promoting her book, Coulter touted her book as being better then Dan Brown's DaVinci Code; she can only wish it were. A total flop."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"I have read all of Catherine's FBI thrillers and have to say this is not one of her better writings. She entwines two tales in one story that have nothing remotely to do with each other and it just kind of leaves you mixed up. Wondering when she was going to touch on the other story she was trying to tell. It seemed to drag on and on...and that is one quality in book that I do not enjoy.

Zero connection between the 2 plots (except that Savich is working on both of them). Author shows almost no understanding of how the courts and FBI actually operate. The dialog is so trite & junior-high-schoolish that it's embarassing (\\"I'll tell you I love you if you'll say it at the same time.\\")Yuck! Get me outta here."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"This is a poorly crafted excuse for an F.B.I. story.

If I could have awarded it a zero star rating, I would have.The initial premise is interesting: A Justice of the US Supreme Court is murdered in the Supreme Court building itself.But after that, disaster. Two plots, utterly unrelated. Poor character development. The action doesn't flow-it starts and then stops. And when action occurs, it's over in about 2 pages, getting you back to inane plots. The end never really is revealed.And for some reason, the author is very annoying as she insists upon making up the names of a lot of streets in Washington, DC. Why invent street names, when a simple glance at a map reveals plenty of real street names to choose from. Inventing new one is more work that reading a map!In short, read the first line again."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"I am a Catherine Coulter fan but I have to say this is one of the worst books I have ever listened to.

The book is typical of the FBI series, and following well known characters is fun. However, after Savage and Sherlock spend a whole book chasing the killer of a supreme court justice, the motivations given by the killer in the final scenes is anticlimatic, furthered by a plot twist that had the potential to be huge, but was largely dismissed. It was a good read, just left me a feeling a little let down with the ending."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"This was the first book from CC I ever read, and I won't be looking for another one. The plot is thin and there is simply no actual problem solving. The protagonists come to decisions simply \\"because\\". The use of the MAX computer to find the murder - OMG, what a cheesy resource... The ending is also probably one of the weakest I have ever seen, unexpected in a bad way, disconnected to all the previous threads she mentions througout the book. In short: don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"I just finished \\"Blowout\\" and I liked it for the most part. As in every book, there were a couple things that were distracting. For me the whole Supernatural thing could have been left out but I didn't hate it either. I enjoyed reading about the workings of the Supreme Court. There were a few times that I was confused as to who was talking and would have to skip back up a paragraph. I have read the reviews and some hated it and some loved it. That's what makes the world go round-we all see things differently. Someone said Savitch and Sherlock are played out. There I disagree. That is why I continue to read the FBI series is to read about them. The other characters are just secondary to me. I will say I was a bit surprised as to the ending of the thriller and why the people were murdered. I expected something deeper I guess for the death of all those people and so brutal. Also I didn't feel a deep connection between Callie and Raven. That was too rushed seeing as how they didn't even like each other in the beginning and this all takes place in a matter of days. However, that seems to be CC's style so that's okay even to Callie and Raven saying I love you at the same time. Corny maybe but at least different. Unlike some of the other Romance-Thriller authors where the love sceens are all the same and the couples all react the same, at least CC's romances have all been a bit different. Sometimes there is no love scenes, but just mentioned. I have liked the fact every book in the FBI series has been different. Some I liked better than others. I'm probably not as critical when I'm reading fiction-it's not Rocket Science-just fiction. I will admit I skim if it gets too long or one scene goes on too long. I will read the rest of the Series as long as Savitch and Sherlock continue to be a part of them. I enjoy their relationship even if some think it corny. I understand CC is working on the 12th book of the series. Could that be the end??? Gilbert Morris once did a series of 40 books (and I read them all)but spanned several generations."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"I loved the carracters in Blowout Dillon Savage and Lacey Sherlock.

I have read each one of Coulter's FBI thrillers, and BLOW OUT didn't disappoint. There are other books that are better, but I don't know why the angry reviews some posted. I really enjoyed the Callie Ben relationship and thought Mrs. Califano's friends were like the ya-ya sisterhood. The story lines were as clever and tricky as usual. I'm waiting for the next one!"},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"Hey, if you can, hey, read this book and, hey, believe the dialogue, hey, good for you. I have never, hey, ever seen an author abuse the word &quot;Hey&quot; so much in my life. People don't talk like this in real life, hey. (Hey, people don't even really talk like this, hey, in unreal life, hey!)I am unlike most of the reviewers here in that I actually liked the storyline, which to me *was* believable. The interaction between Callie and Ben seemed to follow along at a good pace although there was room for more romance and character development. I even liked the Samantha Barrister storyline.I have noticed a trend in Ms. Coulter's FBI works: the conversation is stilted and sometimes completely inappropriate to the situation. If, however, she would just drop about 250 uses of the word &quot;Hey&quot; in each of her stories, I would be more inclined to overlook the less than stellar character development."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"I won't buy Coulter books any more. The dialog is incredibly bad the plot lines are non-existant. What was with the \\"ghost\\"? Why title the book \\"blowout\\" when the story revolves around the murder of the Supreme Court Justice.

Not even worth checking out for free at the library."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"This may be the most tedious book I've ever read. The plot meandered through unnecessary people and events until almost the last page. I couldn't even really tell who the main characters were.

In the past, Catherine Coulter has kept me on the edge of my seat with her plot and character development. This book had me struggling to stay awake. \\"Blow Out\\" is just that, a blow out."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"I was very disappointed in Coulter's latest work. She took a potentially complex story and &quot;shrink wrapped&quot; it. How naive does she think we are? Then to add the paranormal story was just too much. It was almost embarassing. Are the editors reading this stuff before they publish it; or do they believe that we will read anything by certain authors? It is insulting. I was expecting much better from a very good author. But lately many of these popular authors have been just going through the motions and not really trying to give something new. They just need to bring out a new book every year. Do us a favor and take your time."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"I told myself if someone \\"fanned their hands in front of themselves\\" one more time, I would quit. This happened 3 times by page 57. The plot is dumb, I couldn't stay focused; the dialogue is terrible; I don't know that I will ever try another by this author. (Don't think that I am a literary snob, I read nearly everyone: Hillerman, Connelly, Cornwell, Woods, Patterson, Coben, etc.)I have (begun to) read some bad books in my life, and I have read some good books. I know the difference.... I certainly don't recommend this one."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"Where to start? This book is a mess. A total mess. I can't decide what was more disappointing, the poorly conceived plot and subplot, the random events that can't pass as \\"plot twists\\" the underdeveloped characters, or the stilted dialogue. There was no flow or cohesiveness to the story, the writing itself was disjointed, and the characters make incredible leaps in logic that are unexplained and unbelievable.The Story & Characters: By the end, there are too many loose ends still dangling about, which is inexcusable in a 356 page novel. I liked the chemistry between Ben Raven, one of the minor characters who should have been a major character, and Callie, but their romance was rushed and left me sad that the author didn't take the time to bring them to the forefront and develop their relationship. They were the only reason I kept reading. Sherlock and Savich were there, the super crime fighters, and again we see them without flaws or human characteristics that might make them more accessible as characters. They have the best equipment, super computer programs he invents, and after meeting people she can just know them as if she was reading their minds. It's incredibly difficult to read and care about characters who can do anything and everything. We cannot even see thought processes or how they come to the incredible conclusions they do. Their leaps are logic could span the Grand Canyon. And the subplot with the ghost? Completely out of place, unnecessary, and ridiculous.The Writing: I think the last time I read writing this sophomoric, I was a sophomore in high school. Besides switching points of view whenever the mood strikes, I was surprised the author's use of:He said \\"Blah\\"She said \\"Blah blah\\"The other guy said \\"No Way.\\"Don't believe me? Page 290, 291. It's all he said he said she said. Hard to read, annoying to follow, and fails to hold this reader's interest. The dialogue is wooden throughout the story, and every character has the same speaking voice, which makes it difficult to differentiate between them. After awhile, I stopped caring what he said, what he said, and what he said.This is only the second FBI book I have read and it's clear they are missing the flair she has for Regencies.

The ending is not only predictable, but lame. I have nothing intellgent to say about this book because it was soooo bad."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"Talk about a huge waste of time. There are basically two separate plots in the book: one involving a ghost haunting an FBI agent and another where the same FBI agent is investigating the death of a Supreme Court Justice. The only connecting thread between the two loosely woven plots was that the same FBI agent was working on both cases. That's it. The title of the book has no bearing whatsover on the main focus of the book - the Justice's murder. The \\"blow out\\" refers to the ghostly plot, which in fact, is miniscule both in scale and importance to the entire book. The respective endings of both plots were so unbelievably anti-climatic, I kept turning pages just to see if there really was \\"more.\\" There wasn't. This is the first and last book I'll ever read by this author.

I was looking forward to this book because I buy all of her books. It took me a minute to get into the book, and besides that I was very easily interrupted. It did not capture my imagination. I could not believe that they brought a person who is on a hit list into their home even though they have a son they love so much. The book was all over the place. All of a sudden, MAX came up with the name of the murderer, just like that. It was just so out there. I liked the Samantha Barrister secondary plot line better than the main plot. Maybe that should have been the main plot. It was hard to believe that the judge was having an affair. The way everyone described him as being private and waiting patiently to marry his wife, does not jibe with him being an adulterer. Instead of paying your hard earned money, I would go to the library and check it out."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"The whole time I read this book I was thinking, &quot;Are they kidding?

Here are a couple...1) The dialog is so unbelievable that I was laughing. The characters are too long winded. 2) The main plot-line was horrible. You couldn't even GUESS who did it because they just picked the bad guy out of thin air at the end! And the reason why he did it was laughable. 3) CC needs to research police policies...no Cop would EVER, I mean EVER blurt out every single detail of the investigation to a reporter, victim family members, and other suspects in the case.

Lots of mystery and intrigue and great escapism."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"FBI agent Dillon Savich is driving down an isolated stretch of road on the way to meet his wife, Lacey Sherlock, and their son, Sean, for a much-needed vacation. Suddenly, a woman jumps into his car's path and causes a near accident. He chases her to a large estate home. She is obsessed with a man inside who is trying to kill her. When Savich tries to help her, she flees in terror. Savich's call for help with the local Sheriff gets sympathy but no definitive action. According to Sheriff Doozer Harms, the Barrister house on Clayton Road has been abandoned and vacant. The young woman Savich described with excellent detail was Samantha Barrister, murdered thirty years earlier.The following morning, his getaway grinds to a halt when a phone call summons both him and his agent wife back to Washington, D.C. Supreme Court Justice Stewart Califano is dead, murdered in the Supreme Court Library. The Saviches are in charge of the federal investigation and will work with local detective Ben Raven. Califano's death is brutal; he was garroted by a thin wire. The murderer is a professional. To complicate matters, Justice Califano's stepdaughter, Callie Markham, is a crack journalist on the Washington newspaper's staff. Raven accepts her help with family information when she becomes a willing sidekick after taking a leave of absence from her job.Eight previous well-received FBI thrillers give author Catherine Coulter credibility in BLOWOUT, a fast-moving but logical mystery. The right amount of leakage makes the reader lean one way toward the crime's solution, then veer in another when clues lead in a different direction. Savich's encounter with the &quot;dead woman&quot; on the moonlit road in rural Pennsylvania is a nagging unfinished piece to a complicated puzzle.The murdered Justice leaves a trail of questionable companions, his three legal assistants at the top of the list. When two of them come up dead, the FBI struggles to keep the third, Elaine LaFleurette, alive. Meanwhile, clues lead to the murderer, a contract killer who has been silent for more than a decade. Savich stays a step ahead of Gunter Grass, the suspected killer, when he hides LaFleurette in his home. But rapid-fire events compromise their safety.The Justice's widow has a close-knit circle of four long-time friends: Janette Weaverton, Anna Clifford, Juliette Trevor and Bitsy St. Pierre. During the course of the investigation, the four are a formidable group, protecting Margaret Califano from intrusions into her past and present personal life. Their smothering protectorate stifles the agents' forward progress. Markham finds her loyalty to her stepfather's reputation and her love for his memory at odds when confronted by the realities in the case. And she has become more than a sidekick to Ben Raven when their friendship takes a personal turn.Loose ends keep both cases in turmoil until the final interviews conclude. The results are acceptable but not necessarily neat. Coulter writes with vigor, yet is sympathetic to her characters' feelings. For her empathy, she can be allowed to exit with cases solved but not totally resolved. She is a prolific writer, and BLOWOUT leaves a thirst for the next Savich and Sherlock story to unfold from her computer.--- Reviewed by Judy Gigstad"},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"I have read all of the books in Catherine Coulter's FBI series and really enjoy them. They have everything I like for an entertaining read: suspense, mystery, fun/comedy, romance! I love it when Ms. Coulter brings back Savich and Sherlock and also has two new characters who will also get romantically involved. \\"Blowout\\" is a good story on both plot lines, an older unsolved murder and the new present-day murder with a little other-worldliness thrown in.The story begins in the Poconos where FBI agent Dillon Savich is on his way back to the cabin where he, Sherlock and their son Sean are staying for a brief vacation. He is on an icy and snowy road when his tire blows out. After he calls Sherlock to let her know he is delayed and changes the tire, a young woman dressed in a light summer dress comes running out of the woods on the side of the road hysterically screaming that Savich needs to go with her and that someone is going to kill her. Savich gets her in his car and under her direction drives to a nearby side road and down the road a bit to a beautiful mansion on a hill. The lights are all on in the house and a cozy fire burning in the living room. There doesn't appear to be anyone there but Savich takes no chances and has his gun out. He searches downstairs but doesn't find anything or hear anything. The woman is still terrified and crying while sitting on the couch. They hear footesteps -- very loud -- above them. Savich goes upstairs and still can't find anyone although he sees a young boy's room with a sports poster from 1972. Then he hears a loud thump above and he find the attic and goes up the ladder when something whooshes out and knocks him off onto his back. When he gets up and goes back downstairs, the woman is gone. He calls Sherlock and they agree to meet at the Sheriff's office. They ride back out to the house with the Sheriff who has been Sheriff over 30 years in the small town. The Sheriff told them the place was deserted and the owners long moved out. He speculates also and tells them of the young Mrs. Samantha Barrister who was murdered there in 1972. All in all not very satisfying for Savich who cannot sleep well that night.Meanwhile, in Washington D.C., at the Supreme Court Building, another mysterious murder is taking place that same Friday evening around midnight. Supreme Court Justice Stewart Califano is garrotted while in the building's library.The next morning, Savich and Sherlock are called back from vacation to head the investigation so the mysterious woman or ghost? is put on hold. They are glad to work again with their friend from the Metro Police, Det. Ben Raven. None of them are happy that Justice Califano's stepdaughter, Callie Markham who is an investigative report, also insists on helping.To not be a spoiler, I will not say more on the plot except there are more murders and very scary times on the Justice murder investigation and Sherlock works to get information to ease Savich's mind and help resolve the mystery of the murdered Samantha Barrister and why she appeared to him. I think Ms. Coulter has a great imagination as she manages to find totally new villains, plot twists and situations for each of her FBI thrillers. I look forward to reading the next one soon! If you are NOT a Coulter fan, then this may be too light of reading for you!"},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"As usual, superb job.

The victim was a moderate judge with no known enemies and never stirred up any controversy. The only wrong doing they can find is that he is having an affair with Eliza one of his legal aides. His other aides Danny and Fleurette thought their boss walked on water. When the culprit kills Danny and Eliza, the Feds use Fleurette to flush him out but that plan fails almost killing Fleurette, Savitch, Sherlock and Sean. While they try again to capture the killer, Savitch knows that when their ordeal is over, he has a ghost to put to rest.Catherine Coulter can always be counted on to write an exciting romantic thriller. Her protagonists, Savitch and Sherlock are as deeply in love as they were in the first book in this series and their love for their son is a beautiful thing to behold. There is a lot of action and chase scenes in BLOW OUT but the author also concentrates on her characters and how they act and react to certain dangerous situations. This book is sure to make the New York Times Bestseller List."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"I borrowed this book from the public library. I can't believe someone can find a serious publisher to print such a poorly written book and that people will pay real money to buy it."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"I have read all of Coulter's books, some more than once. Her Regency-era romances were usually witty and fun and her early FBI thrillers were actually good. This one is just bad. It had good primeses but bad characterization, bad dialogue, no plot, stupid cops and a spectacularly bad ending. She should never have let this one go to print.By the way, I checked the other reviews written by the three people who have given this book a five-star rating. Who's paying these people? Two of the three have written dozens of reviews, giving nearly every book a five. Either they have no taste or they are shills."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"I shudder when I think of why this alleged \\"author\\" even wrote this pile of C***.What a premise! Murder at the Supreme Court; one Justice killed, his legal clerks are getting bumped off.... ahhhh! how a real who-dunit writer could have developed such a great idea.But what we have here is saccharine-sweet garbage, badly edited at that. No idea about police work, FBI agents crying like babies, and a ridiculouds construct as an end...Don't even read it from the public library; it ain't worth it.I had to give it one star because Amazon would not have accepted it otherwise; also, because Coulter abstained from graphic descriptions of sex, as it seems to be mandated now for woman writers.Otherwise....Gahhhh!"},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"I listened to the audio CD of this book. I have never read anything by Catherine Coulter, but the plot sounded interesting. After listening to this, I will never listen to (or read) another book by Catherine Coulter. I must agree with some of the other reviewers that the dialogue is, at times, cringe-inducing. Who talks like that? I think if I heard the terms &quot;moron,&quot; &quot;jerk,&quot; or &quot;Crown Vic&quot; one more time, I would scream. And, what man in this day and age would think that what he really wanted to was &quot;neck&quot; with his date. It's not that I think vulgar dialogue would have been better, but &quot;neck&quot;? I think it was even worse to hear it out loud rather than in your own mind (thus, my preference to hear nails on a chalkboard). The actions of some of the characters were totally unbelievable. Callie has just broken up with her &quot;jerk&quot; of a boyfriend and finds out her stepfather is brutally murdered and, within days, two more murders follow. Yet, she is flirting with the detective on the case she has only just met. Where is the grief and fear here? A supposedly top FBI agent interviews a witness on two occasions, thinks the witness is a great gal, and when she enters the witness' home shortly after she is killed, touches the victim and cries into her face. Gee, isn't this a crime scene? Bullets are flying into a home and Callie is on the carpet and when asked if she is &quot;sucking&quot; carpet, remarks that the carpet won't have to be vacuumed for a week. Who jokes at a time like that? A very interesting plot dumbed down by really poor writing. I'd definitely skip this one if I were you."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"Savich, Sherlock and their son, Sean, are spending some family time at a cabin in the Poconos. On his way back from the market, Savich's SUV blows a tire. Just as he's done changing it, a woman comes running out of nowhere, not suitably dressed for the weather, screaming about a man in her house. His cell phone all of a sudden not working and unable to call for back-up, Savich goes with the woman back to her house. Making her wait in the living room, he searches the house, and other than a small incident, there's no one there. Exactly no one, for even the woman has disappeared. The house now seems abandoned, as if it had been that way for years. Had Savich actually been talking to a ghost?And just when he tries to convince the local sheriff of what happened, Savich and Sherlock are called back to D.C. to head up the investigation of a murdered supreme court justice, Stewart Califano. He'd been murdered right in the Supreme Court Library, and all they have to go on is the guard who'd been knocked out.Metro detective Ben Raven is helping Sherlock and Savich with the case, the appointed liason between the FBI and Metro police. They met the now widow, Margaret Califano, as well as her daughter, Callie Markham, an investigative reporter for The Washington Post. Taking a leave of absense, she's determined to help the FBI find her stepfather's killer. And now Ben is stuck with her. And that's just the beginning of a spark.Everyone is interviewed, from the other justices, the clerks, family and friends. Then one of Califano's clerks is murdered, the same M.O. With the help of MAX, the computer finds the M.O. matches the M.O. of a killer who hasn't killed in over 20 years. How can that be? Is no one safe and who could be next?**Could have been better. All those interviews and no clues from them. And the more the interviews, the more I started to get bored. They kept revisiting the same information. A few events in the book make you sit up and take notice, just for it to go back to more interviews. And then finally, you get face to face with the killer, and it made no sense - there was no connection between this person and his victims. And just when you're thinking \\"You've got to be kidding me,\\" you read the barest of connections, a rather neat twist, and yet you still don't know much about the killer or who it really was he associated with. Callie finds out by mishap, but doesn't tell, not even Ben.Savich and Sherlock were their usual selves, and I really like them as characters, as man and wife, as mom and dad. We see them more with Sean in this one and I liked that aspect. Callie - I liked her personality; no nonsense, she pushes to get her way. Ben - I liked him as well. Even when he's not happy of being saddled with Callie, he makes the best of it. I liked the banter between them, but that spark you feel at the beginning, stayed just like that. A spark - one. That's it. After that, I felt a camaraderie between them and nothing more.Then there's that twist, and you're thinking \\"Holy Cow!\\", but it stays there. You still don't know who the killer was associated with. While I have an idea, it's not confirmed, and that bothered me.Meanwhile, there's a second, smaller investigation, for the ghost of Samantha Barrister won't leave Savich alone. They do find her son, in a most unusual way, and even solve her murder. I actually enjoyed that part more than the main investigation, and I believe that more could have been added to it and made its own book, I think.While it was good, the book could have been better."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"Many years ago an English professor told a class I attended that we needed to read some really bad books; otherwise, we'd never be able appreciate the good ones. I found that strange at the time and didn't quite subscribe to it. But I realize now that it's valid. And this novel certainly qualifies as a bad book, if only for the sake of comparison with a good thriller, \\"Day of the Jackal,\\" for example.To begin with, the plot of \\"Blowout\\" is preposterous. Both plots, actually, and they never mesh--the ghost of a murdered woman in the Poconos and the murdered justice of the Supreme Court along with his staff. I didn't believe in either one of the plots--especially the ghost of the murdered woman and the \\"explanation\\" for her. There's no point in going into all the wearisome details, except to say that both killers give unbelievable explanations and confessions when a simplr denial would have sufficed.The writing is clumsy, uniformly bad--malaprops, dangling participles, cliches, etc. I can only wonder at the editors who blue penciled this--or didn't bother. They should have cleaned up some of the mess, albeit a Herculean task. The dialogue is stiff and silly, and it's not always certain who is talking--or that it matters. The characters are shallow, posturing, standard issue for this sort of work. Even the justices are bed hopping. There's no real atmosphere. Both solutions are letdowns. I could cite specific examples of all these criticisms, but it's just not worth it.Other reviewers have pointed out that some of the author's other books are better. I do hope so.

The premises of both of the plots, one involving a ghost and another involving the murder of a Supreme Court justice, were quite intriguing. Unfortunately, Coulter resolves both plots with deus ex machina type villains that simply don't ring true. Thrillers are so much more interesting when the villain is right under the reader's nose, instead of thrown in at the end as a hackneyed plot contrivance. Yes, it would have taken a lot more work to make the killer someone that all the characters knew, but that would have made the book excellent, instead of merely passable.That said, this book is an improvement over \\"Blind Side,\\" the last Coulter book I read. But I think that the real problem is that the author needs to find entirely new protagonists, because she's milked Savich and Sherlock for as much as she can get out of them, and while the earlier books in this series were stellar, the concept has simply run out of steam."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"the book itself was a bit disappointing when all was said and done.

The main plot was a huge let down."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"Another great mystery in the FBI series from Catherine Coulter. You won't want to put this book down until you've finished reading it."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"ELEVENTH HOUR by Catherine Coulter was the subject of the third review that I wrote for Amazon (8/28/02), and while my five star rating might be a little generous by my current standards I enjoyed the book immensely. Despite mixed reviews, its bestseller status indicated that many other readers shared my opinion. It made me want to learn more about the adventures of (Dillon) Savich and (Lacey) Sherlock, the husband and wife team who are the two main characters in Coulter?s ?FBI Thriller Series?. I was especially intrigued by the ?two for one? aspect of the story; there were two mysteries to be solved that were cleverly woven together as an integral element of the plot. Therefore, I eagerly awaited the next entry in the series, BLINDSIDE (review 7/28/03); unfortunately, while it bore superficial resemblance to the earlier book, the storytelling and the editing were very disappointing and the second mystery was seemingly included as an afterthought. Much to my disappointment, BLOW OUT, the latest installment in the series is even more poorly written and edited. It appears that the author and her publisher have decided that Sherlock and Savich have such a loyal fan club that a peremptory effort at telling a story and the continuation of the two-for-one mystery format will be sufficient inducement for her loyal readers. Well, I am officially going on strike with regard to the purchase of future books in this series until I read some glowing reviews by reviewers whose judgment I trust. I will instead content myself by reading some of Coulter?s much more highly praised earlier stories.As my review title indicates, my greatest disappointment with regard to this story is that with a little additional effort and a lot better job of editing this could have been a first rate book. For some reason, perhaps to grab the reader?s interest, the book opens with a riveting action sequence which turns out to part of an interesting but totally peripheral plot. Savich encounters an apparition and gets involved in an unsolved murder that occurred thirty years ago. It almost seems that perhaps this story began as the author?s primary interest but she wasn?t sure that she could turn it into a believable full length novel so threw it in as a twofer that provides some interesting asides and gives us readers more for our money. Suddenly, the action switches to DC, where the brutal murder of a Supreme Court Justice inexplicably occurs within the library of the Court itself despite the incredibly tight security that prevails. When additional murders occur, it appears that a very bold and fiendishly clever murderer has an agenda to fulfill. Additional characters are introduced including Ben Raven, the liaison from the DC Metro Police, and Callie Markham, the stepdaughter of the murdered Justice, who in a totally unbelievable fashion is teamed with Ben in order to utilize her unique insights into the case and her analytical skills honed as an investigative reporter for THE WASHINGTON POST. And for fans of the series, MAX, Dillon?s computer sidekick, provides invaluable help before the chase is over. Unfortunately, much of the dialog is totally inappropriate and becomes almost laughable at times. Furthermore, the paragraph breaks often make it unintelligible who is actually speaking. There are on occasion paragraph breaks in the middle of comments by the same speaker; at times, the narrative perspective seems to suddenly change. Finally, the romantic subplot is so predictable it lacks any interest at all.In summary, a potentially interesting villain and a plot with great potential have been sacrificed to the apparent desire to keep to a publishing schedule of a book each summer. I only generously rounded my rating up because there are two aspects of the book which certain readers will enjoy. First, there is some minimal further character development for the truly devoted fans of Savich and Sherlock; the true series addicts will probably enjoy this element. Second, the plot?s potential is interesting although unrealized. Very surprisingly, the distribution of the ratings of this book by the seventeen previous reviewers exhibits a wide dispersion of opinion. The average of three stars to date derives from an entirely level distribution ? three readers each rated it one, three or five stars, four readers each rated it two or four stars. I believe that this difference of opinion reflects how different types of readers relate to the various factors that I mention in this review. Someone who is perhaps a speed reader and primarily interested in a plot (or two) with some interesting twists might easily overlook many of the features that I consider to be very significant flaws. Much of my interest in reading derives from the subtleties of character development, the intricate details which clever writers weave into the fabric of their stories, and the careful construction of the narrative and a wonderful use of language. By definition, any subjective rating system incorporates how an individual reader balances all these diverse factors when deciding which books provide a pleasurable and worthwhile experience. The strengths of this book no where near compensated me for the severe weaknesses with regard to any of those factors.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"Let's see, my stepfather was just murdered and, within less than twenty four hours, I am wildly flirting with the police officer. The only way that any fact can be explained to the reader is through stilted dialogue -- \\"I am going to see so-and-so.\\" \\"Oh, isn't she your sister?\\" \\"Yes, she is my sister.\\" It's a murder mystery, actually two murders, completely unrelated to each other, both of them \\"solved\\" at the last minute through long-winded confessions in the bad old James Bond style, \\"now that I've got you, the good guy, pinned down and could kill you just by pulling the trigger, let me explain to you in long-winded fashion why I've done this.\\" And spiced with right-wing fantasy throughout (the liberal Supreme Court Justice is a horrible person, the Black law clerk is labelled an affirmative action whiner for no discernible reason, the \\"good\\" beer is Coors, and so on).

Alas, it is hardly developed at all in the book until the last 40 pages or so, and I really can't see, hard as the author tried, how it is linked up with the supposed hero and heroine of this book, Ben Raven and the daughter of a murdered supreme court justice. The motive for the murders as the body pile mounts up is absolutely absurd, and the twist at the end totally falls flat. I felt really cheated by this book. It was nice to see Sherlock and Dillon and their little boy, but the whole relationship between Ben and his lady love is a wet squib and the macho posturing in the living room of Savich's home is just absurd. A real let down. Neither romantic, nor suspenseful."},{"Title":"Blowout (FBI SERIES)","review":"I have read many of Catherine Couleter's FBI books and enjoyed them thoroughly along with the characters of Savich and Sherlock. But this book had a silly unrealistic plot. The main premise what that a Supreme Court Justice could be murdered by someone clubbing a Federal Guard, changing clothes with him, and gee, going back into the building to commit the murder. I guess the building was just open to anyone. The characters were one dementional and even in very stressful times the dialogue was &quot;very cute&quot; and supposedly witty. The final resolution was as unrealistic as the plot and character development. Honestly, I would have to say that this book was written by someone else who just took the name of Catherine Coulter. I regret the money I paid for the book and it was so poorly written than anything in excess of five minutes a page would have been too much. Instead of finding an old friend who gave me a few hours of wonderful reading, I found an imposter.

A computer determined who the killer was, from out of the blue, with no explanation to the reader. Likewise I was waiting for a tie-in between the supernatural portion of the story which appeared at the beginning of the book but there was no relationship between the ghost of the woman Samantha Barrister, her family, and the rest of the story.

First off, the dialogue was really strange--almost like Coulter herself didn't write it. In her past books she has been pretty good at characterization, but in this book, the characters were stilted, wooden and totally unbelievable as was the plot and the twists. The ending of the story line made absolutely no sense to the rest of the book. The characters--Ben and Callie had so little chemistry between them that it was almost painful when they finally hooked up! My advice to anyone contemplating a purchase of Blow Out - is don't blow your money on buying the book--look at how uniformly bad these reviews are and then either skip reading it all together, or go to the library and check it out! This is not a book you will want to keep in your personal library.

I was stupidly thinking that MAYBE it had something to do with the murder of the Justice, but huh uh. Nope....Who the murderer is and why he did it is BEYOND STUPID! It took like a paragraph for him to explain why. It was so unbelievable.At the beginning of her books, Coulter always says something coy like: \\"Let me know how many times you checked your heart monitor during the story.\\" Well, everyone, at the end of the book I flatlined.

The book provides a solid, integrative theory of personalityand personality disorders that can be used not only in research, but also clinicalpractice by psychologists from any theoretical orientation.Because it is so comprehensive, the book is especially useful for students. The firstsection of the book (approximately 200 pgs.) is dedicated to laying down a foundationfor the study of personality disorders -- the issues that it entails and a concise (yet,detailed) review of various personality theories. Dr. Millon then presents a rational,integrated theory of personality that is the foundation of his integrated biopsychosocialapproach to personality. The rest of the book is dedicated to a detailed examination of theDSM-IV personality disorders. This single book can serve as a primary text for any advancedcourse in personality.Whether one aggrees with Dr. Millon's theory (and few can disagree with it completelyonce they understand it's comprehensive and integrated nature), this book is one that anybodywho deals with the personality disorders MUST have on their bookshelf."},{"Title":"DISORDERS OF PERSONALITY: DSM-IV AND BEYOND 2E","review":"The book is great, and a &quot;must have&quot; for those who seek a better understanding of personality and its disorders.The authors not only provide the reader with the know-how, but also an enthralling overview of the history of each personality disorder.

However, I have also learned that many of the signs of each cluster of PPDD were already described in ancient history.Apart these cultural connotations, the book is a very helpful hint for those working with patients suffering from obstinateand &quot;hard-to-treat&quot; personality disorders.Great book, worth each penny paid."},{"Title":"DISORDERS OF PERSONALITY: DSM-IV AND BEYOND 2E","review":"I have had to buy this book several times--each time paying an enormous amount, it seems. People borrow it and don't return it, they take it off my bookshelf, become absorbed, just want a brief look at it, or, on shared bookshelf declare that my copy is actually theirs. So, I have spent much money on this book. But it is worth it. Reading Millon is discovering a new way to understand people--a sort of typology that incorporates, but is far more complex, that the human personality or character typologies that are invented time to time in historhy. That he has managed to create this complex system of personality typologies, as well as, even more impressively, a series of tests that measure them so accurately and with such psychometrically robust tools gives him, in my view, a stature of those greats we read about in grad school--the Skinners, Guthries, Freuds, Hulls, Tolman's Rogers, Piagets, who in their day formulated broad, at times even paradigm changing theories that they pursued, developed, researched, and elaborated on over the course of a lifetime. Being a psychologist, Millon might not get the recognition he might if his talent at human observation were in another field, since psychology still has a questionable reputation as a science, catching all the aspersions given a social science. As a novelist or film maker, Millon's perceptiveness might be more commonly celebrated. This is a very smart book--a systematic yet highly sensitive roadmap of human nature.

You'll miss out on a few things, such as how psychiatrists had epileptics imprisoned in \\"colonies\\" just a few decades ago. Epilepsy was, we were informed by Harvard psychiatrists, proof of pathological criminality. You will also not read about how homosexuals, after long being persecuted by psychiatrists (electroconvulsive therapy, insulin schock, lobotomy, etc.) were suddenly declared well, and about how people who dislike homosexuals then were afflicted with a \\"mental illness\\" called \\"homophobia.\\" You won't learn how it is that psychiatrists \\"knew\\" that people contracted peptic ulcers because they could't handle stress until the bacteria was isolated that actually causes such ulcers. You won't learn this because psychiatrists don't like to get hemmed in by history, or science, or ethical considerations. The authors discretely ignore the fact that no autopsy has ever revealed a person to have had \\"schizophrenia\\" or that any disease revealed to have a genuine organic cause is removed from psychiatry and given to physicians, such as neurologists, who deal with real illnesses.But do not fret. This book is directly in the psychiatric mainstream. It presents all the categories, classifications, modalities, complexes, and \\"treatments\\" just as if they were the product of actual science. It's as complex and convincing as an elaboration on astrology or phrenology. Like any good pseudoscientific tract, it is so splendidly dense and pretentious that it will not lack for credulous readers.Yesterday's forgotten \\"cause\\" and \\"treatment\\" for \\"schizophrenia\\" is replaced by the hottest new thing.

Additionally, I think Austen does a great job of creating characters that you love and hate with a passion. This is one of the funniest novels that has been written by Jane Austen. I like Emma, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know the story upon which Clueless was based."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"This book is one of many by Jane Austen that will put you into a total field of happiness. Emma's perilous journey towards understanding herself and her own wrong doings is funny and down to earth. The English is a bit hard to read but once you get into the book, the English becomes easy to read."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I enjoyed the quaintness of Emma's society. The heroine, Emma, was hilarious, especially when her schemes backfired. However, Austen's EMMA resembles modern day soap operas. As an example the heartbreaks of Harriet and the maliciousness of Mrs. Elton can be found on any episode of _The Young and the Restless_(granted, though, without the strong sexual content). Just like a soap opera, EMMA and the contents wherein get tedious. Suggestion to the would-be reader: don't linger in Emma's world for too long; the story will be better if done so."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I'm writing in reference to the Kindle version of this book. Since I like the book itself, I gave 2 stars; however, this version was lacking in extras. I was seriously disappointed to find no footnotes, no introduction, no nothing.

I certainly would have chosen another one of the available editions."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I guess I am an exception. I found the book, Emma, to be overly long and tiresome. The book focuses mostly on social calls between Emma and her neighbors and their dialogue. Emma is just so snobbish and aware of her high status that it was hard to find her likeable at first. I found myself liking her more towards the end of the book as she saw the error of her ways. I loved Pride and Prejudice...but this book just didn't really click with me."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Austen weaves a brilliant tale of Emma Woodhouse, a young socialite, and her community in Victorian England. Emma cannot resist inserting herself into the affairs and pursuits of her neighbors and dear friends and the resulting chaos is delightful. Emma is indeed a flawed character, but so are the others in this tale, which makes it all the more authentic. Emma's belated realizations of the results of her machinations are humorous as well as often disastrous. Feeling she must match her new protogee, Harriet Smith, with a suitable husband, Emma manages to mangle the situation not once but three separate times. Of course in the end it all comes out well but it is a wonderful ride. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I downloaded Emma for free on my kindle from amazon. This book is about Emma a vain wealthy and confident young woman who lives in a small town in Highbury, England. She cares for her father who is worried that she is not going to get married. She plays match maker for her friends and acquaintances by setting them up with different suitors. Emma realize that her matchmaking skills was not good and cause a lot of grief. So she vowed never to get marry, but ended getting married to a very unexpected person .This book is a typical romance comedy friction novel. It started of slow and then the pace pick back up again. You will see Emma finding herself and becoming a better person. I think the Emma character means well and wants her friends to be in high society like her, but she comes of snobby and meddlely. while reading the book I keep saying to myself girl just fall back and fix your own self up. If you love Jane Austen then you will love this book, becuase she love to write drawn out romance novels.I think this book will be perfect for a lazy sunday afternoon or a long plane ride."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"As much as I love Jane Austen, Emma is a horrible read. This was the only one of Austen's books I couldn't finish in college. I thought I'd try it again a decade later and I still don't like it (although this time I did finish reading it).Like some of the other reviewers have stated, Emma is just not a likeable character. And unlike most of Austen's heroines, she seems to have no redeeming qualities, making it incredibly hard to read about her for hundreds of pages.I guess one could argue that the book is well written by virtue of the fact that I despise Emma so much as a character. But I'm not arguing Austen's merits as a writer. I am simply stating that this book is not worth reading when there are so many other classics out there that you might actually enjoy!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"A lot of people have said that Emma is one of their favorite books but I would have to differ. This book put me to sleep every time I picked it up. It was dull and boring, this is only my opinion. I would not let this book effect and make me not want to read Jane Austen again. Since it is only one book out of many of hers. I felt this book was for a different crowd of people. Maybe I should have waited till I was older and grasped the concept more.Miss. Taylor Emma's good friend and governess get's married and move's out. Emma has no clue what to do with herself. Mr. Woodhouse, Emma's father, gets upset and thinks Miss. Taylor now known as Mrs. Weston is making a huge mistake of leaving the family and things will never be the same without her living at the house. Emma then meets a girl named Harriet Smith, who is not as smart as Emma but she likes how she is willing to learn and listen to what she had to say. They went on daily walks around the town. Mr. Martin a very dull farmer that Emma's brother-in-law works proposes to Harriett who has had a crush on him before Emma tried to set her up with Mr. Elton. Emma influences her to refuse the offer of marriage, so she does. This was before n and got to know each other very well.Emma thinks she can match anyone up with love, if they gave her a chance. She herself has vowed to remain single. She tries to set Harriet, up with Mr. Elton, but Mr. Elton likes Emma instead of Harriet and wants to marry her. Emma refuses and Mr. Elton leaves and gets married to some person who nobody thinks is worthy of him. When Emma finds out Mr. Elton got married she doesn't want Harriet to find out since she is still hung up on him they found out Mr. Elton had married. Emma is very controlling when it comes to love, and this is one reason why I didn't like the book she aggravated me.Mrs. Weston's stepson is coming she is nervous he won't like her and confides in Emma. Emma is out for a carriage ride and she gets stuck. Mr. Churchill Mr. Weston's son comes and helps her get out, he doesn't tell her who he is till after and she is amazed by how good looking he is. She is confused with hr feelings for him after that. She thinks she may be in love but she doesn't feel like she is. Mr. Churchill likes a woman named Jane who is staying with Miss. Bates, a dear friend of Emma. Emma doesn't really like Jane since she always has one over her. For example at a party that was thrown they asked Emma if she would like to play the piano, when she is done Jane is asked to play the piano and everyone loved Jane's when people only like Emma's performance.At a picnic with Jane, Mr. Churchill, Miss. Bates, Mr. Elton, his wife, and Mr. Knightly, Emma's very good friend. Emma insults her friend, Miss. Bates. Mr. Knightly tells Emma off. Emma realizes she loves Mr. Knightly but is worried he loves Harriet. They secretly have feelings for each other but neither of them do anything. Finally they do confess there feelings and they get engaged. Harriet ends up with Mr. Martin and Mr. Churchill ends up with Jane.Mrs. Weston becomes pregnant and Emma does not want anyone to know about her and Mr. Knightly's engagement until the baby is born. Jane and Mr. Churchill are also keeping their engagement a secret.I couldn't really relate to this book. I would have done a lot of things different then what she did. For starters I would not have gone and meddled into every ones love life. Its their life and people need to respect that and not mess with it. I understand she thought she was helping everyone but truth be told she wasn't and it just was annoying to see how she kept going off and doing that throughout the book."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"While this isn't the only great narration of \\"Emma\\" available, I've enjoyed it for years.

I had to watch the movie to understand who certian people were but the book is even better. She is wity and funny. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"When commenting about the brilliant Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice is the most commonly discussed. Though I must admit that Pride and Prejudice is my undisputed favorite from among those novels I have read by Ms. Austen, she does have many other great works. Emma is yet another example of her unparalleled skills as a writer. Most people find Austen's themes of romance most interesting but her novels, Emma in particular, are peppered with a great deal of satire. Austen manages to not only create an engaging story but also to criticize the ridged society in which she lived. In all of the Jane Austen novels that I have read she has created a humorous character who seems to talk far too much and make herself ridiculous to everybody; that character in this story is Mrs. Bates. Though Mrs. Bates long speeches did often get annoying they were not without humor and it seems obvious that Austen was poking fun at many of the women in her society. Though it took me a while to get through this book I did thoroughly enjoy it and was further convinced of Jane Austen being one of the greatest writers to ever live. This novel rather contrasted both Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility in the fact that the heroin was not an underprivileged young woman who was lifted up from inferior circumstance. Instead, Emma was born into a high circle of society and a great deal of money. It was not her who was looked down on but she who looked down on others and while she was generally well meaning she was not without her pride and sense of superiority. I had a bit of a difficult time relating to Emma's character as opposed to those of Elizabeth Bennett or Elinor Dashwood who were both more level headed and loveable. I always enjoy Jane Austen's novels and I am very glad that I read Emma. I would most certainly suggest it!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Received book in excellent condition and fast shipping. I am enjoying this book, what a great read! Thank you."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma was the first Jane Austen book I've ever read &, originally, I liked it much more than Pride And Prejudice but I've since changed my mind. While I love this book, it's not my favorite anymore.Emma is such a fun character because she is so sure that what she's doing is right when all the while she's just making a mess of things. The best part about her is that when she sees that she is wrong, she can laugh at herself & learn from her mistakes.Mr. Knightly is one of my favorite Austen characters. His name says it all, \\"knightly.\\" He is the perfect gentlemen...possibly moreso than Mr. Darcy, even.The characters in this book, as in all Jane Austen books, represent both the follies & goodness in human nature, which is what I love about her writing. This is a wonderful book that I highly recommend for anyone new to Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is in need of a new particular friend now that her governess has married. As luck would have it, she meets pretty and artless Harriet Smith, a girl of obscure parentage. Emma is convinced that Harriet is a gentleman's daughter (after all, she did attend a good boarding school), and takes it upon herself to teach her the ways of a lady and to introduce her to a good eligible gentleman that would elevate her station in life. Harriet has her eyes set on a simple farmer, but that is not enough for her, at least not according to Emma. She knows what's best for everyone around. Emma fancies herself a matchmaker. In fact, she takes credit for introducing Mr. Weston to her former governess. And, at twenty-one, she has no intention of ever marrying. She has to look after her father and their Hartfield estate. She is an heiress to thirty thousand pounds and is well respected among her peers. What more could she want? But Harriet needs Mr. Elton. A girl like Harriet cannot become an old maid like the tiresome Miss Bates. Emma is determined to make it happen, and she doesn't care what Mr. Knightley, her brother-in-law's brother, has to say on the matter.Jane Austen is known for creating flawed characters, most of which are not central in her stories. The closest Austen came to creating an anti-heroine was Marianne Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility. But the novel is told mostly from Elinor Dashwood's POV, which makes Marianne seem less insufferable. Emma is Austen's official anti-heroine -- a young woman who thinks she knows so much when she actually knows nothing. She is essentially clueless to everything that goes on around her. Mr. Knightley is always there to scold her and set her right, of course. Emma, though not my favorite Austen, is a lovely story. The theme is very popular and it has inspired many authors and Hollywood producers throughout the years. (The 1995 teen flick Clueless is a modern-day adaptation of Emma.) It has also inspired an infinite number of sequels written by new authors. Austen does sort of drag the story a bit toward the end, which is why I take away half a star. That, in a nutshell, is the only drawback in this book. The rest is wonderful. You will get all of the Austenian elements here: a shocking match, irritating snobs, hilarious social commentary, balls and assemblies, silly ladies and suspiciously charming men. Mr. and Mrs. Weston, Miss Bates, Harriet Smith, Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax are my favorite characters -- after Mr. Knightley, of course. He is my third favorite of the Austen men (after Mr. Darcy and Captain Wentworth). If you're new to Jane Austen, then Emma is a good way to start. You won't be able to resist reading her five other books. I read this several years ago, but the experience was more enjoyable this time around. Jane Austen is as addictive as chocolate and I look forward to reading Mansfield Park soon."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I haven't read a Jane Austen novel in years. The last time I read one of her novels I was very young and it was not by choice. If you want to rediscover Jane Austen, start with Emma. This novel is about a very snobby, spoiled, and at times malicious young lady by the name of Emma Woodhouse. Emma lives in the village of Highbury with her hypchondriac father. After Emma's Governess, who throughout the book is known as Mrs Weston marries, Emma is left with a lot of time on her hands. I'm afraid she does not use this time wisely.Emma finds a new friend and protege in Harriet Smith, a young lady with an unknown past who Emma takes under her wing. Emma brings it upon herself to give young Harriet somewhat of a social makeover. She induces her to aspire to greatness and put on airs proper to a lady of Emma's class, although she's not even sure what class Harriet belongs to. When Harriet is offered marriage by a farmer by the name of Mr Martin, Emma is horrified! She convinces Harrriet that such a man is hardly worthy of her and intices her to find romance with the handsome but vain vicor, Mr Elton. Emma's disasterous matchmaking decison is the focus of the book.I found this novel incredibly amusing! Emma's unbashed snobbery, Harriet's ignorance, Mr Woodhouse's constant worry of illness befalling every character in the book. This book is literally laugh out loud funny at times. The novel features many other equally amusing characters. Mr Knightley, Emma's sister's brother-in-law, who is the one person in the novel to always tell Emma how it really is. The chatty and annoying Mrs Bates, the insufferable Augusta Elton who is almost as full of herself as Emma.When Jane Austen wrote this book she claimed no one but herself would like Emma Woodhouse. Emma is conceited and selfish, but the beauty of this book is that Emma is forced to come to terms with what her behavior has caused her and those she loves. The Emma you meet at the beginning of the novel is not the same Emma that you say goodbye to at the end.If you want a simple description of what this novel is about I will tell you that it is about a young lady's road to maturity and growth. Jane Austen isn't for everyone, but if you are curious or want to give her novels another try, start with Emma. It's guaranteed to renew your interest in one of the greatest writers in English literature. Five stars!!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"After reading 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' and loving it I decided to read all of Jane Austen's works. 'EMMA' was second on the list, if I am being honest, because I loved the movie 'CLUELESS' and although I believe 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' will always be my favorite Jane Austen novel, so far (I am only three novels in) 'EMMA' is a close second.I found 'EMMA' to be extremely witty, intricately woven and definitely kept me on my toes! The way Austen set the stage for the many different interconnecting aspects of this book just proves why so many readers adore her. If you are interested in reading Austen , I am sure many would say that you cannot go wrong with any of her novels, however this reader highly recommends both \`EMMA' and \`PRIDE & PREJUDICE' and hope that you will enjoy them as much as I have."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Like most of Jane Austen's novels, the theme is around young women and how to obtain marriages with suitable men and be in love with them at the same time. In Emma, we have a heroine who not just sits around and speculates on who would pair up with who, but actively strives to influence and guide the matchmaking. She takes on a protege, Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage and sees into every interaction with the various gentlemen, more than is actually there. Unfortunately for poor Harriet, whose emotions get tangled around various men \\"who are all above her socially\\", Emma learns that manipulation and scheming is doing more to hurt her dear friend than to have left things alone.The reason I read this book as a mystery, is that the reader is left to speculate (without peeking) which man would pair up with which lady. There are red herrings, where the characters other than Emma, misspeculate, to lead the reader into examining the clues to see if it were the case. Also, one of the male characters purposely set out to mislead where his affections are placed, and there is also a misunderstanding between Emma and Harriet on which gentleman she admires, with Emma giving encouragement because of mistaken identity.The scheming finally crashes to a sequence of revelations brought about by a sequence of events. One after another, the couples pair off with a sequence of marriages, assuring the reader that the correct matches were made and happiness for the future guaranteed. Even though the middle of the book is very slow, the reader can go back and look at the clues and events after knowing the ending to see where inclinations rested and secrets lay buried."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I've read it a million times, it was purchased as a gift for someone; but, since I never received the other two books, I didn't bother giving it."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"This book arrived new and in good condition.

Enjoy"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"When I first opened the novel, I realised that the book was split into three volumes, which comprised of eighteen chapters apiece. I wondered how long it would take me to get through the read. As it worked out, the organisation of the novel, and the clarity of the language makes the novel a very legible read, and can flow through the chapters in each of the volumes with much ease. It could take less than three to four days to complete one volume, in nine by nine chapters, with active concentration.As the volume chapters are split, volume one makes for a very interesting read, as divided in between the chapters, we're almost immediately introduced to Harriet and Emma's relationship, and Emma's designs on how she plans to interfere in Harriet's relationship, and make her wed mr Elton, of Emma's choice, not mr Martin, of Harriet's choice. As she breaks up Harriet's relationship with mr Martin, we find ourselves sympathising with Harriet, but with Emma a lot less, and our opinion of her schemes, makes readers feel critical of her.In volume two, we sympathise with Emma a lot less than we are critical of her. On first read, volume two can get extremely tedious, because the themes run on, and have a lot less in common with volume one. By volume three, we get a better understanding of volume two, and the themes eventually link together, into something more conclusive. On first read, however, volume two can get quite tedious, and more put-downable as readers opinion grows colder towards Emma, because of how unfairly she breaks down Harriet's relationship, and also because of her prejudices towards miss Jane Fairfax, whom we find ourselves liking, and is through the novel a lot nicer, and more consistent than Emma.By volume three, our understanding of Emma grown warmer, as her feelings towards not wanting to ever be married begins to change, as her understanding of mr Frank Chruchill, and mr George Knightley begins to change. She finds herself going to balls, and centred into some flirtation between these two men. By the end of the novel she discovers Frank Churchill has been secretly wed to Jane Fairfax, and we are also surprised to see that Emma's marital status also concludes with a wedding to George Knightley, although Mr Woodhouse, Emma's father was to a certain degree against this union of the two, believing that Emma had vowed never to get married to anyone, so that she can continue looking after Woodhouse, and not leave.If there were any further protests to the conclusion of who got married or not, or if there were ever any intentions for the centreing married couples to divorce, this is not identitifien by the author, because of the cosy-close ending of the novel, centred about the characters getting married, and divorce is never a theme that has ever been explored in Austen's novels, even in less happier, eccentric, or less committed relationship.Overall, with a little patience, the novel is a very good read, especially, if readers can get through the tedious themes of volume two, and into the merits, and warmer themes in volume three."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel.

Emma Woodhouse is the spoiled, rich, younger daughter of the widowed Mr Woodhouse. Her father, Henry, is nave, self-centred, a borderline hypochondriac and the ultimate pessimist. Emma lives at home with him, looks after him and has no plans to ever marry because of this. She is a strong-willed and snobbish 20-year-old with a rather dull life who fancies herself an excellent matchmaker. Most of her friends and acquaintances indulge her. Only George Knightly, the elder brother of her sister Isabella's husband, John, is critical of her behaviour. He takes her to task for meddling in others' lives. As with all novels of this era, compared with today's offerings, the reader has to be patient and allow the story to build. There's also getting one's head around the language used. It took me a few instances of the word \\"nice\\" to realise that what it meant then (foolish, stupid, senseless) was not what it means today. The garrulous Miss Bates is a source of humour and there is plenty of talking at crossed purposes. This novel seems to point to the importance of status and appearance in Miss Austen's world. Another Austen classic."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings.

It's my favorite novel from Jane Austen followed by Pride & Prejudice. In fact I only like those two novels out of the six she wrote, but anyway, Emma was a really good read. The best part about this novel is that it isn't about a girl who is looking for love, it's about a girl who unexpectedly finds love where it has been all the time. Talk about right under your nose. Emma is friendly, kind, naive, smart, loyal, whitty, clever, innocent, and definatley worth reading. I truly love this book because I love romance in it's purest form, true love, when you know that these two characters will spend the rest of their lives together and will love each other faithfully!

Where Emma Woodhouse takes residents with her father. Emma is clever and yes, rich. She enjoys many of the same things young adults do today do including match making and visiting friends in 1800's fashion.Emma is the main character as you probably can tell by the title of Emma. She has a bad habit of match making just ask \\"poor\\" Harriet. Emma attempts to stop threw out the book but always ends up going back. She vowed never to marry early in life. Besides her father Mr. Woodhouse needs her and she enjoys calling on her single friends. If she had a husband to complicate things she could not go see those friends. Unless the man she married enjoyed calling on those same friends.Emma seems like she could walk off the page and appear in the 21-century, even thew she lived in the 1800's. Her habits are the same as many young women today of not marrying and the dreaded habit of match making.Emma is full of personality even thew she can be a little mean to long time friends and not relies it without someone telling her. But Emma appears real and grounded.I would recommend Emma to young women who are fast readers and who know someone or they themselves enjoys match making.

After watching the movie probably 16 times, I went and read the book and was so glad I did! It's become one of my all-time favorite books simply because I love Emma's character and get lost in her life and world every time, and come back later craving to read it again! The book expands and clarifies so much we don't get to see in the movie and gives you the original view of Emma - apart from the movie. As a woman, I love romance and tales of older times where nobility and class presided yet values were down to earth, respectable and loving. 'Emma' combines both nobility and the 'down to earthness' in Mr. Knightly. If you love romance, strong female characters and getting lost in another world of balls, dances, society - definitely read this and watch the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow! It's gorgeous and guaranteed to uplift you."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Though not her favorite novel, Austen's Emma shines as one of her most beloved.

It is through Emma's repeated blunders,imprudence, and vanity that she becomes one of the most charming heroines of all times. Jane Austen has created a hilarious set of characters: the preposterously overprotective father, the poor chatterbox neighbour, the pretty, lighthearted proteg&eacute;, and the man of reason whose love finally dictates against his logic (to name a very few). Although the plot is at times made dreary by Miss Bates' prolongued monologues, the novel is otherwise a light read. One must not expect to turn the last page having learnt some universal truth, but rather having enjoyed a few good laughs, some heart-leaping, and a few sighs. Emma is an outstanding proof of Jane Audten's wit; the candour and modesty in her novel make it a truly refreshing read."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma is one of the best books I have ever read.

By the end of the book, these characters will feel like your own family. I learned a lot about English culture and about how the upper class families used to live. Jan Austen is a very good author and could be classed with the best of them. Oddly, this book has a strikingly similar plot as the movie &quot;Clueless&quot;.

Austen's novels, a treasure any time, are given a fine aural performance by Ms. Scales."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma by Jane Austen is truly a very enjoyable novel dealing with the upper-middle class women of the Victorian Era, and it gives us an illuminating insight on the way of life of the people of that time. Emma is a comedy in the sense that the novel ends on a happy note with three marriages and also in the sense that it gives themes such as marriage an exaggerated importance. Also, the novel as a whole in conceived in a spirit of irony - irony in incidents and irony in characterisation. In the novel, Jane Austen depicts her view of people as social animals who live by a social code based on a set of moral values. Thus, in Emma, Jane Austen shows, in a good-natured way, the disastrous consequences caused by human follies and stupidities, leading to the violation of the social code.The very fact that Emma is looking for \`would-be' grooms for girls she takes a fancy to is undoubtedly a trespass of the social norms existing at that time - a clear example of a folly. Emma's other folly may be said to be her excessive pride. Her pride leads her to dominate, and to see the lives of others as extensions of her own ego, and therefore deny the other characters their human autonomy. Ironically, we see that she, who delights in using others, discovers that she, in turn, has been used, or more correctly, duped.Emma also deals with the follies of arrogance and self-deception. While reading the novel, we find Emma adopting what may be called a \`know-all' attitude. She is utterly self-important and presuming. She pays no heed to Mr. Knightley's advice either with regard to Mr. Elton or with regard to Frank Churchill. She thinks that she can successfully handle the affairs of others, and the high regard the Highbury society has for her only makes matters worse. Hence, through the character of Emma, Austen warns against the dangers of influence and interference. Emma, through her actions of meddling in everybody's affairs, finally achieves nothing good, and even causes harm to her own self.Also, Austen gives marriage such an undue importance that the title character, in her pursuit of husbands for others, overlooks social norms existing at that time and gives more value to marriage rather than crucial human relationships. Thus, in a comic way, Austen depicts Emma's greatest fault in breaking social norms and overlooking crucial human considerations in pursuit of petty things such as marriage.Comedy also emanates from the narrator's treatment of Mr. Woodhouse and Miss Bates as \\"comic characters\\". But through these characters, Austen explores another facet of human follies. Through the character of Mr. Woodhouse, we are brought to see the negative aspects of indulgence - indulgence of the same kind that has caused harm to Emma. And the character of Miss Bates, while depicting the pitiable state of unmarried women, acts as a kind of test for Emma's power of responding to \`socially inferior' people. Mrs. Elton is another comic character, amusing us greatly by her airs of self-importance and her social snobbery. She has too high an opinion of her own elegance, accomplishments, and social charm that she thrusts herself upon everybody without inhibition or hesitation. She also breaks the established social rules by calling Mr. Knightley \\"Knightley\\", not giving him his gentleman's worth. In fact, we may say that Mrs. Elton is used to portray the very evils of Emma's character in a somewhat extreme way.Hence, as we have seen, Austen deals in an intellectual way the follies and stupidities of humans. We learn particularly through our understanding of Emma's faults, and by learning above all, how significant and fundamental these values are. For Emma's aloof relation to others, her willingness to treat other characters as toys - these become significant betrayals of human considerations. The social and moral universe of the novel takes a greater significance because it provides a context in which Emma's faults are not minor ones to be treated lightly, but total violations of a whole established system. The agents of retribution in this world are Mr. Knightley and Austen herself as the narrator.Thus, Austen condemns certain human foolishness such as snobbery, excessive pride and a disrespect for established moral and social values. These are the human stupidities which are purged, through Emma's process of self-analysis and redemption. It is only at that time that Austen makes her heroine rise above such human foolishness and stupidities to become a more moral and less petty human being. Hence, it may be said that the novel persuades us, through a very entertaining and comic plot, the importance of self-knowledge, a true regard for self and others, and also to consider every human action as a crucial, committing act of self-definition."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Jane Austen said of Emma Woodhouse (in a letter) that she had written a novel with a heroine \\"whom no one would like but myself\\". Indeed the first sentence (another sterling first sentence by Austen. How does she do it?) paints a picture that is easily understood as a spoilt little rich girl:\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever and rich, with a comfortable house and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\\"At the same time we have to disagree with Miss Austen. Readers have fallen in love with Emma (both novel and heroine) since the novel was published, and with good reasonRonald Blythe states in his introduction to the 1966 Penguin Classics edition of \\"Emma\\" that it is \\"the climax of Jane Austen's genius and the Parthenon of fiction.\\" I do not dispute it for a second. This novel is my favourite work from my favourite author.The book has a plot so timeless than even translating it to modern day Hollywood and casting Alicia Silverstone in the lead still gets you a hit movie, Clueless. OK, it's obvious from the first chapter who is destined to marry Emma but our dashing hero, Mr Knightley, is still the only person who ever criticises Emma, indeed he spends a large part of his time in the novel telling either Emma or her friends about her flaws.Austen wrote to her niece Anna (writing a novel at the time) that \\"Three or four families in a country village is the very thing to work on\\" and stayed close to this for most of her own works. Yet at the same time, in a letter to her brother Edward (another incipient novelist) she played down her concerns as \\"the little bit (two inches wide) of ivory on which I work with so fine a brush, as to produce little effect, after much labour.\\" 'Emma' is certainly the novel on the smallest piece of ivory with the finest brush, yet it pokes as much fun and wields as savage a knife on the social conventions of Austen's England as any other novelist of the time.Austen was capable of writing novels with genuine popular appeal at the same time as she flouted the conventions of fiction. 'Emma' is a marvellous example, an easily read, enjoyable novel with a heroine who is in charge of her own destiny and who marries for no other reason than she loves a good, strong man.Everyone deserves to read a novel this good. Just because teenage girls will adore this novel and swoon over Mr Knightley doesn't mean the rest of us should be stopped from this marvellous read. I enjoy Austen immensely and this is my favourite. I probably read it once or twice a year.When you come to choosing the edition I once again find myself recommending the Penguin Classics edition for its Introduction. This time it is Fiona Stafford who does such a good job (though I think the '66 edition Introduction by Ronald Blythe was a fraction better.)"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"The present novel is about the young women, Emma Woodhouse, who lives a pampered life with her father in Sussex. The family is well off financially and one of the wealthiest in Hartfield, part of Highbury. Her mother has passed away and her sister has married and left the home. Emma's governess, who is her best friend as well, has gone leaving Emma alone with her father. The story revolves around Emma's social life in the town and the development of Emma as a person. Beyond knowing those facts, you should not read any more about the plot until you read the novel, or you will risk spoiling the read. I will not give away the plot, but will only describe the writing style and structure.I read Austen's \\"Mansfield Park,\\" then read some analysis by Nabokov from his Cornell \\"Lectures on Literature\\" and the comments of Jane Stabler from the introduction of the Oxford version. After that I got a bit excited and read Austen's early writing \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" along with the analysis by Margaret Doody in the Oxford version. Yes, I guess I am now an Austen fan, and it is a pity that she did not live longer. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was my third Austen novel and so far the most fun to read.Based on the four novels written over two different time periods, it is clear that she developed a certain fixed writing style and a common structure. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humour and irony.From what Nabokov and others are saying, she got her inspiration from Sheridan, Richardson, Henry Fielding, Sir Walter Scott, and the poetry of Cowper. She modulates the complexity of the prose to reflect the characters - such as making the sentences of Sir Thomas Bertram in \\"Mansfield Park\\" somewhat elaborate instead of describing how the character is dressed or a similar description to convey qualities and traits, i.e.: she uses the complexity of speech to convey character. Also, she uses lateral shifts and epigrammatic notations and similar literary techniques. These techniques are interesting for some readers but just confusing for others. It is all part of the price of admission to entering the world of Jane Austen, and it is part of the fun in reading her novels.Overall, once you get past reading and digesting 50 pages or so and have absorbed the Jane Austen vocabulary (words such as felicity, remonstrance, countenance, etc.) and understand the structure of her prose, the book becomes a compelling read. The second Austen novel seems much easier than the first.This was written by a mature Jane Austen and by way of comparison, it is an interesting read but less complicated than \\"Mansfield Park.\\" It not as interesting nor as witty as \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" The read is slow and a bit diffuse since there is no clear set of protagonists other than Emma, her brother-in-law, her reserved father and a few other residents of the town. The novel wanders for 350 pages, then comes together strongly at the end. Overall, it is a delightful and a pleasant read."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"There is absolutely nothing wrong with this book at all. It is a very good read, in a very standard binding. You get a good introduction to it and some nice notes which are helpful.This is set in contemporary times to Austen, and was the heroine which Austen least liked. Emma Woodhouse is young, rich and single. She lives a life of wealth and privilege in a small village just outside of London. In her world, and in her village she is queen. However there are flaws in her character which will be tested.Austen liked to write about small things, about daily life, and the petty things which people in small communities become obsessed with. And so into Emma's life come the scatter-brained Harriet Smith the daughter of \\"someone\\" who cobbles together what learning she might at a local ladies academy. Emma adopts her and tries to help her make her way in the world by finding her a good match.Emma's fine world is disrupted when first Mr Elton moves to the village, and then marries a rather smart but upstart woman who wishes to manage everyone's life.Austen's skill in reflecting Emma and her machinations for good, against Mrs Elton and her machinations for her own good are gloriously done.Emma is a brilliant novel and its themes are universal and timeless, it is all about the things in life which never change - love, pride, marriage, status and money.Don't watch dreadful movie adaptations of this book (like the one Gwyneth Paltrow did) the book is much sharper, wittier and subtler. It is greatly enjoyable reading. The introduction may (or may not) help you to greater understanding of her ability to write with a light, sharp pen. Hopefully the story will stand out for its brilliance."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"i had to read this for my english sophmore highschool class and while most of my peers *hated* this book, i found this book very intriguing and esp. realistic to even today in highschool. the subjects of vanity, friendship, honesty, control, reality, self-desire, relationships, status, and maturity is all incorporated in this book and deeply and straight-forwardly depicts the life of any teenager in any century then or now. Emma struggles to understand her intentions and learns what her mistakes were all about and the reader sees her mature through experiences and constantly learning and realizing her mistakes and flaws and misconceptions. though it was a long story and had a lot of old-language narration, i have to say, Emma is part of the epitome of what ever teenager goes through, female and male. while this is mostly a chick book, guys can find themselves related to the situations that Emma deals with with the other men in the book. i highly recommend this book for people who have patience and are open to the ideals of aristocracy back then. it's amusing, witty, and shocking. really great book."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I'm in the fellowship of the \\"unashamed.\\" That is, I'm a whole-hearted MALE fan of all things Austen. It all began when I found my daughter's dusty college copy of Emma from our library because I was bored and could not find anything else to read. After struggling through the first 100 pages and trying to make sense of Miss Austen's enormous character list, I was hooked. What hooked me? First and formost was the very intertwined plot, much like a romantic \\"whodunit\\" or \\"who's gonna do it\\" mystery. The plot thickens with subtle clues as to who loves whom and the comedy surrounding the heroine's naive' and fumbling attempts to become a matchmaker to anyone in her circle that is marriage material. Never in my life have I read such succulent and appropriate dialogue. I was so enthralled I literally roared through the book to find out what was going to happen next. A second reading is mandatory for the first-timer because part of Miss Austen's genius is that a more deliberate reading mines the depths for the clues that lie beneath the surface of the story. Like the tip of an iceberg, the reader can storm through the book and enjoy it thoroughly; then do a re-read and luxuriate on how much richness and delicate detail lie below the surface. I was so caught up that I found myself talking to the characters alternately encouraging them and warning them on what they were scheming. The heroine Emma is one of the most charming, yet frustrating heroines in all of English literature. Give it a \\"go\\" as the English would say!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Jane Austin captures the styles and manners of the period so well. I find her works very interesting and informative."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Some might think I'd be ashamed, giving to this celebrated Jane Austen novel a mere 4 stars. But with the greatest, the classic authors, I use a special yardstick, awarding the ultimate prize only to their absolute must-read works.Indeed I do think EMMA is done with more elegance of finish than PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. But it cannot match that 5-star work for drama and characterization. Looking back on EMMA, is there very much to the story that really stands out? Rather, isn't it the writing that's the star? Doesn't the craftsmanship, and particularly Jane Austen's gift for managing the flow of narrative, stand out even above the narrative itself?! Very odd.The story is essentially that of Emma Woodhouse's miscalculations regarding everybody and everything -- and, I guess, how in the end these do not matter anyway. The one big dramatic turn in the book is where young Mr. [withheld] is revealed to be engaged to Miss [withheld]. It's a testament to Austen's creativity that this revelation has the cataclysmic effect it does on the reader. Thus does she make a great big universe out of her tiny local ecosystem in which people are wholly absorbed in discussing and planning and brooding over other people's relationships -- that little world in which matrimony is the ultimate destiny.Only one character comes back to me as having been memorably etched, and that's Mrs. Bates, mother of Miss Bates. Her train of conversational irrelevancies is comically rendered in some of the longest and best speeches in the book, giving quite a realistic effect that, incidentally, doesn't advance the story in any way I can tell and therefore subtracts just a bit from the marvelous consistency of the whole. Of course Emma too is someone we can look back on and remember after we're finished reading the book, but that's a little different because we're always seeing her from within, hers being the central intelligence of the story.Striking passages abound throughout the novel. One can make a fun exercise out of just savoring the narrative effect of her chapter openings. Here are two of them, picked totally at random. Chapter 33's: \\"Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill opinion of Mrs. Elton.\\" Or Chapter 38's: \\"No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball.\\"But suddenly now I must take something back. I almost omitted mention of what is actually the biggest dramatic turn in the book, and one which provides its very crux, \\"It darted through her, with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. [withheld] must marry no one but herself!\\" That does indeed come as a shock! So yes, now that I think of it, EMMA contains somewhat more of dramatic highlighting than my above reflections would suggest. And definitely, the more I page through the book at this moment, reviewing my red underlinings in it, the more I get drawn back into Jane Austen's world of exquisite prose."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I am a huge Jane Austin fan and was not disappointed with Emma.

I give her narration the highest possible recommendation. Here's to more from Ms. Shaw!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"EMMA, Jane Austen's fourth novel was published in 1815 and dedicated to the Prince Regent, later King George IV. Austen privately abhorred the Regent for the treatment of his wife Princess Caroline and his dissipated lifestyle. In 1813 she wrote to her friend Martha Lloyd, \\"I suppose all the World is sitting in Judgement upon the Princess of Wales's Letter. Poor woman, I shall support her as long as I can, because she is a Woman, & because I hate her Husband.\\" She did however recognize the value of his name and agreed to the dedication. Upon publication EMMA also had its own share of critics. What impressed early readers was not that it lacked energy and style, but that its story was dull and uneventful. Even Austen's famous publisher John Murray thought it lacked \\"incident and romance\\" and Maria Edgeworth, a contemporary author so greatly admired by Austen that she sent her one of the twelve presentation copies allotted by her publisher, could not read past the first volume and thought \\"there was no story in it.\\" Ironically, what these two prominent and well read individuals attributed as a weakness is actually EMMA'S greatest strength.If one looks beyond the surface, EMMA is an intricate story focused on the astute characterization and social reproof which Austen is famous for. Emma Woodhouse is a complex character that on first acquaintance is rather a pill. Austen gave herself a great challenge in creating \\"a heroine whom no one but myself will like.\\" In contrast with her other heroines, Miss Woodhouse does not have any social or financial concerns and thus no compelling need to marry. Therein lives the rub. We have no sympathy for her whatsoever. She's rich, she's spoiled and she's stuck up. Who indeed could possibly like such a \\"troublesome creature\\"? During the course of the novel we witness her exerting her superior notions of who is suitable for whom as she match makes for her friends with disastrous results. It is no wonder that Maria Edgeworth gave up reading EMMA after the first volume. At that point we have met most of the characters in Emma's insular world and are coming to fully understand her ignorance and misguided perceptions in relation to them. She is truly exasperating. Austen tests our endurance fully as the novel progresses and her heroine continues to make mistakes. It is a testament to her skill as a writer and deft comedian that she holds our fascination with the \\"busy nothings\\" of every-day country life in Highbury, a small village filled with endearingly flawed characters. The transformation of the heroine from spoiled and insufferable into a contrite, mature and likeable young lady that you want to root for, is nothing less than remarkable. It is truly a shame that Edgeworth could not recognize the genius of Austen's sly sashay of characterization into a world that could be your own neighborhood. We can only account that, \\"One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other.\\"If you liked the new BBC/PBS miniseries Emma (2009), enjoy the original novel with all of Austen's resplendent language in this expertly produced audio recording. Read by acclaimed British actress Juliet Stevenson, viewers of the 1996 movie adaptation of EMMA will remember her superb portrayal of the vulgar a vacuous Mrs. Elton and know you are in for a treat. Adding equal measure of energy and humor to each of the characters, Stevenson's perfect blending of a classic novel and a sensitive interpretation enhanced my enjoyment greatly.

While the Bennett women were certainly by no means perfect either (the crazy mother immediately took away any hopes of that), they always seemed rather flat to me. Emma is witty and charming, but with a degree of authenticity that makes her seem less like a character in a novel, and more like your best friend. highly recommend."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Jane Austen's, Emma, is about an upper-class young woman from the 18th century. She is the protagonist and makes a hobby out of match making. By doing so she injures her companion, because she is blind to other peoples' feelings and opinions. Emma is a benevolent character, but she is incredibly misguided. The only person who can criticize her is Mr. George Knightly. They have grown-up together and their relationship develops as the novel progresses.Most of the plot is propelled by Emma's antics and schemes to contro the people around her. Comical witticisms pervade the novel. The more Emma attempts to steer her peers toward certain paths the more she discovers her own lack of direction. The theme of marriage is evidents as it is the central focus for nearly every character. Some renounce it while others advise prudent matches. In the end, Emma must stop wielding others and concentrate on her own ambitions regarding marriage.I thoroughly enjoyed reading Emma. I also read Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. Both of these paled in comparison to Emma. I found myself with a perpetual smile on my face as Emma got herself in and out of mischief. She is so likable that I was constantly rooting for her. She was great because of her fallibility. Her mistakes weer always out of good intentions.The novel is romantic, yet not in an effusive way where there is some Adonis spouting sonnets. It is more subtle and underplayed. It is above all a story about society. I learned a lot about the role of women in this time period. Emma is extremely intellectual and her only outlet for her intellect is in trying to play Cupid. Also, a woman's solitary means of advancing her situation is though matrimony. This explained the emphasis on connections.The only character that slightly peeved me was Mr. Knightly. He is the handsome \\"prince charming\\" and mentor to Emma. It is his infallibility that makes him so aggravating. Knightly was always right and Emma was always wrong. I wanted her to be right for once and laugh at him for being precocious. This, of course, never happened. Ultimately, Emma is one of my favorite historical fiction novels."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I am a burgeoning literary scholar, so it may be rather unfashionable, as I am told, to say that I am a Janeite - though I have never gone so far as to throw a tea-party in her honour, I will say that I am exceeding fond of her novels, her style, her characters, and her corrective social satire. If she were not dead, lo, these last 185 years, I would positively send her an elegantly written letter declaring my love. At any rate.&quot;Emma&quot; is a fine novel, as though it lacked only my approbation to make it so. In it, Austen explores the vagaries of the marriage plot in the way only Austen can, with all the humour and satiric bite of which she is capable. She imagines a solipsistic community, Highbury, &quot;a crowd in a little room,&quot; if you will, where everyone knows everyone else's business, and Emma Woodhouse, the 21 year old mistress of Hartfield, presides socially over all. Through and around Emma's point of view, Austen examines the various social, class, and economic relationships that hold the community together.&quot;Emma&quot; begins with a very Doodian rhexis - the cut - Emma Woodhouse and her sedentary old father's society is broken up by the marriage of Emma's governess/best friend, Miss Taylor. Creating a sort of void in Emma's life, a newcomer to Hartfield, a 17 year old girl named Harriet Smith, becomes the intimate friend and a reclamation project of sorts for Emma. Emma, convinced the &quot;natural daughter of somebody&quot; must be, like Fielding's Tom Jones, related to someone of wealth and influence, tries tirelessly to play the matchmaker, filling Harriet's head with delusions of grandeur. Throughout the novel, Emma must face the chastisements of her landed neighbour, Mr. Knightley, the quiet support of Mrs. Weston (Taylor), and the temptations of a relationship of her own, while learning the limitations of her own understanding of the world in which she lives.As in most of Austen's novels, &quot;Emma&quot; focuses on the changing nature of the English economy, and how it trickles into even the most secluded of English towns, forcing a reckoning and acknowledgment of the shift in English society from primarily aristocratic hierarchy to the moneyed-middle classes. That Emma is a young woman indicates that the transition must happen immediately, with the present generation, which is difficult, especially from Emma's privileged, though not exactly aristocratic vantage point, to understand and accept. The intrusion on Emma's peace by such characters as the young, ambitious vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton, the up and coming interests of the merchant Cox family, the industrious farmer, Robert Martin, and the incessant bombast of Miss Augusta Hawkins (and her associations with Bristol, epicenter of the British slave-trade) provide a range of perspectives on the possibilities of the rising and increasingly influential middle classes - and the impact they have, even in so small a village as Highbury. Austen asks us to read the microcosm as in some ways, importantly representative of the macrocosm of England.I think in all of these points of interest, at least to me, I've forgotten completely to say how deftly Austen presents these critical issues with such decided humour, grace of style, and flawless execution of plot and character development, as to make the most glaring philsophical and social issues seamlessly blend into the comic forefront of the novel! One finds it difficult not to laugh straight through the first three or four chapters altogether. Her characters, from the delightfully disturbing hypochondriac Mr. Woodhouse, to the initially unreadable Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax (who must foreshadow Jane Eyre), and the irrepressibly vociferous Miss Bates - are all well drawn and memorable. This review is getting really long and pretentious now, so I'll stop - go, start reading &quot;Emma&quot; this instant."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"The problem is that Jane Austen is so popular - her books are the only 200 year old novels to stay in the Amazon top 5000- that people come to her expecting easy reading. This is 200 year-old English and takes persistence and I get upset when readers are disappointed. It's about a young woman in an English village trying to make matches for all her friends and getting into trouble. Deaths and sex take place way off stage. Some critics complain that Jane Austen ignores them but she is sharply aware of them. When Mrs Churchill dies it's a joke (People's opinions of her improve because she proves her ailments were not imaginary) The death of Emma's mother takes half a sentence and she is replaced by &quot;an excellent woman as governess&quot;. Jane Fairfax's father is killed in action (presumably against Napoleon - or maybe the Americans) Harriet Smith is the daughter of a tradesman decent enough to support her but not married to her mother.

I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may comfort me for any thing.&quot;Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, &quot;Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for whatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more matches.&quot;&quot;I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world!&quot; -Jane Austen, EmmaThe edition of Emma that I just finished has a lovely portrait of a young woman on the cover painted by Josef Stieler. So as a coworker walked by my desk she asked : Are you reading a chick book !?I quickly protested it was not a chick book--one has one's pride after all--but the cover and her question raise the question : why is it not a chick book ? Why are the novels of Jane Austen, dealing as they do with the machinations of English gentry of marriageable age and their convoluted courtships, so popular among all readers ? We well understand why she should have been a favorite of Henry James, but why did Winston Churchill continually reread her also ? These questions are directly related to another which plagues modern arguments over Jane Austen : do her novels have political ramifications ? The answers to all these questions are to be found in Emma, which is my favorite of her novels.At the outset let me admit that this only became clear to me when watching the terrific movie Clueless, which is based on this novel, but I now believe Emma to be one of the greatest political novels ever written. Austen predicted of Emma Woodhouse : &quot;I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.&quot; She was quite wrong; Emma is exactly the kind of misguided busybody with a heart of gold for whom, unfortunately, we have trouble nursing much dislike. The plot of the tale is presumably too well known to need much rehashing here : suffice it to say that Emma is a pleasant and well-intentioned young woman who fancies herself a matchmaker, having successfully joined her governess and Mr. Weston, and so proceeds to meddle in the romantic lives of those around her despite eschewing the idea of marriage for herself. In particular, she takes Harriet Smith, a pretty young girl of dubious social station, under her wing and tries finding her a husband. There follow the expected misunderstandings and hurt feelings before true love finally outs and Emma realizes that not only did she not know what was best for others, in fact she did not understand her own heart's desires.Now, at first blush that may not sound all that political, but the fundamental point Ms Austen conveys is actually not dissimilar to the argument of the great political philosopher F. A. Hayek in The Road to Serfdom (read Orrin's review). Hayek's devastating critique of the modern state and centrally controlled economies argued that no government bureaucrat could ever effectively make decisions for other people because it is impossible to process all of the information that goes into other people's decision-making. Only the free market, which allows for the greatest flow of information that humans have thus far devised, can even begin to approach the levels of efficiency that a complex economy requires to function smoothly. Likewise, Jane Austen, over a hundred years earlier, warned us of the unsatisfactory results to expect when one person sought to make decisions for others, even when acting with their best interests at heart. There will always be those among us, like Emma or like Hilary Clinton, who wish to manipulate our lives (always, we are assured, for our benefit rather than for the joy they take in the exercise), but the results are seldom salutary and never what the manipulators intended.The idea of poor Jane Austen having to hide her writing when a family member entered the room and confined to the novel of manners is nearly totemic to feminists. They decry the system of oppression which restrained her talents to insignificant topics and sentenced her to writing about romance. In reality, Austen, at least in Emma, demonstrates that simple human wisdom knows no bounds and is as likely to be found in a comedy of manners as in any scholarly journal. In its own way Emma is as stern a rebuke to centralization and authoritarianism as can be found in the Western Canon. That her books are wonderfully witty and evoke images of an inviting pastoral past is merely icing on the cake.GRADE : A+"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I love the movie with Gweneth Paltrow and Jeremy North and so i read the book.

You could update the time period and everything is still completely applicable in today's world.Aside from the story, I should also like to note that the formatting of this story is fantastic on the Kindle, unlike some of the other Austen novels I'm reading (Pride & Prejudice's formatting is not as smooth)."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"\\"Handsome, clever and rich\\" is how Emma is introduced to us, and a happy, carefree existence she leads, with very little to worry her other than idle gossip. The youngest of two sisters, Emma lives alone with her father, doting on him, after her sister Isabella marries. Their mother is long deceased, and Emma has grown up with a kindly governess, Miss Taylor, who bestows strong motherly affection on her.Set in 18th century rural England, the novel affords us a picturesque, detailed view of the daily tenets of English life at the time, complete with carriages, gowns, housekeepers and social traditions. Austen weaves a delicious web of Emma's life and that of her friends in Highbury, where they live. Mr. Woodhouse, Emma's father, is a gentle, kind man with an excessively considerate compassion to others that often borders on paranoia. He is constantly afraid of catching cold, or falling ill, and lectures those around him incessantly on the need for precaution. We learn of Mr. Knightley, a long-time, close neighbor of the family, whose brother is married to Isabella, and of the Westons, Bates, and Perrys, all families of the area, as they intermingle in Emma's world.Harriet, a girl of less social advantage, is taken by Emma under her wing. Emma's favorite hobby is matchmaking, and we watch her make one blunder after the next to poor Harriet. When Robert Martin, a young farmer, proposes to her friend, Emma retaliates very sharply, advising Harriet against marrying him and \\"falling into lower circumstance.\\" Harriet is miserable, but appears to be convinced. Mr. Knightley, ever present in Emma's life and home, scolds her sharply for her interference, but Emma stands her ground defiantly, insisting that she knows what is best for Harriet.When a Mr. Elton appears on the scene, pouring lavish attentions onto them, Emma is convinced of his being far superior to Mr. Martin, and does all in her power to coax Harriet into returning his feelings. All the while, she is smugly telling Mr. Knightley that she predicts a far better outcome for her friend than his preference of Mr. Martin. Harriet becomes attached to Mr. Elton, and all is going to plan, when Emma receives a tumultuous shock: Mr. Elton asks for her own hand in marriage. Emma, horrified, asks him about his feelings for Harriet, but he denies vehemently, saying that all his advances were meant towards Emma! Our heroine then sinks into utter guilt and mortification, watching Harriet's heart break due to her own wheedling and landing her in this mess.Mr. Elton wastes no time; he soon marries another rich woman, obviously keen to secure a fortune. Meanwhile, Emma's attention is caught by Mr. Frank Churchill, a recent arrival to Highbury, but she comfortably assures herself of her immunity to love and marriage. She flirts with him, but does not entertain any serious ideas towards him--only to find herself duped, again, when his secret engagement to her neighbor is revealed.Overwhelmed by all her blunders, Emma is feeling a great deal of confusion and remorse, but there is a final blow that she is unprepared for. Out of the blue, Harriet shares her new feelings for Mr. Knightley with her, and her hope that these feelings may be returned.Emma's world crashes at that moment. She panics and feels extremely agitated, which suddenly leads her to realize her own love for Mr. Knightley, a love unknown and unacknowledged by her. As she stares into herself, she reflects on his constant presence in her life, her attachment to him, her extreme care for his opinion. The thought of losing him is too painful to bear, and Emma, for the first time in the story, is plunged into total misery. But the tables turn yet again. As she awaits his breaking the news to her, of his attachment to Harriet, Mr. Knightley comes forth with a powerful declaration of love for Emma, a love he has had for years. In a very touching scene that causes the reader's heart to soar, Mr. Knightley, normally not a man of many words, pours his feelings to Emma in anguish. He asks her to marry him, with a pained conviction that he will be refused. Emma is overjoyed, assures his troubles away, accepts without a second thought.Amidst her shock, and just as she is dealing with the conflicting emotions of her own extreme happiness, and great mortification for Harriet, Mr. Knightley saves the day by encouraging Mr. Martin to approach Harriet again. The girl's feelings for him, which had never ceased, finally prevail, and the couple are united.Despite her haughty airs and egotism, Emma is \\"faultless despite all her faults\\" in the eyes of Mr. Knightley, and we can't help liking her, too, for she is always trying to do good, and her heart is in the right place. Mr. Knightley himself, kind, generous, sincere and honorable--a close reminder of Mr. Darcy--wins us over, and we breathlessly wait for things to work out between him and Emma. The author, with a remarkable talent for making us hold our breath, turning the tables and providing unexpected turns, concludes the book with happy endings for all, leaving us smiling.Austen's language, two centuries ago, is as delicious as the novel itself, the quaint writing taking us on a foray into older English and its idioms, structures and expressions. One of my favorite novels, Emma is a delight to read, from start to finish, and a story that captivates the imagination right until the last page."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Written in a very different dialogue, sometimes hard to understand what she means the way she express's her thoughts and feelings. I would call it very old English setting"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I finally finished Emma after months (yes you heard me right) of reading. I lked this book but I didn't adore it.I think the characters were well done. My favorites were Mr. Woodhouse and his germaphobic ways...as well as his distaste in people getting married and leaving their cozy little lives. I also liked Harriet Smith because she had a simple and almost innocent way about her...the way she blindly followed Emma and molded the desires of her heart according to Emma's approval. I felt a connect to Harriet in that way...especially thinking back to high school...the popular girls trying to get you to think a certain way and telling you would make a good boyfriend.Emma Woodhouse is a likeable character. She is a matchmaker who gives up on the hobby due to her matches never fall for each other and drama is the result. The secound half of the book is about Emma finding out her own heart.The reason I only gave two stars was because to me this was an okay read. I saw some of the new movie and the theme interested me...so because it was free on my Kindle and because I wanted to try a sophisticated and chic lit type read...I read it.If you can keep up with drama and who likes who...and if you enjoy a well written novel with a long letter thrown in for the juicy details you crave...than leave the gossip behind and stick your nose into one of Austen's lesser known novels. As for me I prefer Dickens and anything with a bit more action."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I bought this book to be a decoration on my shelf.

However, I reviewed this book as a 4 star simply because it lacks the strong story that other books from Ms. Austen display.Emma is a bit scheming and conniving and the story actually is more about events that just happen because of her medling ways.

My earlier experiences (with 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Sense and Sensibility') were disappointing; they seemed to be overly genteel and without substance. Was 'Emma' any different? Er,.. no.The first thing that grabs you about 'Emma' is that it reads like a play. It is almost all dialogue. No action, no flowing descriptions of the early 1800s England country ... just talk. This makes for a very tiresome read.Worse, the story (about a sweet young thing who busily plays matchmaker without any consideration of her 'victims' or her own love life) is rather [bad]. Any dramatic moments are very tame. Emma's high society world is so devoid of emotion it is any wonder they bother living at all. And in Emma's world there are no bad guys, no poverty, ... and no one seems to work for a living. Think 'Ozzie & Harriet' transported back 150 years and plopped into rural England and you've got the idea.So why bother with 'Emma'? Purely out of respect for the author, and her legacy as one of the founding female writers of modern English literature. She attempts, although not very successfully, in writing on matters other than soap operatic tosh (\\"gothic novels\\") her female peers did during that time. True, other woman writers have since greatly eclipsed anything Jane Austen has done. But she was the pioneer. So please give at least one of her novels a try."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Some of my friends like Jane Austen, but I really don't understand why. I know she's an important part of literary history because she was the first writer to use third-person narration instead of writing novels in the form of letters or diary entries, but an innovative form does not make up for bad content. I don't think I dislike it because of the time period - I like Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. I don't think I dislike it because of the everyday activities of the characters - I like L. M. Montgomery, James Herriot, and Ray Bradbury's Dandelion Wine. It's just boring. Emma is a whiny rich girl whose problems are on the same level as Miley Cyrus getting the wrong car for her sixteenth birthday.Emma is the only JA book I have made it all the way through. I had to read this book for a high school Lit class, otherwise I wouldn't have finished it. I have seen at least one movie for all of her books, though, so I know none of them are my cup of tea. Pride and Prejudice is the least aggravating. Mr. Collins, Lady Catherine, and Lydia are sort of funny I guess, but not much. The part where Lydia elopes is okay, because it is the only time in her entire career that JA makes her characters show any strong emotion. And Mr. Darcy is kind of hot in the six-hour movie, but so what.Maybe I would have liked Jane Austen if I had been introduced to her when I was thirteen. There's nothing in Emma that pisses off the moral guardians, but at least sex and violence can be entertaining when they aren't too gratuitous, whereas shallowness and materialism ... are ... just ... boring. JA's heroines don't seem to think about anything other than finding rich husbands and wearing fancy dresses to the local ball.In the words of Charlotte Bronte, \\"Anything like warmth or enthusiasm, anything energetic, poignant, heartfelt, is utterly out of place in commending these works: all such demonstrations the authoress would have met with a well-bred sneer ... ruffles her reader by nothing vehement, disturbs him with nothing profound ... Jane Austen was a complete and most sensible lady, but a very incomplete and rather insensible (not senseless woman).\\""},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"...However not nearly as bad as _Sense and Sensibility_. The characters seem a little less sterotypical here, and while _S and S_ was harshly critical of the snobbery of the upper class the main heroine in _Emma_ is herself one of these people, which makes it interesting. She is a busy- body who meddles in the affairs of others and thinks she alone can judge the motives of everyone else with exactness. Although she is very proud, she is not overbearing or mean (except to those she snubs) and we like her.The plot doesn't hold much to it, though. It is filled with what has become typical plot devices of the romance novel-- the comedic misunderstandings between people as they miss each others meanings completely, as well as the \\"knowing/not-knowing\\" and the \\"does she love me/love me not\\" devices which are utterly over-used and stale to most contemporary readers. Perhaps these were fresh in Austen's day. That to one side, even the plot itself was too simplistic and much too easy to see through. These shortcomings combine to leave the reader with a sense of tedium.

Plus how could we possibly like Emma. She is so self centered and ignorant. The only two times in which she can somewhat appeal to us is when she crys and in comparison to Mrs. Elton. This is a mockery of upper class life of the 19th century and Jane Austen, to my knowledge, lived a somewhat isolated life. How could she write a book on a topic which she doesn't know about. This further mocks the upper class leaving the point of this book as being entertainment. Why put us through 500 pages of pain.

The use of some of Austen's words and phrases from 19th century England (around 200 years ago) may make it somewhat incomprehensible for many readers, though. Since this book is focused more on characters than on the plot, and Jane Austen's own style is very elaborate, it tends to drag on with detailed descriptions of people and events. This can get very tiresome and tedious. So, if you're going to read Emma, you may need to save quite a bit of time because it might be necessary to read some parts a few times to understand them. Because Emma is such an old tale, there has been a movie made of it to make it easier to understand. Of course, it is not as detailed as the book, so the movie can not replace it. The movie Clueless, a modernized version, could also help decode some of the tough parts; just remember, watching it doesn't replace reading it; as characters were added, and names changed. Also, if you are looking for ways to create more effective characters in a story you may be writing, this would be a good story to find examples in. There are many characters who have very distinct and individual personalities in Emma. In this way, it relates to another of Jane Austen's novels, Pride and Prejudice. Emma is a long book with many creative characters, settings and plot twists.

I would still recommend people to read the book for the good plot behind slow movement and seeing this prideful heroine transformed into a more likeable person."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Endowed with wealth, brains, and good looks, Emma Woodhouse (twenty-years old) busies herself with other peoples' lives as she --thinking herself worldly and clever-- goes about scheming and conjuring up romantic liaisons.But it will turn out that she's neither worldly nor clever, but nave! And that in the end the only love match that really matters is her own. Dialogue supplies an immediate image of Emma. In reply to Mrs. Weston's question: \\"She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?\\" Mr. Knightley responds: \\"I have not a fault to find with her person,\\" he replied. \\"I think her all you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise, that I do not think her personally vain. Considering how handsome she is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies another way.\\"From the very beginning we can see that neither beauty nor vanity seem to be the theme of the story but--meddling. When Emma's governess-companion marries and leaves the Woodhouse household, Emma finds herself on her own; that is without a female voice of wisdom. Soon, she befriends a 17-years old illegitimate girl named Harriet, taking upon herself the duties of a matchmaker.Though Harriet is a sweet girl, she isn't so well-read or bright. Emma has her own opinion of her: She had always wanted to do everything, and had made more progress, both in drawing and music, than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to. She played and sang -- and drew in almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting.Next, Emma prevents Harriet from marrying farmer Robert Martin, who though decent, Emma thinks he's \`beneath' her. The novel depicts the British social system of hierarchies and inequalities, where titles of nobility and the landed gentry are the regents of the majority of the population. Intrigues, conspiracies, and much cleverness fill Emma's head as she cooks up schemes upon schemes to guide the docile Harriet.For this Emma proclaims her maxim: \\"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to refuse him. If she can hesitate as to \\"Yes,\\" she ought to say \\"No\\" directly.'\\" Having formed an opinion of Emma, at this point, readers can see how misguided she is. Emma's father is a feeble old man given to whining and wishing everyone to see the world as he himself sees it.Although he's a benign character, he proves incapable of giving sound counseling to his daughter. So father and daughter agree, \\"That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other.\\" To all of Emma's interventions, Mr. Knightley --a man of reason, common sense, and much nobility of heart-- disapproves, and once in a while warns Emma of her meddling. When Emma goes beyond her childish trickery and insults the town's spinster, Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley reprimands Emma, causing her to realize that she had turned into a selfish and careless brat. Much self-knowledge will come to Emma from this episode.The mysterious characters Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax add much thickness to the plot, which in some parts reads like a detective novel. The interaction between Emma and Frank and Jane helps Emma grow up and find a spiritual center.When Harriet tells her that she is in love with a man of a higher social standing and that he is being corresponded, Emma believes that man to be Mr. Knightley! Expecting to be told that Knightley will confirm his love for Harriet, she's awakened fully to the pangs of love when he --instead-- declares his love for her.And all is well that ends well: Harriet marries Mr. Martin and Emma Mr. Knightley.Although I admire Jane Austen's novels, I cannot help but to cringe at the British caste system that she describes. Titles of nobility, hierarchies, landed gentry, inequality, advantages over the common people, and so forth are all in my view detestable.The founding fathers of the United States of America wrote in the Constitution: The constitution of the United States provides that no state shall \\"grant any title of nobility; and no person can become a citizen of the United States until he has renounced all titles of nobility.\\" So, let's keep it that way."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Matchmaker, Matchmaker,Make me a match,Find me a find,Catch me a catch,Night after night in the dark I'm aloneSo find me a match,Of my own.- Fiddler on the RoofIn this romance, all the married characters are perfectly matched: Mr. and Mrs. Weston, John and Isabella Knightley, the reverend and his wife, and the list goes on. No wonder there is a friendly cupid in the village: Emma Woodhouse. This story explores the different aspects of love.Harriet Smith is Emma's friend. Miss Smith falls in love with three men in one year; quite a record even for Highbury. Hardly a flirt, Harriet Smith's heart is pure and indestructible. Bad advice makes her ditch Robert Martin, but a chance encounter reveals that her feelings for him are unchanged. \\"Unconditional\\" is the best word for this kind of love.Mr. Knightley's love is unrequited. For years he's been longing for a woman out of reach. And Emma does not even know she is in love. She only finds out when Harriet lays claim to the one man her heart desires.And the case of Mr. Woodhouse reveals a bizarre and unhealthy obsession. He refuses to believe his family and servants can ever find happiness away from Hartfield. But this actually reveals his own dependent form of love. When Emma marries he won't let her leave the house, so unfortunately her husband has to move in till Mr. Woodhouse dies.But it is not a tale of love unless the green-eyed-monster makes an appearance. Emma's jealousy is the most obvious. Jane plays the piano better than she does. Jane does almost everything better than Emma. It is no wonder that Highbury's most eligible bachelor is enraptured by this pale beauty. Needless to say, Jane Fairfax is an infrequent visitor at Hartfield.Miss Fairfax in turn discovers her jealousy of Emma at Box Hill, when Emma flirts loudly with a man who unbeknownst to her, is Jane's secret lover. Jane decides to break all ties with Emma. This might have been the best plan, because until matters turn right, sickness makes Jane paler than ever which may frighten visitors.But perhaps the worst culprit is Mr. Knightley whose disparaging remarks concerning Frank Churchill at first seem to be the wise counsel of a man of the world. Frank found true love as a young man while Mr. Knightley is fast approaching middle age unable or unwilling to find someone to marry. His constant criticism of Frank ends abruptly when he finds a woman willing to marry him.Highbury's cupid is in some ways similar to Jane Austen. They both are strong independent women who believe that marriage with the right person can create happiness. This is a light read. For the most part, Austen avoids physical description in favor of dialogue. It is amazing how depth of character can be portrayed this way. Jane Austen's ability to make fiction appear real is a rare talent."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I'm so sorry, but I simply fail to see what's so wonderful about Jane Austen.

GoodReads informs me that I have been struggling through this book since the middle of October, but in actuality this book has been haunting me for at least ten years. I bought it sometime before I went to boarding school. Though I remember starting it several times, I never made it past page 30. As I vociferously complained about this book as I was reading it this time, both M and my mother asked me why I was reading it if I disliked it so much. I didn't really have a good answer at the time, but now I know. Leaving this book unread for so long was haunting me. I really don't like leaving things undone, and I wanted to challenge myself as a reader. As an apprentice-writer, you are supposed to read as much as you can. If left solely to my own devices, I would mostly read YA, so Classics and Modern, Adult Lit are good for me.Usually, I like reading about Austen's heroines. I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice. Northanger Abbey was a fun read. But Emma Woodhouse makes me want to hit people. Okay, mostly I just want to hit her. So what were my issues?In Northanger Abbey, the heroine is also fairly naive and kind of creates the problems in her life. But you know what? She feels badly about it! And she learns! Emma's excessively high opinion of herself pissed me off beyond belief, and though she feels bad for a minute or two, in another 30 pages she'll be doing exactly whatever it was that got her into trouble last time. In fact, I don't think she focuses too much on starting the rumor about Jane Fairfax being in love with a married man. If she even thinks about it, it wasn't for very long. In fact, she focuses more on making a catty comment to Jane's aunt (whose ridiculously chatty dialog is *painful* to read), and that's primarily just because Knightly chastises her for it.Which brings me to my other issue: Knightly. Not a super-hot Austen heroine, in my opinion. Call me a crazy modern woman, but patronizing guys just aren't attractive to me. Now, I think he's perfect for Emma, who continues to act exactly like a spoiled child/Mean Girl, but I couldn't get 100% behind a relationship predominately based on him trying to fix her and get her to grow up. Maybe I'm missing something, and I'd love to see your thoughts or defenses of the book in comments. But really I'm just glad I accomplished that. Hopefully my other 10+ year book that is haunting me, The Phantom of the Opera, won't be as painful.Rating: 2 stars-- At least I will never have to start this book again."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Jane Austen has a lot of fans. I am one of them. My wife is another. People have been arguing the merits of Austen's novels for quite a number of years now; some people love her work, others do not. This is as it should be. We can take this premise of love/hate Austen a step further though. It has been my experience over the years that there is conflict even among those who love this writer's work and that everyone seems to have their favorite novel. This is also only right.The problem is though that I have found people who read Jane Austen are also a very opinionated lot and quite often harsh words are spoken when discussing the strengths, merits, flaws, dislikes, etc. of Austen's various works. Alas, I have to report to you that this is the case in our household; a normally peaceful place filled with tranquility and marital bliss...about 49 years of it...thank you very much!Yes, we are a family torn asunder. My wife (silly girl) feels that Emma is Austen's best work, while I, who am far more knowledgeable of such matters, prefer her novel, Pride and Prejudice...of which I am sure most of you will agree....me, not her, i.e. my mistaken wife. (Emma, bless her heart, is such an aggravating little twit).Anyway, this is really not a review of Emma, the work (I will admit that it is a very fine read worthy of multiple readings ever few years), but rather that of the actual book edition on sale here. I felt sorry for my wife when I saw her ragged copy stuffed into one of her already overly stuffed bookshelves and felt a new edition was in order. I bought this one for her.For the asking price of this book, including S&H;, I cannot for the life of me figure out why people are disgruntled and unhappy with it. It is very well bound, the font is extremely readable, the quality of paper is quite good, the dust jacket is extremely attractive and all the pages were present. I check the binding very closely when the book arrived, and again, for what I paid for this thing, it was excellent! Trust me...I know about such things. Hey folks, this is not advertized nor is it a leather bound first edition! This is a workable, useful book for everyday use.Now I have both this work and P&P; down loaded to my Kindle. The chances of my wife ever using one of these reading machines are as about as likely as pigs flying next mayday. It ain't going to happen. Therefore, she now has a new hardback book; one that will quite likely outlast both of us; It did not cost me a fortune. She can read her copy; I can read mine and the war between us that has been going on since we were in our early teens can continue.Bottom line...this is a good buy. And I must tell you, my wife was delighted with it.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I must start by admitting I did not get \\"Emma\\" the first time I read it. Or even the second. I did not really begin to properly understand \\"Emma\\" until after reading an essay by the great P.D. James, \\"Emma Considered as a Detective Story,\\" which forms a chapter in herTime to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography(a wonderful piece of writing too). And even after that, I have to confess, it took a while. This is a novel that does not give up its secrets easily.Although the outward plot is simple enough (some reviewers have found it tedious, and I did too, initially), the real genius of this book is that all the really exciting and dramatic stuff -- Jane Fairfax's agonized secret engagement, Frank Churchill's game of misdirection -- is happening both offstage, as it were, and under our noses. There is a very exciting, melodramatic romantic story here, but that's not the one Jane Austen tells us. She hides it in plain sight, however.All the clues are there (just as in a detective story) but we don't see them, because we are seeing the world through the eyes of Emma, who is, as the 90s remake wittily reminds us, clueless: self-absorbed, naive, convinced the world revolves around her. But aren't we all?The book itself is a kind of conjuring trick, and once you see that, it is impossible to ever see it again in the same way."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"These books are wonderful! I love feeling like not only am I reading a delightful classic but I am doing so with a piece of art. They are truly treasures on my bookshelf!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Jane Austen's Emma was published in December 1815, when she was forty years old (just 19 months before she died). It is thus a work of her mature period, and is something of a favorite among her devotees.My admiration of Austen's work is partly for her insight into human nature but also for the sheer beauty of her prose. It has a poetic texture. Her sentences can be long and complex, with some confusion of pronouns, so that they need to be lingered on, their sense teased out of them, until their structure and meaning is revealed, exactly as one would do with poetry. The effect is immensely satisfying.She spends almost no time on descriptions of place, but when she does she shows herself capable of describing a scene succinctly and effectively. Her main focus is on character. She describes her characters and their motivation at length, and reveals them through dialogue. This emphasis on dialogue makes her work eminently suitable for dramatization, so it is no surprise that there have been so many adaptations of her work in cinema and televisionEmma is unique among Austen's novels in that the heroine is a spoilt rich girl, with definite character flaws. The reader is challenged to judge her and to choose to like her or not.One or two of the plot elements are somewhat contrived, but that befits a comedy of errors, which is what this essentially is.I would advise reading as little as possible about the book before reading the book itself, for fear of spoilers. In particular, you should avoid any introduction, because editors of classics very generously provide complete synopses of plots in their introductions, presumably to spare the reader any surprises. Introductions are best read after the story or, in the case of the Barnes & Noble Classics edition, not at all. The introduction by Steven Marcus is verbose, meandering and thoroughly confused. If you want good editorial input, choose another edition.[PeterReeve]"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Unlike the previous reviewer, I greatly enjoyed this book. It's actually my favorite of Jane Austen's novels. Emma, to be sure, is a little frivolous and silly, but she's meant to be, as the book shows how she goes from hapless matchmaker to happily matched herself. The book is at times laugh-out-loud funny, and gives charming insight into life during that time period. Poor Harriet is a very amusing character, and Emma's father is a hoot. The many misunderstandings and romantic confusions only add to the story. Give Emma a chance...you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"The title character of \\"Emma\\" is unique among the heroines of Jane Austen's novels. She is \\"handsome, clever, and rich\\" and at twenty-one years of age, inexperienced in life. Further, for most of the novel, Emma is not actively seeking a husband. The grim economic necessity that made finding the right husband so important for Lizzie Bennet and her counterparts in the other novels does not apply. Emma can therefore be allowed to be foolish in her social forays, even to fail, without impairing the audience's ability to enjoy the resulting romantic comedy.Emma lives at the estate of Hartfield with her doting but hypochondriac father. Their social status as the leading family of Highbury is unquestioned. The recent marriage of Emma's governess to a close neighbor prompts Emma to wish to arrange suitable matches for her other friends and neighbors. Her immediate target is Harriet Smith, an amiable young woman of uncertain social status. Against the advice of Emma's brother-in-law and confidant Mr. Knightley, Emma persuades Miss Smith to refuse an offer of marriage from a Mr. Martin, a upright hardworking farmer of no social distinction. Emma then tries to match Harriet up with the ambitious young vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton. This scheme fails, hilariously, when Mr. Elton proposes instead to a horrified Emma.Mr. Elton soon brings a new Mrs. Elton to the village, a vulgar social upstart who presumes to arrange the social life of Highbury. Among her targets is young Jane Fairfax, once the paid companion of a gentlewoman, now forced to make her own way. The arrival of the charming and handsome Frank Churchill creates additional complications. Emma, after getting over her own initial infatuation, presses a match between Frank and Miss Smith. She is also provoked by Frank into passing rumors about Jane Fairfax and the husband of the woman she formerly accompanied. The climax of the story may be an unfortunate picnic at Box Hill, where everyone seems out of sorts. Emma thoughtlessly insults the silly but harmless Miss Bates, for which she is very properly upbraided by Mr. Knightley. Emma then learns, in rapid succession, that Frank has been engaged to Jane Fairfax all along and that Harriet believes she has gained the affection of Mr. Knightley. Emma is mortified to have misjudged both Frank and Jane, and to have inadvertantly pushed Harriet towards a man she now realizes she loves herself.Emma must take responsibility for her mistakes and make good her relationships with Miss Bates, Jane Fairfax, and Harriet Smith. Her fear of losing Mr. Knightley leads to a fateful conversation with him in the garden of Hartfield, in which Emma's fear of losing his friendship works at cross-purposes with Mr. Knightley's real agenda.Austen's subtle and witty exploration of social relationships in \\"Emma\\" is both humorous and insightful. \\"Emma\\" is the least heroic of Austen's heroines, but her undoubted charm and her very human efforts to mature have endeared her to generations of readers. \\"Emma\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen's novels as perhaps her most polished romantic comedy."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a a mess of things as she tries to manage the affairs of others.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"While \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Austen's masterpiece, Emma deserves distinction as a work of wit and fun. Austen wrote about the misfortunes of a high-minded philanthropist (\\"Emma\\" was perfectly translated into the 90's by the movie \\"Clueless\\"). In \\"Emma\\" Austen poked fun at the way Emma feels almost obligated to help her associates \\"better themselves\\" but did not realize until the end that she needed to work more on herself.I enjoyed reading this book and recommend it. If you are new to Austen then I recommend you start with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\"."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I am not going to read through all the reviews to see if anyone had the same feeling I did when reading \\"Emma.\\" I had just read six T.

One \\"struggles\\" to decipher who, where, and when. This is much more than a comedy of manners. Holmes would have been baffled by the twists and turns, the hints and allusions; and that is what made it so difficult to put this novel down. A \\"whodunit\\", if ever there was one. This was a much smoother reading experience than P&P which has a more intense love story.

I have never read Jane Austen before so having it for free is just so convenient! I highly recommend this book. The quality in my kindle is also really good."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Among fans of Jane Austen in the U.S., most may not recognize Juliet Stevenson by name; however, they will certainly recognize her from her photograph as \\"Mrs. Elton\\" in the film adaptation of Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow and therefore might be inclined to dismiss a reading of Emma by the deplorable Mrs. Elton. Big mistake. Stevenson's reading is energetic, precise, and diverse. As a very accomplished actress, she skillfully conveys a different and appropriate voice for each of the many characters. She easily glides from the whining Mr. Woodhouse to the pining Harriet Smith; from the jabbering Miss Bates to the judicious Mr. Knightley.I selected this audio volume of Emma because the box clearly states that the reading is _unabridged_. Naxos has published unabridged all six of Jane Austen's novels, and all are read by Juliet Stevenson except Pride and Prejudice, which is read by Emilia Fox, the actress who portrayed Georgiana Darcy in the 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. We who love reading these treasures by Jane Austen are, therefore, in very good hands when listening to these unabridged audio versions."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Yet another charming & beautifully published book. If you have enjoyed her other writings you will like this one as well. Thank you, Jane Austen, for your legacy! Book arrived as described (brand new, perfect condition)"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Nothing struck me more about this book than its pre-occupation with class boundaries, dwarfing even its other principal obsession - the question of matrimony.Coming from a society often criticized for its rigid caste hierarchy, I cannot help wondering whether comparisons of social equations in India and England in the 18th century would yield many remarkable differences. Emma's disregard for the &quot;insignificant&quot; classes would do the most caste-conscious Brahmin proud.One of the questions that stems from a first reading is the position of Ms. Austen herself. Emma's character is obviously intended to come across as more than moderately conceited. Is the opinion she, and other characters imbued with the darker shades of gray, hold, of the importance of nobility and high birth, intended to reflect the authoress' own disapproval of the social rigidity of pre-Victorian England...or is it merely the use of an existing social situation as a tool to bring into focus, the underlying moral theme of the ills of conceit and indiscretion?Either way, it is a little disappointing to note the apparent indifference which marks the book's attitude towards the same class distinctions which it so effectively delineates. It would have been considerably more interesting for instance, if Ms. Austen's sparkling prose could have been employed to contrast the characters and social circumstances of Emma and Jane Fairfax, who is superior to the eponymous protagonist in merit but inferior in social standing, instead of restricting her role to a supporting one."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I thought Emma was a deligtful book with a great ending i knew it would end that way but it was fun to read and jane austen is now my hero."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"This was the second of Austen's books I had read, The first being 'Pride and Prejudice'.

I see such a realism that only Austen seems to have mastered in her characters. Thought it always finishes with a happy ending, it gives hope that even as clueless (not meant to be a pun) as Emma is and how many stupid mistakes she made her efforts are rewarded with all of her matchmaking adventures coming to an end and everyone who was caught in the confusing love web being freed."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Marvelous!

She has a kind, loving heart, and really wants to do good, but makes a tangle of everybody's lives, including her own.

The unabridged book is slightly complicated (such as old-fashioned language) but if you savor it slowly it is well worth it.

Jane Austen created a charming and hilarious heroine in Emma. The comic timing and great characterization proves that Austen was -- and still is -- the most sought-after and influential author ever! (Just look at the work of Helen Fielding, Marian Keyes and other female authors of this era.)Emma is a force to be reckoned with. She takes it upon herself to play the role of Cupid. She chooses her candidates according to social status, age, charm, etc. The irony, of course, is that Emma doesn't have a lover of her own. What happens when one of her conquests as Cupid goes terribly wrong? And will Emma find her own knight of shining armor? This is one of the funniest situations in the book.If you love Jane Austen, and if you haven't read this novel, please do!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"An intellectually stimulating piece of literature, which challenges one's beliefs and enlightens one's mind with inventive theories concerning life-- if this is the type of commentary that peaks your fancy than I would not recommend reading Jane Austen's Emma. Indeed, the book is a coming-of-age story illustrating the comical mishaps of Emma Woodhouse, the novel's heroine, who takes destiny into her own hands. Particularly, she makes it her purpose to find suitable mates for her close acquaintances. As one might imagine, at times this creates a slightly awkward situation for the parties involved. Therefore, readers are introduced to a strong set of supporting characters inhabiting the small commonwealth of Highbury.Undoubtedly there is one amongst the bunch that the reader is able to identify with. For instance, Mr. Woodhouse, the town hypochondriac, who fears any situation which could spark the onset of illness; therefore, he virtually never leaves the comfortable confines of his home. In addition, Miss Bates and Mrs. Elton, the village gossips, who make it their business to learn all the comings and goings of the townsfolk. Besides the previously mentioned characters, there are a host of others who take you into their hearts and homes within the pages of the Jane Austen's novel.In fact her strong characterizations were perhaps the most compelling factors that kept me turning the pages. Indeed, Emma lacks the complex nature of many other novels written today. It is, however, a timeless example of the dynamics of human interaction. Yet the book's strongest claim to attract readers is a carefree amusement ending with a happily ever after."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"How could Jane Austen have thought that the character of Emma would please no one but the author?I was charmed to enter Emma's world, amused by her wit, stunned by her complacency, sympathetic when she made her mistakes. I finished the book with a real affection for this character, drawn so finely and so lovingly by a truly masterful writer.I had seen the movie version starring Gywneth Paltrow before reading the book. I expected to read the entire book with Paltrow's raspy laugh and swanlike neck in mind. Yet Austen transported me away from my cinematic preconceptions. There is so much more to &quot;Emma&quot; than a movie can capture: the incisive social commentary, the near perfect grasp of human nature, which hasn't changed much since Austen's time, in all its ugliness and sublimity.There has been much discussion over why Austen remains so popular with readers today. After all, her characters are geographically and socially isolated, immensely concerned with money, and (with a few exceptions) have no discernible occupations other than hunting for mates. It is hard to find similarities between these lives and those of modern Americans. What Austen does so well is to depict her particular place and time with astonishing clarity. Through Austen's (and Emma's) eyes, we see the commonalties that exist among all people, no matter the time or place."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"&quot;Emma&quot; is definitely Jane Austen's best and most humorous book. The quirky characters, comic faux pas, and Emma's adventures in matchmaking keep you very entertained. Although it's funny, the vocabulary can be challenging. (Austen had an astounding vocabulary for never even having gone to a secondary school!) If you need a classic and want some laughs along the way, &quot;Emma&quot; is the book for you."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Honestly, if I had not read Pride &amp; Prejudice first, I would have thought that I did not like Jane Austen's writing style. Emma is extremely slow to begin with though it picks up about half way through. The story centers on Emma Woodhouse, the unmarried daughter of a man obsessed with ailments to be potentially caught from drafts, rich foods and just about anything that is part of ordinary life. Consequently he does not go out (as a rule) and depends on Emma substantially for companionship and general well being. Despite his eccentricities, he is well loved by the community and is a very genial character. Emma, resolved not to marry, takes up matchmaking after her governess, Miss Taylor, marries friend and neighbor, Mr. Weston and Emma feels that she had contributed to making the happy union come about. Against the advice of family friend and mentor, Mr. Knightly, she \\"takes under her wing\\" a young girl at the local school to groom and bring out into good society in hopes of finding her a husband - specifically Mr. Elton of the vicarage. Despite her unknown parentage and lack of good expectations, Emma convinces the girl, Harriet Smith, to aim high in her expectations of a husband and to reject the advances of those of her natural social set in preference for a gentleman.This goes on for so long that I was convinced that this was going to be the whole of the book. Joyfully, though, the Mr. Elton angle blows up catastrophically and simultaneously several more interesting characters are introduced. The icily reserved Jane Fairfax comes to visit her grandmother and aunt before hiring out as a governess. Though she had been taken in by the Campbells and raised very genteelly along side their own daughter, she has no fortune of her own. The same age as Emma, they are expected to be fast friends but Emma's resentments of Jane's superior abilities and deportment do not bode well for this. Then Mr. Weston's son, Frank Churchill, who was raised by his aunt and uncle after his mother's death, comes to meet his new stepmother and makes a splash in Highbury society. Mrs. Weston has designs for Emma and Frank. Emma meanwhile has designs for Harriet and Frank. No one can figure out Jane's designs though Emma suspects improper attachments between her and her benefactor's daughter's new husband. Mr. Elton then brings in a new wife whose forceful manner and arrogant air threaten to turn everything upside down against Emma when Mrs. Elton tries to force a relationship as Jane's benefactress. Similarities between Emma's presumptions with Harriet and Mrs. Elton's presumptuous behavior with Jane are unavoidable and provide a relatively subtle irony.In this last half as the intrigues play out, the story takes on the flavor of Pride and Prejudice and becomes infinitely more interesting. Though the first part was slow, it did serve to really build the character of Emma and she becomes very real through her actions in the second half. It also serves to humanize Mrs. Elton's character to some extent while softening Emma's.This really is a very, very good book and I would have given it 5 stars except for how slow it was in the first half. A patient reader will enjoy this but readers who don't have patience with character studies or slow bits would do better to read Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"After reading Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, then Sense and Sensibility, I could not help but read another one of Austen books. The merits of the book lie mostly in character development. Emma, a girl of 21, is altogether too absorbed in the dangers of matchmaking, which result in several devastating consequences for her friend Harriet and her own continual blindness to the true feelings of the men around her. The reader encounters various characters of interest that form a better &quot;tangle&quot; of plot than Pride &amp; P/Sense &amp; S has to offer. I admit that the first 2/3 of the book left me questioning Jane Austen's work. I could not admire Emma Woodhouse (whom I thought to be at first a silly girl who misinterprets everything) as much as the other &quot;heroines&quot; in Austen's other books, but she proves to be sweet and naive, but clever at the same time, and she always has the best intentions at heart, especially for her loved ones like Mr. Woodhouse. It appears that Jane Austen always saves the best for last--I found the last 1/3 of the book delightful. Throughout the whole book however, Austen's talents and satire shines in various characters, particularly Mrs. Elton, who represents society's perpetual desire to be upper-class. Austen also sheds light on the social stress of class, power, connectinos, etc, without overwhelming the reader.I highly recommend reading this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"&quot;Fffftt!&quot; Cupid's arrow, once again, pierces the hearts of two unsuspecting people. Causing two people to fall in love, Cupid is known for his matchmaking. Similarly, Cupid is portrayed through Jane Austen's Emma. The protagonist, Emma, tries to find her best friend, Harriet, a husband. Emma is a well thought out, insightful novel. Despite the time gap between the time that Austen composed this novel and present day, the reader can still relate with characters. By developing a setting for Emma, Austen uses a realistic setting. For example, in the village of Highbury, class rank, reputation, and family background are major factors in marriage arrangements, which was a harsh reality during those times. Austen also develops Emma really well through her actions and decisions. Because Emma is a life-like character, she too makes mistakes. In addition, Emma also chooses to make decisions that make readers love and despise her. Creating unique love triangles, they contribute to the interesting and complex plot. For instance, Harriet has affections for Mr. Elton, however Mr. Elton has feelings for Emma, and Emma is trying to set up Harriet and Mr. Elton together. Using symbols, Austen is able to help readers recognize affections between characters. Showing his love for Emma, Mr. Elton keeps Emma's portrait of Harriet and makes a riddle for Emma and Harriet. However, Emma interprets Mr. Elton keeping the portrait and the riddle as his love for Harriet, but in fact symbolizes feelings for Emma. Also, Austen's themes are well carried out in arrogance and self-deception, and marriage. Thinking she's a perfect matchmaker, Emma is constantly proud of herself and her setups. However, she is unable to realize that marriage can't be playing around with. Ultimately, Emma was a very good book because of its great setting, characters, plot, symbols, and themes."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma is definitely Jane Austen's most captivating heroine. Emma may be flawed, but her character is the most enjoyable. I loved this novel. Throughout the story, Emma overcomes many personal hurdles. A synopsis would ruin the book - this is a must read!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Watching my favourite sitcoms or a worthy comedy on the big screen I may be moved to laugh out loud. Books have a much more arduous task. Very few authors have managed to make me laugh. Roald Dahl has, so has Harper Lee. Now I can add Jane Austen to the list. Emma is more of an entertainment than an art. It is structured very much like a romantic comedy of the 90's. The characters are introduced and beautifully developed while the reader wonders who will end up with whom. It is a tribute to Jane Austen that we care for Emma even though she causes so much trouble. She is unique in that we enjoy her failings as they lead to so many embarassing situations. In fact the Emma at the beginning of the novel is a much more interesting character than the polished Emma at the conclusion. Plot? There is very little. It is characters that Austen succeeds at. We remember Knightley and Emma; Frank Churchill and Mrs Elton; Mr Woodhouse and Harriet Smith. They are all well defined characters and like any good book you miss them when they depart. Oh and the line that forced me to laugh out loud: &quot;Mr Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without difficulty, upon Mrs Elton's beginning to talk to him&quot;. If you don't get it read the book, I guarantee you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I loved Emma by Jane Austen. I think that the best aspect of Austen's writing is her witty irony that is featured in all of her books. I thought that Emma was a touching and funny story about a young woman whose lot in life is to play the matchmaker. She tries to fix the world to her own liking, but it does not work. Finally, she stops being so critical and realizes what is standing right in front of her. If you enjoy the book (which I think you will), buy or rent the movie starring Gywneth Paltrow. It is just as funny as the book. If that is not your fancied genre, check out Clueless, starring Alicia Silverstone. It is loosely based on the novel and also very funny, with a modern twist."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Though Persuasion is my sentimental favorite, I regard Emma as Austen's finest novel overall. She is at the top of her game and everything works: the dialogue, character development and, did I mention, the humor? While teaching Emma in my AP English class this year, I realized that many less talented readers read right over the irony and scathing remarks. Jane Austen is so very funny that she makes better readers out of those who take the time to read her carefully. I have to admit that the movie version of Emma with Emma Thompson is quite good and does the novel some justice. It also helps a first time Austen reader get a flavor for how things looked and sounded in this time period. If you haven't yet started to enjoy Austen, pick up Emma and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I've been reading ever since I was younger, and have always enjoyed it..

Emma brags to a good family friend,Mr. Knightley, that she predicted the match herself. She then wants to be a matchmaker. However, Mr. Woodhouse decides to disapprove of every marriage.To replace Mrs. Weston, Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young poor girl wiht no record of her real birth mother. The two become good friends. Emma finds a wealthy man, Mr. Elton, that she thinks would be perfect for Harriet. Harriet grows to love Mr. Elton, but the feeling isn't mutual.A poor old maid, Miss Bates has her niece, Jane Fairfax, visit the town. Emma is envious of Jane because Jane is everything Emma wants to be: respected, elegant, and musical.Frank Churchill, Mrs. Weston's step-son, visits the town. Charming and handsome, he pays much attention to Emma. Many speculate the two as a perfect match. While others approve, Mr. Knightley is determined to think ill of him.Well, I'm sorry, but I hate giving away books, but believe me, this book is worth it. I will warn you that Austen tends to ramble on, but if you hang in there you will love it!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Once you master the difficulty of the language(some in our reading group never did), you can focus on the story and relate to the witty and impudent Emma. In one incident Emma and her best friend and former governess share a non-verbal communication by stepping on the other's foot under the table when something wild is happening! So many of these &quot;modern&quot; exchanges take place, that I was able to drop my misinformed presumptions that the english gentry class of the nineteenth century are so different from me. There are moments of great cruelty (such is the case of class struggle) and there are two hilarious characters; the gossipy neighbor who barely catches her breath, and answers her own questions, and Emma's worrisome and overprotective father. The story seems to be one party after another -- from parlor rooms to ballrooms to picnic luncheons -- you will be amazed at how much time these people have on their hands! Oh, the leisure class. Emma goes through some humbling changes, and there are surprising turns of events. I found myself wishing for Emma's world -- where your neighbors are intimates and you alternately visit and are visited upon, and work isn't in the picture."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is priviledged. Very priviledged. She comes from the richest, most important family in her small town. Everyone looks up to her, including her indulgent governess and even more indulgent papa. The theme of her life, from the time she was small, has always been \\"Emma knows best\\". Emma takes this to heart when she takes an interest in young Harriet Smith, the beautiful, empty-headed daughter of, well, someone. The book follows Emma's misadventures as she tries to marry Harriet off to the local parson and meddles in the lives of her friends and neighbors, eventually learning that perhaps she doesn't always know best.This is, I think, one of Jane Austen's less popular works, perhaps because there isn't a great deal of romance in it. It is, as I titled the review, more of a character study, as well as a study of society at that time. On first reading, I didn't care for the book or for Emma's self-centered goodness. After reading it again, I grew to enjoy the book as much if not more than her more popular works, like Pride and Prejudice. The wit is sharp as usual (and maybe slightly more ascerbic), and more thought seems to have been put into the secondary characters. Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Like all of her novels, Jane Austen's EMMA is essentially a comedy of manners, a work in which the characters move inside a highly restrictive code of conduct and must walk a fine line between the socially acceptable and unacceptable if they are to survive, much less reach their goals. But at the same time the central character, Emma Woodhouse, is a marked departure. Not only is she a young woman of considerable wealth and social standing, she is, as critics are fond of pointing out, &quot;flawed.&quot;The nature of Emma's flaw is essentially Austen's observation of the great failing of the upper-class: an assumption that what they think and do is inevitably correct. And although Emma is quick-witted, generous, and kind, she suffers the effect of this blind arrogance when she comes to believe that she is gifted as a matchmaker and can order the romantic lives of her circle to suit her own liking. The result is a series of seriocomic entanglements and disasters that touches virtually every one with whom Emma comes into contact.The story requires considerable exposition, and consequently the action is slow to gather; add to this the fact that Emma herself is so overbearing and self-assured that you frequently want to give her a slap. The result is a novel that many, including Austen fans, will find an uphill read. Even so, Austen is writing very close to the peak of her powers here, and her amazing talent for observation, subtle irony, and flashing wit endow EMMA with tremendous charm and interest. In many respects a remarkable novel, but one that I recommend more to determined Austen fans than to casual readers.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I definitely recommend this book to first time Jane Austen readers, and especially to young girls, for it is so cute and so amusing. I wish I were &quot;forced&quot; to read this in High School for I would have surely written good papers on it. I can't see how anyone can dislike this classic. Jane Austen's character &quot;Emma&quot; has her faults of course, be she is a true character that is amusing and utterly charming, unlike those characters in Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, which by no doubt are wonderful books, but Emma truly has to be my favorite Austen work. It is predictable, even without having seen the movie that was based on this work (that mind some of you was written over 200 years before Alicia Silverstone existed...gosh!) but the predictability of it made it all the more enjoyable, like a sort of mystery in romance. I definitely recommend this book to anyone over the age of 11 or 12. I know I'll make my kids read it some day. It is superb!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"If I could do it over again, I would read Jane Austen's Emma before I read her Pride and Prejudice. Unfortuanately that was not the case. I loved it nonetheless. Emma combines witty humor and a fun cast of characters that makes for very enjoyable reading. It does not read as quickly or as easily as Pride and Prejudice, but it is still great fun!If you have seen the movie Clueless starring Alicia Silverstone, then you know the basic plot. The 1995 movie was adapted from Jane Austen's novel, which was published in the 1800s. The Miramax version of Emma is done very well and should be viewed after reading the novel, not before. It would make the reading even slower.Emma Woodhouse is a young woman who is the socialite of her small English town of Highbury. She is beautiful and wealthy and popular; everything that girls nowadays want to be or imagine themselves to be, so she is not terribly hard to relate to. She is not terribly smart but humorously clever and witty.This novel displays this young woman's journey to self-discovery and love; along the way she humorously meddles in everyone's lives. Her romantic blunders are extremely fun to read about. I recommend this novel to any avid reader, but I should caution you against reading Pride and Prejudice beforehand, but if it is too late, do not hesitate to read it. And even though it may drag a bit, bear with it; the ending is reward itself!Needless to say Emma will always have a place in my heart and on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Of all of the books by Jane Austen this was my least favorite. The central character is not likeable and you can't sympathasize with her. It is a long and tedious book and it was constantly set aside to read something else when a new book arrived. If you are truly a fan of the 18th century period writings yes go ahead and read it but Pride and Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility and Northlanger Abbey are far better reading."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I'm reading Emma again for the third time. It happened like this: I thought I'd try an audio book on CD for the first time, something to listen to in the car besides music. Scanning the shelves at the local bookstore, I saw loads of contemporary best sellers, self and financial help, new age and evangelical Christian spirituality, and Jane Austen's Emma in MP3 format, all on one disc. Austen! Water in the desert! I scooped her up.For the last week I've been listening to her in my car. At the beginning it was without much concentration. Over the next few days my attention gradually increased. Now I'm hooked. Down the throat. Through the gut. Again. It happens to me every time I return to Jane. I just can't get enough. The last two nights I've gone to bed reading ahead of where I've listened. Even though the story is coming back to me, I'm still taken by it, hook line & sinker. Jane's reeling me in, and the line is utterly slack.Now, I am a guy. I break out in hives if I happen to accidentally brush a romance novel. As far as I am concerned, bodice rippers where the tall olive skinned duke inevitably has his forceful yet gentle way with the heroine are good only as ammunition with which to tease the women in my life who enjoy such tripe. Having said this, I realize a lot of people also refer to Jane Austen as \\"Chick Lit,\\" equating her with the likes of Nicolas Sparks. For the record, those people are on crack.Austen is much more a comedic writer than a writer of what we call romances. She is simply a hoot. Subtle disjunctures and ironies build to exquisite crescendos. She has me laughing every other page. Her characters, even her unpleasant and ridiculous ones, tend to breed sympathy. Like most of my favorite books, she creates worlds, or a world, really (all of her books are set in the same historic and geographic milieu,) which comforts and gladdens. The feeling I get from her is much like the feeling I get when I read Tolkien describe the Shire or Last Homely House, or something like the children's book Frog & Toad to my niece.It's an eating poached egg on toast snuggled up inside under a quilt on the couch with a cup of tea on a rainy day kind of feeling. (Don't you just love English prepositions and phrasal verbs? Try doing that in French! Austen and phrasal verbs: two of the many reasons English speakers ought to rejoice in their language, I say!)Anyway, during all of her stories, including Emma, Europe was being blown apart by the Napoleonic Wars, and the only oblique references in any of her stories to that maelstrom is that Great Britain has a mobilized Army (Pride & Prejudice) and an active Navy (Persuasion.) The reason the military is important has nothing to do with Austerlitz, Waterloo, Trafalgar or any of that nonsense. Rather, it is that both services have officers which make very suitable suitors for women of her heroines' social positions (Lt. Wickham & Capt. Wentworth, for example.)Some brand this awful: elitist, sexist, parochial. I, for one, find it beautiful. Small, intimate, ordered, secure, anchored. Very human and sane, that is.What matters most is not what some silly diminutive one armed Corsican with maniacal delusions of world conquest is doing; no. What really matters is whether and how Mr. Woodhouse takes his gruel, or if Mr. Elton will propose to Harriet. Or if Mr. Knightly and Mrs. Weston have come to visit yet, today. Will Mr. Frank Churchill come, and what is he like? Has Emma truly foiled Mr. Martin's advances on her friend, he being an entirely unsuitable yeoman farmer? Harriet must marry a gentleman, you see.Just so. Indeed, these are truly the things that mattered- and still matter- most. Don't let the history books and the reverse snobbery of some critics fool you.Instead go read this book, and every other that Jane wrote, and prepare to be enchanted."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma is Jane Austen at her best, the work of a writer in her prime. While earlier novels such as Northanger Abbey and Pride and Prejudice are extremely witty and well-plotted, none are as clever, interesting or satisfying as Emma, in its depiction of the frivolous preoccupations of the landed gentry in eighteenth century England.The plot centres around Emma Woodhouse, the young, beautiful and clever daughter of a hypochondriac father, who amuses herself by attempting to play cupid to her friends and neighbours - with predictably painful results. Austen's characterisation is delightful: characters such as Mr Woodhouse and Miss Bates are brilliant comic creations but are never in danger of becoming caricatures, like Dickens' characters sometimes do. Meanwhile Emma herself is a complex mixture of intelligence and thoughtlessness, kind-heartedness and self-satisfaction, and is superbly realised. Austen's dialogue is as delicious, and frequently hilarious, as ever - she reveals the finer nuances of her characters through the things they say, intentionally or otherwise - and shows how intuitively insightful and compassionate she was.As in most Jane Austen novels, all situations resolve themselves into a happy ending, though whether this tendency was prompted by a genuine positivity and warmth of feeling or a playful sense of irony, nobody is sure. Regardless, Emma is a tremendously satisfying read."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Jane Austen wrote some of the most remarkable romantic novels in English, and Emma is said to be written at the height of her powers. Like all her novels (Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility), the narrative is simple, straightforward and the story develops through seemingly commonplace conversations and events. Emma is twenty one year old daughter to rich Mr Woodhouse, \\"full of trivial communications and harmless gossip.\\" The story captures how Emma comes to terms with her own errors of judgement, and how she discovers her liking and love for one of the chief characters of the novel. (Perhaps giving his name away here would be sacrilage on my part!!). The cast, the locations, the conversations are set in distinct Austen style, rooted in rural English counties. The romances are Victorian, and progress through delicate, slow developments that a through, diehard romantic is bound to like. Emma's actions are governed by her own romantic fantasies, where she tries to bring people together playing a matchmaker, and her failures as well as successes make this novel an interesting read. A treat for Austen fans!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Buyers be advised that, though this page as of 08/30/2005 does not specify, this is ABRIDGED.

That was a special interest of Emma Woodhouse. \\"Emma Woodhouse,handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some ofthe best blessings in existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little todistress or vex her.\\"Emma lives with her father in Highbury, England in the early 1800s. Her mother died when shewas little, and Emma's governess, Miss Taylor, married Mr. Weston. Emma is now all \\"alone\\" with herfather at Hartfield. She decides to excite her boring life by trying to find Harriet Smith a husband. Emmadecided never to marry, but she breaks that decision later on in the book. She tries to make Harriet theperfect gentlewoman, who has a good taste in men. Harriet and Robert Martin, a young farmer wholikes her, are \\"in love\\" already when Emma decides to find Harriet a husband, and she convinces Harrietto dump Robert. One problem is that Mr. Elton, who Emma tries to set Harriet up with, is in love withEmma, or at least her money. Next Emma tries to set Harriet up with Frank Churchill, but only afterhaving a failing attempt to fall head-over-heels in love with him herself. Then Mr. Knightley comes intothe romantic picture, both Emma and Harriet fall in love with him. After all the attempts, both girls getmarried, but I'm not going to tell you who marries who.Emma is a comedy of manners.

It might take you a while to get into the way it is written, but take the time to do that as it is well worth it."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Well, Jane Austen was not a Charles Dickens. This work lacks the superb construction of Charles Dickens' novels. The images are there, but Austen does not put you there the way Dickens can. Also Austen's work does drag at times even though it is only about half the length of Dickens' full length books. But aside from that, it is a pretty good novel. The book is pleasantly funny with some touching moments. Emma herself is well drawn as a young woman who thinks she knows what is best for everyone, and later learns that sometimes it is best to let people make their own decisions. In all honesty, this is not uncommon at all. I find it very interesting that the recent movie &quot;Clueless&quot; was able to portray this story in a modern day setting. (The names were all changed, but anyone who read &quot;Emma&quot; could tell the movie was based on it.) Mr Knightley is memorable as the embodiement of reason. Harriet is fine as the poor girl caught in the middle. If you like this book, I suggest the movie with Kate Beckingsale as Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma was a very well written book in the Victorian era.

For the price, I was very pleased."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"It seems as though there is a law that every edition of one of Jane Austen's books must be published with a painting of a formal lady or ladies on the cover. In the case of Emma, such a painting is, perhaps, most appropriate. Emma, unsurprisingly, tells the story of a young woman named Emma. She is, as we are quickly told, spoiled and head-strong. And, as is always the case in Ms. Austen's heroines, young and unmarried.Emma has recently lost her sister/mother-figure to marriage and appears doomed to a lifetime of seclusion with her kindly, but odd and hermited father. To avoid such a result, at least for a time, Emma sets to matchmaking. She finds a neighborhood girl with only limited prospects and attempts to launch her into the stratosphere of an advantageous marriage. Irony abounds.This novel reads much like Jane Austen's other materials. The text is dense, but witty and, at times, quite funny. The action, such as it is, is slow paced and revolves around the joining together of various singles into couples. The themes are, as is often said of Austen, private. The manners, speech and attitudes are largely dated.I do not consider myself a great Jane Austen fan, but there is no doubting her greatness in crafting this novel. The characters are as lifelike as ever an author has produced. The plotting is intricate. Indeed, only a second or third reading reveals the many hints and suggestions laid before the unknowing reader on his first journey through the book. The text absolutely sparkles with wit - there are, in fact, moments where one might laugh out loud. This is without reservation a book that any reader would do well to peruse and study.That said, I find it difficult to overlook the attitudes of an earlier age and that impacts my enjoyment of the book. The casual tyranny of Jane Austen's protagonists is jarring to the modern eye. Indeed, much of Jane Austen's value system is repugnant to me. Of course, one tries to read the book with respect to the time at which it was written. In doing so, one finds a beautifully written book about a delightful set of characters who comedically come together. Ghastly prejudice, however, is very close to the surface, particularly in this book of Austen's."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Seriously, this book is just convoluted and boring.

Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"There is one principle reason that Emma is remembered. It was written by a woman. If Jane Austen had been a man, her works would be regarded as banal and inconsequential works of little literary merit. The work is impressive considering that Austen came from a culture that repressed women (a characteristic that most female authors share), but beyond that it is a poor work.There is a profusion of works of greater literary merit by women than what Austen offers, Mary Shelly's &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, Kate Chopin's &quot;The Awakening&quot;, Alice Walker's &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, &quot;Nectar in a Seive&quot; by Kamala Markandaya, or a very fine piece &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; by Zora Neale Hurston. All of these works have better characteristics than &quot;Emma&quot;, and prove to be superior to all of Austen's writings.Trust me, &quot;Emma&quot; is a waste."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Having been forced to read &quot;Emma&quot; for an English Literature course, I feel that I know as much about it as anyone else, if not more so. &quot;Emma&quot; is nothing more than a trashy romance, like the rest of Jane Austen's novels. We all know more or less what is going to happen at the end of the book - of course the hero and heroine are going to fall in love. Austen's use of irony is not exemplary either - is there anyone who didn't realise that Frank Churchill was hiding something, if we weren't sure quite what? Anyone who describes an Austen novel as a &quot;classic&quot;, particualy this one, needs their head examined. She is an olden days Jackie Collins, whose fancy language seems to have deluded some into believing that she is something which she certianly is not."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I actually saw the film (with Paltrow as Emma) before reading the book and I must say, that I am glad that the movie was very true to the novel because I adore the movie. I was actually surprised that the book was so similar. It features one of my favorite Jane Austen characters, Emma of course. She is a joy to read about. The dialogue was easy to follow and it was a quick but fun read."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"The fourth, longest and last of Jane Austen's books to appear in print during her lifetime, Emma is considered a classic romantic comedy and was first published in 1816. Written almost 200 year ago, it's inevitable that the dialogue may feel a bit stilted at times. However, this adds dimension and depth to the story that focuses on 19th century social hierarchies and the interaction between various social classes.Miss Emma Woodhouse is a shining example of a 19th century socialite. Beautiful, clever and wealthy, she fancies herself a master matchmaker and sets in motion a laundry list of schemes to pair off the Highbury residents. Convinced a makeover would elevate her new friend Harriet's social standing and thus her marriage potential, Emma, fueled by her feeling of superiority, plotted and planned, all to no avail. Failing to realize the extent of her shortcomings and the consequences of such hurtful behavior, Emma was finally confronted by Mr. Knightley. Afterwards, embarrassed and ashamed, she reevaluated her life and began to make amends, in hopes of becoming a better person.Emma is a beautifully written, classic, laced with wit and sarcasm. Through a vastly differing cast of characters, each delightfully inspiring in his or her own way, Austen vividly captured the heart of a community. Everything is neatly tied up at the conclusion, as things literally come full circle...ending much the way it began.A subtle, yet significant message is hidden just below the surface--the beginning and the ending are just definitive points in the journey, in between is where we write our definition of happiness. There's a depth and sincere honesty written into the very fabric of this story-that must be recognized to fully appreciate the artistic genius of Jane Austen.Like a vintage automobile, Emma is a slow, leisurely read, perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon.Armchair Interviews says: What more can you ask of a book, even if the story is 200 years old."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I really enjoyed this a lot. It's not quite as good as Pride and Prejudice, but it is better than Sense and Sensibility. It still has a lot of things to say that are still very much pertinent to modern times. Austen's longest work is an entertaining romp that shows what happens when one young girl gets too involved in the affections of (and between) others. Although overlong, it's still a really, really entertaining read."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Jane Austen is one of the greatest women writers in history, and Emma ranks among her best. The characters are rich and varied. For anyone with an interest in Victorian literature, Emma is sure to be a hit."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I tried to read this book when I was in middle school and quickly returned it to the shelf when I found it slow and boring. I decided to give it another try and couldn't believe that I hadn't enjoyed it before. \\"Emma\\" is not a work of deep and intense literature, but Austen deftly explores human motives and emotions. Emma is consumed by the class system and buys into its importance, much like Mr. Darcy in \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" Emma feels she has the power to change the system, especially where her friend Harriet Smith is concerned. Emma must find out the hard way about class distinctions and friendship.I'm not an avid Austen reader, in fact I'm quite a novice as far as she is concerned. Maybe after I've read some more of her novels I won't value \\"Emma\\" as highly, but for now, this novel is high up on my list, and I enthusiastically reccomend it."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Ms. Austen wrote very well about headstrong, intelligent young women. All of her books are wonderfully warm, but they show a tendency to light irony as well. Ms. Austen describes her world of early nineteenth century England so very well. In this book her heroine is Emma Woodhouse. She is the younger daughter of a wealthy landowner. She has a good heart, but she is spoiled. She also sticks her nose into other people's love affairs with some disastrous results. Miss Austen does a wonderful job describing life in a busy English village. The village in this story is Highbury. The characters in the book are wonderful, but it is the spiritual development of Emma that carries this book. Somehow she manages to grow and learn while staying within the strictures placed on her by her father and by English village life. Your journey reading Jane Austen's work is not complete if you do not read this book."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"This is a book about Emma, a rich girl's mischievous struggle in her own little fantacy world. This book is a bit boring and dry in the sense that everything is just always so beautifully fitting. Even in the worst moment when Emma's ill judgement turned into chaotic love triangle, the story went on and worked everyone's fate for the best. Since I don't read much of Jane Austen's works, I guess her style tends to be light and comic. So, if you are looking for a book with lots of heart throbbing drama, this is definitely not the one."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"When I first tried to read this book (almost ten years ago, when I was around 13), I found it incredibly dull because there is little action. I finally decided to reread Emma and realized that the appeal of this book (in addition to Jane Austen's writing style) is in its characters. Emma's setting is a small town full of an assortment of delightful personalities.At the center of the story is Emma Woodhouse, an intelligent and wealthy young woman, who believes that she knows what is best for everyone around her. Emma takes the orphaned Harriet Smith, a pretty but simple-minded girl, under her wing. The consequences are disatrous for all. I found it pleasant to watch Emma grow throughout the book and learn about the way the world works.The other characters include the loquacious Miss Bates (and her silent, elderly mother), the constantly distraught Mr. Woodhouse, and the handsome and affluent Mr. Knightley. There are also Jane Fairfax (who the movie portrays a little bit more negatively than the book) and Frank Churchill who show up later on in the book to make life a little more interesting.These people and many others add to the richness of Austen's narrative. The best part about them is that all are real people who have both good and bad points, and make mistakes. I found that a lot of them are similar to people that I know today in the 21st century.The second time I read through this book, I found myself aching for more. I felt delighted every time I find one of Jane Austen's little witticisms (and there are a lot!). These little gems are enough to make her my all time favorite author."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is easily Jane Austen's most annoying character. She's young, knows absolutely everything about everything, is the judge of everyone's good character and takes those around her for granted, despite frequently praising her friends and relations. She is, for all intents and purposes, the 18th century version of daddy's little rich girl.How can a book about such a person be so captivating? The short answer is simply: because Jane Austen wrote it. The long answer is several hundred printed pages and well worth the read.Much of the story is the typical Jane Austen framework, but the character of Emma is entirely different from many of the other main figures in Austen's works. While her other heroines have plenty of outstanding qualities and several flaws, Emma has plenty of flaws and several outstanding qualities. It's the central, exceptional qualities that make Emma a worthwhile character, but the flaws - and her growing consciousness of them - that make her loveable.Countering Emma is the younger, and more gullible, Harriet Smith. She becomes Emma's project when Emma learns of her situation in life and is determined to improve it by befriending her. Emma's increasing awareness of her own flaws footnote their friendship, as she is forced to admit to being something of a snob, and a meddler.There are all sorts of loud and obnoxious people in \\"Emma\\", and Austen's orchestration of the interaction among them is, as always, brilliant. The character of Mrs. Elton alone is one of my favorite \\"bad examples\\" of all times. This is perhaps the downright funniest of Austen's books, but in ways it is also the happies and the saddest. Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith are in the throws of adolescence, where everything is either tragic or blissful.I typically say that \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" and \\"Northanger Abbey\\" are my favorite Austen works, but secretly it might be truer to say that \\"Emma\\" is. It's not as clever as \\"Pride\\" or as satirical as \\"Northanger\\", but the way in which Emma is forced to open her eyes to the world - and the way it continues to revolve, and evidently not around herself - is really something most of us can relate to all too well.Incidentally, the movie version of \\"Emma\\", starring Gwyneth Paltrow, isn't bad, but if you haven't seen it yet, please do yourself the favor of reading the book first. As always, there is so much in the pages that is ignored on the screen. Then, when you're done reading, watch \\"Clueless\\" again, which isn't nearly as true an adaptation, but is a funnier movie."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I did my best to read this book but I just couldn't get into it. The book is well written and clearly at a 187 years old, has stood the test of time. Nonetheless, at this stage in my life I was not motivated to finish the book."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Received my book 2-3 days after I purchased it! It is in even better shape that I thought it would be in, love it!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Yet another solid Jane Austen classic.

I enjoyed the book, Emma, it takes me into an older, different era where gentility still existed. Refinement used to be an art."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I don't know what it is about Jane Austen's novels, but I've read two of them now and I find that I really do enjoy them. The characters that she creates come alive on the page and even though nothing terribly exciting happens besides the usual day to day, I find myself drawn into the lives and events anyway.In the introduction to my version of Emma, there is a comment that Emma is basically a book about nothing. While this is true in a way, Emma is about a lot more than nothing and gives the reader a fascinating glimpse into the world of Emma's England. There is also the great intrigue (insert tongue into cheek a bit) of whom will be matched up with whom and when these courtships will commence, etc.Ms. Austen's easy to read style and sense of humor really do make this an enjoyable book to read and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a lighthearted frolic through classic literature in old England."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"If you have not read Emma since you were in high school or college, read it again!! A wonderful story which held my attention from beginning to end. I read it on my kindle and could not put it down. The recent movie follows it very faithfully."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"As a reader who is tired of cliche romances and characters, I really enjoyed Emma for the unstereotypical main character. Emma is neither wonderfully good with dreadful circumstances (like Jane Fairfax, Jane Eyre, etc.), nor rich and intolerable (like Mrs. Elton, Scarlett O'Hara, etc.), rather she is like many of us today, a well-to-do girl who is nice but has faults. I loved how she grew through the story, slowly realizing more and more of her fundamental issues. Mr. Knightly is the perfect gentleman to everyone and a wonderful friend to Emma because he loves her enough to correct her for her faults. Even so, he grows and improves in the book as well. All of the characters have many facets to their personalities and characters and Austen weaves a beautiful web through the story. Emma is a lighthearted, fun read, yet has depth and relevant themes.I recommend reading this book twice so that it can be fully appreciated."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Now that I have all my computer business sorted out (and at home sick today) I'm going to try to get moving on my Jane Austen reviews. Emma was the second Jane Austen book I read, and the only one I read for school. I was 15 at the time and actually wasn't all that fond of the book. It was funny, yes, but I found Emma herself absolutely insufferable and the relationship between her and Mr. Knightley kind of squicky (fell in love with her at 13???) but watched the Gwyneth Paltrow movie and liked it. A couple years later, I gave it another try and loved it!It's probably second or third favorite of all Jane Austen's novels. I still find Emma to be very irritating at times but she is a very amusing character to read about. Like Elizabeth Bennet in a way, she is so sure of herself and her impressions of people and turns out to be totally wrong at just about everything. I like how she learns her lesson when some of her matchmaking attempts go awry. And I realized that Mr. Knightley wasn't serious about falling for Emma when she was only 13, thank heavens. I like that Frank Churchill, the \\"bad guy\\" of the book, isn't exactly a villain per se, but still a total cad.Most of all, I like the element of mystery. Who sent Jane Fairfax the piano? What secrets are the characters hiding? It wasn't a crime novel or anything, \\"only\\" a romance, but throughout there was a sense that things weren't what they seemed, which I enjoyed. Of course, now there's no surprise to learn of Jane and Frank's engagement but it's fun to pick out the all the hints or \\"clues\\" that Mr. Knightley picks up on but Emma is totally oblivious to.I like Mr. Knightley as a character, but he's not exactly my type. Emma needs someone to keep her on the right track, but I'd be afraid he'd be nagging me all the time. I guess it's of no importance, since he's a fictional character and all, but it's still fun to think about."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Before reading the book Emma by Jane Austen, I made the mistake of watching the 1999 movie version starring Gwyneth Paltrow. For some reason I just did not like this movie and I found that I could not sympathize with our heroine Emma because I just plain did not like her. I found her childish, self-absorbed and meddling. Since watching this movie I have been a bit prejudice with the story and I never really wanted to try my hand at reading the book itself. I have been lately re-reading most of Jane Austen's novels and I realized what a disservice I have been doing myself all of this time by not reading this book. I dug out my copy of Emma and I began to read. The basic plot everyone knows and not a lot happens but I realized that the writing is wonderful and what a truly fantastic heroine Emma is. She is flawed, probably the most flawed of all of Austen's heroines but the best part about Emma's personality is that this makes her more human and more like us. She is able to see when she does wrong and she tries at the end of the book to atone for some of the mistakes she made about people's characters. Of course the novel is filled with Austen's wonderful characterizations of human personalities, and I think that since Emma is one of her later novels she had perfected her art of characterizing people and making them such wonderful individuals to read about whether they are more for comic purposes than to be a main character.This addition also contains some wonderful supplemental background information of Jane Austen as well as some of her letters and also what other writers have thought of her works and of this book in particular. I love reading other's opinions on Jane Austen and what they feel she thought or felt since we can't ask her ourselves so I found the information in this addition excellent."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"It was hard to like the main character but it is supposed to be. I liked her father enough to make up for it.

Just as you would have seen in Jane Austin's time. If any of you have grandparents and have stumbled upon their editions, their's probably looked the same. I don't think this is due to the fact that B&N; doesn't care how their books look, but because they wanted to keep that feel that you were reading an older book, from a different time. After all, they didn't have computers and things to measure the print paper perfectly back then.I can't wait to dig into the witty, wonderful world of Jane Austin. It's always a treat!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Although Austen's longest novel, Emma is a lot of fun to read. It was areal challenge to make us truly care about this spoiledand meddlesome character. I guess it because it is Emma's depth of feelingand her reactions to all the chaos she creates throughout the book that reallyendear her. That and the fact that in the end everything works out as itshould (no major spoiler that), and all her messes are resolved happily orcomically.I can see why many consider this to be Austen's best work: it has many of thebest qualities of the other work, but it also builds into a mysterywith a surprising resolution, and many characters turn out to be quitedifferent from what we initially suspect."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I love historical novels and Jane Austen holds a special place in my heart. Even so, I have issues with Emma. I adore much of the writing style, but the plot and characters irk me.Let me start by saying that Jane gets kudos for trying to do something different here. In other stories she had not-well-off young women who were desperately trying to get by in life, to thrive in the world they had been born into. Emma is Jane's efforts to focus on a new kind of heroine. Rather than being poor and worried about her future, Emma is quite secure. She is wealthy. She has a father who dotes on her, a house she loves, and she is perfectly content to live like this forever. She has no need of a husband or really of a partner at all. This is an interesting diversion from other stories.Emma, aged 21, grew up without a mother and with a loose-handed governess. So she is spoiled and very aware of her class and status. It might be hard especially for American readers to relate to just how stratified English culture was at the time. Some situations - like how Emma treats farmers - might be seen as cruel. It's important to put this into context. This was \\"normal\\" at the time. Heck, for a few societies on the earth this is \\"normal\\" even in modern times. You can't really judge it as right or wrong.Mr. Knightley, aged 38, has been pretty much an uncle to Emma her entire life. He was a teen when she was born and was always there to watch over her and correct her. He tries to guide Emma as she plays romantic match-making games with the people around her, but Emma thinks she knows what is best. She manages to bungle a variety of relationships. To her credit, she does feel badly right away, but then she plows ahead with a new scheme.SPOILER WARNINGOne of the key issues I have with this book is the VERY creepy idea that Mr. Knightley has been lusting after Emma since she turned 13. If I had a young daughter and a male family friend in his late 20s started following her around as soon as she hit puberty, I would be quite irate with him. Again, I realize gigantic age gaps in this time period were normal. As they say in the story, men weren't expected to take on a family until they hit age 30 and had the financial strength to support a family. Women were supposed to marry in their late teens / early 20s so they could kick out as many kids as possible. Even so, though, to have a person that was almost an uncle to Emma stalking her as soon as she started showing a womanly body really bothers me a lot.Also, I realize Emma is written to have her be spoiled. Jane Austen tries to give her some humanity by making her dote on her father and feel remorse each time she does something wrong. However, to me it just doesn't get past the way-too-spoiled aspect of her personality. Interestingly, I enjoy some of the movie versions FAR more than I enjoy the book because in the movie they alter the storyline just enough to make it much more palatable. They smooth out some of Emma's annoying traits and make the Emma-Knightly pairing a bit less creepy.Still, if you're looking to start reading the Jane Austen series of books, I wouldn't start here. I'd start either with Pride & Prejudice or with Sense & Sensibility."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Frankly I am puzzled by the criticisms leveled at this edition. There is another edition [also by Barnes and Noble] and it is cheaper, though the quality is very flimsy and I wonder if the other reviewers were confused with that edition?This edition of Emma is beautifully bound, with a cloth spine, and has a lovely portrait on the cover. The text is not too small unlike some other editions, it makes for comfortable reading. The book itself is sturdy, as it is in hardback, but not unwieldy - it fits nicely into my hands. Besides the main text of Austen's novel itself, it has added features - a brief chronology of the world of Jane Austen & Emma, an introduction, the main text, as well as useful endnotes, a list of adaptations of the novel [in both film and book format],comments, as well as a list of resources for further reading [biographies and letters of Austen] and criticisms. In all, a value buy."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma (Barnes & Noble Classics)Great Book if you like the classics as I do. Quality of the pages is very good (acid free should you wish to keep it and, smooth texture)."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"It is difficult to imagine how a book written in 1816 can still be relevant and emotionally viable, after so much change in literature. And while female gender roles have evolved and broadened (causing certain things to become irrelevant- like the drastic choice between marriage or condemnation), Emma remains one of the most complex and ambivalent characters in literature. Perhaps because Austen's major theme- pride- is a rather timeless attribute in humans.Austen was quoted as wanting to create a character \\"no one but [her]self will much like,\\" and Emma certainly answers that promise. Emma is a talented, highly intelligent woman who carries so much pride, that she deems every man an ill-suitor for her, while an under-adjusted adolescent side of her secretly resents such men for being turned off by her harsh arrogance, smugness, and severity. She acts as a match-maker for her less fortunate common friends, bringing them together with men whom she despises; thus ridding herself of her own ingrown desires while condescendingly \`helping' her girl-friends meet men who share their mediocrity. As difficult as it is to like Emma, readers will find her mysteriously compelling, perhaps because there are moments of confused kindness, where our heroine is able to transcend her vanity and truly feel happy for the couples she brings together.Enter Mr. Knightley, who after a tiresome handful of preceding men, is able to gain Emma's respect and affection simply by not buying into her mind games and calling her on her actions. Austen's genius is most manifest in her witty dialog, and the dynamic between Emma and Mr. Knightley- in their bantering flirtations veiled under intellectual stimulation- are testament to that.This novel is about self-image, and for a woman in 19th century patriarchal society that is all she has. Emma owns her self-importance until the men notice, until it becomes real (and despite early feminist tendencies, this only re-confirms female's subordination to men in that social context). Regardless of how readers feel about Emma, the novel is superbly written with wit, irony, and an almost ruthless emotional verity. If an author's goal is to gain her reader's empathy, Austen set out for herself a highly ambitious goal, one that was improbably executed with grace."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Maybe it was the way Jane Austen drew the reader into the story, or possibly the twists and turns of the plot, but whatever it was to add the extra flavor it worked. The book demonstrates a perspective on love that can only be seen through the eyes of a person who involves themselves as a whole in the book. It has a way of making it an impossible task to put it down. This story stands the tests of time and will surely work it's way into the hearts of millions more.

After every movie adaptation, I feel compelled to return to the sour ce and have always found Austin's presentation the best."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"It's not that I don't like Emma as a character, I do! It's great that she's a bit flawed and gets into messes because of her arrogance, and I even liked the storyline (though to be honest it's probably only because of \\"Clueless\\") to a certain extent - I just felt it was a little dull.Nothing ever really seemed to happen. People just talked. A lot. And I felt that the whole 367 pages (of my copy) could have been cut down to 150 - at least! The one possibly exciting part (Harriet and the gypsies) you didn't see happen, as it was only ever talked about. Like the rest of the book.It's the first Austen I've read and has - I hate to say - slightly put me off trying any of her others, although I probably will in time.If you like charming books of light humour and romance - or just Austen - I'm sure you'll enjoy Emma, but if like me, you are used to a bit more excitement and adventure, you might want to try something else.

The story pretty much revolves around our heroine in her attempts at matchmaking, the social norms of England in those times etc. Though it borders on romance, I would say it is more of drama.

You can never tire of a truly well written book like her writing of Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"For some reason, I always think of Emma as my least favorite Austen, but I thoroughly enjoyed re-reading it. Emma is a very imperfect heroine, but Jane Austen was wrong in supposing that no one but herself would like her. I find Emma to be refreshing as a heroine, and she stands is stark contrast to Fanny Price in Mansfield Park (my least favorite Austen heroine). There is none of Fanny's timidness or inability to stand up for herself. Emma is independent and strong, and much more modern than other female characters in classic literature. Her mistakes in pride and arrogance are such as we all make on a daily basis. She presumes to understand people's emotions and thoughts and thinks she has a right to order things as she would have them be...very type \\"A\\", in my opinion. But, as her intentions in every case are good, as she only wants those she loves to be happy and prosperous, one cannot really blame her.The other characters in this book are also very satisfying, particularly Jane Fairfax and Mr. Knightley. Jane is the poor orphan on whom everyone in Highbury, the village in which Emma lives, dotes upon. Emma, of course, can't stand her at first, but only because of the knowledge that Jane is superior to her in many ways. How many of us have declared that we don't like someone simply because they're better at something than we are? Mr. Knightley, Emma's neighbor and long-time family friend, is her conscience, calling attention to those errors in judgment that Emma constantly seems to make. He often lectures her, but only in an attempt to set her on a better course. When faced with the prospect of losing him, Emma must confront her own feelings and question her own situation in life.It's altogether an enjoyable read, with plenty of twists and blunders, and should appeal to any fan of Jane Austen...or just anyone who wants to read the real version of the movie \\"Clueless\\"."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse, \\"handsome, clever, and rich,\\" is the 21-year-old daughter of the elderly owner of Hartfield, the largest estate in Highbury.

Emma, doting on her hypochondriac father, whom she represents to the outside world, has grown up without a mother's softening influence, and at twenty-one, she is bright, willful, and not a little spoiled.Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world.\\" Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings. Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her.Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions. Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.Love and the formal protocol of marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion. Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults. Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives. Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one.

For all its pleasant enjoyability, however, the novel is also a fascinating character study of one woman being elevated to a nobler level by being taken down several notches.In this respect, \\"Emma\\" is a prime example of the fact that although many see Jane Austen as something of a proto-feminist, she often gave her male characters the most admirable constitutions of her entire cast. Although the female Emma may be the heroine we hope will triumph, the male Mr. Knightley (like Colonel Brandon of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\") is the unimpeachably noble person, and the one who helps Emma ascend to a higher plane of virtue when she might otherwise have been left in despair at her failures. In the end, Austen's fourth novel (and the last published during her lifetime) is not a feminist manifesto. Rather, it transcends the gender wars and remains a touching comedy of errors with a profoundly subtle commentary on human pride and folly."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"In a letter to a relative Austen once wrote \\"3 or 4 families in a country village is the very thing to work on \\"She knew this world intimately and well and it was the subject of her best novels of which Emma most assuredly is one .Emma Woodhouse is young,lively and thoroughly spolied .She is complacently sure she knows what is best for all her friends and acquaintances ,especially in matters of the heart .She is a self-appoinited matchmaker to all her friends and she particularly interests herself in the affairs of the young and naive Harriet Smith,an unassertive and timid young woman .Emma is convinced Harriet would be ideally matched with the local minister Mr Elton not knowing that he despises Harriet for her lack of social graces and standing and that he is set on wooing and winning Emma herself .Emma is idly contemplating a dalliance with a newcomer to the village ,Frank Churchill ,but her real feelings are for the local squire George Knightley .Knightley is an amused and exasperated spectator to the meddling which is second nature to Emma.The novel deals with the way Emma's plans for others collapse and she as a consequence comes to a new and painful degree of self-awareness.She knows less about herself and others than she fondly imagines .The book is a very tough-minded piece of work and has universal themes to do with human motivations and self-deception.It shows the manipulations and strategems of the marriage market as supremely important in society .Emma is essentially about growing into self awareness rather than a romantic comedy as so many other Austen novels are .It is why it still retains its impact so many years after its original publication .The support cast is well drawn -Elton,in particular being a great sketch of an odious snake who has somehow been born as human being .Any society in which people meddle in each others affairs is one in which Emma is still a valid book"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"A classic gem done full justice by the superb reading of Prunella Scales. A great listening experience was marred, however, by a surprising and disappointing flaw in disc 8 which rendered the final track unintelligible.It would be much appreciated if you could replace this faulty disc, as such a literary masterpiece deserves to be presented and preserved in mint condition.The damaged disc apart, Jane Austen would surely applaud this excellent rendition of her beloved Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"*Warning: there are some plot spoilers in this review!*Jane Austen has a reputation as a witty, humorous writer with a keen eye for human folly and failings, and with this novel she certainly lives up to her reputation. While Emma isn't as popular as my personal favorite Pride and Prejudice, I believe that Emma is so popular, and can be considered \\"literature\\" (that is, a piece of art) because the story really has a universal quality to it. The fact that we can relate to the situations and characters in Emma some 300 years later is what makes it seem so timeless, and why the Emma movie with a \\"modern twist\\", Clueless, was so wildly successful. When you compare both Emma and Clueless they show how little has changed and that privileged teenagers (and young adults) will find themselves in the same situations and social patterns, whether they are in 19th century England or 21st century America.Of course, while the wealthy and bored teenagers in Clueless might try to set up their friends on dates, the stakes were a bit higher in Emma. Emma (the heroine) attempts to match her new friend Harriet Smith with the new minister Mr. Elton not just for dating, but for marriage as long as they both shall live (remember, divorce was rare, if not nonexistent in early 19th century Britain.) Unfortunately, this plan backfires when Mr. Elton becomes interested in Emma, not Harriet. The problem was that Emma (already conceited because she successfully \\"guessed well\\" when she matched her tutor Ms. Taylor with a local widower Mr. Weston) failed to get to know Harriet and Mr. Elton well enough to figure out if they were, in fact, right for each other. Emma shows her class-snobbery when she (through some very adolescent mind games) convinces Harriet to reject the proposal that she receives from a local farmer (Mr. Martin, the man Harriet likes and eventually falls in love with), in the hopes that Mr. Elton will propose. Emma was too self-centered and (to steal the phrase from Amy Heckerling) clueless to notice that Mr. Elton was not, in fact, interested in Harriet, but in herself--a fact that leads to Harriet's heartbreak. Of course, this is only one part of the multi-faceted story that Jane Austen created about the life of a \\"handsome, clever and rich\\" woman living in Highbury, England, but it gives you a sense of the life and times of Ms. Emma Woodhouse (as we see them in the book)Fortunately, all is well in the end when Emma learns her lesson about matchmaking and toying with emotions and discovers that she loves her brother-in-law and well loved family friend Mr. Knightly. This is a classic \\"happy ending by way of falling in love with the best friend that you had all along,\\" but with a slightly dated feel. First, he is sixteen years older than her and he, in a way, helped to raise her (at least, in principles). The fact that he admits openly to having been \\"in love with (her) ever since (she) was thirteen at least,\\" slightly bothered me. Who, in the 21st century, would admit to having a crush on their 13 year old sister-in-law? In the context and time of the novel it's romantic. Now Mr. Knightly might be described as a pedophile. However, the dated dialogue (like the above) is the only qualm I had about the book, and I hope that it doesn't discourage anyone from reading Emma. Overall, I would recommend this book to any Clueless fan, romantic-comedy fan, or anyone who wants to read the wonderfully universal writing of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Very much like Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, Emma, a novel by Jane Austen, is a tale of confusion and intrigue over the universal topic of love. The reader's feelings of befuddlement and captivation, while nonexistent at the beginning of the novel, will grow exponentially until the climax. At the end of the novel, everything finally makes sense and the characters live on happily ever after. This is a very satisfying ending, clearing up all earlier confusion, although it leaves little room for wonder and thought after the reader has finished the book. Though I found this novel very confusing, and therefore unenjoyable at times, the intrigue and vivid setting and characterization overpowered my initial dislike. I would recommend Emma, to seventh through ninth grade students who are capable of deciphering meaning from complicated words and are able to pick out the essential subject matter of passages that do not state the meaning strait out. Readers will enjoy the frenzied, almost comical, characters in all their confusion over who loves whom, as well as all the wonderful descriptions, and the satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma is another one of Jane Austen's novels. It's a good book, however I don't believe it's as good as Pride and Prejudice. The protagonist, Emma, is a very bright and handsome young lady. It seems that the protagonists of Jane Austen are always female, intelligent, and pretty. The characters in this book are complex. For example, an elderly well-known bachelor suddenly falls in love and took a wife of about the same age as he. His reason for marrying is also strange, because he simply wanted to have a wife. And Emma was the person who started and encouraged their relationship. The plot was interesting too, a few surprises here and there.My problem with Emma is that it wasn't as engrossing a story as Pride and Prejudice. But this is a different style of book, so it's really unfair for me to say that Emma is not as good as Pride and Prejudice. Other than that, it's a wonderful book.I recommend it to readers who want dialogue-based novels."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Easy to get on my Kindle and to transport it everywhere.

Throughout the beginning of the novel, Emma is portrayed a nave child, with a broad imagination. Due to her broad imagination, Emma bases her own happiness solely upon her matchmaking abilities. However, although Emma has the best intentions, her actions eventually lead to the worst results.Through the key marriages of Mr. Elton, Mr. Churchill, and Mr. Knightley, the theme of self-revelation through the actions of marriage is revealed in the novel, Emma.Emma attempts to make a match between When Harriet Smith and Mr. Elton. However she is blinded in noticing Mr. Elton's love for her. Mr. Elton does declare his love for Emma, which leaves her bewildered. After this incident, Emma's first revelation is that her matchmaking abilities are flawed and resolves that she will no longer match-make.Emma then meets Frank Churchill. Emma soon begins to realize that she might be in love with Frank Churchill. However, soon after Emma learns of the impending marriage between Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax.However, soon after this event, Emma's third revelation begins to arise. Emma recovers from the disappointing event concerning the marriage of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax, and finds herself suddenly appreciating Mr. Knightley. Emma now begins to realize at this point in the novel that Mr. Knightley is her true love.In the beginning of the novel, Emma Woodhouse is portrayed as a conceited and imaginative child, who lacks the knowledge of true love and self-respect. At the end of the novel, through the events of marriage between Mr. Elton, Mr. Churchill, and Mr. Knightley, Emma ironically becomes a mature and selfless woman. Although Emma's character throughout the novel changes dramatically from a spoiled heiress to a mature and selfless woman, I believe that Emma's endurance and triumph of numerous obstacles of oppression, gave her the strength to liberate herself from her stereotypically society, thus allowing her to realize and attain her own desires and dreams.In conclusion, I would consider Emma a very good book. However, I think the novel's only faults are that it was extremely long and at some points very difficult to understand."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma is a great classic novel and probably one of Jane Austen's best! If you like this book I also suggest the wonderful movie adaptations. Both the one starring Gwynneth Paltrow and the one starring Kate Beckinsale are quite lovely!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings in existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress ir vex her.\\"So begins Jane Austen's classic novel of the mishaps of matchmaking. Upon the marriage of her governess, a match Emma purports to have arranged herself, Emma next turns to finding a suitable husband for her new young friend, Harriet Smith. She encourages Harriet into an infatuation with the vicar, Mr. Elton. Her plans fall apart, however, when Elton reveals to Emma that she is the true object of his affections. Rejected, Mr. Elton flees to Bath and finds a wife almost immediately. When the long-awaited Frank Churchill finally comes to visit, the entire social set of Highbury is swept into a tangle of suspicion, charm and deceit. Although Frank is commonly viewed as a perfect match for Emma, she feels only friendship for him, and views him instead as a potential husband for Harriet. In spite of Emma's multiple failed attempts at matchmaking, there are two couples married and one engaged by the end of the novel.Jane Austen was one of eight children, the daughter of an upper middle-class clergyman. Although her family was not wealthy, they led comfortable, socially respectable lives. Well-educated and with a love of reading, Jane Austen began to write at the age of twelve. She never married. Her first novel, Sense & Sensibility, was published in 1811, followed by Pride & Prejudice. All of her novels were published anonymously. She died in 1817, and is buried in Winchester Cathedral.I found this book to be as charming and delightful as the film, which I first fell in love with long ago. Jane Austen's wit is very much in evidence throughout the novel, and greatly improves what might otherwise be a somewhat dry style. Austen referred to Emma as \\"a heroine whom no one but myself will like much.\\" However, I found Emma to be engaging and delightful. I recommend this book to all fans of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"So what does a &quot;handsome, clever, and rich&quot; girl like Emma Woodhouse do when she has no professional aspirations and no intention ever to marry? In addition to painting, playing the piano, and condescendingly visiting the poor, she is what might be called a social organizer, which primarily means finding husbands for single women and arranging all the social details involved in doing so. Her decision not to marry stems from her opinion, conceited but sincere, that there's not a man out there who could entertain her as a lifemate; and besides, with her mother pushing up daisies and her older sister Isabella living away in her own marriage, she already has a husband: her father.Jane Austen's novel weaves a group of several characters, balanced almost equally between men and women, into a web of romance in which the reader is led through various scenes and situations in a guessing game of who will end up with whom. Emma makes herself the prime mover of this group, but she is not as infallible a love broker as she would like to think. After she has successfully matched her childhood governess Miss Taylor with an affluent man named Weston, she turns her attention to the naive and impressionable Harriet Smith, for whom she has identified the young vicar Mr. Elton as a suitable beau. But then Elton declares his love for Emma, who of course is not interested in him, and...oh, what a mess.The plot thickens when a pretty girl named Jane Fairfax arrives in town to inspire Emma's curiosity and jealousy because she, unlike Harriet, is charming enough not to need Emma's assistance and tutelage. The main heartthrob among the women is Frank Churchill, actually Weston's son from a previous marriage, an impulsive and not totally honest young man whose amorous unpredictabilities shake the foundations of Emma's schemes. The man designed to be a traditional hero is George Knightley, sixteen years Emma's senior, who acts as Emma's moral anchor and monitors her matchmaking endeavors, gently cutting her down to size when her head gets a little too big, such as when she tells him that Robert Martin, a farmer, isn't of the proper class to be Harriet's husband.Austen maintains the right narrative pace, giving her major characters just enough room to develop themselves plausibly through interactions with some colorful minor characters. Emma's father, the slow-on-the-uptake Mr. Woodhouse, a man of extreme sensitivity to gastronomical disorders and temperature fluctuations, is an innocuous but amiable fellow who appreciates his daughter's loyal devotion but is judiciously content to remain in the background of her life and activities. The Highbury seniors are represented by the elderly Mrs. Bates and her slightly less elderly daughter Miss Bates, who has a marvelous talent for prattling about trifles in which nobody else is interested. She can be outdone only by Miss Suckling, the annoying chatterbox Elton decides to marry after being jilted by Emma.Emma is not a bad or cruel person--she genuinely feels guilty about Harriet's continual romantic misfortunes and her own momentary sarcastic behavior towards Miss Bates. However, it cannot be denied that she's a snob whose goal is a Perfect Society with all the right ladies married to the right men, and to hell with all those other little people (the farmers, the servants, the unattractive, etc.) who don't fit into her master plan. But Austen herself admitted this much, showing that Emma is far from perfect herself and allowing her to learn a lesson in humility by the end of the novel, for which she is duly rewarded--the denouement is a little too neat, but of a style so familiar to us by now that &quot;Emma&quot; seems nearly two centuries ahead of its time."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I can never decide whether Pride and Prejudice or Emma is my favourite book by Jane Austen. Emma has all the Jane Austen hallmarks - wit, exuberance, and laugh out loud moments, coupled with realistic, well drawn characters and a real feeling of being in the Regency (which is hardly surprising, as that's when the book was written).Emma is a spoiled young woman who has everything she can possibly want in life: a doting father who lets her do as she pleases, friends, family and a beautiful home. She is understandably please with herself, and this leads to complications as she tries to sort out everyone else's life. She's meddling and interfering, and yet so well meaning she comes across as a likeable character rather than as a busybody.She takes up Harriet, a young woman of doubtful birth, and encourages her to set her sights on Mr Elton, the local vicar, as a future husband. Poor Harriet is completely bowled over by Emma, and is persuaded to like Mr Elton over the farmer's son she is really in love with. Emma is oblivious to the fact that Harriet and Mr Elton are completely unsuited, and that Harriet and her farmer are made for each other.Through a variety of hilarious scenes, Emma comes to realize she doesn't know as much as she thought, and learns that it's better to let other people manage their own lives.The minor characters are wonderful: Mrs Elton with her barouche landau (anyone who's read the book will know what I mean), sweet Miss Bates, and dreadful Mr Elton, who has designs on Emma.Eventually, Emma learns how to understand her own feelings, and leaves everyone else free to listen to theirs, which leads to a satisfying ending all round.Hugely enjoyable."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"This is my favorite Jane Austen novel. Yes, Emma the heroine is a flawed human being. She is a spoiled little rich girl always trying to manage other people's lives, an effort that never turns out well. For example, she convinces her less-well-off friend, Harriet Smith, that she deserves better than the honest farmer who loves her and whom Harriet loves, and almost upsets Harriet's chances of happiness as a result. Emma continues in this vein throughout the book, at times being on the verge of doing serious harm, until at last the moment of enlightenment comes - a moment filled with shame and confusion.Of course, the overall plot in this as in all other Austen novels is the problem of getting married, and in that respect these books represent the original \\"chick lit.\\" The difference, of course, lies in Austen's brilliant satire of characters like Miss Bates, the village gossip, and in her glorious ability to make the words sing."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I felt that Emma was a great book and an informative look into the past, when it was written around 1815. It was interesting to read how everyone called the other Mr., Miss, or Mrs. It was a little confusing because of this, because, for example, there is a Miss Bates and a Mrs. Bates, and sometimes it's hard to remember which is which!The story is a good one, a great novel that pulls you in, but with lengthy descriptions, and once in awhile it drags. Throughout the story, my 21st century \\"hurry up\\" mode would prefer it to move along more quickly.The storyline, similarly, is also a bit slow at times, but it's a wonderful romantic novel with a human character like Emma. She has flaws, but is enchanting, as are the rest of the characters in the book. it's also very humorous and has a great ironic twist.
